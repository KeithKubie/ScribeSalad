with most of what is in Android jetpack
already what we're doing is adding to it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300
already what we're doing is adding to it
 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.580
already what we're doing is adding to it
over time with stuff that's going to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590
over time with stuff that's going to
 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.110
over time with stuff that's going to
make it even better and we're also

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
make it even better and we're also
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.090
make it even better and we're also
improving it over time one of the major

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100
improving it over time one of the major
 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.130
improving it over time one of the major
steps that we're taking is what I like

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
steps that we're taking is what I like
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.130
steps that we're taking is what I like
to think of as a refactor because it's a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
to think of as a refactor because it's a
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.440
to think of as a refactor because it's a
refactor my favorite thing about the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
refactor my favorite thing about the
 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.360
refactor my favorite thing about the
support library is how the package names

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370
support library is how the package names
 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.720
support library is how the package names
embed the release number in them so for

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730
embed the release number in them so for
 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.110
embed the release number in them so for
example we support things like v4

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
example we support things like v4
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.780
example we support things like v4
actually we don't support v4 anymore we

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
actually we don't support v4 anymore we
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.690
actually we don't support v4 anymore we
have a min SDK of at least 14 now but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
have a min SDK of at least 14 now but
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.400
have a min SDK of at least 14 now but
it's in the package name isn't that a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
it's in the package name isn't that a
 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.870
it's in the package name isn't that a
little bit silly so we're doing away

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
little bit silly so we're doing away
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.100
little bit silly so we're doing away
with that we're doing a whole lot of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
with that we're doing a whole lot of
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.660
with that we're doing a whole lot of
tedious renaming and we're also

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
tedious renaming and we're also
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.400
tedious renaming and we're also
providing tools to make it easier for

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410
providing tools to make it easier for
 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.860
providing tools to make it easier for
you to do the similar refactoring you're

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
you to do the similar refactoring you're
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.970
you to do the similar refactoring you're
going to need to do in your application

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.230
Thursday morning to learn more the
details there so one of the things that

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240
details there so one of the things that
 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.579
details there so one of the things that
we've been focusing on with Android

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:42.589
we've been focusing on with Android
 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.529
we've been focusing on with Android
piece privacy maybe that's what it

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539
piece privacy maybe that's what it
 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.629
piece privacy maybe that's what it
stands for so one of the things we've

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639
stands for so one of the things we've
 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.100
stands for so one of the things we've
done is that when your app is in the

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110
done is that when your app is in the
 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.749
done is that when your app is in the
background it doesn't have access to the

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759
background it doesn't have access to the
 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.279
background it doesn't have access to the
microphone anymore it doesn't have

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289
microphone anymore it doesn't have
 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:52.540
microphone anymore it doesn't have
access to the camera anymore

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550
access to the camera anymore
 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.700
access to the camera anymore
and it doesn't have access to the sensor

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710
and it doesn't have access to the sensor
 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.040
and it doesn't have access to the sensor
kind of so you won't be you won't

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050
kind of so you won't be you won't
 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.390
kind of so you won't be you won't
receive the data from the sensors

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400
receive the data from the sensors
 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.279
receive the data from the sensors
automatically you can manually pull from

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289
automatically you can manually pull from
 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.480
automatically you can manually pull from
the sensors and you'll get to batch

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490
the sensors and you'll get to batch
 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.579
the sensors and you'll get to batch
update but the best thing that you

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:03.589
update but the best thing that you
 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.260
update but the best thing that you
should to do if you want to get access

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270
should to do if you want to get access
 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.700
should to do if you want to get access
to the sensor data is to keep a

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710
to the sensor data is to keep a
 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.559
to the sensor data is to keep a
foreground service running instead

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569
foreground service running instead
 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.540
foreground service running instead
so no more microphone no more camera for

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550
so no more microphone no more camera for
 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.429

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:33.980
wouldn't be nice then it is possible to
 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.370
wouldn't be nice then it is possible to
do that in easier ways now in mockito we

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
do that in easier ways now in mockito we
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.750
do that in easier ways now in mockito we
are not changing the framework but we're

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760
are not changing the framework but we're
 

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.130
are not changing the framework but we're
actually integrating changes into

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.140
actually integrating changes into
 

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.230
actually integrating changes into
mockito itself so you can now

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240
mockito itself so you can now
 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.300
mockito itself so you can now
mock final methods and soon you should

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.310
mock final methods and soon you should
 

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:51.090
mock final methods and soon you should
be able to mark static methods

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.100
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.190
and check is making that face because it

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200
and check is making that face because it
 

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.769
and check is making that face because it
doesn't understand why that's that is so

00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:55.779
doesn't understand why that's that is so
 

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:00.060
doesn't understand why that's that is so
interesting to you and system created

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.070

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.340
objects like activity eventually working
on that internally but it should be on

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.350
on that internally but it should be on

measurement this is part of a bunch of

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:08.740
measurement this is part of a bunch of
 

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.319
measurement this is part of a bunch of
smaller changes that we made in the text

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:10.329
smaller changes that we made in the text
 

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:12.269
smaller changes that we made in the text
area it turns out that measurement is

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279
area it turns out that measurement is
 

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.490
area it turns out that measurement is
really expensive so most applications do

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:14.500
really expensive so most applications do
 

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.380
really expensive so most applications do

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.390
text and that we'd bet that the text
 

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.449

operations in your application are some

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:18.459
operations in your application are some
 

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.040
operations in your application are some
of the most expensive going on in the UI

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.050
of the most expensive going on in the UI
 

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.630

wouldn't it be nicer if you could

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.410
wouldn't it be nicer if you could
 

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.620
wouldn't it be nicer if you could
offload that to a background thread so

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.630
offload that to a background thread so
 

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.150
offload that to a background thread so
that by the time you actually need to

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160
that by the time you actually need to
 

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.980
that by the time you actually need to
render the text or perform those

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:28.990
render the text or perform those
 

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.259
render the text or perform those
operations on the UI thread most of the

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:31.269
operations on the UI thread most of the
 

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:33.150
operations on the UI thread most of the
hard work was done for you so the

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160
hard work was done for you so the
 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.370
hard work was done for you so the
observation is that 80 to 90 percent of

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:35.380
observation is that 80 to 90 percent of
 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.590
observation is that 80 to 90 percent of
the operations that are necessary for

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600
the operations that are necessary for
 

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.410
the operations that are necessary for
actually displaying text happen in text

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:40.420
actually displaying text happen in text
 

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.670
actually displaying text happen in text
measurement well we've made it possible

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680
measurement well we've made it possible
 

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.579
measurement well we've made it possible
much easier to actually perform this as

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:44.589
much easier to actually perform this as
 

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.710
much easier to actually perform this as
a background operation so we have a

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720
a background operation so we have a
 

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.050
a background operation so we have a
class called pre computed text and you

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.060
class called pre computed text and you
 

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.730
class called pre computed text and you
can query that and you can say I want

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:50.740
can query that and you can say I want
 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.590
can query that and you can say I want
you to pre measure this and then you can

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600
you to pre measure this and then you can
 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.110
you to pre measure this and then you can
set that text that's spannabis x field

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120
set that text that's spannabis x field
 

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.090
set that text that's spannabis x field
later whenever you want so you do it in

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.100
later whenever you want so you do it in
 

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.639
later whenever you want so you do it in
a background threads like this you say

00:10:59.639 --> 00:10:59.649
a background threads like this you say
 

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.319
a background threads like this you say
create this thing and then you can set

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:01.329
create this thing and then you can set
 

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:02.639
create this thing and then you can set
that on the textview later when you

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:02.649
that on the textview later when you
 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:04.730
that on the textview later when you
actually need it should be much faster

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740
actually need it should be much faster
 

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.870
actually need it should be much faster
magnifier is something that if you're

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880
magnifier is something that if you're
 

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.569
magnifier is something that if you're
using the preview releases you might see

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:09.579
using the preview releases you might see
 

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:11.699
using the preview releases you might see
if you select some text it pops up this

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:11.709
if you select some text it pops up this
 

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:14.460
if you select some text it pops up this
little bar up above it makes it easier

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.470
little bar up above it makes it easier
 

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.350
little bar up above it makes it easier
to manipulate the cursor that's really

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360
to manipulate the cursor that's really
 

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.030
to manipulate the cursor that's really
great for text but the other cool thing

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040
great for text but the other cool thing
 

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.040
great for text but the other cool thing
about it is that it's also available for

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
about it is that it's also available for
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.990
about it is that it's also available for
your applications for any other use case

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000
your applications for any other use case
 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.389
your applications for any other use case
so there's an api that allows you to pop

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399
so there's an api that allows you to pop
 

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.850
so there's an api that allows you to pop
up this magnifier for whatever happens

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860
up this magnifier for whatever happens
 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.860
up this magnifier for whatever happens
to be in your view so you can show this

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:28.870
to be in your view so you can show this
 

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.780
to be in your view so you can show this
and dismiss it and use it for your stuff

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:30.790
and dismiss it and use it for your stuff
 

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.150
and dismiss it and use it for your stuff
as well so core functionality that we

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160
as well so core functionality that we
 

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.040
as well so core functionality that we
want in the system user interface but

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.050
want in the system user interface but
 

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.260
want in the system user interface but
also useful API is for developers to use

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.270
also useful API is for developers to use

also useful API is for developers to use
for their own purposes I don't know if

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:39.730
for their own purposes I don't know if
 

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.860
for their own purposes I don't know if
you've worked with your design

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:40.870
you've worked with your design
 

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.180
you've worked with your design
department and they've specified

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.190
department and they've specified
 

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.759
department and they've specified
something about text in your UI and okay

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:44.769
something about text in your UI and okay
 

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:46.650
something about text in your UI and okay
well I want this aligns you know this

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660
well I want this aligns you know this
 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.300
well I want this aligns you know this
many dips away from the top and then I

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.310
many dips away from the top and then I
 

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.680
many dips away from the top and then I
want the baseline on the bottom this

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:49.690
want the baseline on the bottom this
 

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.509
want the baseline on the bottom this
many dips away from the bottom and then

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519
many dips away from the bottom and then
 

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.430
many dips away from the bottom and then
you have this interspersed vertical

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440
you have this interspersed vertical
 

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.500
you have this interspersed vertical
alignment stuff going on and then you

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.510
alignment stuff going on and then you
 

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.180
alignment stuff going on and then you
sort of puzzle with this for a while and

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.190
sort of puzzle with this for a while and
 

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.480
sort of puzzle with this for a while and
you basically futz

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:58.490
you basically futz
 

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.040
you basically futz
patting in all kinds of different

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.050

where they wanted to get it we have

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.070
where they wanted to get it we have
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.710
where they wanted to get it we have
worked with that and created some new

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720
worked with that and created some new
 

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.150
worked with that and created some new
attributes and methods and properties

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160
attributes and methods and properties
 

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.130
attributes and methods and properties
for you to use that make that much

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.140
for you to use that make that much
 

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.980
for you to use that make that much
easier so we allow you to just pass us

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:11.990
easier so we allow you to just pass us
 

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.840
easier so we allow you to just pass us
the information about the baseline

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:13.850
the information about the baseline
 

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.940

alignment calculations that you would

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:15.950
alignment calculations that you would
 

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.740
alignment calculations that you would
like to perform and then we'll futz with

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:17.750
like to perform and then we'll futz with
 

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.500
like to perform and then we'll futz with
padding on your behalf

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.510

SmartLink if I I think of this as being
 

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.350
SmartLink if I I think of this as being
Lincoln Phi but smarter so we already

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360
Lincoln Phi but smarter so we already
 

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.930
Lincoln Phi but smarter so we already
have the ability to ask for links in a

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:28.940
have the ability to ask for links in a
 

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.550
have the ability to ask for links in a
block of text and it'll detect things

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560
block of text and it'll detect things
 

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.949
block of text and it'll detect things
like phone numbers and addresses but we

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959
like phone numbers and addresses but we
 

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:34.570
like phone numbers and addresses but we
also have the ability through machine

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:34.580
also have the ability through machine
 

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.250
also have the ability through machine
learning models and stuff that you've

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:36.260
learning models and stuff that you've
 

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.320
learning models and stuff that you've
seen through smart text selection to

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.330
seen through smart text selection to
 

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.900
seen through smart text selection to
detect other entities we can do the same

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:40.910
detect other entities we can do the same
 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.970
detect other entities we can do the same
thing with link of Phi it takes a little

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:42.980
thing with link of Phi it takes a little
 

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.980
thing with link of Phi it takes a little
bit potentially longer so you do this

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:44.990
bit potentially longer so you do this
 

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.540
bit potentially longer so you do this
off thread so you would basically

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:46.550
off thread so you would basically

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.050
I'm going to talk to you about some of
 

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.480
I'm going to talk to you about some of
the stuff that as developers you might

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:08.490
the stuff that as developers you might
 

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.009
the stuff that as developers you might
be interested in the first one is

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019
be interested in the first one is
 

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:12.769
be interested in the first one is
display cutouts aka well there are other

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779
display cutouts aka well there are other
 

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:15.860
display cutouts aka well there are other
names for it these are coming to the

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:15.870
names for it these are coming to the
 

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.960
names for it these are coming to the
ecosystem all over the place and so as a

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:17.970
ecosystem all over the place and so as a
 

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.400
ecosystem all over the place and so as a
developer you need to know where it's

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.410
developer you need to know where it's
 

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.379
developer you need to know where it's
safe to draw and where it isn't when you

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:21.389
safe to draw and where it isn't when you
 

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:22.940
safe to draw and where it isn't when you
get your window in sets on

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:22.950
get your window in sets on
 

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.460
get your window in sets on
you window inset something or there you

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.470
you window inset something or there you
 

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.830
you window inset something or there you
get a display cutout object which gives

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:27.840
get a display cutout object which gives
 

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.570
get a display cutout object which gives
you all kinds of interesting data about

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:29.580
you all kinds of interesting data about
 

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.650
you all kinds of interesting data about
the cutout but you're probably going to

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660
the cutout but you're probably going to
 

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.300
the cutout but you're probably going to
want to use something called window

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.310
want to use something called window
 

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.290
want to use something called window
layout in display cutout mode on your

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300
layout in display cutout mode on your
 

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.810
layout in display cutout mode on your
windows so there's a the basic way which

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820
windows so there's a the basic way which
 

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.610
windows so there's a the basic way which
is I I never want to overlap the cutout

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620
is I I never want to overlap the cutout
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.080
is I I never want to overlap the cutout
just leave a black bar at the top or the

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.090
just leave a black bar at the top or the
 

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.640
just leave a black bar at the top or the
bottom whatever I'm not all that

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:43.650

interested a little more advanced would

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620
interested a little more advanced would
 

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.890
interested a little more advanced would
be display cutout mode default which is

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:48.900
be display cutout mode default which is
 

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.840

if you were already going to clear the

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:50.850
if you were already going to clear the
 

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.000
if you were already going to clear the
status bar just fine we'll let the app

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.010
status bar just fine we'll let the app
 

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.190

window draw underneath the cutout is

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:55.200
window draw underneath the cutout is
 

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.410
window draw underneath the cutout is
well so you'll get the nice action bar

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420
well so you'll get the nice action bar
 

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.450
well so you'll get the nice action bar
color extending through the status bar

00:16:59.450 --> 00:16:59.460
color extending through the status bar
 

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.480
color extending through the status bar
and extending underneath that cutout

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:01.490
and extending underneath that cutout
 

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.760
and extending underneath that cutout
better still or more advanced still is

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:04.770
better still or more advanced still is
 

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.189
better still or more advanced still is
short edges cutout mode which means

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199
short edges cutout mode which means
 

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.280
short edges cutout mode which means
essentially anytime there's a cut out on

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.290
essentially anytime there's a cut out on
 

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.720
essentially anytime there's a cut out on
the short edges of the device and we're

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.730
the short edges of the device and we're
 

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.699
the short edges of the device and we're
in portrait I will just draw underneath

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:13.709
in portrait I will just draw underneath
 

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:16.040
in portrait I will just draw underneath
you don't have to do anything special

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:16.050
you don't have to do anything special
 

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.780
you don't have to do anything special
and in that situation you do need to

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:17.790
and in that situation you do need to
 

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.250
and in that situation you do need to
look at the display cutout and ask it

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260
look at the display cutout and ask it
 

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.560
look at the display cutout and ask it
for the safe in sets essentially well

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.570
for the safe in sets essentially well
 

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.600
for the safe in sets essentially well
okay I'm drawing everywhere but you tell

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:23.610
okay I'm drawing everywhere but you tell
 

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.189
okay I'm drawing everywhere but you tell
me what rectangle what single rectangle

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199
me what rectangle what single rectangle
 

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.620
me what rectangle what single rectangle
of the screen is safest to draw in and

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:27.630
of the screen is safest to draw in and
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.540
of the screen is safest to draw in and
then finally the cosmic version of this

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:29.550
then finally the cosmic version of this
 

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.250
then finally the cosmic version of this
you can do short edges but you can

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
you can do short edges but you can
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.990
you can do short edges but you can
actually get the bounds of the cutout as

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000
actually get the bounds of the cutout as
 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.050
actually get the bounds of the cutout as
a region so you will get the exact set

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.060
a region so you will get the exact set
 

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.090
a region so you will get the exact set
of rectangles that are unavailable to

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100
of rectangles that are unavailable to
 

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.830
of rectangles that are unavailable to
you on the screen so you can display UI

in the corners if the corners are

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580
in the corners if the corners are
 

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.040
in the corners if the corners are
available or if there's a corner cut out

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.050
available or if there's a corner cut out
 

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.960

you can move things out of the way so

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:44.970
you can move things out of the way so
 

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.580
you can move things out of the way so
that it's visible in the center of the

display this is the most advanced
version of it and you can put the

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:50.490
version of it and you can put the
 

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.590
version of it and you can put the
electrical tape away because you can

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600

applications to target some of the
 

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.400
applications to target some of the
newest API levels and we're doing that

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.410
newest API levels and we're doing that
 

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.620
newest API levels and we're doing that
to make sure that we can keep the

be able to ship 32-bit support in your
 

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.820
be able to ship 32-bit support in your
application but we will ask you to ship

so from now on a lot of the CPS will

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:03.580
so from now on a lot of the CPS will
 

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.820
so from now on a lot of the CPS will
trigger warnings in one form or another

if an API falls in the blacklist you

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200
if an API falls in the blacklist you
 

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.860
if an API falls in the blacklist you
will not be able to call it ever I'm not

it's part of Android P the idea is to

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:25.510
it's part of Android P the idea is to
 

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.290
it's part of Android P the idea is to
make it only easier to decode images but

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:28.300
make it only easier to decode images but
 

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.420
make it only easier to decode images but
also to make it possible to decode

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:30.430
also to make it possible to decode
 

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.250
also to make it possible to decode
animated images so image decoder can

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.260
animated images so image decoder can
 

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.530
animated images so image decoder can
decode bitmaps which also drawables

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:34.540
decode bitmaps which also drawables
 

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.770
decode bitmaps which also drawables
including animated image drawables you

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:37.780
including animated image drawables you
 

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.480
including animated image drawables you

how kids are using them possible I

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:41.950
how kids are using them possible I
 

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.650
how kids are using them possible I
actually love those now so there are few

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:43.660
actually love those now so there are few
 

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.060
actually love those now so there are few
concepts that you have to learn when you

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.070
concepts that you have to learn when you
 

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.350
concepts that you have to learn when you
when you learn image the Curan we're

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360
when you learn image the Curan we're
 

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.400
when you learn image the Curan we're
going to go through them in an example

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.410
going to go through them in an example
 

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.900
going to go through them in an example
so we have the concept of a source we

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:48.910
so we have the concept of a source we
 

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.370
so we have the concept of a source we
have the concept of the post processor

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:50.380
have the concept of the post processor
 

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.350
have the concept of the post processor
and finally the header listener so this

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360
and finally the header listener so this
 

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.690
and finally the header listener so this
is what the API looks like first you

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:54.700
is what the API looks like first you
 

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.920
is what the API looks like first you
have to call create source on the image

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:55.930
have to call create source on the image
 

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.050
have to call create source on the image
decoder the source can be an ascetic and

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.060
decoder the source can be an ascetic and
 

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.370

different thing and the goal here is

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.030
different thing and the goal here is
 

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.730
different thing and the goal here is
that once you create a source you can

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:02.740
that once you create a source you can
 

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.010
that once you create a source you can
decode multiple images from the same

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:05.020
decode multiple images from the same
 

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.960
decode multiple images from the same
source this is particularly useful if

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:06.970
source this is particularly useful if
 

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.550
source this is particularly useful if
you want to build thumbnails you can

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:08.560
you want to build thumbnails you can
 

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.710
you want to build thumbnails you can
decode the same source once at high

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720
decode the same source once at high
 

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.720
decode the same source once at high
resolution once at lower resolution or

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:12.730
resolution once at lower resolution or
 

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.180
resolution once at lower resolution or
even intermediate resolutions and that

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.190
even intermediate resolutions and that
 

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.740
even intermediate resolutions and that
can be done from multiple worker threads

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:16.750
can be done from multiple worker threads
 

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.870
can be done from multiple worker threads
then you can called iko iko decode

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880
then you can called iko iko decode
 

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.950
then you can called iko iko decode
bitmap you pass the source and you can

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960
bitmap you pass the source and you can
 

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.450
bitmap you pass the source and you can
should we pass ahead or listener so

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:22.460
should we pass ahead or listener so
 

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.160
should we pass ahead or listener so
their head early center here we have a

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.170
their head early center here we have a
 

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.990
their head early center here we have a
lambda it gives you back the decoder

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000
lambda it gives you back the decoder
 

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.450
lambda it gives you back the decoder
itself the metadata about the source

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:28.460
itself the metadata about the source
 

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.000
itself the metadata about the source
about the image and the source and it's

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.010
about the image and the source and it's
 

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.470
about the image and the source and it's
inside the header or listener that you

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480
inside the header or listener that you
 

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.180
inside the header or listener that you
can set the option so in bitmap factor

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:34.190
can set the option so in bitmap factor
 

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.830
can set the option so in bitmap factor
you had bitmap factory that options that

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840
you had bitmap factory that options that
 

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.630
you had bitmap factory that options that
you had to pass to decode here you have

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640
you had to pass to decode here you have
 

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.070
you had to pass to decode here you have
to wait for the header listener to be

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080
to wait for the header listener to be
 

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.530
to wait for the header listener to be
invoked upon since we should point out

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:41.540
invoked upon since we should point out
 

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.390
invoked upon since we should point out
to like that set target size that's kind

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:43.400
to like that set target size that's kind
 

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.830
to like that set target size that's kind
of a fundamental difference where the

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840
of a fundamental difference where the
 

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.450
of a fundamental difference where the
old bitmap it's up there first and then

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:46.460
old bitmap it's up there first and then
 

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.160
old bitmap it's up there first and then
oh I see that right there that's that's

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.170
oh I see that right there that's that's
 

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.900
oh I see that right there that's that's
a huge difference like before if you

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:52.910
a huge difference like before if you
 

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.580
a huge difference like before if you
wanted the right target size you needed

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:54.590
wanted the right target size you needed
 

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.860
wanted the right target size you needed
to work with what in density as well as

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:56.870
to work with what in density as well as
 

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.770
to work with what in density as well as
in sample size in density and do a lot

00:27:59.770 --> 00:27:59.780
in sample size in density and do a lot
 

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.240
in sample size in density and do a lot
of trickery we didn't know how they

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.250
of trickery we didn't know how they
 

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.700
of trickery we didn't know how they
worked either yeah so a lot easier now

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:03.710
worked either yeah so a lot easier now
 

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.890
worked either yeah so a lot easier now
yeah usually our answer was figure it

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:05.900
yeah usually our answer was figure it
 

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.190
yeah usually our answer was figure it
out anyway so now you can just tell us

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200
out anyway so now you can just tell us
 

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.990
out anyway so now you can just tell us
what size you want the bitmap to be in

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000
what size you want the bitmap to be in
 

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.960
what size you want the bitmap to be in
and what take care of it finally and you

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:13.970
and what take care of it finally and you
 

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.580
and what take care of it finally and you
can also set the post processor so post

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:15.590
can also set the post processor so post
 

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.320
can also set the post processor so post
processor is a same thing as simple

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:17.330
processor is a same thing as simple
 

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.640
processor is a same thing as simple
interface it gives you a canvas so you

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:18.650
interface it gives you a canvas so you
 

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.110
interface it gives you a canvas so you
can draw on the bitmap right after it's

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120
can draw on the bitmap right after it's
 

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.390
can draw on the bitmap right after it's
decoded so you can you know I don't know

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:22.400
decoded so you can you know I don't know
 

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.970
decoded so you can you know I don't know
a header like the title or submitted

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:24.980
a header like the title or submitted
 

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.660
a header like the title or submitted
data on it

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:25.670
data on it
 

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.510
data on it
media we are adding a support in the

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.520
media we are adding a support in the
 

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.390
media we are adding a support in the
platform for the HD a profile of vp9 so

you can play HD of videos in your
 

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.750
you can play HD of videos in your
