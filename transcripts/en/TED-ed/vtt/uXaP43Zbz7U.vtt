00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:11.416
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:16.207
who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses.

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:19.186
That earned him the name
the Teflon Don

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.576
after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth.

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:26.807
Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing,

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:29.668
in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project,

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:35.227
and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets.

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:39.778
So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it?

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:43.159
Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene,

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.539
or PTFE.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.021
It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:52.870
named Roy Plunkett

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.160
while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.081
a chemicals company.

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.360
The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.091
was chemically inert,

00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:07.169
meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances.

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:10.390
It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.620
making other materials slide right off it.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.611
Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery,

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:18.772
chemical resistant,

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:20.250
or waterproof,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.771
which means it has a lot of applications.

00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.801
It can be found all over the place,

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.622
as a coating on raincoats,

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.272
industrial ball bearings,

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:29.480
artificial joints,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.584
circuit boards,

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:35.151
and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport.

00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:40.101
The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure.

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.352
It's a polymer,

00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:45.921
meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together.

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:49.756
A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms,

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:52.562
each of which is attached 
to two fluorines.

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:55.543
The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor,

00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:57.282
spiraling around the chain,

00:01:57.282 --> 00:02:00.622
and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight.

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:03.611
Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other,

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:06.281
carbon and fluorine interact so strongly

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:10.940
that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.812
don't stand a chance.

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:16.892
Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip.

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:18.022
But wait!

00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:20.541
If PTFE doesn't stick to anything,

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:24.406
how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan?

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:27.281
One method involves sandblasting the pan

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.696
or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:34.502
Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue.

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:39.301
Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.022
The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:45.541
and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.492
The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating.

00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:52.662
When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan,

00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:55.112
the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.952
just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs.

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:00.592
Without those interactions,

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:03.802
the food just slides around 
without sticking.

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:07.598
You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan.

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:10.452
The answer is yes, if you're careful.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:16.211
PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish,

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:19.871
but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade,

00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.852
and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick.

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:27.502
An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat,

00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:31.754
but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes.

00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:35.212
People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE

00:03:35.212 --> 00:03:38.782
that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you,

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:41.851
but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless.

00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:45.002
Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well,

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:48.158
it isn't thought to break down
inside your body.

00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:51.612
Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story.

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:54.140
DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.282
now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars.

00:03:57.282 --> 00:04:00.072
They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.472
and exposing employees 
and local communities

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:07.932
to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA.

00:04:07.932 --> 00:04:11.552
That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon.

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:12.894
As for John Gotti,

00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:17.582
in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder,

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:19.292
among other charges.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:22.761
That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce,

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.981
"The Teflon is gone.

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.473
The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."
