Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       the chicken in on you. I'm just checking in on you. So you know your week's going. How are you holding up, how you're handling today's top stories in the news? Um, I haven't seen much about it, but I guess Nike, uh, got on board with the colon. [inaudible] Colin Kaepernick, right? Say, hey, sometimes you gotta do this to get debt, right? And then everybody, you know, you know the deal, you know, people are, it's like, Hey, my point is about police brutality and ever since nine 11 a bit. Yes sir. Sir. We're not talking about that. No one is saying that your brother is not over in Iraq. He's talking about police brutality. What,

Speaker 3:          00:01:01       where the fuck out of the country.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       And that right there is political discourse in 2018, you know, not saying people listen back in the day, but at least they, they, they did a better job pretending. You know what? Where does Nike get off acting like they give a fuck about people. You know, if they really, you gave a shit about people when they, uh, have allowed that documentary exposing their fucking sweatshops to air at some point. Oh, shots fired and bill, if, uh, if you gave a shit, wouldn't you not be wearing a Nike shirt right now? Hey, fair enough. We're all full of shit. Um, Jesus Christ. If I see one more fucking moron.

Speaker 4:          00:01:47       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       yeah. No screaming about troops or nine 11 on a subject that has nothing to do with it. Jesus fucking Christ. It's a protest about police brutality. He is allowed to do this. The long allowed to misconstrue. It's construe what he's saying, Dan. You know, but that's what it is. I think that's what happened with the Internet is now everything. Even when it isn't about you, it has to be about you.

Speaker 4:          00:02:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       You know, all of these fucking people, you know what I mean? It's, it's, it just, it just be all of this shit, this fucking shit you see on Instagram with a person's acting like they're trying to inspire you. When they're really just trying to show you all the cars they have outside of their fucking a giant house with their abs. You know the fuck was I joking about that with, I did the Bill Simmons podcast that was joking about that. You know, all these fucking celebrities always telling you how hard they're working. Yo, we out here grinding. It's like everybody. Everybody is. A lot of people weren't blessed. Most people were not blessed with your gifts. They're grinding does not fill an arena, you know, but there are really good fucking carpenter, but no one's going to sit there and watch him frame of fuck. While I guess you wouldn't frame a house as a carpenter. I finished copper numbers. I'm thinking, what are you saying, bill? That regular carpenters aren't as good as finished carpenters? Well, I mean, yeah, you can hide a lot of your mistakes in the walls.

Speaker 5:          00:03:26       Hey, my brother was a carpenter.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       Um, he built a shack and I wreck, that's not what I was talking about. Ah, I felt like yelling.

Speaker 4:          00:03:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Anyways, I saw a little bit of it. I saw somebody retweets something and it was something about Fox News, of course, trash and Kaepernick of course saying he's not American. Uh, and of course saying probably that, you know, he doesn't support the troops because he's talking about police brutality.

Speaker 4:          00:04:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Oh, the weather outside is frightful. Um, so there you go. But um, by all means, you know, people, uh, you know, don't burn your own property. You know, even if you don't like Nike's, you could give it to a homeless guy. And also when you burn that stuff, you're just really polluting your own environment. Yeah. With all that rubber and God knows what else is on the fucking sneaker, what do you have to burn it? Why can't you just throw them out or set them aside? They always got to burn it. I remember when Lane Kiffin lift left fucking Tennessee in this guy. Somehow it's some lane Kiffin Jersey and he like lit it on fire, filmed it, and then pissed on it.

Speaker 5:          00:04:56       Okay. You run up and leave and Tanner steep or book in USC.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       Uh, what do you think about an American Corporation? Poisoning our own food supply. What are you going to let you cornflakes on fire and then pee on him?

Speaker 5:          00:05:17       What are you and asked us, what the fuck you talking about? You Bald headed freckled mother fucking Yankee cut. Would the fuck you do now on here?

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       No southern guy ever said can't do. They can if current and that's how they'd say it. Good. Um, [inaudible] why am I acting like it's everybody down the south burning their Nike's?

Speaker 4:          00:05:42       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       I don't know why. There's not more people saying like this was about police brutality.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       You may or may not agree with it, but to then try to make it about something else, which then leads you to burn your own sneakers is probably not the direction you want to go in. However, that's not what you know. But the thing is is if somebody is burning their own sneakers and then you show it on TV, like all of those channels you have flipping through, right? There's, there's the fucking the lawyer chick, right? You flip the channel. There's the, there's the Jack Ryan Guy. You flip the channel is to Psi Phi. You flip the channel. There's a commercial you flip the channel is a saga gave you flip the channel. Somebody sneakers are on fire, you're going, what the fuck is that with somebody in those, when those caught on fire, my God, what? What? How do those sneakers catch on fight fire and, but yet, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       I think we cracked the code here. People for anyone in Hollywood listening to this, if you want to hit series, you need fire. That'll make people stop. But it's got to look real. So in other words, you know, like when you shoot without a permit, you got to like light something on fire without permission and then it'll look real because it is real. And if you can somehow capture the people running out of whatever the fuck you lit on fire, then I think you could actually get people to stop long enough and possibly sit through some commercials that they would allow your show to air for the following week. So see, I guess there is a silver lining for the life of me. I will never fucking understand people that take it to that fucking level. I get the UK, you're not agreeing. Well, let's say you know it's about police brutality, but you're like, that's not the way to go about protesting. Fine. I get that. Fair enough. Good point to you sir or Madam. But when like you take it to the point that like,

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       you're going to burn your shit and then film it and then uploaded onto the internet and no point during any of that fucking process. You like those sneakers when it was just crying, children's sewing them together, didn't you? You don't like how fucked up. I mean, I mean, how far back are we going to take this? You know, if you really care.

Speaker 4:          00:08:08       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       Dan, you wouldn't buy those things in the first place. You'd be going down to the fucking a sneaker factory and given that little kid a break and you'd sit down on the stool and you'd fucking glue your shit together yourself, wouldn't you, wouldn't you? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       I dunno. All I know is I'm sitting here right now and I don't have the Internet. I'm a 50 year old man. I don't have the Internet. I don't know when. I'm going to be able to upload this. Uh, I once again upgraded my sister, you know, my uh, buddy of mine was just telling me, Greg Fitzsimmons just at his podcast. I don't know when that's going to air. Gee Cibele why are you doing all these podcasts? Well, cause I got some big tour dates coming up in f is for family season three is right around the corner. The the fuckers done, man. We're getting ready to start promoting.

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:09:02       Well you bet. Promote [inaudible] brought her over now ran. Don't burn my sneakers.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       I will burn my fucking sneakers. Hey Nike, I'll be watching.

Speaker 5:          00:09:16       Oh, burning my fucking sneakers. Don't make me burn my pole over cause I'll fucking do it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:23       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       just do it. Yeah, I'll fucking do it. I'll come over there like your whole fucking factory on fire. How dare you kneel during the national anthem.

Speaker 4:          00:09:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Do you have any idea how disrespectful kneeling is?

Speaker 4:          00:09:44       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:44       Whenever I go to church and pat, she says everybody take their knees. It's like, I will not disrespect God, but getting on my fucking knees.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Everybody knows. If you believe in Jesus, you stand up, you go eyeball to eyeball with that hip is some bitch and you see how you measure up. You look at him in the eye.

Speaker 4:          00:10:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       maybe you're a little taller looking down on them being like, Hey Jay,

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       fuck was up with that hooker man. Or maybe you you, you want them a little fellows but with a big heart. Just keep coming, knock them down. Keep coming like a fucking wolverine. Fucking Michigan Wolverines is sponsored by Nike. I'm going to go in there and I'm going to burn all of them. Tight little yellow pants. They run around it. Ones that hug their buttocks is in such a way, I'm sorry people, I don't have the Internet right now so I, I can't look up anything about sports, so you're just going to have to suffer through another fucking 20 minutes of this.

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       I'm contractually obligated to continue running my fucking mouth for another 19 minutes. The contract. I signed with myself kind of like with Motley Crue signed that contract that they were never going to tour again because if they did then I guess they're going to sue themselves. That's how that works.

Speaker 4:          00:11:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       I'm sitting here right now. I am staring at a VCR DVD player

Speaker 4:          00:11:22       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       I'm trying to find, you know, I don't have the Internet. I'm trying to find a fucking radio shack or something. Oh Jesus. What did I just do? I can't hear myself. I can't hear myself. There we go. Now I can hear myself. You know, I just literally just fucking bought this shit and now it doesn't work. I, you know what, I'm going to bomb in a blame Colin Kaepernick. Uh, anyways, the fuck if somebody texted me here, allow me Andrew through this Goddamn podcast. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:11:58       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       there's best buy. Still sell the shit you need for that. Does anybody know that's one of those things, man, when you hang onto the old technology, cause I got all my old standup tapes over here on VHS. I converted most of them. And then there's other ones and it's just like, I don't know what the fuck's only shit before I go send it over there.

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       trying to think, did I ever make a porno? You gotta ask yourself before you send your VHS tick, you ever hear VCR man, it's this new fangled fucking machine.

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Is it put out by Nacky cause I light it on fire. MMM. Some redneck is going to go to a Chinese restaurant and, and accidentally light one of the people that are on fire,

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       because he's going to give him a tip and he's going to be like, do you like, you know, you like, and she's going to be I likey and then he's going to think she said Nike and then let's see that. See how that happens. It's a slippery slope. Once you start, did you start lighting shit on fire man? Like you don't know where, where's it going to stop? I mean, maybe if you do it, you start to like it, right? And then the next time you wife's like, could you take the trash out and you're walking over their shoulders slump looking down at the linoleum defeated man. You get like a foot away from the trash and suddenly just remember how good it felt. Like your own sneakers on fire. All of a sudden you lift at fucking hit up proud first time in years and you knew like, you know what?

Speaker 4:          00:13:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       you want me to take this trash out? You fucking bitch. I'll take it out. I'm allotted on fire and I'm a film it and I'm going to put it on the Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:14:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       And then we'll see what damn sneakers sale and motherfuckers say ban.

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       16 minutes to go. Oh Jesus. Um, the red sox are playing 500 ball. When is Chris sale coming back? I have no, he's the guy. He is the guy that prevents us

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       from slice of fucking funny. Everybody I told, you know I told those fuckers at ESPN, they wouldn't listen to me. They don't, they, they are afraid to listen to this podcast when they said the fucking Yankees got swept. This fucking division series is ober. Yeah, he said that the first week of fucking August. And what did bill say? What did the balding freckled con to never played baseball belong beyond the, the minor or major leagues. Okay. Got kicked out of baseball because he got a d in math in 19 fucking 79 was the last time I played in an organized league and even I could see it even I was going, hey, wait a minute. ESPN.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       there's like 60 fucking games left and were up by nine and a half games. I don't know what kind of fucking uh, Muslim assets textbook you're looking at. The numbers don't add up. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       we'll probably going to win like 105 games. I even know where the fuck around right now. Last I saw he's like 91 or 92 probably go 500 for the rest of the fucking year. You know, it's, it's never fucking Yogi Berra said it's not over till it's over. And he said that before there was a wild card, a one game playoff, 19 fucking rounds of baseball. He said that back when all you had to do was win the fucking division and you won the pennant and then you had to win four more games. You won the world series. Even that fucking guy who essentially mocked mentally challenged people his entire life with is planned out. Goofy segs,

Speaker 4:          00:16:30       right?

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       Playing Glib the whole time, like a hot chick trying to get some free drinks. Never figured out what that guy's angle was. Even he said, it ain't over until it's over. Who said what first

Speaker 4:          00:16:49       fine

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       sounded like Abbott and Costello who said it ain't over till it's over first or like what came first that or it ain't over until the fat lady sings,

Speaker 4:          00:17:01       right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       Everybody knows if you want to hear somebody could sing, you got to get a fat woman, right? Fat Woman, fat woman listen to, we're saying, right. Isn't that that theme song? And they come walking out,

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       they always had some sort of flair on for a code or some sort of, uh, some sort of, I dunno what something but dazzle coming out day with, they have fat feet fucking just all squeezed into those little pumps. Hello. Shayle Kann. Who? E. Right? Singing the shit out of the national anthem. Why would they sing at the end of the game? You know why? I bet. Because they didn't have fucking jumbo trons back in the day. You don't see, everybody's just walking out and all you could hear was the sound of fucking people stepping on empty peanut shells. Just Racist Shit right there to stop people from being racist to each other to get them out of it. And that's just the white people you fucking day best. I mean, you a fucking Irish bastard. Fuck you're, you're fucking Daigo right back there. When like the Irish and the Italians, like white people were like racist against each other, Polish people, all of that shit. They needed to keep them calm when they walked out of the ballpark. So then they just had some fat lady come waddling out there. Everybody could laugh at her going, well, you know what? I might have fucking tuberculosis release. My feet aren't oozing out of my shoes. Then she'd get out there singing and our man, hey, how I lobby our, I'm five foot two are [inaudible] girl.

Speaker 4:          00:18:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       Everybody just put on their fucking derbies and they walked up.

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       take me out to the ball game. Take me back to my neighborhood where everybody looks like me and we fucking cabbage for three cars where I rich people in the Irish section of they'll fucking town. Keep your pasty freckled fucking ass in your own neighborhood. Right. So weird how they glorify that, that error in sports. A simpler time. The good old days or baseball. They tell it two different ways. They're either, you have like that, that version we're Billy crystal talks about going to the Yankees game and seeing Mickey Mantle or they do the real shit, the Jackie Robinson story that it's just like, oh, okay. And all in that see exact same fucking footage. Other than that black cat being thrown on the field. Other than that, it's all the exact same footage and how you're viewing it has less to do with what they're saying and more to do with the music that they play underneath it. 11 minutes to go. I don't have my rewrite now. I'd be reading my fucking advertising and I could get through this part, but I don't fucking have it. By the way. Butcher box. You're welcome. I have blown up heritage bread. Pork.

Speaker 4:          00:20:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       I blown it up. I brought, I brought it back. It was so fucking far gone. People didn't even know it was missing. I had never heard, I been eating pork chops my entire fucking life. Bacon, Ham and cheese sandwiches got older. I moved to New York. I was introduced to a Cuban sandwich. Right. All of that fucking

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       what do they got their welcome whenever I think I got to go fucking cause you're dumb bill. Oh that's probably it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       Pork Butt, right? Pork shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       Is it really the acid of the pig and they just say pork shoulder cause they don't want you to be reminded, you know they do say rump roast, right? Hey all you guys out there burning your sneakers. You know, you know, you know you also have like an apocalypse like game plan. You know what I mean? You like Bill Walsh, she calling all the plays in the first half and I'm just fucking showing up and I'm not even gonna know what the fuck's gonna hit me. Right. I am an apocalypse plant to die within the first hour. Ah, Shit. That's that. I mean, that is the ultimate plan, you know, cause then I, then I get to be a ghost. Right. And I'm already as white as one. Right. That might be my, my disguise. The freckles would give me away.

Speaker 4:          00:21:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       No, you die within the first hour and then you just hang around. You want, you know, like, remember Patrick Swayze and uh, Moondance, whatever that fucking movie was called, our hair to Tam or a dad or not judged with this chick and her knows that she chose to change. You knew way. That was weird. Um, ghost Jesus Christ. I said I wanted to be a fucking ghost. Yeah, I remember that. When he would look up at the light. Evidently you have an option when you die. All right? If you go into hell, you don't have an option. You just get manhandled. Look like you grabbed some chicks ass at the club. These fucking Damon's just come up and they just grab you and then that's it. But if you lived a good life, if you took out their trash,

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       I guess you could look up at the light and God gives you the option and be like, hey man, you want to come behind the velvet rope? Or like, do you just want to fucking, you want to be a voyeur for awhile? I'm not judging, dude. This isn't going to go against your record. Okay, you done good. You did good enough to get up here. You know there's another train coming in in a couple of weeks. If you want to just fucking hang around, you mean you got to hang around, right? You've got to go Tom Sawyer and hang out at your own funeral. That'd be, that'd been no funerals at the fucking apocalypse. There'll be the old school once they fucking dig up fucking foot and a half foot and a half trench deep trench. You just hope they don't see anything sparkling in the dirt or they're just going to leave you out in the open and keep digging.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       Is that uranium, you know it's going to have an easy time during the apocalypse is going to be the hipsters cause they're already like, they already have the fucking grizzly Adams beard, so let's stay warm in the winter. They're already, you know, they know how to make like their own jam and fucking bear in the bathtub like all this old school stuff. Some of them know how to make their own clothes. Like I think hipsters are going to be, I think they're going to be all right and we're all going to be like, wow. You know what? I remember I wanted to fight that kid cause he told me that he's learning how to be a blacksmith, you know, and the other kid was building a steam ship and then all of a sudden the apocalypse is going to happen. You'd be like, you know something. Those are some skills I wish I had right now. Oh Jesus Christ. This is like the longest fucking podcast ever. Okay, five minutes to go. Jesus Christ, five minutes left. Um, I'm going to be in Sacramento this weekend. Everybody know north of Sacramento. I'm doing a casino up there with a rose bowl tailgate. Less legend. Jason Lawhead, master flat top grill, Shep master smoker math. You put them on a green egg. A fucking a standard fucking grill

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       demand is going to [inaudible] going to make something. He just makes, he makes everyone around him better with like, you know, it'd be like if you just add that player that causes everybody to elevate their game. The second we added Jason Law, head to the fucking tailgate, everybody had a few more beers, right? Everybody? Uh, I dunno. Eight a little bit more everybody. Everybody just took it a little bit more and we got an extra room for the first time ever. We made it to the playoffs of arguably the top whatever, 400 tailgates and our section though, there's some people that throw down, man, they bring like satellite dishes and shit and like TVs, you know. But I'm telling you, you want to, you want to bring the fucking flat top fucking grill. All right? But the Goddamn propane tank, none of that shit squat and around with your little firebox trying to get the coals burning and all of that shit. Fuck that. You just turn on the gas week weekly Click, let that fucking thing heat up. Drink a bloody Mary. And next thing you know fucking you making yourself an egg sandwich with bacon. Oh, delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:26:40       Toasting up your egg mic. Yeah, you're fucking Yah, Yah. English muffins. That's just breakfast. Now you've moved onto whiskey, right? It's fucking per, I got the flat top going over a

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       over Labor Day. And by the way, I'm telling you, I made the, I made the practice burger. I took it right out of the fridge and I was like, you know, I should have fucking had this been room temperature, but I don't have the time. And I threw it on. I did five minutes, both sides. I made sure it was nice and thin or whatever. Um, it was, I guess a little too thick and I took it off. Had a nice crunch to it and everything, but when I got to the middle, it was like rare. So I was like, well thank fucking God. I didn't, by the way, I ate it still. I still ate it. Fucking hamburger in the middle. It was like the consistency of bubblegum and a very dangerous, very dangerous thing to do. You can, you can get away with that with steak because you just fucking with one steer at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       But hamburger is just like a million stairs, you know what I mean? That's like, you know, eat that raw. That's like going rob with a porn star. You have no idea how many people you just fucked. So I took the meat out of the fridge, got it at room temperature, and then I did six minutes on both sides and uh, got nothing but compliments. So there, there's a little tip for you. This little tip that I learned from a pro chef is you got to get up the, you've got, you've got to hit a fucking breakfast ball. All right? You got to make one for yourself. You make the mistake on your own. All right. If I just took all that meat out and just throw it on there, everybody would have had bubble gum in the middle of fucking raw meat in the middle of their burgers. They'd have to take the fucking buns off and all of that messy shit and I'd have to put it back on and everybody would be looking at me like my balls just rolled off the fucking porch. What kind of a man doesn't know how to cook over and open flame?

Speaker 6:          00:28:41       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       That's what they would be saying. Nope. Didn't say that about me because in private when no one was around, I failed miserably. Okay, well that's one to grow on for the love of God. Is that 30 minutes. Ah, 29 minutes. One minute to go. People. What have we learned here? We've learned that bill can do a southern accent. We've learned that anytime anybody's dumb built as a southern accent, we've learned that bill has watched dirty dancing and ghost.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       And, uh, I think I did an advertisement for eating pigs and, uh, putting them on a flat top grill. I don't know what else she fucking need out of this. Um, at some point this will be uploaded. And the next thing you're going to listen to his, uh, audio of me on my cell phone, probably reading that should have already been read at this point when I wrapped it up. Um, on Saturday, this Saturday I'll be at the Toronto Film Festival for the Premiere of the front runner star in Hugh Jackman, who's already getting Oscar buzz. Uh, it's going to be very exciting to be a, to be that close man, to be that close to the, the biggest trophy out here in Hollywood. And I ain't talking about your third wife. There's a southern accent again.

Speaker 7:          00:30:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Yeah. It's going to be, this is going to be cool. I am so fucking psyched and feel so lucky that I got to be in that movie. Everybody knows seeing the trailer, except everybody who listens to this, who will now write negative shit, hip, all have positive things to say about it. And um, like I said, don't blink.

Bill. How excited are you that football is officially back?

Speaker 10:         00:36:19       Oh, this is the greatest time of year. It's Jagan in La. It's starting to get colder at night. I love it. I'm actually, I, you know, I know there's all these new rules and they could barely hit each other. Oh my God, I don't see, I don't even care if it's flag football. It's football. I'm sorry. Is this the best football into Halloween and Thanksgiving? Christmas. I love it. Favorite time of year.

Speaker 9:          00:36:43       Honestly, Sean, it's the feeling I get when I, uh, when I give myself a little, uh, abstinence from the old medication and then I get to indulge again in that, that first like sinking into the couch. That's football for me. I'm, I'm stoked. It's back comfort food, baby. It is so great. I feel like they scared us a little bit in the a week two and week three of the preseason. They were just flagging everything. Any, any, uh, guy lowers his helmet even though he's got his head up trying to hit him right in the chest. They're throwing a flag and then all of a sudden week for the preseason, all those flags dried up. I have a feeling when it comes. Yeah, Thursday night we'll see. Very few of those penalties actually called because the refs are just as big a fan of football as us and they know it'll just kill the game if they do it all the time. I think they should.

Speaker 10:         00:37:29       They'll rent the rest, stop making that call. It's the top talent to do it. This is the deal. At some point, if the game's going to continue, you're just going to have to sign a release. If you want to play this at a professional level, these are the risks and they're going to make you like, they're probably drawing up that contract right now. You can never come back and sue us. I mean, look, if, if, if this state or the federal government can put you in jail for like 30 years and then realize they screwed up and the only way they let you out as you can't sue them. I'm sure the NFL can draft something. Yeah. These for these people, that belt, they'll come up with something. So I think the game will be okay.

Speaker 9:          00:38:11       Yeah. The same people who drew up the warnings for cigarettes now, the Philip Morris guys, they'll meet up with the NFL, they'll figure it out. Hey, you just got to put this warning on the helmet. You know, we'll still be good. Yeah, come on. It was great. It did feel like this, uh, this college football weekend leading into the NFL was almost a kind of a warmup or play baby. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:38:32       Did you watch football? Because football has been like, it's just been what it's been all about man for the last few years. Like it's just, it's so exciting. And then they finally figured out not to have all those like just a hundred cupcake games. You know, like I remember back in the day when you would gamble and like in like, uh, September, like Nebraska would be favored by 58 over Kent State and then they'd cover, it was like ridiculous. Um, but now there was smart enough where they had, they had the Michigan Notre Dame game, they had Lsu Miami that the Florida state game last night. I missed all of that. I was doing some daddy labor day stuff with the family. I missed that one. But, um, I, I absolutely, I love college football as much as I love pro so much to my wife's Chagrin my entire weekend and this weekend I'm actually in Sacramento and then I got to go to the Toronto Film Festival. Uh, so I'm missing Saturday football and I'm flying home during the one o'clock games. So there's going to be a lot of Dvr and going on in my house.

Speaker 9:          00:39:32       Oh, that's my favorite thing. Every season is the, uh, really football's back already. It's only August, wasn't it? Just the draft. What happens then you've got the combine and then you just go, hey honey, what are the real housewives? In the off season. Exactly. The Bachelor is a full time sport. Like you know the NFL should be as well.

Speaker 10:         00:39:54       Yeah. That, that Andy Cohen show, that's their sports center where they hit those women all stirred up again. What about on this play, which you said you're barren and you couldn't have children. They start yelling at each other. It's like watching a round the horn.

Speaker 9:          00:40:07       Yeah, it does. It does. It cougars in the pacing of a studio show cause they bring up game film. They're breaking it down. What are, you know they have former players, former bachelor's weighing in turning point. Madden telestrator over there. That's great.

Speaker 10:         00:40:24       That's the only way I could, I had to like get like look at my wife's perspective and just be like, this is just her sports center. And then I was able to kind of relax and then I really look at a lot of the, you know, it's a lot of the sports chatter out there. It's just so ridiculous. It's like somebody like me who's not even connected to it. Just be, I'll tell you, I'm really concerned about our middle release, you know, talking baseball. It's like, oh, are you somebody who never played beyond not getting picked in gym class,

Speaker 9:          00:40:50       but we thing is always funny. Sean's a big fan of doing that with the eagles. I do enjoy the I, you know, we're, we're going to win it all this year. It is a way, because if you don't win, you get all this crap. You guys saw that show you are blah, blah, blah. Then all of a sudden you win. And then the other guy's like, oh, we're easy. They apply. You didn't play, but what do you mean? Yeah, when I, when I wake up Monday and eagles got their ass kicked, I'm fucking depressed. All right. I have to live with that. These guys, that's just a job for them. This is my fucking life. So yeah, I might drop

Speaker 10:         00:41:23       and people give you shit saying you guys suck. You guys show Philly's a bunch of losers and then all of a sudden if you win every that, that's, that's when you know, you want to gain. When people say, oh, we, it's not weird. It's like, oh, we must have something that, that you resent.

Speaker 9:          00:41:39       Yes, exactly. All right, well, perfect transition bill. We, uh, we picked up a couple of games here to break down with you. Of course, all the spreads come in from our official partner in my book. He died a g, he's that Promo code bill beds for a hundred percent deposit bonus. First game opening game of the season. Atlanta falcons heading into Philadelphia right now it's looking like eagles minus two and a half. I think it opened at like three and a half. It was up to four when it sounded like when's was playing now whence is out foals. His name to starter. Which way you lean in on this game.

Speaker 11:         00:42:14       Ah,

Speaker 10:         00:42:16       I, you gotta take the Eagles at home. I know. I, you know, they're going to be raising the flag. Every one's going to be going nuts. Half the crowd will be in that little jail. They have. Um, I, Huh. I, it's, it is, it's still the eagle. So those should win this game, but there's still, until they, in that second one, this is still the still angels on earth, but I'm going to take the eagles at home considering, uh, nick falls at a pedestrian 300 yards in the Superbowl compared to Tom Brady's 500 yards and losing, which will never be broken. Does it

Speaker 9:          00:42:53       again, thank you so much for bringing this up. I go at it with Patriots fans who say that Brady had a better game, that false. Now Brady had an amazing game and you can't obviously knock Brady's play at all, but in that particular game I would say nick foals out played him because of the couple of key plays foals made and the limiting of the turnovers and Brady obviously. Yeah, Sean's defensive of Nick fold is a passion of mine and Brady obviously. What? Well, no, and then the fumble, that kind of turned the game at the end in on the other side, you've got nick foals driving down to get a touchdown. Now. I'm not trying to, I'm up to

Speaker 10:         00:43:35       Tom Brady's not a running back. He's like shifty one years old. If you don't block it, he gets tackled. He had that one fumble, dirty, true for 500 yards. If you're really going to put that, it was our defense defense. What's the problem on both sides of the ball? Catch the ball. Nick false came out like it was a regular season game. He wasn't nervous. Tom Brady's Tom Brady, false offenses, played great defense defenses on both teams. Sucked. Sucked. The only thing was the eagles sucked a little less than he goes. Basically the eagles made the only, I think defensive play the game, you know, it's all I'm saying. Listen, you started this shit sitting there congratulating you. Hey, if you're going to say like, but that is like like some ESPN shit to say somebody close to 500 yards and they're the problem. They, I think they're all kind of offs. Yeah. Tom didn't have the

Speaker 9:          00:44:32       magic. No. I, at this point it's my, it's probably my second favorite sport. Watching Sean talk about how nick falls had a better game than Tom Brady and the, and to be clear, Tom Brady had an amazing game. The reason the patriots lost was because they couldn't stop anyone on defense. That's, that's what I'm coming. Really what you're bringing it full circle for us. Nick is going to suck like he has the rest of his career and the,

Speaker 10:         00:44:53       I don't think that's good, but also like eagles couldn't stop the patriots either. They stopped the one fucking to do. There was like two punts the whole game. Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy. There's no talking shit about what your defense did in that game other than we made one play that they would like the offense was it? It was the weirdest. I can't watch it because it's too still too close, but I have to go back and watch it. It's the weirdest fucking game. I mean that's, that's, that's, that's some shit that happens that like division three high school, but it's like two pumps in a game. You look like a big game. It was really a, it was, it was bizarre. And it started off with what's his face is like, like, like crying, like he's at a funeral that Malcolm Butler.

Speaker 9:          00:45:37       Oh Man, what did he do? What did he do? I guess we'll never find it.

Speaker 10:         00:45:40       I should've known. I should've known when he was, when they'd bet anytime Bella check does that we lose. So I remember we were playing the jets at home and Wes Welker and made all those feet joke about Rex Ryan. We sat him and that Brady threw the worst pass of his career on that screen pass or it was just, it was like he threw it three yard hail. Mary went up in the air and there's always a pick six. And uh, so anyway, what happened, man, I bet you guys beat somebody else because I was very happy. I would have what I could have enjoyed watching the eagles. Finally, when am I? Because I don't wish longterm misery on any sports fan other than a select few Montreal, Montreal Canadien fans and Yankee fence. Everybody else. Everybody else.

Speaker 9:          00:46:29       All right, so Kramer said, are you going with, obviously I'm going to be on the eagles. The key with foals is if you give him time, if he doesn't face a pass for us, he's going to be okay. They got Jason Peters coming back at left tackle. I think that'll be huge. They get some of their weapons back. I think they could scheme up a decent game plan. I think their defense will play good against the Falcons here week one and uh, yeah, they're raising the banners. I think there'll be jacked for it. I'm going on the eagles.

Speaker 10:         00:46:55       You guys shut down the vikings, you know everybody, you guys just completely shut them down in the, in the NFC championship game, if I remember correctly. So they'll be census there. I just don't, that was like a twilight zone game.

Speaker 9:          00:47:08       It was bizarre because I, every scenario in my head going over the game for the eagles to when it was going to be a defensive struggle, you know, or, or a low scoring game. I certainly didn't see teen 13 yeah, something like that. That's what I was thinking and I was shocked to see them pull it out with the, you know, 74 points or whatever scored. Yeah, I mean, listen, it's tough to go against the, the, I mean the Patriots got run up last year, but typically the team raising the banner, it's a good bat. You know, the contrarian in me also likes the line, you know, the line move is moving the wrong way. Nick falls did just win the Superbowl MVP. So gotta give them the benefit of the doubt. But what I would say the Falcons could have that pass rush showing. You mentioned the past, the rush that could be this problem.

Speaker 9:          00:47:49       And just out of principle, I'll of course I'm going to fade the eagles fan niggles. All right. Next up. Big Game. Houston Texans at the New England patriots right now. Patriots six point favorite. And uh, I'll kick things off. I like the pats here. Lane six against this Texans team. I mean, one thing that's been pretty consistent in the Brady Belicheck era is they look good coming off a loss. And if you look at 2012 when they lost the Superbowl in 2008 they and even back to the parcels and 96 they came back and uh, they won 34 13 they want 1710 they want 41 to seven. Like this team, I think we'll come out with a statement game and really put it on the text. And so that's what I mean,

Speaker 10:         00:48:33       I'm not sure, I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but how does, how does that have anything to do with this team? All those on all of the personnel from all of that, that's like, you know, they, they, they play really good historically in the sand when it's 70 degrees out

Speaker 9:          00:48:48       check I guess. Yeah, I guess, I guess to me it's, I don't bell chicks, the guy that just doesn't lose back to back games and I think, listen, little brother coming off a Superbowl loss. Yeah. Bill O'brien, former guy in the coaching tree. I think he's gonna want to put it on him. I just, this patriots team seems like they're ready to make a statement at home against the texts in steam.

Speaker 10:         00:49:11       How do you, how do you see it go? Well, I think that Texas quarterback, what's his name there to Sean Watson? He's coming off the ACL. He's going to be a nightmare. He's going to be a nightmare for us trying to contain him. And the only thing I like is, I guess they have the worst offense of line in the league. I think that bodes well for us. Um, what's the spread?

Speaker 9:          00:49:33       Six patriots lane six at home.

Speaker 10:         00:49:36       Oh, they always pick the perfect number. Dot. Yeah. They're so good. Now what I'm gonna do, I'm actually, I'm actually gonna take the Texans with the points because you have the last year we played the Kansas City chiefs and they came in and they, they, they killed us it up. So I'm going to play your game and talk about something that happened before. Probably doesn't matter. I think everybody's going to jump on the path being like, oh, they're gonna be pissed because you've lost the super bowl. Everything you just said. And then the Julio Jones, that wasn't really your though on a sports bar like me who have jobs and make a couple of great catches in. Now also, this is their revenge game. I'll forget, they'd haven't seen her since we, uh, came back and this, you know, came back historically two years ago in the Superbowl against them. So, uh,

Speaker 9:          00:50:23       sorry, I think you're bringing the falcons in there for a second right there.

Speaker 10:         00:50:28       I have not only a plan, I'm sorry.

Speaker 9:          00:50:31       Oh, good. Kramer. Which way? Which way you lean in here? Uh, I mean, yeah, it's Bellicheck just whoops. On his disciples period. Yeah. Not much to handicap to Watson would scare me with that defense. Yeah. Um, I, I do, I am curious to see the offensive line, but I've just seen, I feel like we've seen this so many times where a t and optimistic disciple of bill Belicheck comes in and just gets, gets a shit pushed in. So yeah, I'm not, I'm not fading the Patriots Week One. Yeah, I do. I do think bill is hitting on something. No. Because I feel like, and maybe this is again just kind of a gut instinct, but the paths kind of play themselves in September. They use it as an extended preseason. Kind of trialed some stuff, figure out some things. And I'm still shocked that Patricia got a head coaching job because I don't know that defense didn't Wah, you know, instill a lot of confidence. So that's, that's crazy that he got that Detroit Keg. Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:51:26       You liked that reminds me of when I first moved out to la the first time in the late nineties, everybody out here either had a Seinfeld or a friend's credit and that entitled them to some sort of show runner, like, uh, or they would get some sort of deal and they would pair them up like, oh, this guy wrote on friends. This guy wrote on Seinfeld, I think bill Bellacheck is the Seinfeld of writers' rooms. Yeah. So see if you did, if you did anything, if you will, the water boy. Yeah, he was a water boy. Bill Belichick, you, you don't make a lateral move, you don't become the waterboy, you get elevated in position. So maybe that's why a Patricia's,

Speaker 9:          00:52:05       where were you guys? I mean it's so true, but it sounds like Patricia is just, it sounds like people are already Pennsylvania men as a failure. It sounds like things aren't going well. There's some weird dynamics going on with that team. All right. One of the, uh, one of the Monday night games. There's the dual Monday night game. Do a kick off the season, which fuck it. Why not the La Rams head up to Oakland right now. The Raiders four point home dog bill. I'll let you, uh, get things cause started here. How do you, how do you see this game shaken out? Deal at, do you like the Raiders? What's your thoughts on John Gruden?

Speaker 7:          00:52:39       MMM,

Speaker 10:         00:52:40       I'm hoping that he doesn't regret going back to the 24, seven, three 65 life of coaching when I always feel like when coaches get into broadcasting and there was good at that. Good at it as is Gruten is they gotta be sitting there going like this? Just job as a joke. Yeah. Compared to what? Compared to what I used to have to do. But I imagine he missed it. Obviously they gained the right amount of money. He came back, I mean Gruden I know he's been gone for a while, man. I mean, well, how many years? Like almost a decade and a half. He left like early two thousands. Am I right?

Speaker 9:          00:53:13       Yeah, I think it's been at least 10 years. I think we looked it up. It was, it was before the wildcat. So to put that in perspective, yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:53:22       2007. Yeah. So that's a long time. And each generation of kids is a little bit different. And he's also rebuilding. And, uh, I saw the thing on the Ram's head coach where he could recall like, you see it on real sports at Bryant Gumbel. Like there'd be like, Hey, a minute, 42, week eight, third quarter, what happened? He's like, Oh yeah, we ran that sweep play. Uh, the guard didn't get out, uh, quite where we wanted him to, but he got the job done. He has like a photographic memory. I think that guy is, is like, if anybody's going to be the next generation of guys, it's gonna be him. And, um, where he's, where he's just taking the ram so quickly. I just think, uh, because gluten is just starting to put it back together. I would take the ramps. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:54:10       Kramer, you first of all, yeah, Make Bay comes off like somewhere between a serial killer and rain man in that piece. He's definitely like, well advanced of grew and, and, and just just imagine, I mean I have to deal with millennials on a daily basis. John, I cannot imagine John Gruden dealing with millennials. I mean, we know why he came back. We saw it in hard knocks last year. He still was making a playbook. He just didn't have anyone to give it to. He loves rock and the visors, he's, he's cut like half the team. I think I saw that there's, there's 31 new players on his 53 man roster. Um, I saw a great tweet. The Raiders decided to pay a coach $100 million and not pay their best player. 90. Uh, so many reasons that, I mean, this is the ultimate, like, just take the ugly dog, right?

Speaker 9:          00:54:53       This is the ultimate take the ugly dog on Monday night, but I can't do it. I can't do it in this spot. So yeah, I'm going to fade. I come on wheat, we think Jay Gruden's a joke. At least I do. He made a mistake. He's going to realize it quickly. My talks, I wouldn't, I wouldn't normally like to take a kind of road favorite here in a divisional spot. I, I normally like to take a Monday night home dog. Great Opportunity here. But man, this Raiders team isn't crazy disarray and it just seems like th the quarterbacks pissed off. He's upset that they traded their best player. It's a weird move to pull this close to the season and the Raiders did the what, 24th ranked defense with Cleo Mack. You trade a all time defensive player. Now maybe this lined up working out for them in the long run, but I think this Rahm's office, even though they didn't get a lot of reps in the preseason for whatever reason McVay maybe, you know they use the crazy analytics and some sports sides Gruden's using the analytics. He openly challenges analytics, which I Kinda, I normally like the old school guy approach there, but uh, yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:55:53       I'm looking guys also that they're moving. Yeah, they got half the shits and boxes. Like I just, I just felt

Speaker 9:          00:56:01       yes. You look at that, you look at the ram season that last year in St Louis. Did Donnie go well moved out to Fisher. It was just a complete disaster. We just think of this, if John like John Gruden became a caricature, much like John Madden. Imagine if John Madden came back to coaching after like 15 years. No fucking way. Yeah. I think burden. Uh, it'll be interesting. I don't know.

Speaker 10:         00:56:22       I'm not that guy. Can't coach.

Speaker 9:          00:56:24       I'm just saying he walked into a hell of a situation and yeah, he's playing these guys week one who are just going to build on what [inaudible] the past two seasons, how much they've improved. I just think that, I think they are going to keep going. Yeah. The rams have a lot of momentum from last year. Not even catching like an east coast team playing that late kick off. You're catching another west coast teams. So it's not like they have no, it's, there might be more rare. I mean there's gonna be a lot of rams fans right now that the bandwagon has gotten nice and roomy. Yeah. I think it's, I think it's just, I don't see a lot of fans going up to, that's also true horror picture show. That is such a weird tradition. You guys, let's get her costumes on and go to the game. The foam spike shoulder pads. Like, Hey, I got to, hey, we're going to go tailgate. Let me stop off at Michael's first to get all my face pain and Styrofoam cones. The glue on the shoulder pads. I'm a pirate.

Speaker 10:         00:57:19       Yeah. They used to look like a biker gang. The crowd somewhere along the line yet starting to look like, like a musical. Like, like, like, like for kids or even this, even the scary things.

Speaker 9:          00:57:31       It looks a little friendly. It's almost like if kiss just became sharing section.

Speaker 10:         00:57:37       Yeah. And it's like rocky horror pictures, whatever the hell that stupid movie meets like, uh, like meats, like a Disney ride or something. Like, we can only make it so scary because we don't this something about like when you have the dad bod and, and, and foam spikes coming up. I love that. They think that they're intimidating together team. The other team literally has 300 pound guys trying to rip their heads off. But you're up there dressed like a pirate and you're the one who's going to

Speaker 9:          00:58:06       throw 'em off iPads. Man, you're freaking me out.

Speaker 10:         00:58:10       There's a lot of that. The dog pound lot of that Ellie stuff like, you know, your dad goes there and a rubber mask eaten dog biscuits. It's like, come on dad, I gotta go. I gotta go.

Speaker 9:          00:58:20       Cool on Monday. I have to respect you father. Come on. Yeah, you just helped me with my math homework. You're not crazy. All right bill, before we, uh, before we let you go here, what is a, maybe it's these three games, maybe it's a, a, another game you feel really strongly about week one. Can we get you to throw out a lock? You know, we are gambling podcast. So what is, what is bill burrs leadpipe lock for week one?

Speaker 10:         00:58:45       My lead pipe lock. All right, this is my lock and it's not going to be gambling related. My lock is going to be whatever happens this week. Most people in sports are gonna Talk Radio are going to act like, you know, like say Oakland gets their ass is kicked, all they're going to be talking about that John Grown you make the fingers was Jacob was he sitting on $100 million and he's all in one worst case scenario, one game out of first they're going to act like every God damn thing that happens this son Thursday, Sunday and Monday is what's going to happen the whole year. They do it every fucking year. When Kansas City came out and kicked the Patriots, as all of a sudden Kansas City was the fucking team of the future and what happened to them? You know, the Patriots went back and won the AFC championship, you know, so I mean, just don't listen for gamblers. Do not listen to all of the freaking out that that they're going to be doing when they do it. That's just, I don't know. They always got asked like the fucking sky is falling or Jesus just came back after every single game. You know what I mean?

Speaker 9:          01:00:00       You look at some of the teams that started to and Oh and then get destroyed, missed the playoffs and that's a great, you know, advice especially for gamblers because a lot of times you see one week and then complete crazy overreactions and we always talk about that week too. When you're picking your games, don't overreact to that week one. If you had a strong feeling or you know whatever you, you were really high on the team, it could just be one bad game. Don't totally throw out your shit. Buy Lotion Bailo

Speaker 10:         01:00:28       exactly. Look for the look for that overreaction spread. See if he can jump on that.

Speaker 9:          01:00:33       Tons of line value there and of course you can head over to my book. He died ag to take advantage of that potential line value either week one week to live betting prop bets. They got it all in game way during my bookie. Dot. Agee. Use that Promo Code Bill bets for a 100% deposit bonus. Bill. Appreciate you calling in man. And uh, we'll talk to you soon. Thanks dude.

Speaker 10:         01:00:53       All right guys, go pass. I'll see it.

Speaker 11:         01:00:55       Ah, later. Crazy.

Speaker 12:         01:01:21       Hey, what's going on? It's built bar and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, August 23rd, 2010. How the hell are you? What's going on? I just got back from Portland, Oregon actually taping this a Sunday night cause I got a bunch of bullshit I have to do tomorrow. Um, I dunno what the fuck I just got back from Portland and I hate doing these things Sunday night because I'm, I'm still like jet lagged. I'm out of it. So, uh, this is gonna be a rough one and I'm plowing through this. Even if it fucking sucks. I'm not stopping it and rerecording it like I did last week because that ended up getting me in trouble. That's how I started talking about that doctor Laura Shit last week. And I got to say for the first time, maybe the second time ever, I'm nominating myself as Douche bag of the week because last week I actually supported Dr Laura Cause I had no fucking idea who she was. And uh, you know, I was having a rough time doing the podcast. I needed fodder. Somebody send me an email, what do you think about this? And I watched like a ten second clip of evidently a five minute clip and I just thought she was imitating some something she saw on def jam. So I was like, well she's quoting it, she's not calling anybody that word, but the ban all that bullshit. And then Jay's, oh Jesus. The fucking emails came in

Speaker 8:          01:02:39       from a, I ever deadly. Uh, for my 14 podcasts listeners. Evidently like six of them are African American. Um, and uh, yeah, they read me the riot act in different stages and I got admit they will fucking write cause I didn't, I, you know, something, my uninformed logic is usually funny that I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about and I go off on shit and I realized that our race probably isn't one that you should probably do that on. I didn't know that. She was like, uh, like rush Limbaugh with a cunt. I had no idea. I just, you know, I don't know the fuck she was that she was some soccer mom with a podcast, you know, and she was like, all the crazy kicked out there, fucking blah blah blah. I had no idea. Sorry. Fucking eggs on my face. Um, but you know, it was funny.

Speaker 8:          01:03:26       One guy got so into fucking trashing me. Wait, before I close this email, here's something I got from a former marine talking about that clapping for, uh, the troops going through the airport. He goes, as a former marine, nothing was a bigger joke than seeing those support. The support, the troops, stickers talk about an empty gesture and clapping is even lamer. I have always fucking thought those bumper stickers with stupid support. The troops, she to Sligo by that for a buck slapping on the back of your truck or car and then he just drive away. Well, I did my part. Do you support the troops? Have you looked at my bumper sticker will. All right then. Um, yeah, that's fucking lame. Um, he said, and clapping is even lamer. He said, you're on the right track. Sending over drinks to veterans who got back, but think bigger. How about a program called head for heroes? That's right. Every, every service member of returning from whatever fucked up Third World Shithole we're engaged in at the time, gets met at the airport by some gorgeous whore and blown in a specially designated area. That would be a great way of showing the country's gratitude.

Speaker 12:         01:04:43       You know what? I think if you can build a banker's out, give them $1 trillion. I think it, you can get a couple of fucking who is, you know, forget about the girls who have a fucking uniform fetish. Um, but anyways, uh, yes, so I got fucking trashed. Um, I took a little heat off of Mel Gibson. I bet. Then he heard a couple of less a fucking hate mails last week, so I apologize. I don't know who she is. I'm not gonna Apologize For my stupidity, but in the future when it's something, you know, race-related I, I will try to be a little more informed. All right, well I've got to find this fucking email with this guy fucking trashed me. You know, he said, uh, [inaudible] let's see. He goes, it starts off good. Just trashing me, which I totally get. He goes, just like in your bit, you did about the Jimmy, the Greek thing. It's best for white people to just leave it alone. Dr. Laura May be old, but she's aware enough to know what happens to white people when they say the n word or bring up racial supremacy theories. See, that's the part of the tape I didn't watch.

Speaker 12:         01:05:44       I showed up late to that rally, you know, by the time I showed up, they had already put the cross out. You know, everybody's hoods. They took them off. It was a hot day. I didn't know what I was walking into. I thought it was like a fucking, you know, Aa meeting or something. You know, we're all over by the table, haven't donuts. It's my fault. I came in late. Um, so anyways, uh, he said the podium comes out, so I'm surprised you defended Dr Laura in this case. They asked where I got a lot of them. Surprise. You defended or can we, cause I watched eight seconds of the tape because I'm Maura. Um, I don't understand why there's any debate about racial ethnic, why any debate about racial inequality always comes down to comedians and def comedy jam. I don't think it does, but evidently a, in your world, maybe it does.

Speaker 12:         01:06:28       Um, I've heard this argument before, well, black comedians say this and that about white people and say the n word, why can I, is it fair for minority comedians? [inaudible] Pitta and all basic, all that's all that shit? Uh, I'm trying to get to this part here. So then he was talking about this documentary saw where some comic was saying, you know, making a joke. This is actually a good joke where white people like, why can't I say the n word? Uh, and then the dude was like, Oh, it was Chris Rock. Well, why do you even want to say it? Right. Great fucking joke. Totally makes sense. And then the punchline is, I've sailed the world. I've fucked Raquel Welch. If I could just say the n word, my life would be complete. And then this dude writes after that, he goes, I think that it bothers white people because you're not used to being told that you can't do something white people used to be able to do and say anything they wanted. Now there's all these rules. Isn't that fucking that, that part of the email, that's where it just went off the fucking rails for me. You know what I mean? It's like I totally get it. She's a fucking idiot. I didn't realize it because I watched that short little clip, you know, I shouldn't have support that shit. And, and you're offended by that, which I totally get. And then in the end, you make some dumb, general generalization about white people. See where all the same, we're fucking morons.

Speaker 12:         01:07:56       Jesus Christ. I've sailed the world. Fuck walk. Hell, we'll see. That part's the joke. But this, here's what he writes bothers white people that you're not being used to told, being told that you can't do something. Oh yeah, yeah. We just run around doing whatever the fuck we want to do. It's great. Ah, Jesus Christ. That's, that's one the great stereotypes

Speaker 8:          01:08:16       is that we're all Kennedy's living on fucking Martha's vineyard rather than fucking

Speaker 6:          01:08:21       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:08:22       You know, the majority of white people aren't out there. Majority of white people sitting in cubicles not living their dream, drowning in a sea of fucking debt, trying to get health insurance. Isn't that the majority of fucking white people? Evidently not. Evidently according to this guy, white people have yachts sailing the world. All 300 million of us, you know, do you just see it during that, the Gulf War, uh, the Gulf spill there, you know, that was one of the biggest problem. All those white people, all the 300 million white people with our fucking yet just sailing around. Oh, it's so awesome to be white. You can just walk them. You can do what it say, whatever you want to do. It's fucking incredible.

Speaker 12:         01:09:03       Um, that's an argument I've, I've gotten it to, uh, with the, um, I think every fucking, yeah. Female comics, black comics, every fight. They just go, yeah, it's easy for you. All you gotta do is show up, man. Oh yeah, that's all it is. I don't even audition. I just lay here and they, they call me up and I'm like, why? Why did you give me that part then? Cause your white, here you go. You don't have to work for shit. Uh, you know, that's that classes. You know that, that fucking double standard right there. Okay, now we're opening a whole nother can of worms. Let's talk race for the next couple of weeks. People. This ought to bring out a lot of ugliness. Um, that's that classic fucking like, that's one of those statements like you, if you flip that thing, what you just said there, that generalization that you made of, of white people that basically what we just sit around and they do. People just give a shit and we can do whatever the fuck we want to do. You basically going to define us by the Illuminati. MMM.

Speaker 8:          01:10:09       If you flip that around and somebody white says that upon another race of people, then there were in like a Mel Gibson situation. All right, now I'm open this up for discussion. I'm not opening this up for fucking rednecks to come on here and be like, yeah, that's why the fuck I'm talking about. I'm not saying it like that, but what I'm saying, you know what? This is what I've learned. Traveling the fucking Globe and by the globe. I mean I went to two other continents. I went to Australia and Europe. I did all my research with just white people. All right. A. Dot. Yeah. I think pretty much people are people. We're all the same. You know, there's a few, like very small percentage of people on this planet are genuinely good people and everybody else is pretty much full of shit. And everybody looks at everybody else and I think they got it easier. And all you gotta do is, yeah, you gotta do is this, I got to work twice as hard at this guy and this guy does this. And you know, no one wants to know

Speaker 12:         01:11:05       what I've learned. Well, you probably don't wanna know because I'm a fucking moron, but for what it's worth, this is what I've learned. Life is that life isn't fair. It's really fucking difficult. But if you bust your ass, you're going to make it on whatever level you're going to fucking make it. You surround yourself with positive people and you don't fucking quit when somebody kicks you in the fucking chest, you get back up again. You don't walk right into his foot. You go around finding different fucking avenue, or maybe you build your own avenue, you do whatever you're gonna fucking do. And everybody's got different starting positions and all that shit, and it isn't fucking fair. And there's nothing you can fucking do about it. But, uh, you know, and there's some people who don't get stuff because of who they are

Speaker 8:          01:11:50       because they're, they're, they're so that, that they're fat or that they're fucking in an Asian guy with one leg. Okay. And he can't work at a Goddamn fucking place where you get a fake Tan, you know? Yeah. That shit definitely fucking exists. But you know, what are you gonna do? You know? But you know what? I think most people don't make it because they're fucking pussies and they just tap out, you know? And I'm talking about fucking wipe. I'm actually talking mostly white people cause that's what I know, you know? And I got, I got people, people I know, they just fucking quit and they've got all these fucking excuses why they can't fucking do it. And it's like, no, you, you quit, you got punched once in the face and then you just fucking laid down and now you're going to fucking blame everybody else.

Speaker 8:          01:12:33       Right. Did that make any fucking sense? I'm trying to say something positive here. Trying to be balanced where it's like, I know you and like female comics are always fucking complaining, but you know, I can't tell you the amount of fucking times I would. I would be auditioning for festivals and the industry becoming up to me going, we need funny women. Where are the funny women? And then they would pick a fucking woman just cause they needed one. Not because they were one of the funnier fucking people. I'm not saying that female comics aren't funny, but I'm just saying there. There are examples. You know what? You guys can all go fuck yourself. I'm a balding redhead trying to get into movies, all right? You know, cry me a fucking river. I don't give a shit, all right? But I was wrong about the doctor Laura thing. Okay? When I start a fucking group crying about how there's no fucking redheaded action heroes out there. You know Jesus Christ. What's that fucking movie? That's the number one movie in the country. They got 58 fucking action stars in there. One of them can't be a redhead. Couldn't have called up David Caruso to show his pasty white ass walking up to Arnold Schwartzenegger. Ah, it gives a fuck. All right. So there you go. That was, that was my, that was my roundabout apology.

Speaker 12:         01:13:49       Uh, no, seriously. I really felt bad about that. Felt like an ignorant ass at a rather than just immediately come on and apologize. I left it up there for the week, so I'd get my nice pounding from everybody and uh, yeah. You know what I mean? I fuck around and said a lot of fucked up shit, but I, you know, I'm trying to start your week off right. I'm not trying to Piss you off, although there's probably a lot of women out there who had fucking disagree, but you know, it's comedy. You know, people, people get hurt. It's out fucking works. This is the worst apology ever, but it's coming from the heart. All rights. Go Fuck Yourself. That's how we got to end it. All right. I grew up with no hugs, so if I'm trying to be fucking nice, it has to end with go fuck yourself.

Speaker 12:         01:14:29       Um, speaking of go fuck yourself. Um, I just got back from Portland, Oregon and I had a great time up at the a helium comedy club, the grand opening helium comedy club, and a Portland, Oregon is a city that I have not worked in, um, in 10 years because there was no comedy club for a guy in my situation to come in there and work. Uh, I did work. There was a local club there, but it wasn't really a comedy club. It was, but it wasn't like the club owners is basically what he would do. He would paper the room, which is a, the showbiz term. He would just just call people up. And I talk about this last week I came fucking remember he would just call people up and just say, you know, or have this whole team of telemarketers call up people and tell them that they want a comedy show.

Speaker 12:         01:15:18       And he would just call enough people where he would fill up his room every fucking night of the week from Tuesday through Sunday. And everybody cared. It got in for free. And then all he did was fucking just throw food and drinks down their fucking throats. And that's how he makes his million. But meanwhile, the comedian stands on stage in front of a bunch of fucking drunk overeaten jackasses who could give a fuck about the show. And you had to go up there on a Tuesday night with a goddamn whipping a chair, two shows, Friday, three shows, Saturday the guy would, he wouldn't even let you talk to the waitstaff, you'd think if you put a comedian through that bullshit, they can at least try to get fucking leg, you know, try to get a little bit of action. He fucking cock block young like nine different levels. It's a fucking horrific gig is what I'm telling you.

Speaker 12:         01:16:04       And then the second you got a TV credit and you said, hey, can I have an extra quarter? The next time I fly across the country? And then the guy that you just wouldn't return your phone call. So he basically, other than up and coming guys would just be booking horrific talents. So Portland has been really starved for any sort of national headlines. So now there's a new club out there and I was really excited to be the first guy to come to town and, uh, and have, uh, you know, work the comedy club. And I had no idea how bad that other club was until I talked to some of the younger comics. This guy told me, he walked in there to do a spot. He moved up from, uh, from host to feature in that club owner. Guy Calls him and he's like, look, I make $1 million a year just selling food. That's what he said. When you get on stage, no f bombs that just reads them the fucking riot act. It's, it was horrible. It's a great business model. He's made his money, but it's fucking horrible for the development of Comedians. He's sitting on their fucking chest.

Speaker 6:          01:17:12       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:17:13       And that Dick's, he's not even letting them get fucking lay. What did they, you know, just asshole fucking asshole. Um, so it's great that there's a new comedy club out there and that the, you know, there's another place for these comics to work and that they can actually see national headlines. Cause that was a fucking big thrill for me when I was back in Boston. So, uh, so if you live in the Portland area, you know, if you're a lumberjack, climbed down out of the fucking tree and come on down, do a helium comedy club. It's a great club. And uh, he's got C's. Who's he got next week? He's got a Jimmy Pardot is who he's got Jimmy Pardot. Uh, right. Is that what is what I think there was one other person, um, oh, Reggie watts. Reggie rots on Wednesday. And then Jimmy Pardot from the never not funny podcast.

Speaker 12:         01:18:04       Jesus Christ. I'm losing my God damn memory. I knew there was somebody else. So go check out those shows next week and uh, support a comedy club that actually will book somebody who's funny and on television. All right, low plowing ahead here. Um, what's the next thing on the docket? I really have, I don't have shit this week. Do I? What am I? 17 minutes in? That's not bad. You gonna fucking tap out at 40 minutes yet. You know, you guys don't go home early every once in awhile and just fake a fucking injury at work. Try to pretend like a forklift drove over here. Some shit. You know what I really wanted to do was I wanted to look up that five hour energy here on the Internet, five hour energy. Now this is how I do my research now. Five hour energy I think is a liquid cocaine and I think it really fucks with you yet.

Speaker 12:         01:18:55       I think it's bad. So, um, rather than just look up five hour energy consumer reports, I'm going to search five hour energy unhealthy. See, and this is how most people do research. They already have their mind made up and then they just read shit that agrees with them. Yeah. You know, according to a fuck face.com um, I'm exactly right. Side effects of five hour energy drink shots. Are they unhealthily unhealthy? Let's read this one. This is the first one that came up. Side effects of fiber to, okay. I was at lunch today and my friend was trying to get someone to drink five hour energy caffeine shot. So I, I opened it and smelled it and said I'd give it a shot anyways, I think you're supposed to mix them in a drink. But I straight shrugs that, chugged it and almost gagged from the taste. After I swallowed it, it took me like 15 minutes to get that horrible taste. Uh, out of my mouth. I tried eating food, chewing gum, drinking, but the taste stayed in my mouth for like 40 minutes. I felt sick. Every time I thought about the taste, I think the taste bothered me so much. Uh, Jesus, why you do or you're going to get to the part where you had the heart attack so I can feel like I'm right.

Speaker 12:         01:20:12       Take the taste, bothered me so much caffeine. But anyways, I'm shy. So after the tastes and the sickness wore off, I was feeling great all day and I felt probably the happiest I have all school year because all my subtle tendencies wore off and I acted more outgoing and funny like I do around friends. They just turn this dude into a fucking coke head. That's classic reason why people do drugs. Helps me loosen up, man. I could talk to the chicks. Um, there's nothing on here. Are you shitting me? Oh, gives a fuck. I just, you know, why don't you get eight hours sleep? Why don't you do, why did you start that? You know, I had somebody else in another mother call in or call in or write in going back to that fucking that shit I said about stay at home moms and once again they were doing, she was, she was saying, I totally agree with you.

Speaker 12:         01:21:13       I understand. You're absolutely right. They have no right to be saying it's the most difficult job ever. And then she wrote three paragraphs about how difficult it is to be a mother and to be worrying up and having the responsibility of another life. And it's like I like, I don't, I get it. I know I don't totally get it cause I don't have a kid. But you know enough already. All right. Like that other listeners said you chose to be a mother. You know, you're acting like a, all of a sudden you've got like a fucking terminal disease and all you're doing is bringing up the bad shit. What about when you have, you have a bad day and you come home and that kid with, you know, all that innocent just looks at you and just thanks. You're bigger than life. What about that? Doesn't that, that, that, you know, wash away some of the spittle on your shoulder blade?

Speaker 12:         01:22:05       I don't fucking know. You know, it's funny, actually ironic. It was, I was just watching 60 minutes and they have one of those guys on the fucking BP oil rig and I said when they jumped off of it, it was the equivalent of jumping off a three story fucking brownstone. Evidently it's the equivalent of jumping off a 10 story fucking building. That's what they did. That was their choice standing there in the middle of the Goddamn Ocean. Either I burn up or I jump into the fucking oily water without, oh, it was brutal. Okay, so while you mom's stand the fuck down, stop giving me shit. I was just fucking joking around. I'm just gonna have to end up apologizing to everybody here. You know, I had somebody run into me today from a New Zealand just podcast is really going to be random. Somebody wrote it from a New Zealand. I was thinking about this topic that for people and all these random countries who listened to this podcast, I'm going to start nominating who I think the coolest person from your countries and with new New Zealand, I think it's a no brainer. It's

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       Phil Rudd. You don't get any cooler than that guy. He's played the exact same drum beat for fucking 35 years and he's such a tough bastard that no one has the balls to tell them to switch it up.

Speaker 13:         01:23:19       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:23:20       You don't feel like, how about boom, check, boom, check, check. You know, how about that fucking guy? The whole fucking, the whole goddamn album. I think he just goes in there right and he just starts fucking play in that beat and then they just, they just play the whole song, the whole fucking album worth of songs. And then when they're done they just, they just started yet fail, fail. It's over. We're done. Yeah. We made another album. He just said, oh, all right. Yeah, let's just start breaking down his kit. Oh, Geez. I got nothing. I really riffing about Phil Rudd. There was some of the wars beatbox and you're ever gonna fucking here. Um, oh, here we go. You know what? I got to read this right here. Now I've got something. This will take up a good three fucking minutes. You know what? I liked it. This podcast is this difficult. Now you guys can relate to me. You know, you sitting there and you Goddamn cubicles on a fucking Monday. Unless you're white. Of course you're out on your yacht. You know, chatting it up with a Kennedy. Hey, when's the stock market going to crash again? Give me the heads up. Don't tell the Puerto Ricans. That's what it's like. That's exactly what it's like. There's not white people working farms, slaves to corporations.

Speaker 8:          01:24:43       Ah, not at all. Not at all. All your deal. You, you don't even have to get up. You don't have to get up. I spent nine years in bed just because I was white and they just fucking hilarious. I made more money then than when I worked. That's how great it is to be white. It's so fucking easy. And thank God for people who aren't white, who've never been white to tell me what it's like to be white. It's fucking awesome. Let me tell you something about being white white guy. This is how good it is. Oh yeah. What do you reincarnated was your name frank and another life? Um, is that a white guy name? I don't fucking know. All right. So anyway, so I've pissed off a bunch of people and uh, I just want to, I just want to try to redeem myself and show you that it's not all bad either. It's not all bad. You know, I do inspire some people. Uh, here's one for you. Milk white thighs is the name of this. This email, somebody sent me a set bill. A few things. The last five years, I've been six feet tall, 240 pounds. Upon trying to work out with no results and no willpower, I usually lose five pounds, give up and sit and eat shit. However, you talked on the podcast a few weeks ago about Bill Clinton and Al sloshing

Speaker 12:         01:26:04       around the White House. I believe I said sashaying around the White House with their milky white hips. Um, I was in a quiet room with about 50 people and blurted, blurt, laughed out loud, laughed loudly, blurt laughed loudly. That's really worded strangely. You burst out laughing. There we go. Ever since then. How will it be sitting, watching TV, looking at my treadmill and I will say to myself, slosh your ass up there and work off those milky white hips or something to that effect. It makes me laugh every time and realize how pathetic I've been. It's been about three weeks of this everyday and 45 minutes on the treadmill. I'm down to 208 pounds. Well, on my way to my goal of a hub of a buck 80 also, I'm a dude and my name is Lindsey. I know you don't have a lot of female listeners, so if you ever feel like you need a quote or just a woman's approval on something, you do, feel free to use my name and just say, yeah, this chick Lindsay, I know this chick, Lindsay who takes it. Uh, I'm more than willing to compromise my sexuality for the furthering of your career. Um, I would buy five of anything bill Burroughs endorsing. All right. There you go. There's a good email. Congratulations. You're down to 208. Keep going. And, uh, I'm glad. You know, I'm glad I just didn't bring all negativity to the podcast this past week. I felt fucking horrible about that even though I've been kind of a cost again this week. That's what I do. You know, you came back, didn't you?

Speaker 12:         01:27:43       You know, I don't know any better. I'm just a white guy laying in bed. I can't remember the last time I've had disappointment in my life. It just doesn't happen. Just doesn't happen, you know, you know, sometimes the sale on my schooner will break and I'm just like, AH, Jesus Christ. And then I call the government and I say, Hey, can you uh, can you send me another one? They're like white and what color are you? I said, why they guy? There you go.

Speaker 12:         01:28:13       Right on the way. You know, I agree with the first half of the email. This guy I'm making fun of, but I would love to send this guy my fucking taxes. I really would. These motherfuckers, what a lot of people don't realize is that rich people feel there's enough rich people and they got all kinds of fucking, they take a fucking pipe to a goddamn knees every fucking quarter. They make sure they can only be, they can only be a certain number or a fucking rich people unless you just invent some shit. Like, uh, I dunno. I Dunno what if you come up with the technology for the fucking iPod then even then, I mean they'll just, they'll just hire you on as like a scientist. Right. I'm really getting to know over my fucking head here. You know what I mean? If you come up with Facebook, if you that. I think that's the way now that you can actually become fucking rich, but I'll tell you right now, it's not fucking telling jokes. Fucking assholes.

Speaker 6:          01:29:09       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:29:09       Fucking assholes. God Damn fucking quarter. I gotta I gotta. Oh Gee, I am. I am going to get into it. I'm not going to fucking get it. Just give me some me so fucking mad. You're telling me I think I'm getting ahead. Look at me. Yeah, I'm getting the hey fucking sit down. That's what they do every quarter. You sit the fuck down. You stay right where you're at bay. Sit right where you're at. That's what it is. Anybody else? This isn't even a color thing. Anybody else in the fucking middle class. There you go. Fucking rich pricks fucking last goddamn eight years or they're making a ton of fucking money and then all of a sudden the shit hits the fan and they run out of the Goddamn restaurant. Leave everybody else with the fucking check.

Speaker 6:          01:29:58       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:29:59       Fucking unbelievable. My ever going to get that fucking car. I'll tell you, I got off the plane today and somebody had the dodge challenger in the all white, like the vanishing point guys ever see that movie with that dude? Kuwalski he's got an all white charger. So they did this tribute to, it's all fucking white and the guy had these fucking rims on it and uh,

Speaker 6:          01:30:21       yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:30:21       I just sat there drooling at my girl's looking at me like, she's like, Jesus Christ, you were obsessed with that car. It's like, yeah, you know I am.

Speaker 6:          01:30:32       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:30:32       Well, you know, I'm standing here. You just got off the plane. You could say hello to me, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:30:38       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:30:39       Oh, you know what that reminds me of. I fucking went to go to this pizza place. I really try to do fun things when I was in Portland, try to be healthy. I went for a fucking hike. I was sticking with my smoothies, you know, dropping pounds here and uh,

Speaker 6:          01:30:57       yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:30:57       Anyway, somebody tells me that in, in Portland they have this fucking room. They got this pizza parlor where they had the best God damn pizza and all the fucking northwest. So this guy has like this homemade goddamn doe, and he only makes so much of it every day. And when he's done making the dough, he's done making pizza. Go Fuck Yourself. All right? So I'm like, you know, well shit, I gotta try this pizza.

Speaker 12:         01:31:21       So I go on the Internet, I look up, I see where it is. It's right on Hawthorne Street, like 45th and Hawthorne, 46 in Hawthorne, something like that, right? So I'm like, all right, I gotta go check this fucking thing out. So I allow, I get myself an hour and a half before the show to get there, to get a God damn pizza, right? It's a fucking pizza. Okay. So I call up, just told me to cut, just to call this place. And uh, I called up the, it rings like 11, 12 fucking times and nobody picks up. So my guy, you know what? They're probably busy. No big deal. I got an hour. I'll get there with an hour and a half before, right? I get a goddamn cab. I'm driving over there. Cab driver goes out. Just to let you know, this guy's kind of like the pizza Nazis, like, like the, like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

Speaker 12:         01:32:09       So I show up and I walk in. Lo and behold, the place is packed, but I see this little two top gets up, waitresses cleaning off the table, she walks away. So I go over and I sit down, get re order the pizza, I'm checking out where people are ordering of getting excited is what I'm trying to tell you. And then the waitress comes over, she's like, um, were you over in the waiting room next door or did you just like walk in here and sit down? And I was like, um, I just came in and sat down. She goes, yeah, I'm, you have to like fight in, um, next door. You know, those people, everything's, everything's a question you have to like sign in next door. And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well, how long is the wait? She's like, well, I can't really like say it's, you know, it's kind of busy at that point. He's like a quarter of, I go, well, I gotta show at eight to quarter to 7:00 AM I going to have time to order a pizza and eat it? She's like, yeah, no,

Speaker 7:          01:33:09       now.

Speaker 12:         01:33:12       And um, and then that's when my blood starts fucking boiling because I realized what I just walked into. You know what I walked into? I walked into the pizza version of pinks, hotdogs out here in fucking La, the pizza version of Magnolia Bakery in New York City or that fucking place. We get the hot dogs in Chicago,

Speaker 7:          01:33:36       you know,

Speaker 12:         01:33:38       hour and 15 minutes to make a fucking pizza. You can't do that. This guy sitting here acting like, you know, like he's making some sort of gourmet for now. I'll tell you right now, that's my overrated for the fucking week. Standing in line at any restaurant. These, you know, the, the, the breakfast place in your neighborhood, your girlfriend's like, oh my God, the stuffed French toast is to die for and you stand there and fucking line, never worth it. It's never worth the hype. Okay? You learn anything from this podcast other than I'm an ignorant asshole. Don't ever stand in line for fucking food. Okay? And less some, there's a natural disaster. The places flooded in this. They're scooping out fucking pea soup. You know when you're putting it into your baseball hat, then you'll stand in line. Soup kitchen. You stand in line, but don't stand outside these fucking places. It's stupid. It's never worth it. You know fancy restaurants. You don't stand outside. You call up, you make a fucking reservation. But I'm not standing out there like I'm waiting to fucking

Speaker 7:          01:34:40       okay.

Speaker 12:         01:34:41       Do they even make goddamn sense? You know what I mean? He's fucking people in New York. They stand outside for 90 minutes for a cupcake, for fucking cupcake. It's gone in three seconds. You know it's going to Piss me off. Is some people in Portland. Okay. They're actually going to figure out what pizza parlor I'm talking about and then they're going to tile. Tell me, dude, it's totally fucking worth at these low self esteem Douche bags who just allow themselves to get totally treated like absolute fucking shit for pizza. Yeah. Sorry, I can't make you a pizza within an hour and 15 minutes. Well, you know what? Fuck you and your fucking pizza. What do you think about that and your number one God damn rating. I've got a pizza hut. Eat their fucking slop.

Speaker 12:         01:35:26       You got to kill him. He is that. I know. I'm going to have to go back. I have to try it. People hyped it so much. That's what I'm really mad about is I know as much as I just fucking talked about that shit, I'm going to have to go back down and go get it and for all you guys wondering, yelled at Magnolia. It's, it's a great cupcake, but it's not that great. It's not that great to have to stand there and listen to that awful conversation. Now, if people driving by looking at you, trying to figure out what are they standing in line for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:35:55       You know

Speaker 12:         01:35:57       it's the president. They're doing a book signing. Is there a porn star there was going to blow you at the front of the line. Can I raise the stakes for something funny within the last seven minutes? All right. Fuck this. Fuck this podcast. Here we go. Why don't I nominate some youtube videos for the week? Everyone. Um, I have a ton of them and I'm going to make the bold rex Ryan statement that I think pretty God damn soon, if not already, the Mlm podcast.com is going to have the best fucking youtube video collection of youtube videos. All right. I mean, cause you guys are on the cutting edge. A lot of these videos that you guys send me, they only got like, you know, 10,000 to 40,000 fucking hit. Some of them have like a hundred thousand or so like that and even a few with a million. But if they're really funny, I don't give a shit, but I think that we're on the cutting edge of some shit.

Speaker 12:         01:36:47       Like here's two that I found that, you know, only, you know, in the tens of thousands of hits. So I'm assuming you haven't seen them. Uh, look up a prank of the century. This woman puts on a mask and scares the shit out of this other woman and, and it's, you gotta watch it, it's fucking great. And then piss off pissed off. Cat freaks out. Look up that one. And we got a lot of people. You guys like violent shit. I'm trying to categorize them now. And by the way, the MM podcast is the official fan page. There's the Monday morning podcasts. If you don't have to, you know, it's a pain in the ass to go on youtube and try to find six different videos, right? Typing it in and all that shit. You're going to get caught. You're at work, you're not supposed to be doing it.

Speaker 12:         01:37:33       But if he just subtly type in the MLM, podcast.com and nobody fucking looking, all of them are going to be right there. And you can watch one after another, you know, or you can make it last the whole fucking day. You can even drink that five hour fucking energy and just start screaming at your screen if you want. It's all up to you. Um, so anyways, uh, here's a couple of for you fight fans out here. I will start slow, look up a choke slam. Um, I hope that's the name of the fucking video. This is referee reffing a fight in this choke slam. Look it up. All right.

Speaker 12:         01:38:11       Um, here's kind of a cute one. Says little girl boxer. It's actually a boy. His name's pretty boy. Bam, Bam. And you've got to look at this fucking kid. This kid would kick the shit. Just imagine this kid fighting another fifth grader. Um, and this is the most insane one. Boston Street fight guy with bat does damage Boston Street fight guy with bat as in baseball bat does damage. Um, what else do we got? Summer discourteous, something ridiculous. Swollen in south Philly. It's a guy walking around like he's got a fucking hard on having conversations with people. Sort of an old bit. I've seen it done before, but this guy does a great, um, wrestling fans. We got two for you are much your man on Coke and uh, ultimate warriors. Confession is absolutely fucking brilliant. You got to look at that one. And uh, Oh, more violence office worker goes insane.

Speaker 12:         01:39:14       Second Angle. Never. Natalie, there's some new footage. Uh, what else? Oh, this is a great one. Look up the turtle, man. This one might be my favorite. This guy's missing all these front teeth. And when you find out how he's missing his teeth, it's just one of the great stories that he just alludes to it. It's fucking awesome. It's just this redneck who just fucking catches turtles. And, uh, I, I swear to God, I would pay admission to sit on the side of the pond and just watch this guy catching turtles. It's fucking hilarious. And I actually getting into covers, we were talking about the worst covers of all time. Here's a great, one of the best covers I've ever seen just as far as being creative. Look up a stairway to heaven, the Beatniks, that's all one word, B, e. A. T. N. I. X. It's fucking cool as hell.

Speaker 12:         01:40:06       It's really fucking cool. They do stairway to heaven the way the Beatles would do it. It's really fucking, I dunno, it's really creative. Um, and speaking of movies, here's one for you is, uh, I got in this conversation with somebody on the Internet. They sent me an email and they were talking about how, uh, you know, they're not married yet, so they're kind of hanging out with people who are younger than them so they get a little bummed out when they make references to movies that nobody's seen before. So, uh, he started showing him some of the classics, like the dirty dozen and that type of shit. And he asked me, you know, what are some of the great fucking movies, uh, I should recommend with then let it to like music and that type of shit. And uh, here's a new topic for is do you guys have like songs?

Speaker 12:         01:40:54       You must have these, these fucking songs that the second you hear him, you can't hear the song without thinking of the movie. You know what I mean? Cause you do here, I'll give you a classic fucking example and uh, I think even the broads will know this one. Did I get rid of it? I had it all fucking cued up. I really am the worst. Can I ever do this? This is why I started off in fucking radio and then my career quickly ended because I would do the whole beginning. You're listening to 6:40 AM WEC be a broadcast service. The fucking whatever the fuck I used to say. Hang on a second. Let me get to youtube. God dammit bill.

You know what this is like is when you fucking, someone just told you what their name is and then somebody you know comes walking in and you go to introduce them and you have no fucking idea who they are. That's how I'm speaking right now. All right. What, what movie does this remind you of? Instantly?

Speaker 6:          01:42:42       Come on.

Speaker 12:         01:42:43       You know what? You know the movie, right? I know. Most of you know though. Even the broads, we'll get it. Come on. You know this. I'll wait for the breakdown. I'll wait for the breakdown of it. Where the hell is it?

Speaker 6:          01:42:57       Where the hell was it? I had this whole fucking thing queued up. This part right here. You don't remember this

Speaker 14:         01:43:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         01:43:10       I haven't did the sound effects. Remember that reservoir dogs, when he cuts the fucking dude's ear off. I used to love that God damn song and I couldn't listen to it for 10 years cause every time I fucking heard it, I just thought about Marvin Nash getting his Goddamn ear cut off. God. Stop. Stop yelling at him. Fucking what a, what a great piece of acting by both of those guys who ever played Marvin Nash and, uh, Mister Blonde. I can never remember people's fucking names.

Speaker 12:         01:43:44       Yeah, we'll call him Vince Gilligan, I dunno is fucking date. And I want to fuck that. I forget his name. You know, most guys to play psycho would act like a fucking psycho. How they think a psycho supposed to act, you know, and just how fucking Cami was. You know, that's what's really fucking scary. Somebody cut in your ear, I've gone and act like a fucking maniac. You'd almost start laughing halfway through it. Like, is this guy mocking being crazy? But it's the calmness with which he does it. Here's another one for you. These are really easy for like guy movie. So I need some more, more suggestions. I'm actually going to disguise this one. I downloaded this song because of the movie and I didn't realize that this fucking Irish dude babbles telling some fucking story for 20 minutes before they get to the part that I actually recognized. Uh, let's see if you can guess this one. Here we go. What movie

Speaker 11:         01:44:34       goes to where the does with Joyce and lettuce,

Speaker 12:         01:44:43       right? You're like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 11:         01:44:54       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         01:44:55       I didn't, I didn't want to get blood on the floor.

Speaker 11:         01:45:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         01:45:02       mine, you know it.

Speaker 11:         01:45:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         01:45:06       hello audio. Tion that's a Donovan singing a Atlantis. That was from a, the Billy bad scene. When they start kicking the shit. Fucking Billy bet. Is there anything better than that fucking camera angle when they're doing that? Pointing up at Robert De Niro's character. Jimmy just fucking kicking him. Rick flair. Couldn't do fake kicks better than Robert Dinero. You know, he just sitting there kicking him.

Speaker 12:         01:45:37       See, this was bad. Billy batts was a made guy with some real grease balls. Shit. We did what we wanted. We were wise guys. Right? What's the last one I got here? So I, I, you know, as usual, you know, whenever people ask you these questions, I can't end up, I can't remember them. Um, let's see. Here's one for you. This is actually an interesting one that's really fucking upset. This is one from a movie that the dude ended up selling. This is from cool hand, Luke. All right, for those of you have seen cool hand Luke, if you haven't seen cool hand Luke, you've got to fucking watch that movie. All right. And basically the guy who did the score, uh, wrote this song. There's a scene where they have to tar this road and, uh, Paul Newman's character, you know, rather than just sitting there being like, this is a miserable fucking job. He gets them all amped up that it's supposed to take all fucking day, but he gets these guys so fucking amped up. They just, they just fucking, they just, it's like they took five hour energy and before they, they're just flying down the fucking road and they're all laughing, having a great fucking time. And they finished the road and they actually have an afternoon off. Right?

Speaker 8:          01:46:50       So it was like Paul Newman's way of saying fuck you to the, to the, to the, to the screws. Is that what they called them back down to the, to the guards. Right. So they had to have this music. So they, this guy wrote this score for this scene. Uh, but the problem was it was perfect for the movie, but the problem was years later he sold it or I don't know how far along he sold it and it got played so much in this other shit that it actually kind of fucks up the movie. This is, this is the score. This is going to be for some older people to actually understand this is the music that they had for the ta. It's called tar sequence. When they, when they tar the road and they ended up selling, the guy ended up selling the song for something else. Here it is just listening to this shit. Ah, you suck. God dammit. Fuck the, see. This is why I got out of rain. I used to do shit like that on the air. That would be the worst break ever. I am the fucking worst. I want a great intro. I gave that song. All right, here we go.

Speaker 4:          01:47:55       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:47:56       this is the tar in the road. Totally makes sense. Florida. Good evening and welcome to the six o'clock news. It was a four car accident. The mother fuckers sold it to every six o'clock news station. This was the classic with you fucking old like me. Anytime the fucking news came on, this is the fucking song that they played. This is back when, when they actually had fucking journalists telling you what the corporations wanted you to know.

Speaker 4:          01:48:51       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:48:51       good evening. I'm Jake Johansen. Why did I say Jay? I'm a your, I was, that's how fucked up my brain is. I was trying to think, uh, Chet Curtis. I was like, well, I can't say I can't say Chet. That's an actual fucking name. I don't name names. So then I'll go, I'll go with Jake. And then for some reason I don't, it just got crossed up and I said, Jake Johann's I gave Jake, Joe answered a fucking shout out the best God Damn Comedians the last fucking 20 years from my money.

Speaker 4:          01:49:20       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:49:20       So anyways, yeah, it's called out of the tar sequence. So that one actually doesn't remind me of the, the, the, the fuck. That's a reverse one. I actually watched the movie and I'm getting into that scene. And then I think there's like all of a sudden I'm going to start listening to the news. So Jesus Christ, that was, that was probably the worst debut of any segment. But you knew, you got to admit you were definitely into it, right? I know you guys have suggestions. Can you help me out? All right.

Speaker 12:         01:49:48       I'm fucking burned out with this fucking podcast trying to get ready to do other shit and I'm just, you know, look at me. I'm fucking supporting Nazis now. Is that what I'm doing? Is that I'll fucking tired. I am doctor Laura. You're not a bad birthday. Fucking moron. All right. Here's one for you. You know what? I'm going to actually do one. I'm going to do one here for it to try to make peace after my doctor Laura a Dr Laura comments. Here we go. Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've got to get a secretary for this shit. All right. Where the fuck are we? Yeah, I fucking hate youtube. I don't want you douchebags doing the fucking thing. I want the actual guy. Everybody doing a fucking remix. Wait, hang on. Hang in there.

Speaker 6:          01:50:45       Yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:50:47       there it is. There we go. Alright, now this one's mainly going to be for, uh, the people that I offended last week, last week, uh, with a fuck is it? Come on now. All right, here we go. Here we go. This isn't going to remind, this isn't going to remind you of a movie. This is going to remind you of a TV show. What show was this? Hang on. What's the last one? Come on. Wait a minute. You fucking cunt. I didn't hit pause. Did I? Hang on. All right, this is going to remind you of a TV show. What TV show.

Speaker 12:         01:51:49       I somehow missed that one that came out. That is a, that's the Carlton Dance. I think I was too old for that one. I kind of tapped out with sitcoms after, uh, after why happy days and I wanted the chairs. I started boozing and actually believed cheers. You know, I believe that, you know, there was a bar like that and you come in and just being an alcoholic was like funny and fulfilling. I guess there was the sadness. He completely avoided his wife, Vera. And they never showed her. Um, anyways. You know what? I think that's going to be the podcast for the week. I have to, I got a tap out here, man. This, this, uh, this is trying to do one on the road. The day after I come off the road is really difficult. But, uh, fortunately things have been going well that I'm really busy, so I guess that is a good fucking thing. But you know, you get used to this comedian lifestyle. Well you just get the fucking hang out on a Monday. Now I actually, uh, I have shit to do,

Speaker 8:          01:52:46       which is annoying. It's not why I started being a comedian. I started to be a comedian, so I would not have shit to do, you know, wouldn't have a boss to tell fucking jokes, talk about my Dick and all 50 states and whatnot. Believe it or not, people, my neck stand up date isn't until September 9th, uh, at the comedy works in Denver, Colorado. Let's blow through some dates, shall we, by the way, uh, my tickets from my big theater show, my big theater tour that I'm doing, um, are on sale now. And, uh, I don't have the fucking link. Do I? Where is it? Oh, you go to live nation.com.

Speaker 7:          01:53:30       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:53:32       slash bill birth tickets or you just go to [inaudible] dot com you just click on any, any of the dates here? I'm going to be a, before the theater's tour starts. I mean also going to be as Zany comedy club in Nashville, Tennessee on September 23rd, 24th and 25th, one of, uh, one of my favorite clubs to play as is the comedy works in Denver. September 10th. Well, we got there September 10th, 11th. I have September 9th, 10th and the 11th. There we go. That's when I'm working there. Um, and then starts the theater shit. I'm going to be at the egg in Albany, New York. All you people in upstate New York always say, come to upstate New York, man. What the fuck? I'm going to be there. I'm going to be at the egg in Albany, New York. And then the following day I'm going to be at the center for the arts, Buffalo, New York.

Speaker 8:          01:54:26       Um, so I'm finally coming to buffalo. I'm actually hitting up a bunch of towns that I haven't been to in fucking forever. Uh, another city, a city. I've never done standup in a full set. I've done a guest set, but I've never gotten a gig out there. I'm going to be at the, uh, pantageous Pantages pan on ages, whatever the fuck it is, theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 22nd. And then the following day I'm going to be at the Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois on, um, October 23rd. And uh, any other ones? I got another theater date. On November 19th. I met the listener auditorium, Washington DC and a, the last theater I have is the more theater in Seattle, Washington on November 27th. Uh, you can go on to build bird.com and just click on the links in the lower left hand corner and you can check out all that bullshit.

Speaker 8:          01:55:32       And, uh, hopefully you'll come out to the shows. We'll see how it goes. Um, for those of you wondering if I'm just going to try to do theaters exclusively, um, no, I am not. I'm always going to be doing the, the clubs. I like the gym keeps you in shape. You come in, you do five, six shows, and then every once in awhile like, uh, like Buffalo, I don't know. They don't really have like a big time comedy club out there. No disrespect to anybody out there. So why you just come in, you try to do a theater. Same thing with Albany, you know, you start going to those really smaller fucking towns, um, or smaller comedy markets. And then that's just when, you know, the local comedy club is just the name, you know, like knee slappers, you know, um, God dammit, you're funny.

Speaker 8:          01:56:20       Who's ready to laugh, you know, they just got awful fucking names and uh, yeah. And they try to make you stay in a comedy condo. So that's why I always avoided those things. And I tried to stay in the bigger markets where I could, they actually put me in a hotel. I'm like, you, I lie like my comforts. So, uh, that's, that's the big, uh, my big tour coming up. And there's also a date there I missed in Columbus, Ohio. That's a club date, uh, November 12th, 13th, and 14th. And the fucking, you know, what kills me is how quick that's all gonna go by and another year is going to go by as well as, you know, by the end of that tour, um, football season will be three quarters over. How fucking sad is that? At least the regular season. Uh, who do you like by the way?

Speaker 8:          01:57:04       Anybody? Anybody for some predictions. How about we try to do some predictions and whoever comes to fucking closest gets a, an autograph and autographed DVD in my brand new DVD, let it go. Because by then it'll be the end of the season, I'll fucking said, Nah, I'm not going to do that. Then you won't fucking buy it. Right. I need to get you to buy it. Got, damn it. I suck at marketing. Anyways, that's a podcast for this week. It was very disjointed. I, you know, they can't all be gold. You know, even Peyton manning throws an interception every once in awhile and the file drive of a fucking Superbowl doesn't he? Well, doesn't, he actually saw what's his face? Uh, drew Brees finally getting some props. He came in there with John Gruden, you know, John Grooms got that unbelievable intensity that, that vein down the middle of his forehead. That's one of my favorite announcers out there, or color men, whatever the hell that guy's doing that guys to shift.

Speaker 8:          01:57:57       There's nothing better than an ex football player. And this is, this is provided that they have broadcasting skills. Someone either played the game, coached the game and that type of shit. And then you get the classic like broadcast or like a, like an Al Michaels or something like that to call the game. And then, uh, then you got your crew. Thank you bill. Thank you for breaking that down as if we didn't fucking notice. Why don't you just admit, Bill, that you're just babbling at this point to somehow try and make it to, Oh, I'm up to 57 minutes. That qualifies. I can tap out at this point. Don't you guys leave sometimes three minutes before five. So what did we learn this week? We learned that even on major topics like race bill really doesn't do his research. Uh, we learned that I had at why that I got some fat guy with the milky white ties to laugh at himself and he's lost 40 pounds.

Speaker 8:          01:58:51       So I'm not totally a bad guy. And uh, I guess from the troops come back, send them a drink or get, get, um, get him a blow job or shut your face. And evidently they, they, they feel the same way of the support. The troop bumper stickers as I do. You like how I'm taking one marine, his point of view and just saying that that's everybody's well, that's what the fuck I do. That's what I do. Support the troops. I always thought it was ridiculous. What are those bumper stickers that said, I support the troops? It's like, well, why wouldn't you? What do you, what are you rooting for the, the other team. So fucking obvious. I support the troops. Ice Cream tastes good.

Speaker 8:          01:59:34       I like babies. You know what? He's gonna have all kinds of obvious bumper stickers on the back of your fucking car. I saw a guy at a big heart on, on his, on his side of his house. It said love our troops. It just really gave me the creeps and every time I see it I want to fucking rip it down. Yeah, no, I, this other guy wrote me an angry fucking email all about the politics about sending the troops over there, you know? And it's just like, like he was fucking dropping all this knowledge, man, about what's really going on with the war man. You know, like, I don't realize, like I don't realize that shit, but I also realized that those guys don't determine where the fuck they go. All right. So I'll just try not to be a Dick, you know, pick up in a dick enough, haven't I?

Speaker 8:          02:00:22       I've gotta be honest with you. I have no idea what I said for the last 11 minutes, but all I know is I recorded it and you're listening to it. Okay. So who's worse? Me. You guys just shaking your heads right now. Who's really losing his mind? Well, maybe I am. Um, that's it. So I got it. I got like two, three weeks off on be hanging out. Can we go? I'm doing a lot of spots down the comedy store. If you're in Los Angeles, gotta be working out my shit. If you want to come down there and watch me bomb, lean on the mic, stand and stare at that. All weather carpet is, I work out my bits, uh, pop in down the comedy store and that's it. Thanks. Everybody wrote in and uh, and that is that. I'll talk to you guys next week.

Speaker 11:         02:01:20       [inaudible] [inaudible].
