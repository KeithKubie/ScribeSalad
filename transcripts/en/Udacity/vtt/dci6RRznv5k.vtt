00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.810
Let's compare firewalls with IDS.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.230
A network IDS performs
passive monitoring.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.930
That is, while the IDS is copying and
analyzing the network traffic,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.630
the traffic is continuing
to reach its destination.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.020
Traffic analysis can take
a lot of computing power, and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.460
therefore the IDS can be overloaded
by large body morph traffic.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.300
When an IDS is overloaded, it cannot
detect intrusion in a timely manner.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.408
That is, it fails to
adequately protect a network.

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:34.829
We call this situation fail open,
meaning that when the IDS fails,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.790
the network is open to intrusions.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.490
On the other hand,
a firewall performs active filtering.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.270
That is, all traffic must
pass through the firewall and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.310
the firewall performs relatively
simpler and more efficient analysis.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.130
However, it can still be overloaded
by large volume of traffic.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.490
When this happens, it will simply
not let the traffic go through.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.680
We call this fail close,
meaning that when a firewall fails,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.379
the internal network is closed to
the external network, and it is safe.
