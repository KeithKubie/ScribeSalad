Paavana Kumar:
"Ondine" by Maurice Ravel is from his suite Gaspard de la Nuit, and it's based on this

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.000 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
beautiful symbolist poem about a water sprite, an ondine, who falls in love with a mortal

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:48.069 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
man. And she describes her palace under water to him and asks him to come be king of her

Paavana Kumar:
castle with her. But when he says, "No," she laughs at first... and then she dissolves

Paavana Kumar:
into water and streams down his window pane.

Paavana Kumar:
I've really loved playing it because not only is the poem it's based on so beautiful, but

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.200 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
the music itself just has this fluid motive that keeps on going. It's like this beautiful

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.420
Paavana Kumar:
symbol that always stays with you.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.030

Paavana Kumar:
I started playing the piano about... [laughs] 18 years ago... 18 years ago, now. And

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.140 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
when I first started to play, I soon realized that when I was hearing pitches, I would know what

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.300 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
they were without having to play them on the piano or having a point of reference.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.070 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
And then even later I realized that the way I was doing that was to connect each pitch to

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.229 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
a color. So I would hear a pitch and I'd think "green" or "pink." And that's how I would think,

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.229 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
"Oh, it's an A," or, "It's a C." And I realized that is actually a condition called "synesthesia,"

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.660 position:94%
Paavana Kumar:
which is an intuitive relationship between different senses.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.300 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
There are two main pieces on my program: One of them is Gaspard de la Nuit, of which "Ondine"

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
is a movement, and the other is Chopin's third piano sonata in B Minor.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.200 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
And I chose these pieces partly because of their technical range, but really more than that because of their

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.630 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
emotional range. I remember the first time I heard these pieces in concert, and I was

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.630 position:98%
Paavana Kumar:
really struck by the spectrum of emotions that I was experiencing in such a short period of time.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.420 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
You know, some of them were emotions that I couldn't even name at the time or that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.000 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
I didn't think I would feel in everyday activities, everyday life.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:02.300
(music)

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.879 position:97%
Paavana Kumar:
And that is something that I have been working towards bringing across to the audience when I perform at my recital.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.300
