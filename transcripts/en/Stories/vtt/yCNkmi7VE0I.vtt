00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.165
DAVE HAZLEBECK: So this is
the dried algae product.

00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:04.420
After we dry it, we
grind it up into powder,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.760
and then we extract
the oil out of it.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.920
That oil is then refined
into diesel fuel or jet fuel.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200
The fuel that we're producing
is exactly the same,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.741
in terms of performance as
gasoline, or diesel, or jet.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:19.740
It's just a lot cleaner.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.114
And I think the
big difference is

00:00:21.114 --> 00:00:23.220
that all the other
biofuels, you're growing it,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.400
you're just getting biofuel.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.983
In this case, every
gallon of biofuel,

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:28.660
you get 10 pounds
of food with it.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.800
NARRATOR: Dave Hazlebeck is the
CEO and founder of Global Algae

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.040
Innovations, a San Diego
based company growing algae

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130
on a farm in Hawaii,
which he thinks

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.405
could change the landscape
of food and oil production.

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:44.830
DAVE HAZLEBECK:
There are studies

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.090
that show with algae
grown to replace

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.890
a large percentage
of animal feed,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.450
you could actually solve global
warming to a large extent,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.851
simply by doing that.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.100
Second thing is that the
leading cause of global water

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.780
impairment is runoff
from agriculture.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.630
When we grow algae,
there's no runoff.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.340
All the nutrients are
captured in the algae.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.600
Environmentally is
for deforestation,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.520
the leading cause
of deforestation

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.360
is for food production.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.760
With algae producing
40 times more per acre,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.810
that means if we
plant 1,000 acres

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.440
of algae, that's
40,000 acres of crops

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.040
that don't need to be planted.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.610
But the work here we're
doing is extremely important.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.935
The world desperately
needs algae biofuels

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:25.150
and algae protein production.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.200
It's going to have a
big impact economically,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.100
it's going to have a big impact
on reducing poverty, improving

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
standards of living,
because it'll create jobs

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.140
and revenue in rural areas.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.360
That's why I decided
to start this company,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.290
so that it could happen
quickly, because it's

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.842
too important for the
world for it not to happen.

00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:48.570
So we're standing
right now in one

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.460
of our larger algae raceways.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.590
This is about a 2 acre
raceway, but these raceways

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.830
can be scaled to much larger.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.520
We look at making individual
raceways up to 200 acres.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.960
And this is next
to a power plant.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.660
That's unique,
because that allows

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.730
us to capture carbon dioxide
and avoid that discharge,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.470
and reuse it.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.594
And that prevents it from
going into the atmosphere

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.770
and causing global warming.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.310
If every power plant had
an algae farm next to it,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.830
it could potentially solve the
global warming issue entirely.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.790
NARRATOR: In simple terms,
algae is fairly easy to grow,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.310
and it's able to flourish
just about anywhere,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.980
whether it be freshwater,
seawater, or brackish water.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.810
All it really needs is a good
supply of carbon dioxide,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.170
and plenty of sunshine.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.390
And while the location of Global
Algae Innovations in Hawaii

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.600
makes sense, Hazlebeck's team
come across some obstacles

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.135
trying to scale the process up.

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.760
DAVE HAZLEBECK: You can see with
all these tremendous benefits,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.635
you know, why aren't we doing
it now, and why hasn't it done?

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.010
The problem is
that the costs are

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.870
too high throughout
the entire process,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.490
and so it really requires
hundreds of innovations

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.270
throughout the entire process
in order to reduce the cost,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.820
because it's about
10 times too high.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.320
NARRATOR: The problem associated
with large scale production

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.900
has put similar companies
out of business,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.330
but the approach of Global
Algae Innovations is different.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.550
Instead of seeing a roadblock,
Hazlebeck and his team

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.480
saw the potential to
innovate solutions.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.980
DAVE HAZLEBECK: Our approach
was different in that we looked

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.275
at every single step,
developed a model,

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:15.260
we looked at the costs.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.050
And the other thing is we didn't
give up on any critical issues.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.920
So a gallon of oil
when we started

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.870
would have been
about $30 a gallon.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, with the innovations we've
made over the last few years,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.770
we're down in the range of
$2.00 to $3.00 a gallon,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.590
as a projected cost.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.250
Now, we're not there yet from
the standpoint of production,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.180
but depending on how
fast we can get to scale,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.570
we could potentially
have solutions

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.970
within the next few years.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.260
And that's really exciting.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.130
It'll change the
geopolitics of the world.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.600
A lot of the
reasons we have wars

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.120
are because of fights
over resources.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.810
And by creating a more
equitable distribution,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.770
with countries being
able to make their own,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.204
it should lead to a more
stable and peaceful world.

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:58.120
NARRATOR: Algae biofuel
could potentially

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.640
be used in engines
that we already have,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.320
and there would be no additional
infrastructure needed,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.493
as it would be available
at your local gas station.

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:10.840
DAVE HAZLEBECK: As we
develop technology,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.660
we plan to partner
with lots of people

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.850
to have it expand
in other areas.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.990
We're not trying to be the
only company doing this,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.640
because we're in it
because of the impact.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.899
I always talk with
our team, what

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.982
they're doing is going to
change the entire world,

00:04:21.982 --> 00:04:25.110
in the sense of both the
protein and the oil production.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.740
Because both are
desperately needed.

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.730
NARRATOR: To hear more
about the science of algae

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.211
being made into biofuel, check
out this episode of D News.

00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.460
SUBJECT 1: Biofuels like
these are energy sources that

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.570
come from living matter.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.190
They stand apart from fossil
fuels which, by the way,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.910
also come from living matter,
because biofuels are made now,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.560
not over millions of years.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.870
SUBJECT 2: Takes a lot of time
to grow a whole field of corn,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.730
but to grow out a lot of
algae is a lot faster,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.025
and it's just a plant.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.900
