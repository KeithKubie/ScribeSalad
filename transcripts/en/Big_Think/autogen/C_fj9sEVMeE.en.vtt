00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.000
So, a few years ago I went to go and investigate
rumors of hippos, rogue hippos running riot

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.690
in rural Colombia.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:23.390
Now hippos don’t naturally live in South
America, they are from sub-Saharan Africa;

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.039
but these hippos had been transported to Colombia
by Pablo Escobar.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.100
So Pablo Escobar, like many powerful men,
fancied himself as a bit of a Noah’s Ark,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.590
a kind of twisted Noah, in fact, and he wanted
to build his own menagerie at Hacienda Napoles,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.390
which was his ranch where he controlled his
drug empire in between Bogotá and Medellín

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.430
in the Andes in Colombia.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.820
And legend has it that he gathered together
this menagerie by stealing a Russian cargo

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.750
plane, flying it (or having it flown) to Africa
where he loaded it up with loads of illegal

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.899
wildlife, and then had to get it back to Colombia
before the tranquilized animals woke up.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:22.740
And amongst this cargo of creatures was one
male hippo that was nicknamed el Viejo, and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.930
three females.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.140
And he transplanted these enormous beasts
into a pond at his Hacienda, and they loved

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.140
it.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.520
It turns out that Colombia is a hippo paradise,
because actually all hippos really want is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.520
some nice shallow water to wallow around in
and plenty of grass to eat, and Colombia has

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
plenty of that.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.990
It also has no other hippos, so no other competition,
and no natural predators.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:03.139
So the hippos flourished in their new paradise
and very quickly the four became eight, became

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.590
12, became 16.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.120
And what happens with hippos is you have a
male who has a harem, so every time one of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.780
el Viejo’s sons reached sexual maturity
he would boot him out of the pond, and that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.069
young male hippo would then head off in search
of hippo love elsewhere.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.260
Now of course in Africa this is completely
normal and hippos head off from their family

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.409
group and young males will go in search of
hippo love and start their own family.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.819
But of course in Colombia there are no hippos
out there.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.110
So these males, these young males are being
spirited away from Hacienda Napoles in one

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.010
of the many, many rivers in that part of Colombia,
which acts like sort of hippo superhighways,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.420
so they’re sort of pinging them out into
the countryside and then they arrive and they

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.720
can’t find a mate.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.489
They’re quite cantankerous beasts at the
best of times, but these are sort of frustrated

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.659
horny male hippos desperately looking for
love where there is none.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.599
I went to Colombia to investigate this story
and visited one of these rogue males that

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.010
had installed himself in a pond next to a
kindergarten.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.530
I met the kids from the school who told me
that they no longer liked to bathe in that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.840
particular pond—too right!

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.019
And one of them told me about how his grandmother
had been chased by the love-lorn beast for

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.000
quite some time earlier in the week.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.580
So they’re kind of running amok basically.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.290
So what do you do with this situation?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.359
You’ve got rapidly multiplying hippos—and
the extraordinary thing about what’s happening

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.249
in Colombia is it’s changing their behavior,
because in Africa you have this very fierce

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:11.309
dry season, which puts the brakes on hippo
reproduction.

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:19.090
So I think they reach sexual maturity, I can’t
remember it’s like five or seven years let’s

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.930
say, but in Colombia they were reaching sexual
maturity significantly earlier and having

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.060
babies every year instead of every two years.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.080
So they were multiplying at this much faster
rate because they didn’t have the same constraints

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.430
on them that they do in Africa, so you’ve
got a bit of a problem; you’ve got a massive

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.250
invasive species.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:49.030
Now with most invasive species the solution
is to get rid of them, because basically they

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.830
upset ecosystems and so they need to be removed.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.200
But the problem with hippos though is that
they star in Disney movies.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.330
So there was this sort of rogue male, and
the first one that they put down there was

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.990
a public outcry, and so they had to come up
with a different plan.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:21.990
And I met with the Colombian vet who was in
charge of implementing the radical plan B,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.590
which was the castration program.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:34.300
So Carlos Valderrama was given the onerous
task of having to castrate one of these rogue

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.430
males.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.699
Now, this I’m sure you can appreciate is
a job that takes a fair amount of cojones

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:50.840
because castrating a wild male hippo is no
easy task; it is actually unbelievably complicated.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.599
First of all hippos, because they’ve got
so much fat, they’re really hard to anesthetize

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:03.389
(because the anesthetic dissolves in the fat)
so even though they’re enormous you have

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.180
to get the dosage right.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.360
They also when they’re nervous they go into
water.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.669
You don’t want it to pass out in the water
because it’s going to drown.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.320
Then when you finally manage to anesthetize
– Carlos said to me he had – and also

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.030
they’re really, really, really aggressive.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.530
Carlos told me that he had decoy cowboys and
all sorts of shenanigans just to get through

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.070
the anesthetic stage.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.090
Then the clock was on they had a certain amount
of time in order to complete the castration.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:41.740
Now, the thing about hippos is – the closest
relative of the hippo is the whale.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.050
They have internal testicles that are buried
underneath about eight inches of skin and

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.160
fat.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.530
Not only that, but hippo testicles have a
habit of wandering about when under threat.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.139
They can move her as much as eight centimeters.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.879
So you’re looking at a blank canvas behind
which there’s a moving target.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.380
Now, when you get in there they are the size
of cantaloupes, but just getting to them and

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.919
working out where to make the incision and
then managing to grab hold of these moving

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.819
melons and getting them out was quite some
task.

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:27.789
Apparently it took him about six hours and
it cost well over $100,000.

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:34.941
I think they’ve managed to do one more subsequently,
but they’re never going to - it’s too

00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:39.180
difficult they’re never going to be able
to castrate all the males.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.540
That’s just not going to happen.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.240
What I think is going to happen is we’re
going to have a new sub species of Colombian

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.340
hippo before too long, “Hippopotamus Escobarus.”

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.169
Because that’s how you make a new species:
you put it in isolation from its parent species

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:01.420
and it evolves into a slightly different species
and that’s what’s going to happen.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.000
The hippo has always been quoted as being
Africa’s most dangerous animal.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.230
Now I did some digging around and I’ve never
really been able to find out the source of

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:16.530
this fact, but I can tell you having been
charged by a hippo myself they are really,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.430
really, really dangerous.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.789
I mean they do kill people.

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:24.370
They are extremely aggressive, they move really
fast.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.039
The male that we went to go and film, the
rogue male in Colombia, we got a little bit

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:35.360
too close and he was in his pond and he came
toward us with such velocity that there were

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.950
barrel waves coming off his nose as he hurtled
through the water.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.279
It was pretty terrifying, I can tell you.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:50.810
So the thing about hippos is they are they’re
really dangerous— so they’re dangerous

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.180
to humans in Colombia who don’t understand
how dangerous they are.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.640
Because culturally they haven’t grown up
alongside hippos, they’ve seen them in Disney

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.950
films they think they’re chubby and cute.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.700
Carlos told me that this is a real issue.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.570
But also, of course, they are ecosystem engineers.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:14.760
One of the things about hippos is that they’re
big animals, they churn up a lot of vegetation.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.730
They have the power to reshape their environment
and it’s this reshaping of the environment

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:28.190
that was most alarming to Carlos Valderrama,
because he was worried that other native species

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.300
that share the rivers like manatees, for instance,
would suffer with hippos being around.
