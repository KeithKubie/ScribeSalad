00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.370
Charles, can you figure this out?

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt; Yes, I believe I can. So, the first thing to note is that because we're

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470
sticking with just 0 and 1, and not

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.420
all possible values in between, we're thinking about

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.920
a binary function. And the output is also

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
binary. Which makes me think of Boolean functions,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.050
where zero represents false and one represents true,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.290
which is a common trick in machine learning.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; Alright, so and let me,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.670
let me mark those on the picture here. So

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.409
we're talking about the only four combinations are here. And

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.330
you're saying in particular. That we're interpreting

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.190
these as combinations of true and false.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.930
&gt;&gt; Right

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.360
&gt;&gt; False, false true false, false true and true, true.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.040
&gt;&gt; Exactly and if you look at it the only way that you get

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.970
something above the line is when both are true. And that is called and.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.290
&gt;&gt; Also take conjunction. Right, exactly so,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.790
exactly so. So this is, even though

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.270
we're, you know we're setting these numerical values but it actually

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.180
is, gives us a way of specifying a kind of logic key.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.460
&gt;&gt; Right. So here's a question for you Michael. Could we do or?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.540
&gt;&gt; That's a very good question. Or looks a lot like And in this space, it,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.550
it seems like it aught to be possible. So let's let's do that as a quiz. .
