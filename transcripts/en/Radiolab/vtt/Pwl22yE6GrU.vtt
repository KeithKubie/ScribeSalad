00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.950
That incredibly talented young boy with soon a talented young man composing

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.440
symphonies can cello. Hello? Hello, Robert. Hi. Hi. Let me, well,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.700
what was that? That was, that was a, the mist of classical music, public radio,

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.290
basically interrupted by science journalist and author David [inaudible]. Hey,

5
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.690
are we all here now? Now we're all here. And you are [inaudible].

6
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:24.470
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080
And actually what happened here is I called David because he has just published

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.580
a book which contains an idea that I found so surprising.

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.490
I had not known of this. It's kind of a,

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.860
a smack in the face to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Yes.

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.180
There have been a number of excellent at Gu that have been added to Darwin's

12
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.740
theory over the last 150 years or so since he published it.

13
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.790
But this is, this is more than that. This is a big fricking asterisk.

14
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.040
And to explain what that means, David told me a story about a month.

15
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.240
<v 1>Yes, the pepper lock. It lives</v>

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.730
<v 0>in forest of central England among other places.</v>

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.440
And during the 19th century,

18
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.800
this moth was white with little flecks of black on it and these moths,

19
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.190
sometimes Ruth's done the on the trunks of trees and the trunks of trees

20
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:23.800
surrounding Manchester, England were sort of light colored.

21
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.320
So when these moths roosted on the trees,

22
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:30.070
they were pretty well camouflaged a light, slightly peppered moth.

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.440
Lana light slightly peppered the tree trunk.

24
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.480
So they were protected against predation by birds. And then

25
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.150
the tree trunks changed. Why did the tree trunks chain,

26
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.150
<v 2>okay,</v>

27
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.190
<v 3>because of the industrial revolution,</v>

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.610
because of the smokestacks of Manchester,

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.400
we're turning out a lot of cold smoke.

30
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.750
They were burning coal for all their industrial processes and there was this

31
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.160
set, this cold sweat that was coming out and it was blanketing the trees in the

32
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:05.630
nearby forest. So the tree trunks turned black

33
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
<v 0>and the moths were no longer camouflage cause the Mazda were white.</v>

34
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.570
You wouldn't want to be a white moth sitting against the coal black tree because

35
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.690
then you or your herd would know exactly where you are.

36
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.073
<v 1>Right.</v>

37
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.300
<v 0>What happened? The moths turned black.</v>

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.530
Oh yes, sure. This is the, this is the classic sort of evolution story. Exactly.

39
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.510
That story was told, it was a,

40
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.070
became a textbook example of Darwinian evolutionary change in,

41
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.110
in real time. And the way that happens,

42
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.440
we were told is that once the trees turn dark,

43
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:46.960
the moths changed by incremental mutation. Like, you know, uh,

44
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.060
thanks to some tiny little mistake in some moth gene,

45
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.520
the black spackling got bigger,

46
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.100
uncertain moths and those were a little bit more protected.

47
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.780
And then the spackling got a little bit bigger.

48
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.670
The morals got a little grayer and then very,

49
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.230
very slowly over generation after generation, after generation of mouth,

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
they get a little bit darker and then darker still till you end up eventually

51
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.360
with a population of Martha turns completely black.

52
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.400
That's the classic story, except,

53
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.380
except that we now know that's wrong. It turns out it wasn't slow.

54
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.680
It didn't take generations and generations.

55
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.760
The sequencing of the moth genome has revealed a stretch of DNA,

56
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.030
22,000 letters of the DNA code that suddenly jumped into these moths from

57
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:38.720
somewhere and in a flash,

58
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.750
the moths changed from white to black pretty much in one day.

59
00:03:44.211 --> 00:03:47.130
Really a white peppered moth mom,

60
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.320
all of a sudden producer's an all black baby. Wait,

61
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:54.330
so how did that, how did that happen?

62
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.450
They said a whole packet of jeans just got shoved in to this new from where did

63
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:00.481
it come from? Well,

64
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:05.481
David says it probably jumped one part of the moth genome to a completely new

65
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.760
part. Different part. But what that means of course, is that living things,

66
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.730
it turns out can change way faster than we thought.

67
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.820
And therefore evolution can happen much faster than we thought.

68
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.590
And on top of that, David says,

69
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.890
scientists have now discovered is even stranger kind of super fast change that

70
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.370
takes things will be about parents and offspring, individuals, species,

71
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.000
things we've counted on for years and just throws the whole mix into the air.

72
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.980
Yes, infective heredity, infective heredity.

73
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.630
What is, what is that hardly enough to explain this to you? I have to go back.

74
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.051
Hello,

75
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.580
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab or talk to an earlier version

76
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.120
of us because it was 11 years ago,

77
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.110
I think that we made a show called a so called life life. Not as we knew it.

78
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.400
Oh God, that's true.

79
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.200
And in that show we dealt with an early sort of more primitive version of this

80
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.170
very question. So I'm just gonna play you a few minutes of that,

81
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.660
of that earlier show. Well, let's talk about life. You and I,

82
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:05.350
and we'll come right back.

83
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.470
When you look around in the world at living things and I say, Look Dad,

84
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.410
there's a cat next that is a dog and that's a tree.

85
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.010
And you noticed that those things of course are different. Yes.

86
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:19.540
And later when we go to school we learn about phylums and categories like

87
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:20.510
kingdoms and stuff.

88
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:23.470
So you think about the nature of those differences and then you're taught about

89
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:27.400
struggle and competition. Darwin species.

90
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.420
There is a new theory that's being talked about that turns all of that on its

91
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.850
head. I heard it first from this guy. I'm Steve Strogatz.

92
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.390
I'm an applied mathematician at Cornell and the story he told me,

93
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:44.200
which is based on analysis of DNA in very tiny organisms, microbes,

94
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.980
is that once upon a time he says, life began with a very primitive,

95
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.550
very simple collection of cells and these cells

96
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.410
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

97
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.100
<v 0>these cells. It appears that as you, when you go back</v>

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.590
<v 5>far enough, there is a kind of rampant sharing of molecules.</v>

99
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.870
It's a kind of orgy in which there are no well-defined species or organisms and

100
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.670
I can give you my genes and you can pass. We're a colony

101
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.240
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.890
<v 0>I totally remember recording that.</v>

103
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.070
The Kumbaya thing that certain wheeler who was there at the start,

104
00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:21.820
he produced this piece years ago. Yes. I think it was just us around the office.

105
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.760
How many? Yeah, it was a commune. What? What does that mean? He's like,

106
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.140
it was a commune. What do you mean? What is it meaning?

107
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.340
I know what it means in the 60 screen. Love sense, but what does it really mean?

108
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.100
What? Oh, what cells are exchanging is chemicals,

109
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.490
chemicals that give them talents and traits. Genes. Here's what happens.

110
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:37.324
I did this with [inaudible]

111
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.210
<v 5>in our, in our ancient puddle,</v>

112
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.050
we in Darwin thought that life might have begun in a warm hello.

113
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.870
Let's say that you and I are both cells. Okay?

114
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.140
So once upon a time there was you and a puddle and I'm in the same puddle as you

115
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.040
and it gets a little colder in the puddle. So we should all get sick,

116
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.790
but you don't get sick. You have some kind of accidental talent.

117
00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.490
You can handle cold water. I'm shivering.

118
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.280
Describe again what happens in at this point, in the glorious old days,

119
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.660
my membrane that is I, I'm a cell, I've got a membrane, I've got my outer layer,

120
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.730
maybe a little bit porous and maybe, whoops, I'm on my jeans just leaked out.

121
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.640
Okay? We're not talking sophisticated organisms and maybe your poorest too.

122
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.440
And Oh wow. You just absorbed some of those genes. So now we both have this,

123
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:26.620
we both got and you both go.

124
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.980
And if I've got this gene now I can survive cold water because it's part of me.

125
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.160
And if I bump into you now it's part of you.

126
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.830
So now this Steve Jean has become a Robert Keane,

127
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.580
which has then become a Jag gene and we're doing it over and over and over and

128
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:43.780
we're getting really, um, come here.

129
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:48.920
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

130
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.490
<v 0>it sounds so friendly. I actually don't think of,</v>

131
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.550
sounds like people shout out all these exchanges.

132
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:59.960
This gene swapping was not intentional. It's not purposeful sharing.

133
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.710
That's Nigel golden fell MSC medical physicist at the University of Illinois and

134
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.670
he and his colleague Carl woes did the science that led to some of these kind of

135
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.010
goofy ideas, not me sort of saying, hey,

136
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.900
I'm going to just help out my buddy over that.

137
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.270
Here's a couple of genes and I think you'll find handy.

138
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.280
It's not something like that. You can still,

139
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.710
if we're swamping jeans so much and you know,

140
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:20.440
you're giving me yours and I'm going to be nine. Yeah.

141
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.080
What does it actually mean to be me? Yeah.

142
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.590
So much of me is spread around. Well, it would be very weird.

143
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:31.250
Imagine a world in which for a while I have your nose, God forbid,

144
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.360
and then I get my nose back. You'd have Steve's hair.

145
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:37.950
Then Steve would get my ear. Then he would get your nose.

146
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.290
Once you still having a lot of exchange, I'll take your chin. Okay?

147
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.060
And you can have my allergies and then you start even asking what does it mean,

148
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.890
um, to be a speech. You can have my love affair with doubt.

149
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.100
You may not even be able to talk about individuals.

150
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.030
<v 6>Yeah. If the mixing is good enough, we're all kind of indistinguishable.</v>

151
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.100
So identity would be very strange in this ancient world when all of the concepts

152
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:06.680
that we take for granted in it

153
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.760
<v 5>biology become more and more nebulous as you get further and further back to the</v>

154
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.550
root of the origin of life. Take for instance Charles Darwin.

155
00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:20.350
What Nigel was really saying is that for the first billion years of life with

156
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.660
the beat you to be everything that Darwin teaches,

157
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.380
all that stuff hasn't happened to no borders, no individuals has no species.

158
00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:30.460
That is Darwinism evolution as we now understand it. That's an interlude

159
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.750
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.260
<v 5>and the real story of life. It's only what's happening now.</v>

161
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.290
What you got back at the very beginning was a whole bunch of cells slopping

162
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.870
genes, swapping advantages, swapping disadvantages,

163
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.670
and this kind of goes wild time.

164
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.360
What tremendous explosion of diversity in a way that life has not seen since

165
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:49.194
then.

166
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.023
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

167
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.183
<v 6>until</v>

168
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.640
one dark and terrible day 3 billion years ago,

169
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.510
as interpreted by Freeman Dyson, famous physicist and delivered here.

170
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:14.740
Now our friend, the mathematician Steve Strug as heres d one evil day,

171
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.390
a bacterium anticipating Bill Gates by 3 billion years.

172
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.023
Refuse to share.

173
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.070
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

174
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.590
<v 6>refuse to share. Ooh,</v>

175
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.280
the first bad guy is this cellular bill k two who decides that I've,

176
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:34.790
I've got an innovation that I don't feel like sharing or possibly by found a way

177
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:38.000
to keep my membrane from leaking. That is,

178
00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:41.390
I'm not going to be a sharing soul anymore. And why?

179
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.060
I mean what made that one little cell decide to stop sharing?

180
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.130
That's a good question. We don't really know,

181
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.690
but what we do know this is was maybe the most dramatic moment in the history of

182
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:51.530
life on earth.

183
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.920
This transition from the age of, well,

184
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.150
if you want to call it the age of sharing to the age of selfishness and

185
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.030
gradually once one creatures stopped sharing,

186
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:05.940
pretty soon the others followed and then more and more did the same thing.

187
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.200
And now for the first time in the history of life, finally we get Darwin.

188
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:14.100
Now we get species. Now we see differences. Yes,

189
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:18.730
it's the age of identity of individualism. It's also the age of, of Stacey.

190
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.130
Things change, but they change much more slowly in any great thing. You know,

191
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:26.880
like you are a bat and you've figured out sonar. I, I don't have sonar.

192
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.660
I can't get sonar. I mean, I used to have sonar,

193
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:33.840
like you're at a little electric fish that lives in the muddy waters of the

194
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:36.330
Amazon. You don't care. It's totally dark. You can see,

195
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:40.140
because you can see with electricity, I can't see with electricity.

196
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.090
If I'm in the dark, I'm bumping my head.

197
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:45.970
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.840
<v 6>did we really use Bill Gates as a stand in for like selfishness? Yeah. Well,</v>

199
00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:50.141
I mean,

200
00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:55.020
at the time he was the ultimate corporate horrible that we did that [inaudible]

201
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.200
faith foundation. That's right. He's actually gone over to the,

202
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.270
to the light side instead of the dark side. Yeah, right, exactly.

203
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.850
That is a Steve Strogatz.

204
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.610
I ended up calling him up just to chat them through some of this stuff and he

205
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:11.320
told me that he actually heard this whole idea from a lecture by physicist

206
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.320
Freeman Dyson. Dyson is just a great writer and a great speaker.

207
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:16.090
And he had this memorable line in there,

208
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.490
at least memorable to me when he started talking about,

209
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.430
I mean he phrased the whole thing in terms of sharing,

210
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.260
which may be why in that previous episode we had that Kumbaya us saying games.

211
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.040
That wasn't my doing by the way. No, no, that was, that was us. But anyway,

212
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.680
so then he said, but one evil day,

213
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:37.120
some primitive bacterium anticipating bill gates by 3 billion years,

214
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.140
refuse to share its DNA. And then, oh, so that was, that was Freeman Dyson.

215
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.330
Yeah, that was his joke. So anyway, it was,

216
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.150
I was sitting there in this lecture and he started mentioning a certain

217
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.530
biologist, Carl woes,

218
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:50.710
and he talked about him in such glowing terms as one of the great

219
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.730
microbiologists of our time. And I'm so you,

220
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.630
so you hadn't heard of Carl woes I had before? No, I had not. So I,

221
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:01.210
the reason I was asking the show,

222
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.330
we actually mentioned cro was because I remember it, you know,

223
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:07.870
I don't know if you guys know there's not, but so that was 11 years ago, right?

224
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.970
I was actually an intern at the time.

225
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.170
I had just showed up and I was tasked with tracking down Carl woes.

226
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.400
Who's the guy that we mentioned?

227
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.180
I sort of like the grandfather of this idea and he was like, oh, huge,

228
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.190
huge deal in science. Um,

229
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.510
he discovered this whole other branch on the tree of life, the archaic. Oh,

230
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.660
he's Mr RKM, which was a pretty big one. It's a whole nother,

231
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.200
whole nother kingdom of, yeah.

232
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.960
It got 'em on the front page of the New York Times and I had to track him down

233
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:37.060
and it turns out he was like the,

234
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.130
just the classic curmudgeonly scientists.

235
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.400
It took me 20 emails to get him to even like just let us talk to his

236
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:52.150
collaborator, Nigel Goldenfeld who we talked to in the show, but whatever.

237
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.560
It is a very strange, he was a very curmudgeonly man, but you know,

238
00:13:56.561 --> 00:13:59.740
like he came to like me and I actually spent some time with him,

239
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.280
his office and we, I can do the curmudgeonly thing if I need to, you know,

240
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:04.420
we share some

241
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.710
get skills. Yeah. I could, we pass some curmudgeonly jokes back and forth.

242
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.190
And um, anyway, uh, after he heard the piece,

243
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.490
he wrote me the most seizing scathing email about and nothing,

244
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.490
there was nothing in it about like, you got this wrong. It was just like,

245
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:28.270
you made a cartoon of my work, which honestly now listening back,

246
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.620
I agree with a little more than I did at the time. Yeah, yeah. But he was like,

247
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.330
I'm a serious person. And you've made this into like a dog and pony show.

248
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.180
And I was like, I was brand new. I was, and it hurt. I mean like I was,

249
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:46.260
I felt really, really bad and he's like, you've disrespected Nigel.

250
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.030
And so I wrote, I wrote to I or called up Steve Maybe and said, Oh man,

251
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.650
you know, this happened. And Steve was like, Hey, listen, forget them.

252
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.910
Don't worry about it. Oh, I love Steve. Yeah. I don't know. I, I,

253
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:01.670
it sounds like something I might've said to you. Do you remember having that?

254
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.330
I don't remember.

255
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.510
I honestly don't remember having that conversation and that was like, oh,

256
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.580
I needed that so bad at that moment.

257
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:11.630
My career for someone like with Steve Stature to like balance it out in that

258
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:15.200
way. Yeah. Um, yeah, I think, I mean, it's a little bit funny that he would,

259
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.280
to me a little surprising that he wouldn't have gotten what you were trying to

260
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.020
do or what we were trying to do.

261
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.060
I think our playfulness in an attempt to be clear and to communicate and to

262
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:29.330
attract people who might not otherwise listen to a story about something called

263
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.890
horizontal gene transfer.

264
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.630
He should have gotten that because he himself in his writing was very playful.

265
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.890
He was very fun to talk to. I mean, he was absolutely, Carl was,

266
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.600
was very playful and irascible and grouchy and charming,

267
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.560
but he would certainly tell you what he thought. Yeah, yeah. This,

268
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.140
this guy has a great character and David Quam, and it turns out in his new book,

269
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:52.490
talks a lot, a lot,

270
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:56.320
a lot about Carl woes and this revolution in our thinking,

271
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.070
<v 0>talking about the evolution of life or the end of his life.</v>

272
00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:03.810
He started to think that he was more important and more profound than Darwin.

273
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:07.950
He got a very negative attitude toward, toward Charles Darwin Darwin's birthday.

274
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:12.510
He'd said that he sent out a note to everybody here that this should be a day of

275
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.940
rage. That's right. Yes. Yes. He did that,

276
00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:19.890
but I guess I'm wondering is now that you spent a book's attention on him,

277
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.980
do you feel that he has some right to say that the picture we have of how life

278
00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:31.731
changes needs serious amending or is he just barking because he's a barker?

279
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.740
No, he, um,

280
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.880
he was entitled not to think that he was greater than Darwin,

281
00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:42.600
but to think that what he discovered was very,

282
00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:47.601
very damn important to understanding the full history of evolution on earth.

283
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.000
What has happened all throughout the history of life on the planet 4 billion

284
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:55.010
years and is still happening today.

285
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.290
This is where we are now.

300
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:10.620
Jad Robert Radiolab,

301
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.620
and we're back with David Coleman and this new new to us way of changing life,

302
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.700
infective heredity, these leaping genes,

303
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:25.701
these transfers of DNA that create new genetic possibilities in a blink.

304
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.291
Turns out,

305
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:32.130
David told us that the swapping of genes that we talked about in the early

306
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.580
history of life, that's still happening today, correct? Yes.

307
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.870
Bacteria all around us. Those bugs are trading genes.

308
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.850
Genes are jumping sideways from one kind of bacteria to another,

309
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.670
even in our belly is even in our guts.

310
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.980
So let's say that you go to ranch on a vacation and you touch something there

311
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.000
and then you lick your finger. I don't know. I couldn't, you know, or oh,

312
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:57.834
you eat something,

313
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.610
not new bacteria from that European food is going to enter your stomach.

314
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.710
And now, not only do you have some new bugs in you,

315
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.930
but they can start trading their genes with bugs that are already in you. Yes.

316
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.490
What would that mean? Like physically?

317
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:14.130
Like would it look like boop out the cell wall?

318
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:18.180
And then they found that there were several different mechanisms for this.

319
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.530
Two bacteria would create a little pipe, a little sort of penis,

320
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:26.040
like thing between them and genes would be transferred,

321
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.340
but jeans were moving sideways under other circumstances too,

322
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.640
from dead busted open bacteria into live bacteria is it acquire this new trait

323
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.250
at once, immediately, immediately in an instant, a new population,

324
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.080
even in new species of bacteria can possess all of those.

325
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.600
Gradually laboriously acquired adaptations that, um,

326
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.160
another strain of bacteria evolve these bugs.

327
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:57.570
They don't have to wait around for generation after generation to pick up random

328
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.320
mutation.

329
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.280
Our bacteria inside us can pick up whole new abilities and new tricks all at

330
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:04.590
once from their new neighbors. So for instance,

331
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:09.591
one kind of bacteria could pass genes for antibiotic resistance to another

332
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.200
completely different kind of bacteria.

333
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.060
So say you've got somebody sitting in a hospital with a staphylococcus

334
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:18.894
infection,

335
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.100
some of the bugs inside have figured out how to resist penicillin.

336
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.280
When that bug then comes out of that human and it gets left on a table in a

337
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:30.630
hospital and somebody else gets infected by it,

338
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.930
then they will also have an infection that is resistant to penicillin.

339
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.610
But if say they happen to be in the hospital,

340
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.020
sick with something totally different,

341
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:42.840
they have a different kind of harmful bacteria doing trouble giving them

342
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:43.674
trouble,

343
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.920
then those old bacteria in them can learn in a flash from the new bacteria.

344
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.710
Now everybody's penicillin resistant and that's why the,

345
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.600
that's why antibiotic resistance is spreading around the world.

346
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.190
So lickety split that is really important. That's a,

347
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.310
that's a global health crisis in the World Health Organization among others have

348
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:04.930
called that a global health crisis.

349
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.260
Tens and tens and tens of thousands of people are dying from that.

350
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.150
So that's really important and urgent.

351
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.300
But the most important part of this whole subject is not practical.

352
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.930
It's a matter of understanding, understanding the history of life,

353
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.880
understanding who we are, quite literally, because according to David,

354
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.370
the way we are, we humans are,

355
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.570
has been affected by visits from other creatures. Genes. Yes,

356
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.620
8% of the human genome is viral DNA.

357
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.980
80% of the DNA has come into humans or into our mammal ancestors sideways.

358
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.061
But here's how that goes.

359
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:47.410
Like you're sitting around and a virus gets into your bloodstream and it travels

360
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:49.810
into one of yourselves, and when it's in there,

361
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:53.350
it drops some of its DNA into your DNA.

362
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.330
And if it gets into an ovary, cellar,

363
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.620
sperm cell will then it will be passed along. So we,

364
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.150
8% of our genome has come to us that way from these viruses.

365
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.830
Some of that is just gobbledygook in our genome,

366
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.740
and some of it is instructions. In other words,

367
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:11.260
genes that are still performing functions.

368
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.420
And one of those creates a boundary layer between the human placenta and the

369
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:21.280
fetus. An absolutely necessary essential boundary layer.

370
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.000
Now this is came at a total shock to me because after all,

371
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:29.940
the thing that's really special about mammals is that female mammals, uh,

372
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.810
or at least placental mammals, um,

373
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.830
carry young around inside the body and the history of life.

374
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:38.740
This was a completely new development. I mean, you think about fish,

375
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:41.680
you think about reptiles, like the dinosaurs, you're thinking about the birds,

376
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.050
what are they doing? They have kids, they lay eggs.

377
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.310
But now we get a creature that comes along and figures out how to keep the baby

378
00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:50.960
growing inside it. Of course, if it does that,

379
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.970
it has to make sure that it's immune system doesn't attack that baby and the

380
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:57.490
baby has to be able to poop and stuff like that and get things out.

381
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.310
So there has to be some kind of boundary.

382
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.450
And how did we get that good idea when we got that good idea from a virus long,

383
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:07.090
long ago, some ancient mammal ancestor got a virus,

384
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:10.960
got infected by a virus and that virus introduced a new gene,

385
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.550
the original virus. It created an envelope or wrapping around the virus,

386
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.880
but it has been adapted to create a different kind of wrapping,

387
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.440
the wrapping that goes around the fetus and inside the placenta so it carries

388
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:27.580
nutrients in.

389
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.200
It protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and it is allowing waste

390
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:37.201
products from the fetus to be carried away and disposed of by the mother.

391
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.250
I mean to assist potentially the origin of mammals and within this being the

392
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:45.410
without, which if we hadn't gotten this talent from viruses,

393
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.960
we wouldn't have gotten the kinds of mammals that we have now that that layer

394
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.620
could not exist and does not function without this viral gene telling it what to

395
00:23:57.531 --> 00:24:01.130
do without this little bit of of virus DNA,

396
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:06.410
you can't be a mammal, you can't be a mother mammo and you can't be a child.

397
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.150
In light of this stuff, and for me,

398
00:24:15.151 --> 00:24:19.950
in light of five years of studying it and following it and interviewing people

399
00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:20.784
about it,

400
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:26.390
the categories that we apply to the world categories like individual and species

401
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.420
now appear more blurry. The edges are fuzzy.

402
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.040
Is there such a thing as a human individual or is it a human,

403
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.980
a composite of other forms of life.

404
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.210
And what this says is that we are composites. We are mosaics.

405
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.443
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

406
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.570
<v 0>It's humbling and it's,</v>

407
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.490
and it's fascinating to think of yourself that way. Like for me,

408
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:53.881
David.

409
00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:58.881
So it turns out that David is not just the descendant of a Norwegian father and

410
00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:00.210
a German Irish mother,

411
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.400
but he's also viral and bacterial and who knows what else.

412
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.900
And I find that, um, I find that thrilling.

413
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.683
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

414
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.310
<v 0>uh, I'm,</v>

415
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.580
I'm grateful to all those other limbs on the tree of life for the things that

416
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:17.414
they've given us.

<v 3>thanks of course to Steven Strogatz of Cornell University, um,</v>

419
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.830
who is always willing to jump back into the ponds where he longed since I'd left

420
00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:35.740
and thought he'd gotten dried off from David Commons.

421
