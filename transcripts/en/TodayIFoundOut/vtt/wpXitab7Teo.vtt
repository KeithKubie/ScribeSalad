00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.620
Black Friday

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.319
While it wasn’t called “Black Friday”
until the 1960s, and then not popularly called

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.360
such until the last two decades, retailers
have been trying to push people to shop the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.860
Friday after Thanksgiving since the late 19th
/early 20th century.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.440
Around this time, it was very popular for
various department stores, such as Macy’s

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.320
and Eaton’s, to sponsor parades that would
occur the day after Thanksgiving.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.650
These parades would typically be a major part
of Christmas advertising campaigns by these

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.650
stores.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.380
This, in turn, would ultimately result in
a lot of people going shopping after the parades

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.570
were over.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.039
Over time, this melded into a commonly accepted
unwritten rule among most major department

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.610
stores to hold off on their major Christmas
advertising pushes until after Thanksgiving;

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.579
specifically, to hold off until after these
parades were over.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.960
By the 1930s, the Friday after Thanksgiving
had become the official start of the Christmas

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.399
shopping season among the vast majority of
retailers out there.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.390
However, this tradition ultimately resulted
in retailers being unhappy with the length

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.610
of the Christmas shopping season on Novembers
where the last Thursday was the fifth Thursday

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.110
in November (Thanksgiving at that time was
always on the last Thursday of November).

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.550
Thus, with the strong encouragement of lobbyists
for various retailers, President Roosevelt,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.830
in 1939, decided to change the official date
of Thanksgiving to be on the second to last

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.430
Thursday in November, in order to lengthen
the Christmas shopping season as much as possible,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.450
with the hope that it would boost sales for
retailers and, thus, boost the economy.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.490
However, when Roosevelt changed the official
date of Thanksgiving to a week earlier in

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.640
1939, many people refused to change the date
they held Thanksgiving that year and mockingly

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.730
called the official government set Thanksgiving
holiday, “Franksgiving”.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.200
In fact, a full 22 states refused to go along
with Roosevelt’s date, which continued for

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.350
the next two years.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.140
Texas, on the other hand, decided to take
both holidays and held two Thanksgivings.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.350
In 1941, in order to fix the multiple dates
for Thanksgiving issue, congress passed a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.590
law, and later amended it, that for the first
time officially set the date for Thanksgiving

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.030
into U.S. law.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.840
The date they finally set, which Roosevelt
ratified, was the fourth Thursday in November,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.880
which would sometimes be the last and sometimes
be the second to last.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.429
In any event, the term “Black Friday”
wasn’t coined to describe the day after

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.849
Thanksgiving until the mid 1960s.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.230
Even then, it wasn’t a popular term nationally
until around the last twenty years.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.439
There are several suggested origins for this
name.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.780
The most likely origin, which is reasonably
well documented, is from Philadelphia police

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.340
officers, bus drivers, and taxi cab drivers
who dreaded the day after Thanksgiving due

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.549
to the traffic problems and the massive amount
of people out and about.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.010
One of the earliest documented references
of this was in December of 1961, where Denny

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.900
Griswold of Public Relations News stated:
“in Philadelphia, it became customary for

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.610
officers to refer to the post-Thanksgiving
days as Black Friday and Black Saturday.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.040
Hardly a stimulus for good business, the problem
was discussed by… merchants with their Deputy

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.549
City Representative…

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.780
He recommended adoption of a positive approach
which would convert Black Friday and Black

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.640
Saturday to Big Friday and Big Saturday.”

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.760
“Big Friday” never caught on, but over
the next decade, more and more references

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.540
can be found in various newspaper archives
of this particular Friday being called “Black

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.170
Friday” for this reason.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.550
In the 1980s, retailers, unhappy with the
negative connotations of what appears to be

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.760
the real origin of the term, decided to start
pushing that the actual origin was that most

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.400
retailers operated in a financial loss for
most of the year and Black Friday was named

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.510
such because it was the day of the year when
the retailers would finally see a profit,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.569
moving out of the red and into the black.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.769
This of course, simply isn’t true.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.310
While there are some retailers that depend
on the Christmas season’s profits to make

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.680
a profit for the year, most retailers see
profits every quarter based on the quarterly

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.650
SEC filings of those major retailers.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.969
There are also no references to this potential
origin predating around the 1980s and there

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.189
are numerous references to the previously
listed theory before that time.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.059
A lesser theory that is sometimes spread about
is that this naming came from the stock market

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.879
crash in late 1929 which kicked off the Great
Depression.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.109
In fact though, that event happened on a Tuesday,
not a Friday.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.230
The actual “Black Friday” stock market
scare happened in 1869, was in September,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.799
and had to do with gold prices, so in neither
case had anything to do with shopping or the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.729
Friday after Thanksgiving.

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.539
While we’re on the topic of Black Friday
myths, it should be noted that Black Friday

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.539
is not the biggest shopping day of the year.

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.800
In fact, it’s typically not even in the
top five, though has cracked the ranks a few

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.819
times.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.190
The real biggest shopping day of the year
is nearly always the Saturday before Christmas,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.780
except when Christmas falls on a weekend day,
in which case the biggest shopping day of

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.130
the year is usually the Thursday or Friday
before Christmas.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.780
Thus, the procrastinators seem to outnumber
the early birds.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.620
Bonus Facts:
• In 2008, Jdimytai Damour, a Long Island

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.030
Walmart temporary employee was trampled to
death on Black Friday when shoppers at Green

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.320
Acres Shopping Center, impatient with waiting
for the store to open, pushed against the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.449
doors to try to get them to open.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.320
Workers pushed back to try to keep the doors
from breaking, but ultimately the masses won

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.240
out and over 2000 people streamed in, trampling
Damour.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.639
The paramedics who arrived and tried to save
Damour were also trampled and seriously injured

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.479
by shoppers who apparently didn’t care that
there was a dying man lying at the entrance

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.310
of the store with paramedics trying to resuscitate
him.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.740
All total, five shoppers had to be hospitalized
at that one location and many more were injured.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.680
• As mentioned, the term Black Friday itself
was first used to describe a stock market

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.940
crisis on September 14, 1869.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.200
At the time, gold prices were almost solely
controlled by investors in the New York Stock

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.200
Exchange.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.590
Specifically, James Fisk and Jay Gould headed
an investment group that sought to control

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.450
the price of gold, at that time owning the
rights to nearly 50% of all gold circulated

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.970
in the United States.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.009
The one flaw in their plan was that the U.S.
government occasionally released gold reserves

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.440
for sale in order to regulate the price of
gold and keep paper money valuable.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.530
To get around this, the investment group recruited
President Grant’s brother-in-law to convince

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.850
Grant to appoint Daniel Butterfield as the
assistant to the Treasurer; Butterfield had

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.490
agreed that he would do his best to make sure
the government would not release any of their

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.349
gold holdings and would tip this investment
group off when the government was planning

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.689
on selling gold, so that the investors could
first drive up the price of gold and then

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.050
sell large portions of their gold holding
for profit before the government release drove

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.250
down prices.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.550
The problems started when this group was too
successful, driving gold prices up by nearly

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.210
15% in a single day at one point.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.539
This had a consequence of rapidly decreasing
the value of paper money.

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.330
When Grant finally realized what was happening,
he ordered the federal government to sell

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.930
$5 million in gold to counteract this group’s
efforts.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.380
Within minutes after this gold hit the market,
the price of gold plummeted resulting in an

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.800
investor panic, which ultimately caused a
huge stock market drop, ruining many.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.099
Interestingly, because Fisk and Gould were
tipped off the day before this government

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.139
release, they were able to sell off much of
their gold holdings to various groups.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.360
Fisk and Gould made a tidy profit while the
groups they sold to were ultimately ruined

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:14.610
the next day when the government gold hit
the market.
