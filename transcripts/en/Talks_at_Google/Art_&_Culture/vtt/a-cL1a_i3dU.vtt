MATT: Help me in
welcoming to the stage

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.460
three-time Grammy-nominated
composer and saxophone

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.260
player, the band leader for
David Bowie's Blackstar band,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.670
the one and only Donny McCaslin.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.161
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.149
DONNY MCCASLIN: Thank you.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.640
Thank you.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.140
MATT: Thanks so
much for joining us.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.750
DONNY MCCASLIN: Good
to see you, man.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.833
MATT: Please, have a seat.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.254
DONNY MCCASLIN: Thank you.

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:27.420
MATT: How you feeling today?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.290
DONNY MCCASLIN: I'm good.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.998
I'm good, thanks.

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:31.050
MATT: Beautiful trip
from Brooklyn out to--

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.924
DONNY MCCASLIN: Beautiful
trip from Brooklyn.

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:35.400
I've been home for a
couple of weeks now,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920
kind of decompressing
from a lot of touring.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.907
So taking the kids to
school a lot, making dinner.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.990
MATT: That doesn't sound
like decompressing to me.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.940
That actually sounds like--

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.330
DONNY MCCASLIN: Well, it's true.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.396
MATT: More recompression.

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:47.520
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah, it's
not total decompression.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.180
But the love of being
with the children

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.190
is carrying me
through the angst that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.709
happens when you try
to feed your children

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.000
and get them to school on time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
MATT: Who is more
unruly, the other members

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.820
of the band when
you're on the road,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.349
or your kids when
you're at home?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.515
DONNY MCCASLIN: Definitely
my kids when I'm at home.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:08.340
Yeah, because when
I first come home,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.870
they're really happy to see me.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.210
And then there's the
second day, which

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.550
is payback for when
I've been gone.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.740
And usually, that's
when my wife is gone,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.140
and I'm kind of
running the show.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.039
And there's just a lot of--

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.830
MATT: Welcome back.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.500
Here's the keys.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.166
Here's the kids.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.380
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.650
And then the kids are
giving me a hard time,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.640
because I've been gone.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.890
But it's good.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.720
MATT: So I want to go back.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.730
Your music career started
at a very young age.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.335
You were gigging on large stages
at the age of 12 with your dad.

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:39.210
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.710
Yeah.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.730
I started when I was 12.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.230
I was actually in a photography
class in junior high school.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.440
And I was not really
engaging with the class.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.260
And I found out that
it was the last day

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.060
that you could switch classes.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.450
And my best friend
from elementary school

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.070
was in beginning orchestra.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.190
So I just switched without
having played an instrument.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.920
And my father is a piano
player and a vibraphone player.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.317
And he had offered various
times over the years,

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:06.900
you want to take some lessons,
you want to take piano lessons,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.540
clarinet?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.490
I always said no.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.740
I was more into sports,
basketball and whatnot.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.750
But I got into the class.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.500
My dad asked me what
I wanted to play.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.110
And I said saxophone.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.580
And it was an
impulsive decision.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680
But looking back
on it, I think it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.740
was because the guy who
played in my father's band

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.920
when I was growing up was
a very charismatic player.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.040
He was a hippie, like
a tie-dye t-shirt.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.020
And he would play these wild
solos, sort of avant-garde.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.869
And it was this really--

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:39.410
I don't know.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.590
It was interesting.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.190
Growing up in Santa Cruz, it
was an interesting cultural kind

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.680
of environment to grow up in.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.470
And anyway, he was
very charismatic.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.990
I remember one time looking
into the bell of his saxophone,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.790
and it was like a
pool of condensation

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300
with a cigarette butt floating
in the middle of it, which

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.990
is kind of gross now.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.569
But as a 12-year-old, I was
like, man, that's really cool.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.860
MATT: The most jazz thing ever.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.735
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah,
anyway, so that was it.

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:05.190
It was saxophone right away.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.420
And then it was something
that I just started doing.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.210
I started practicing
a lot right away.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.840
And things went from there.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.340
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.010
Well, and it seemed to
progress quite quickly.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.870
I mean, through
even high school,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.690
you were already performing on
things like the Montreal Jazz

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.190
Festival.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.315
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:25.260
I was fortunate.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.390
Santa Cruz is a
relatively small town.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.706
But there was a high
school in the next town

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:31.830
over where my father lived.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.300
My parents were divorced.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.340
So I was able to use
my father's address

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.410
to get access to this
high school that had

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.920
an incredible band director.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.200
Name was Don Keller,
trumpet player

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.761
who had been best friends
with Bill Berry in the Navy,

00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:49.260
who was also a trumpet player
who played in Duke Ellington's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.130
band.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.990
So Bill had given
Don a copy of all

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.820
these different
Ellington charts.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.400
And this was at a time
when none of this stuff

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.640
was readily available for
high school or college bands.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.780
So I was in this small town, but
playing Duke Ellington's music

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.170
four, five days a week,
which was amazing.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.210
Then the Kuumbwa Jazz Center
had opened before that.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.279
It opened up in 1976.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.950
But the thing was,
bands would play

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.600
in San Francisco from
Tuesday through Sunday night.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600
And then they would come
to Santa Cruz on Monday

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.870
night and play the Kuumbwa Jazz
Center, the small nonprofit.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.310
But because of that, I was
able to hear Elvin Jones.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.230
That was the first concert I
went to when I was 12, followed

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.140
by McCoy Tyner two weeks later,
Art Blakey, Cedar Walton,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.955
Phil Woods, and the
list goes on and on.

00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:48.900
So I had access once a week
to these legends of the music.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.309
And then Santa Cruz
was just very vibrant.

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.350
There was a lot of music.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.880
I was in a salsa band.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.430
There's a large Hispanic
population in the area.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.760
So I was in a salsa band.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.590
All the major reggae groups
played in Santa Cruz.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.540
So I saw Jimmy Cliff, Peter
Tosh, Mighty Diamonds,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.121
Black Uhuru, Burning Spear.

00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:10.620
What else?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.630
Paul Jackson, who played bass
in Herbie Hancock's group,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.530
the Headhunters.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.585
He was living in Santa
Cruz at that time.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:22.650
And so I was like 15 or
16, and I was in his band.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.370
And he was playing bass
and Casio and singing.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.540
And it was really out.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.720
And the band was called
Surely Out, actually.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.840
But I was in that.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.750
And so just being able
to play all the time.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.520
And then having this sort of
green light with my father

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.230
to just come and
play with his band--

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.784
he played four or
five days a week.

00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:43.950
And I could just go after
school or on the weekends.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.470
I could stay there
all day and play.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.800
So just the sum total
of all that experience,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.910
it makes me think
of Malcolm Gladwell

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.910
and his book "Outliers."

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.576
I don't know if you
guys have read that.

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:55.410
But there's something in there
where he talks about the 10,000

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.570
hour thing.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.770
And I think that
was the beginning

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.330
of that accumulation of
time playing music, having

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.370
to deal with different
musical situations,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.970
being on the instrument
hour after hour after hour.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.450
And in a way, my first--

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.412
after Santa Cruz,
I went to college

00:06:15.412 --> 00:06:16.620
at Berkeley College of Music.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.300
And maybe I was a junior, and
I got invited by Gary Burton.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.800
MATT: Right.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.341
I was going to mention that you
hit the road with Gary Burton

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.190
shortly after.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.440
DONNY MCCASLIN: So this is
prior to joining his group.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.440
I was in a student group that
he led that did a jazz cruise.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.822
And I went to the rehearsals,
and I was nervous.

00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:36.030
I was just like, Gary Burton.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.904
And all the guys who
were playing in the band

00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:39.230
were all great.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.490
So I remember feeling
like I probably didn't

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.320
do so well in the rehearsals.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.870
But then the first gig, I played
up to my ability at the time.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.760
And I remember him
sort of reacting to it.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.740
And sometime later,
he said that it

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.742
was like it was a whole
other situation with me when

00:06:58.742 --> 00:06:59.700
I was on the bandstand.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.820
And I realized, well, that was
because I was so comfortable

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.970
having had all this
experience with all

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.100
these different situations.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.225
MATT: Yeah, the pedigree
and background that you've

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.120
listed out there,
it seems like it

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.070
would be pretty difficult to
hit you with a new person that's

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.560
going to put you on
edge or stun you at all,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.642
having grown up through
that list of names.

00:07:18.642 --> 00:07:19.600
It's pretty astounding.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.430
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah,
so it was great.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.090
It was great.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.720
MATT: So you did four
years floating around

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.010
with Gary's band.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.830
And then that ended up leading
you here to New York City.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.730
And I don't know
exactly the order.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.460
But at some point, you
either moved to New York City

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.195
and then replaced Michael
Brecker in Steps Ahead?

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:39.070
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.550
Basically, I had moved
to New York City.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.940
And the first year or so, I was
still playing a bit with Gary.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.680
That ended.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.030
And I was just freelancing.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.710
And I think I did a gig
with Eddie Gomez, who

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.010
was the original
bass player in Steps.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:59.700
And some sequence of events led
to me getting a call from Mike

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.630
Mainieri to join Steps.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.660
And this is like the early '90s.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.650
And there had actually
been a couple sax players

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.140
after Michael before I joined.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.330
But it was a big, big deal for
me to get that opportunity,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.640
because I was such
a fan of that band

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.470
and such a fan of his playing.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.630
And these solos he played
on some of these songs

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.090
that I was now going
to perform, they're

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.580
iconic solos I'd listened
to hundreds of times.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.910
So the thing was, ultimately,
it was a really, really

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.679
great opportunity, because
I had to find my own way

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.530
to play these songs, my
own way of improvising

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.840
on these songs that didn't
sound like I was trying

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.010
to sort of copy what he did,
which nobody could do anyway.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.050
But really, my generation
of saxophone players

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.970
were so influenced by him.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.050
So it was a great opportunity,
because it forced me

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.741
to just, like, OK, how
am I going to do this?

00:08:57.741 --> 00:08:58.740
How am I going to find--

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.850
what is my voice, and
how can I kind of develop

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.370
that in this
context where I'm so

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.350
influenced by the
original source material?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.510
MATT: Right.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.360
In that same time
period, though, it

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.840
wasn't like you were
only doing Steps work.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.140
You have, again, this sort of--

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.640
I want to say incestuous.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.590
That's a very good
term for what I

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.210
think the music world
in New York City

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.800
is and specifically with jazz.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.070
And it sounds like it holds
true for the West Coast as well.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.490
But this idea that everyone
kind of knows everybody,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.510
and the swapping and
sharing of players

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.610
is and was very
prominent at the time.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.640
You did a lot of
additional work--

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.070
folks like Gil Evans and
Dave Binney and Scott Colley

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.220
that you did a whole
collaboration with.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.710
Do you find that
collaboration is just

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.950
a natural state for you?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.956
How do you approach
that when you're

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:56.580
pairing up with these
other big players

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.746
to collaborate on something?

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:00.930
DONNY MCCASLIN: Well, I
remember, at one point,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.230
being here and kind of doing
my thing of floating around

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.390
from club to club
during the night

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.580
and hearing different
things, and at one

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.730
point seeing David Liebman,
who's a very famous saxophone

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.740
player and educator and very
influential voice in the music.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.370
And we were just talking.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.890
And he said to me like,
so, you got your boys?

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.115
And I was like, what do
you mean, Mr. Liebman?

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:26.380
But I knew what he meant.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.250
And did I have a group of people
I was meeting with regularly.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.077
And I didn't at that point.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:33.910
I can't remember when
it was-- probably just

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.230
when I moved to New York.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.150
But it got me thinking about
how important that would be.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.650
And in a way, I was just
kind of floating around.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.370
And then through a
sequence of events,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.780
I just sort of fell
into this group

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.650
of guys with David Binney,
Scott Colley, Jeff Hirshfield

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.480
on drums, some other guys.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.090
And that was kind of
it, because I remember--

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.270
I think it was I started
playing sessions with Dave.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.852
And we seemed to just be
musically compatible and then

00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:07.685
socially compatible.

00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.506
We're both from California,
both into sports,

00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:11.630
just got along really well.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.900
And that eventually played
on one of his records.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.370
And that was kind of how
this group came together.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.690
And then we were all young,
all just in New York,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.580
so we had time.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.460
So we would get together
two, three, four times a week

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.840
and workshop material,
like being in a band.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.730
I guess it was a co-op
in this situation,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.910
because we were all bringing
our own original music.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:40.040
But it was really a
great opportunity,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.630
because I started to hear
their individual voices.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.760
And then I started to
think about writing

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.830
for that aesthetic or
that kind of group.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.720
Because sometimes when
you're writing music,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.390
it's daunting just to sit
at the keyboard and be like,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.199
I'm going to write a song today.

00:11:58.199 --> 00:11:59.240
What am I going to write?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.740
And it's just this
huge playing field.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.280
But when you can
narrow it down like,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.410
OK, no, I'm writing
for this group.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.760
And, more so than that, I
hear the way he plays bass.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.190
I hear his saxophone sound.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.860
And then it helps
me to focus a lot.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.110
And I feel like sometimes
the most successful projects

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.310
or recordings that
I've facilitated

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.850
are ones where I felt that
strong sense of direction

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.850
and sound with the
personalities involved.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.970
So that was a
really great thing.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:40.040
And that group-- eventually,
we started calling it LanXang.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.070
And we did a lot of
touring, and just, again,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.260
hours and hours on
the bandstand, hours

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.480
hanging, listening to
music, talking about life,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.890
talking about music--

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.900
all that stuff really.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.420
I grew a lot through
that experience.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.970
MATT: Kind of staying
on the topic of New York

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.060
City and the jazz
scene in New York City,

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.540
jazz has been a
little bit protected

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.290
through time, in the sense of
as the mainstream sort of shifts

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.280
its focus, disco
just was destroyed

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.630
by the change of the times.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.030
But jazz has always been
this presence, especially

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.210
in cities like New York, where
it seems like there's just

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.590
a strong, tight-knit community.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.260
You do a lot of touring,
like you mentioned.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.100
But you also play a
lot here in the city.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.040
Do you feel that that's true?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.097
Is the jazz
community tight-knit?

00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:34.430
Is that what's keeping it alive?

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.160
Is that what's keeping it
going in places like this?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.080
DONNY MCCASLIN: Well, New York
City is really the epicenter,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.600
I think, for jazz music.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.890
It's not the only center, but it
is really the epicenter to me.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:55.220
And part of what keeps
it going is there are so

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.320
many great musicians here.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.140
Every instrument, every ilk--

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.530
there's just such a
high concentration here.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.930
And people getting together,
working on projects,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.730
and learning from
each other-- there's

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.360
just a lot of creative
energy around that.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.070
And I think also with the
intensity of New York City

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.330
and the pace and just the
struggles for survival here--

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.980
that adds another element
of intensity to the music

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.110
that I think is important.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.770
Certainly for me coming
from northern California,

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.590
growing up in that environment,
and now living here,

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.150
there's a big
difference culturally.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.233
MATT: Yeah, I can imagine.

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:39.170
DONNY MCCASLIN: And I
remember feeling in California

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:46.140
like the intensity
that I bring to music

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.840
or that comes out
when I'm playing music

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.240
doesn't really fit
here as well as I

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.590
think it'll fit in New York.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.850
And that's been true.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.330
Nothing against California,
but you come here,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.160
and I think there's
part of that struggle.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.750
That all plays into it.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.930
And then you have the
history here of how much

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.090
the music has developed
here over the years.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.930
And then you have
the fact that there

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.260
are people who come to New
York City to hear jazz music.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.312
There's a jazz tourism thing.

00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:18.270
Clubs like the Blue Note,
the Village Vanguard,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.730
they benefit from that.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:25.830
So I guess all those things go
into making this the place it

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.830
is for jazz music.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.160
And in terms of its
survival, I think

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.720
it's a big thing to answer.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.401
Part of it is that the music is
so much about self-expression.

00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:39.650
And I think that's something
that hopefully will never

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.120
go away.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.280
Obviously, other realms
of music are as well.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.730
But jazz, improvisation,
individuality,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.660
telling your story in the
moment from song to song,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.600
there's something very unique
about that in the music world.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.680
And I think that will
never die, because I

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.270
think that's connected to
men and women's humanity's

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.970
need for self-expression.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.470
And obviously, there's a lot
of different ways that happens.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.600
But for musicians, I
think that's something

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.109
that will never go away.

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:13.400
What else would I say about it?

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.460
MATT: Have you ever
struggled with--

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.840
you mentioned the pace and
the intensity of the city.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.420
Have you ever struggled
to separate from that?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.460
Like, you find yourself writing
more uptempo, intense songs.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.650
Is it hard to break
away and write a ballad

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.160
and calm it down for a minute?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.580
DONNY MCCASLIN: I would
say that yes, sometimes.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.060
In the end, I think I'm
most successful when I just

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.730
let the song be what
it's going to be.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.520
And that's the problem
is that sometimes--

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.490
I've been living in
Brooklyn for 23 years.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.250
And I remember at certain
points writing a song.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.590
And I remember, it was a ballad.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.250
And it was pretty.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.610
And I was thinking,
oh, shouldn't this

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.570
be darker, shouldn't
there be more angst?

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.790
MATT: It's not convincing me.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.790
DONNY MCCASLIN: There's
not enough wide intervals,

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.130
it's too--

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.109
and I was sort of
over-criticizing the work

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.359
instead of just letting it
be what it was going to be.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.790
And eventually, I was like,
no, man, this is the song,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.510
I just have to let it come
out this way and not judge it.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.269
So for me, it's
actually just been

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:21.310
trying to let the music
be what it's going to be.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.740
And everything else
takes care of itself.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.369
MATT: So all this
time in New York,

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.610
and this leads to
a few years ago

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.950
where you were contacted, via
mutual friend, by David Bowie

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.700
and asked to play
on the song "Sue."

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.090
And this then kicked off
the whole "Blackstar" saga

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.300
that's transpired.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.970
Can you speak to the experience
of meeting David Bowie?

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.120
DONNY MCCASLIN: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.650
So Maria Schneider is this
composer that I've worked with

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.570
for, I don't know, 14
years or something.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:58.050
And she was getting together
with David to work on "Sue."

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.250
It was a collaboration,
like him singing

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.900
with her band, which I'm in.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.260
So she was calling
me during that time.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.780
And I was just giving
her feedback on stuff.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.880
But at a certain
point, she said, yeah,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.570
I think he should do
something with you.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.620
And she played him
one of my records,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.170
which was called
"Casting for Gravity,"

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.640
and suggested it to him.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.632
And then I think suggested
it to him again and again.

00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.090
She was just telling
me about this.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.030
And I was like, wow, OK.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.127
But you never know what
was going to happen

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:35.210
with those kind of things.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.290
But eventually, they came to
hear us play at the 55 Bar.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.750
And later, she told
me that he had said,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.360
oh, I see that Donny's
playing here, let's go.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.980
So they came down together.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.730
I didn't meet him.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.180
I knew that he was coming.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.660
I actually didn't even
tell everybody in the band.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.930
I told Mark Guiliana,
who plays drums.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.240
But I didn't tell
the other guys.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.770
And then I saw him,
and then that was it.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.140
They were gone.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.090
But a week later, I had
the first workshop session

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.810
with Maria and a few
people from her band, David

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.450
and Tony Visconti.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.960
Dave is a longtime producer.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.910
So that's where I met
him for the first time.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.900
And so at that point,
I knew that he was

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.830
interested in doing something.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.570
But again, I didn't
want to think about it.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.110
I was just here to
work on this piece.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:33.830
And then I remember I arrived
early to the rehearsal space.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.966
And we were all there.

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:35.840
And we're setting up.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.520
And then David walked in.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:46.580
And it was remarkable, in a way,
now looking back on it, because

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.110
from that day and every
day after that that I ever

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.900
was with him, when he
walked in the room,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.360
there was just this
real presence about him.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.920
And I think part of it
was just that he was

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.210
really present in the moment.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.930
And you just felt him
taking everything in.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.420
It wasn't like he was sitting
there on his cell phone,

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.250
or he was disconnected.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.890
He was completely connected
with the environment in front

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.960
of him, and completely engaged.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.460
And that was something
that I really

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.020
came to admire and appreciate
about being with him was just

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.240
that presence.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.410
Anyway, so he was there.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.710
And eventually, he
came over to me.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.990
And we started
small-talking a bit.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.000
And as the day went
on, he eventually

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.732
asked me for my email
address and my phone number,

00:20:38.732 --> 00:20:39.440
which I gave him.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.270
And he emailed me.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.920
He emailed me the
next day, I think

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.690
it was, and sent over
a song and basically

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.500
was saying he'd love to
record the song with my group

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.100
and maybe two or three songs.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:01.840
And he said it--

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.150
and that was another thing about
him is his command of language

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.520
was really deep.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.370
He just said it in
the funniest way.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.489
It would be something
like, it would just

00:21:12.489 --> 00:21:14.780
be a dream for me to record
two or three songs with you

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.780
and your group.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.580
OK, that's-- I'm sitting
at home in Brooklyn.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.930
One of my kids needs
a diaper change.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.414
And I'm just looking at
that email like, wow.

00:21:24.414 --> 00:21:26.080
MATT: Screen capture
that, print it out,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.990
and frame it on the wall.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.989
DONNY MCCASLIN: Exactly.

00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:32.090
So it was really exciting.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.060
And then there was
another workshop session

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.910
with "Sue" maybe a
couple weeks after that.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.490
And then we recorded it
about a month after that.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:47.660
And at this point, he had
sent me some more music.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.450
And so that was kind of rolling.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.810
And in terms of "Sue"--

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.890
just kind of an
interesting story,

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.220
I thought, was we spent five
or six hours recording this.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.930
And it's a large ensemble.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:00.920
Maria's conducting.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.950
And David and Tony are
just in the control booth

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.647
the whole time.

00:22:06.647 --> 00:22:08.230
Again, he's just
taking everything in.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.600
And it's like a
nine-minute piece.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.960
So finally, we get it together.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.560
We splice it together.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.670
And then I was going to
improvise over the whole piece.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.080
But before doing
that, David was going

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.360
to put down what they
call a scratch vocal,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.580
which is basically
just having the vocal

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.620
there so that the
improvisers know

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.245
where it is, and we
can play around it,

00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:31.680
and so on and so forth.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.690
So he comes out.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.090
Six hours in the control
booth, he comes out.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:41.720
They put him in a little room,
clears his voice, maybe 30

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.080
seconds of singing into the
microphone to get his level,

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.700
and they roll the tape.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.830
Well, they press Record
now, because it's digital.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.200
But anyway, they record.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.510
And he sings "Sue"
start to finish.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.830
And I think they might
have, oh, let me just--

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.110
I think he might have punched
one or two things really

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.490
briefly.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.260
And then it was my turn.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.760
And I went, played.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.330
And then I played,
just thinking,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.495
oh, they're probably going
to a little blip here,

00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.692
a little note there.

00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:14.900
But I went ahead and just
played over the whole thing

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.220
a few times.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.080
Ryan Keberle did the
same on trombone.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.010
We did a little bit together.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.676
And that was it.

00:23:19.676 --> 00:23:22.030
I went off to a gig.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.710
So a couple months
later, I hear the song.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:32.940
And I'm sure it's his vocal
from the scratch thing.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.350
In fact, it was confirmed.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.319
But I couldn't believe it,
that he was able to just--

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:40.860
and if you're familiar
with that song

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.160
or if you have a
chance to listen to it,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.410
it's kind of a tour
de force vocally.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.520
He's really kind
of going all out.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.150
And so I thought that
was pretty remarkable.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:56.230
And then the saxophone solo from
start to finish, I was like,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.210
whoa.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.660
I just didn't expect it.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.826
MATT: Everything made it in.

00:23:58.826 --> 00:24:00.930
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah,
everything made it in.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.320
But that was something
that when it came time

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.080
to start working-- well,
when the "Blackstar" started,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.920
that dynamic repeated itself,
where he was singing with us,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.210
and then we'd get the
track, we'd get the take,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.820
and maybe we'd fix a bass and
drum thing if it needed to.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.150
And then he would go out,
maybe fix a vocal thing

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.080
or add some harmonies.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.620
But it all happened so quickly.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:33.520
And then we also really
had a green light

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.050
to just go for whatever
we were hearing,

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.346
add whatever we were hearing.

00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:40.220
MATT: I was curious to
talk about that, too--

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.970
DONNY MCCASLIN:
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.910
MATT: --in the creative process,
because I have had the pleasure

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.690
to speak with a few other people
who worked with David Bowie.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.390
And I've heard two
distinct things that sort

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:55.430
of channel themselves, one
being that when he has an idea,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.520
it's very clear to him
exactly what he's looking for.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.250
But then what
almost seems counter

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.890
to that is that he's
very good at giving

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.320
long leash to the people
that he works with.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.650
So I was curious, when you were
in the studio working with him,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:15.200
how much play did you have
versus how clear his ideas were

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.850
on what he was trying to create?

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.880
DONNY MCCASLIN: Well, I'd
say that the clarity was

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.560
in the demos that he sent me.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.067
And I wasn't sure,
as I had them--

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:26.900
when I had them and I
was listening to them,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.000
I wasn't sure like, well,
what's going to happen,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.800
are we opening
this up for solos,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.810
are we going to modulate, are we
going to experiment with form?

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.980
I just didn't really know.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.740
So I just tried to
prepare for everything.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.540
And one thing that
I did was I knew

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.660
that he was a fan of Stan
Kenton when he was growing up

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.740
and that he really
loved Gil Evans' music

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.180
and obviously was
a fan of Maria.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.600
And I was also kind of starting
to hear some different things

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.080
with the horn lines, like
some counterpoint, some orch--

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.900
I basically start to
orchestrate the stuff

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.390
for all the different
instruments I play,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.240
which is alto flute,
flute, clarinet, soprano,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.340
tenor, but just sort of making
this kind of horn section

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:19.840
feeling.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.548
Especially with the
alto flute, it really

00:26:21.548 --> 00:26:23.150
gives it kind of a brassy sound.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.800
It makes everything feel
bigger, like there's actually

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.230
a brass section in there.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.650
So I started doing that,
because I was hearing it.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.760
And I kind of wanted
to surprise him with it

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.530
and see what he thought.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.582
And so when we start recording
the first tune, I was like--

00:26:42.582 --> 00:26:44.165
and I added some
lines here and there.

00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:45.165
I was like, hey, I got--

00:26:45.165 --> 00:26:48.950
and he was totally
cool with it--

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.380
totally.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.240
And so I felt like
there was just--

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.590
I could go for anything.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.080
But that being said,
that clarity you

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.580
were talking about
in your question,

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.890
the songs provided
a lot of that.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.500
So it wasn't like
anything major--

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.834
oh, we don't need to--

00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:12.750
I guess what I'm trying
to say is essentially,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.670
the song forms that
you hear on "Blackstar"

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.950
are what he sent in the demo.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.050
And it's just us realizing that.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.340
And there's more horn parts.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.460
There's more keyboard
things happening.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:30.690
But he said various times
through the process,

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.280
go for whatever you're hearing.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.520
And Jason Lindner,
who played keyboards,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.110
he had nine keyboards
in the studio.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.570
So we were experimenting
with different sounds.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:43.997
And he was adding--

00:27:43.997 --> 00:27:46.080
I guess one thing is, I
remember at the end of one

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.380
day on the song
"Blackstar," David had left.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.480
And we were just
kind of wrapping up.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.129
And Jason was like, can
I just put one thing on?

00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:55.420
Tony was like, yeah, of course.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.500
And he goes out there and he
just doubled the bass drum

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.040
on the song ""Blackstar"."

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.357
Do-do, do-do, do, do-do--

00:28:03.357 --> 00:28:04.190
something like that.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.910
I can't remember
the exact rhythm.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.087
And that was the first song--

00:28:08.087 --> 00:28:10.670
I think that was the first song
that came out was "Blackstar."

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.960
Yeah, it was.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.040
You hear that right away.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.110
You hear the bass drum
and synth doubling that.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.780
It's a big part,
for me, of the song.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.950
And it was just this
end-of-the-day, oh,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.560
I've got one more idea.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.960
And then I think all of us--

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.375
Tim Lefebvre, Ben Monder, Mark--

00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.750
as we listen to
that record, it's

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.520
like, wow, they left everything
in there that we played.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.930
And I think that's one thing
that, for us, felt so wonderful

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.793
about hearing it was
we listened to it

00:28:41.793 --> 00:28:45.090
and it was like, that's
us, that's what we do.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.920
We hear the
interaction, all the--

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.540
it's all there.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.090
And I guess that was
really affirming,

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.530
because that's what he wanted.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.450
He wanted us to do our thing.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.010
And they left it in there.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.080
And it wasn't this,
OK, let's just

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.560
add like 20 synths
and a string section.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.720
Tony and David did add things.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.230
But it's so well
done, and it's so--

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.985
that's, I think, one of the
great things about the record,

00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:10.860
listening back to it.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.039
There's so many layers
of content in there.

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:16.080
And the way it works
together, the way it's mixed

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.140
together is really tremendous.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.030
MATT: When you guys were making
"Blackstar" in the studio,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.730
was "No Plan" a part of that?

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.310
Were these songs
that were recorded

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.320
at the same time, produced
at the same time that

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.550
just didn't make the record?

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.451
Or was this something that
came along after the fact

00:29:35.451 --> 00:29:37.200
and say, hey, we have
some extra material,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.982
maybe we should
realize this as well?

00:29:38.982 --> 00:29:40.440
DONNY MCCASLIN:
No, it was all part

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.010
of the "Blackstar" sessions.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.070
Yeah, in fact, "No
Plan" is the song--

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.216
MATT: So there was
very much a plan.

00:29:47.216 --> 00:29:48.820
DONNY MCCASLIN: [? BA-DUM TSH ?]

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.969
MATT: Sorry.

00:29:49.969 --> 00:29:52.260
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah, it was
it wasn't called "No Plan"

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.460
at the time, I don't think.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.580
It was "Wistful," I think
was the working title.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:02.530
But that was one song that we
recorded probably seven times,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.360
which was by far the most takes
that we ever did of anything.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.610
And it was because
we were experimenting

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.440
with different orchestration--

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.810
acoustic bass, electric
bass, so on and so forth.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.267
So "No Plan" and those
other songs that came out--

00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:22.350
I'm forgetting the titles--
but they were all part

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.190
of the "Blackstar" sessions.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.910
MATT: OK.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.020
Interesting.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.770
So from that experience,
obviously what transpired,

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:29.370
transpired.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.560
But you've moved
on with the band

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.670
that you mentioned to record
your most recent release, which

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:36.780
is "Beyond Now."

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.830
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yes.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.760
MATT: Talk about how
that process rolled out

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.310
and the influence of
working with Bowie,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.711
going through everything
that you went through,

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.960
and then maintaining those
relationships with the band

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.245
to work on your new record.

00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:51.120
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:59.400
I think the last group period
that we worked on "Blackstar"

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.770
was in March.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.490
And then I did it day of
woodwind overdubs in April.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.670
So then a couple of months
later in the summer,

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.430
I had some time to write music.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.650
And as you can
imagine, his music

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.540
had been just in
my head for months.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.200
And so it was still there.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.230
And I'd been listening a
lot to deadmau5 and Kendrick

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.920
Lamar and Aphex Twin as well.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.970
And I think those were all
kind of there as I sat down.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.390
And so in terms of the
original music on "Beyond Now,"

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.610
it was all written that summer.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.630
And those were the
main influences.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.662
The song "Beyond Now,"
the title track, I was--

00:31:48.662 --> 00:31:51.120
I don't know-- somewhere in
the middle of writing the song.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.250
And I was just thinking,
this is familiar.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.940
And I realized that it was
similar to an intro of one

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.340
of David's tunes that
didn't make "Blackstar"

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.950
but came out later.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.930
But it was just these three
elements-- a bass line,

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.170
then a inner voice that was
moving almost chromatically,

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.872
and then a melody that was
kind of floating on the top.

00:32:13.872 --> 00:32:15.330
And there's other
moments like that

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.350
where I could feel the direct
influence of his music.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.450
With some of his music,
there's a real urgency

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.250
at the beginning of the song.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.749
And that was something that
I was thinking about when

00:32:26.749 --> 00:32:27.790
I was writing this music.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.570
But then also, these other
influences that I mentioned

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.280
were also really present.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.720
So it was writing the original
music and then, with the guys,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.850
developing it as we
would play and working

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:44.622
on the form and sort
of fine tuning it

00:32:44.622 --> 00:32:46.080
over the fall when
we were touring.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.610
And then the other thing
was, what other songs should

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.540
I add to this--

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.590
cover songs?

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.160
And David Binney, who's
produced most of my records,

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.490
we had a lot of back and
forth about different options.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.640
And one song I
knew I wanted to do

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.470
was "Warsala," because we had
started playing it a couple

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.600
weeks after David passed,
because we were doing

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.292
this week at the
Village Vanguard

00:33:12.292 --> 00:33:14.250
in New York City, which
was my first time there

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.020
as a band leader.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.490
So it's a big deal, because
that's like the jazz mecca.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.150
So it was a big deal to me.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.852
And then him passing, it
was just really devastating.

00:33:26.852 --> 00:33:28.560
And then I was just
thinking about, well,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.129
how do I pay tribute to him?

00:33:31.129 --> 00:33:33.420
I don't feel like I can play
anything from "Blackstar".

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.190
It's too much.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:37.450
But eventually, we
settled on that tune.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.780
Jason recommended it,
started playing it,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.430
and it just was
really cathartic to be

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.330
able to play it every night
of every set on that gig

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.760
and just kind of
helped to channel

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.430
everything that had happened
into sort of a musical context.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.450
And it's a great song.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.530
So I was like, OK, we
definitely need to record this.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.350
MATT: And there's a handful
of covers on the record--

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.190
some really diverse covers,
really diverse source material.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.639
And in listening to it,
it's an interesting blend

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:15.650
of elements of electronic
music mixed with obviously

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.969
modern jazz and improvisation.

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:20.750
And I know that a couple
of your Grammy nominations

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.000
are for improvisational solos.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.020
How did you approach merging
electronic music, which

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.679
is traditionally very structured
and repetitive, with what

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.610
is more your wheel house of
improvisation and freedom

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.730
and that sort of thing?

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.429
DONNY MCCASLIN: As
a saxophone player,

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.639
part of what's
interesting is, how can I

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:46.810
improvise within this sonic,
rhythmic context in a way that

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.929
feels authentic to me?

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:55.690
And it eliminates some
of the bebop vocabulary

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.130
that I've grown up with or
that was part of my thing.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:03.940
And so it's been kind
of an opportunity

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:09.320
for me to find new language that
feels right for this context.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.660
So part of it has been exploring
the instrument, finding

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.710
multiphonics and overtones
and these different ways

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.580
of creating sound that
feel like, oh, yeah,

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.694
that feels like
Squarepusher, or that's

00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:26.110
like something that Aphex Twin
would do or Ventian Snares,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.030
and now I'm in there
with these guys.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:32.110
And Tim uses a lot of pedals,
the bass player, and Jason

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.740
with synths.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.906
And there's a lot of pedals.

00:35:33.906 --> 00:35:35.070
So those guys--

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.200
I guess part of the
aesthetic of the band

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.250
is improvising with sound
and not always notes.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:46.490
So for me as an acoustic
instrument, it was like,

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:50.320
how can I explore
this territory?

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.210
So it's been fun to
be like, OK, I've

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.190
got to find a new
vocabulary to drop from.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.200
So that's been
part of it for me.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.170
Now I'm actually
using electronics.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.720
As of about two months ago,
I started doing things.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.380
But prior to that, it was
just finding different ways

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.130
of playing and
just thinking about

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.730
more of a percussive, rhythmic
language in my playing,

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.820
not always feeling like it's got
to be super melodic or whatever

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.092
and just trying to experiment
with all that stuff.

00:36:23.092 --> 00:36:24.050
That's been part of it.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.220
And then also, as
I mentioned before,

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.190
the idea of improvising
with sound and rhythm--

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.710
that the guys in
the rhythm section,

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.410
they do that a lot-- and
just finding my way in there

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.120
with them.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.740
So it's been really fun.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:44.310
And one way I describe
it, what we do--

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.130
people would say, how do
you describe your music?

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.640
Or in terms of David,
it would be like,

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.044
David Bowie does a jazz record.

00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:52.960
Well, that's not true.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.080
"Blackstar" is
not a jazz record.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.550
And what do I do?

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.120
I would say right
now, we're exploring

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.290
the intersection of electronic
and music and improvisation.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.940
And to me, that's, to
me, more of what it is.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.360
It's kind of a hybrid group
where the drums are still

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.470
acoustic.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.940
And until two months
ago, I was acoustic.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.730
Now I'm electrified.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.316
But it's really fun,
because it feels like it's

00:37:22.316 --> 00:37:23.440
something really different.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.070
And all of us in the
group grew up not just

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.060
being jazz musicians.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.750
Talking about my
upbringing and then I've

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.244
continued to just
be involved in a lot

00:37:37.244 --> 00:37:38.410
of different kinds of music.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.620
And so all of that comes
into play in this situation.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.150
And that's why we're
able to negotiate

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.007
these different styles
in a cohesive way.

00:37:47.007 --> 00:37:48.340
MATT: It was really interesting.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.540
My first experience
with the record--

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.630
it comes on.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.700
And I sort of like,
oh, this reminds me

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.370
of Herbie Hancock
when he first broke

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.502
into the synth and electronic
world, but not really.

00:37:59.502 --> 00:38:01.210
And then I'm listening
a little bit more.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.470
I'm like, I can totally hear
like the deadmau5 influence--

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.520
yeah, but not really.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.150
None of that stuff really
explains the full compass

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.650
of what you've
created in the album.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.050
I really enjoyed it, by the way.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.150
DONNY MCCASLIN: Thank you.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.399
MATT: So we do want to open
it up to audience question

00:38:15.399 --> 00:38:15.960
and answer.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.168
If you guys have some
questions, please make your way

00:38:18.168 --> 00:38:18.960
to the microphone.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.085
While people are sorting
themselves out to do that,

00:38:21.085 --> 00:38:23.010
I do want to ask you
about what's next?

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.510
Are you planning
on hitting the road

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.920
again to support the record?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.230
Are you doing some
stuff here in the city?

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.660
DONNY MCCASLIN: Basically, I've
got a couple more weeks off.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.750
And then I'm going to go
to Australia and Japan

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.810
and the West Coast and
then across Canada and then

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:40.860
to Europe.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.219
And it's all--

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.260
MATT: Sounds like a very
linear trip, by the way.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.610
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah,
it's a linear trip.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.160
But it's all presenting
"Beyond Now" live.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.890
But I do have some new
material that I'm developing

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.250
that we're playing now.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.640
And I'm hoping to, in
these next couple weeks,

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.300
write some more music.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.010
And part of what I'm hearing
is working with vocals.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.560
So I'm not sure exactly.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.062
It's not going to
be me, by the way.

00:39:06.062 --> 00:39:08.520
But I'm kind of working on,
what's that going to look like,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.260
who's that going to be.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.060
So that's where it's headed.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.194
MATT: Oh, very interesting.

00:39:13.194 --> 00:39:14.860
Let's take a question
from the audience.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.977
DONNY MCCASLIN: Sure.

00:39:16.977 --> 00:39:17.810
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.268
The question I
would have would be,

00:39:19.268 --> 00:39:22.150
how fleshed were the demos
that Davie Bowie gave you?

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.200
Because the B-side of "Sue" was,
"'Tis a Pity She was a Whore."

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.120
That seemed like it was
just him and a keyboard.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.940
How orchestrated and how
involved were the demos

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.542
that you were initially given?

00:39:34.542 --> 00:39:35.625
DONNY MCCASLIN: Let's see.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:46.260
I would say fairly developed,
because there was always

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:52.500
a drum loop that was one
bar, maybe two bars long,

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.360
synth bass, and
then David singing,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:05.120
and guitar on most things,
maybe not everything, and then

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.590
some other synth.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.100
Sometimes the horn
lines would be on synth.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:16.320
So that's kind of the
basic orchestration

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.370
of what the demos were.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:21.870
I'm trying to think if there's
any exceptions to that.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.030
Let me think for a second.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:28.040
That's pretty much it.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.440
So again, for us, the
information was all there.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:38.860
It was just kind of up to
us to realize it and to--

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.320
I was talking earlier
about the approach

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.780
that I took, in terms of
orchestrating things and adding

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:50.770
harmony to the horn stuff.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.450
But it was all there.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:57.320
And yeah, the only tune that we
really experimented with a lot

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.620
in terms of form was
the version that we

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:06.920
did of "Sue," because I think
initially, it was like--

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.180
the version with Maria
with the orchestra,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.210
there's so much content there.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.490
So actually I thought,
well, why don't we

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:17.030
just go the other direction
where it's David, drums,

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:22.340
and bass and have it be just
super intense and the guys

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.190
going nuts and him
just on top of that.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.030
And initially, I was cueing the
different sections or whatever.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.270
But just the flow
really wasn't there.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:37.490
So we really went back to
the song form from the Maria

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.640
version but just pared down.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.050
And I did kind of a reduction
of the orchestration stuff, just

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.480
for clarinet and flutes.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.570
And it just ended
up working out.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.600
We played a certain amount of
the song and then, at the end,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.220
were just jamming.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.000
And for me, there's
one part of that

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.220
near the end of the song
where he kind of modulates

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.860
to another key
when he's singing--

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.220
(SINGING) "Sue"-- and
I think it's up a half

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.309
step or something.

00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:09.850
And you hear the
whole rhythm section

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.610
just kind of bend with him.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.000
It's a jazz moment.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.350
He's improvising.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.740
He was just taking the melody
and just going for something.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.410
And it was such a
beautiful moment to me.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.180
And I was like, he's
such a bad dude,

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.390
because he's willing to
go for that in the moment.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.490
And then they left it in there.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:33.700
And it's just tremendous.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.284
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:42:35.284 --> 00:42:36.158
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:42:36.158 --> 00:42:36.970
Thank you.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.480
DONNY MCCASLIN: Sure.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.521
MATT: I think we another.

00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:41.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm just curious
about your recent experiments

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.580
with electronics.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.770
Woodwinds, as a
class of instruments,

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.570
seem to be maybe among
the most difficult to

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.430
interface with electronics.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.910
And electronic
wind instruments is

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.190
almost a different instrument.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.600
And I know woodwinds
players do play that.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.930
But I'm just curious
about your experiments,

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.805
to the extent that you're
willing to divulge.

00:43:06.805 --> 00:43:07.679
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yeah.

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:09.040
No, I'm happy to talk about it.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.390
I guess I felt with
the EWI, I just never

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.580
really heard it for myself.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.110
I loved hearing people play it.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.330
But part of the thing for
me with the electronics

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.970
was like, I don't want to
sound just like a synth,

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.310
because I already have
somebody doing that.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.510
I still want the sound
of the saxophone there.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.570
So just for the
longest time, I just

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.910
wasn't feeling like there was
a way to do it that made sense.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.400
And then everybody
was telling me

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.250
how difficult it is to capture
the signal on the saxophone

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.430
and so on and so forth.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.450
So basically,
eventually, I was--

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.360
but I just love the sound
of the ring modulator.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.590
I love it, man.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.940
And Tim Lefebvre has
used it for years.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.565
And I just kept
thinking, man, if there

00:43:49.565 --> 00:43:51.150
was a way I could do that.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.110
And then I was on the gig
with Maria a few months ago.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.660
And Mike Rodriguez
was playing trumpet.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.790
And he had a clip-on mic.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:04.310
And then his output was
going into a preamp--

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.260
a little preamp on stage.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.300
And then he had
some delay thing on.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.260
So I was like, that's cool.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.210
That's something
I could do and I

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:19.640
don't have to take a
rack of extra baggage.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.944
It's a few boxes, fits in--

00:44:21.944 --> 00:44:24.110
MATT: [INAUDIBLE] like a
guitar player's pedalboard.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.749
DONNY MCCASLIN: So
I got the preamp

00:44:26.749 --> 00:44:28.790
because I felt like the
most important thing was,

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:31.976
how do I really capture
the saxophone sound first,

00:44:31.976 --> 00:44:33.350
and then I want
to manipulate it.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.860
So that the preamp solved
that, this little preamp.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.990
And then I was in Chicago.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.930
And a buddy of mine
works at Reverb.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.340
Jim Tuerk works at Reverb.com.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.015
So I emailed him.

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.640
Hey, I'm interested
in ring modulators.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.681
And I was looking online.

00:44:47.681 --> 00:44:49.430
And there's-- I
talked to my friends--

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.590
the Moogerfooger
that people love,

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.720
and there's a couple others.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.220
And you look at the online demo,
and it's almost always guitar.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.490
There was one for saxophone.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.480
So I went.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.070
And Jim had three
different pedals.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.600
And I just AB-ed him.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.850
And the one that really
worked best for saxophone

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.004
was the Fairfield
ring modulator.

00:45:10.004 --> 00:45:11.420
So that was the
first thing I got.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.630
And then he just threw in
a couple other delay reverb

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:15.500
things.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.140
And the one I got was--

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.355
oh, it's from Akron, Ohio.

00:45:19.355 --> 00:45:20.600
MATT: Is this an EarthQuaker?

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.000
DONNY MCCASLIN:
EarthQuaker, that's it.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.454
So that's all I have right now.

00:45:24.454 --> 00:45:26.870
I just have the preamp, the
ring mod, and the EarthQuaker.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:31.670
But that, in and of itself, has
opened up a big world for me.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:36.410
And I haven't even
really practiced with it.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.646
Maybe once before sound
check, about a half hour,

00:45:38.646 --> 00:45:39.770
I was just messing with it.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.840
But I've been hearing
it for a while.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.690
And the thing that I love is
that, the way the set-up is

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.070
so far, I can go between a
clean sound and that sound,

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.840
and it feels really seamless.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.250
And then the distorted
ring modulator sound

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.340
doesn't sound like
a synth to me.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.380
It just sounds like a really
edgy saxophone, distorted.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.580
And really, it adds a lot of
the New York angst that I feel.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.620
So I love it.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.410
And then the reverb and delay--

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.430
so it's been great so far.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.630
And I've just been
improvising with it on gigs.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.400
And it's felt great.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.240
So I'm open to new stuff.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.240
And I just need
time to explore it.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.726
But I'm loving it.

00:46:23.726 --> 00:46:25.670
MATT: Sounds good.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:27.410
So the album is
called "Beyond Now."

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:28.940
It is available now.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.799
DONNY MCCASLIN: Yes.

00:46:29.799 --> 00:46:31.340
MATT: How do people
connect with you?

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.570
What's the best way to find
out where you're going to be,

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.695
how can we come see a show?

00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:37.580
DONNY MCCASLIN: Well, my
website, DonnyMcCaslin.com,

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.050
has a tour page.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:43.430
And then I have a
Facebook band page

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.110
that information is posted on.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.110
On Twitter, DonnyMcCaslin--
so all that stuff.

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.540
But I guess my website is
probably the main thing.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.280
And the record is
on Motema Records.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.750
And folks can get that
at iTunes and Amazon.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:57.710
MATT: Google Play.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.610
DONNY MCCASLIN:
Yeah, there you go.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.180
Exactly.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.050
Exactly.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.990
So it's out there.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.070
And I'm sure having a
lot of fun presenting it.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:04.380
MATT: All right.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.930
Well, we thank you very
much for taking the time.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.200
DONNY MCCASLIN: Thank you, Matt.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.590
My pleasure.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:07.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.340
MATT: [INAUDIBLE]
Donny McCaslin.
