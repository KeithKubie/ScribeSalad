00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.639
We asked you to vote for the 2017 movies.

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.799
You wanted us to make an honest trailer for. Here's your number four pick. You guys are weird...(obviously)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.930
From the mind behind films such as; Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, and Noah. Comes a gruesome...

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.830
..paranoid Bible allegory, which is kind of what you should expect by now from the mind behind Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, and Noah.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.020
mother!

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.280
Experience a gripping tale about...

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.320
something... Where this... mother, and this... guy, have some increasingly bad house guests.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.040
[Clip: Leave me alone. You're an arrogant *bleep*]

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.160
Stuff happens...

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.559
Then slowly but surely, everything goes cuckoo-bananas-not-so-great

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.360
What is going on?! Stop making me feel dumb movie! You're the dumb one.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.240
Stroke your chins for what's either a retelling of the Bible from nature's perspective, an allegory about global warming,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
a meditation on the creative process, a critique of traditional gender roles,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.840
or a story about how hard it is to date a famous person.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.759
In this film that refuses to answer basic questions about plot or character

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.659
But does tell you what Extreme Home Makeover would look like if it were directed by Satan. Move that bus!

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.689
Move it back! Move it back!!

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.460
Witness gruesome imagery that will disturb you to your very core

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.720
where a baby being eaten alive is nothing compared to a close-up of Javier Bardem smiling,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.480
[Clip: *Gasps* You scared me.]

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.960
Kristen Wiig acting serious,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.080
[Clip: The Inspiration.]

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.580
and unprepared public speaking.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.340
[Clip: Would you say something?]

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.540
See this is my actual worst nightmare.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.080
Follow Jennifer Lawrence's giant face around for half the runtime as she takes on a non-stop barrage of household chores,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
generally walks around,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.460
and stares at the wall.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.060
But if that sounds boring, wait until you hear what her husband is going through. He's a poet

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.970
with

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.500
writer's block.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.150
Whoaa

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.920
Man, this movie sounds like it was written by a guy with a lot of scarves...

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440
Oh, right

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.160
So dive in to the esoteric film that audiences either loved,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.100
hated, or really hated. In this film that looks and sounds beautiful,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.940
avoids easy categorization, and really makes the audience think.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.460
[Clip: It affects everyone in a different way. It is remarkable.]

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.780
But sometimes feels like the whole thing was dashed out over a long weekend. Because... it was.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.920
Starring:

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.740
Hunger Games literally Catching Fire

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.380
No Country for Old Testaments

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.560
Dread Flanders

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.300
Catty woman

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.940
a Mcpoyle brother

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.180
what it feels like to host your in-laws

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.040
and *echoing voice* the forbidden sink!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.060
[Clip: That sings not braced yet. Could you get down from there? That sinks not braced yet. Get down from there.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.240
Please get down from there. Please.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.220
Stop doing that. Don't do that. Stop! Stop doing that!]

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.620
We get it already: Don't sit in the sink. Jeez, you're not my real mom.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.520
Big Momma's House 3

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.200
If there's one thing you can count on in a movie, it's that a writer working in isolation will always go insane.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.540
I asked Alexa a question in a dead language and she opened the gates to hell

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.160
banana crumpets

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.080
Somebody once told me that I was Mike Wazowski.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.140
I'm just a porg boy from a porg family

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.440
Eating Tide Pods doesn't make you cool
