00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks
everyone for coming.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.290
So this is Nathan.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.490
And he is the co-founder
and Creative Director

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.890
at "Roadtrip Nation."

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.266
And he started his first road
trip back in 2001, I believe.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.140
NATHAN GEBHARD: 2001.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: So he's going
to tell you a little bit more

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.610
about his current
book, "Roadmap."

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.140
And he has a few co-authors
with them today as well.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.860
We'll go through
his presentation.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.320
If you have questions,
there's time at the end.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960
And then there's books
available for a book signing.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.970
And you can come talk to him
and the other authors as well.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.980
So thank you.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440
NATHAN GEBHARD: Sweet.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.910
Well, thanks for
coming, you guys.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.140
I'm going to kind
of just walk you

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.598
guys through the
story of "Roadtrip

00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:46.320
Nation" and our new book.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.270
And as Caroline said before,
we've got a few co-authors here

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.030
that will join us.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.420
So Alyssa, Jamie,
Willie, and Annie

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.520
will come up on to the
stage for the Q&amp;A part.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.260
So just to give you a
little sense of "Roadtrip."

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.650
When people ask,
what is "Roadtrip",

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.710
what do you guys do, this
is the simple sentence.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.400
We create experiences
that empower

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.160
individuals to build livelihoods
around their interests.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.830
And I think it took us a while
to put that sentence together

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.650
and to really feel
comfortable with it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190
because I think the underlying
piece is that it really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.310
came from a much more rough and
uncertain question, which was,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.880
what am I going to
do with my life?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.980
So in 2001, myself and two other
co-founders, Mike and Brian,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.310
were about ready to
graduate from college

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.030
and just realized we
were sitting there

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.680
in a situation where the lives
that we were about to lead

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.630
were not our own.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.770
So Mike was a double major--
biology kinesiology major.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.700
He had always thought he
was going to be a doctor.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.480
His entire family was
a family of doctors.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.450
And through one internship,
he realized he hated hospitals

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.140
and that that was just
not going to be his life.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.770
Brian was about to become
third generation in a family

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.320
business.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.600
So he was able to
look at his dad

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.790
and see what life would
be like 20 years from now.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.206
He was able to
look at his grandpa

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:08.139
and see what life
was like in 40 years.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.050
And so those two were in a very
similar situation as I was.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.890
I was really interested in--
I wouldn't even say art,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.080
but just being creative.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.410
But I had this inability to
articulate what being creative

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.990
meant to an occupation.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.210
And so when I told my parents,
I want to do something creative.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.120
The only thing I could get
out of my mouth was painter.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.220
And that was the
only artsy people

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.170
that I was exposed
to in my community.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.050
And I remember my parents just
totally like, yeah, you're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.720
going to be poor and homeless
and live under the boardwalk

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.840
if you're a painter.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.730
And I used to think that that
was really a painful comment.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.690
But now that I really
reflect back on it,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.090
it was so accurate because
I'm a horrible painter.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.860
I really can't-- my six-year-old
daughter can paint much better

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.300
than I can.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.847
It was just that I didn't
understand how to articulate

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:02.680
something different.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.032
And so when I was
looking at school,

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:06.990
was looking at trying to
figure out what to do,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.110
I just totally abandoned that
interest in being creative.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.392
And I listened to that societal
expectation of be successful.

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:15.850
And I majored in
business because I

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.350
thought that's what
you're supposed to do.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.266
Just go do something
that makes a lot of money

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:20.640
and you'll be fine.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.710
And it was about the time when
I was getting ready to graduate.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.140
I was literally
just a few months

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.820
from becoming the
consultant, which

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.580
was like the assembly
line of everybody

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.690
in my business major
were consultants.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.327
And I realized at
a career fair when

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:35.910
I was passing out
my resume that I had

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.930
no idea what a consultant does.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.570
And so I asked this
guy, like, hey,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.370
could I just take
you out to lunch

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.386
and learn about what this thing
is that I'm about to become?

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:48.260
And the only thing I
remember from that lunch

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.000
is he was wearing a suit.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.400
And obviously by my
dress today, suits

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.090
do not connect with who
I am as an individual.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.800
My blood was draining the entire
lunch because I just realized

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.730
this whole thing
that I had expected

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.200
that was easy to answer at
the family barbecue of like,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.470
I'm going to be a consultant.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.110
All of that just withered away.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.414
And so Mike, Brian, and myself
all had this instant moment

00:04:12.414 --> 00:04:13.830
right about the
time of graduation

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.700
where we just
realized this is not

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.980
going to work for ourselves.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.014
And so when we talked
about what are we

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:22.930
going to do with our
lives, the answer to that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.750
was really simple.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.210
It was just, we've got to talk
to people that have already

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.310
figured it out.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.100
Who out there has combined
interests and actually

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.840
figured out a life
that they love?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.910
And so we literally just
thought, let's travel around

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.540
the country.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.350
How do we do that?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.370
We can't afford hotels.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.300
Cool, we'll get an RV.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.000
So this is our
beat-up 1985 green RV.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.840
We painted it green with
paint from Home Depot that

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.670
was on sale.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.640
We literally just rolled it on.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.770
It's just caked over the
blinker lights and everything.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.217
It really was unsafe.

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:57.800
And then we started
just cold-calling.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.880
We had no connections.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.587
The idea was just anybody
who sounded interesting,

00:05:01.587 --> 00:05:02.670
we wanted to talk to them.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.080
And we spent about almost a
year putting this road trip

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.230
together, just sitting
at mom and dad's house,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.180
cold-calling all day long.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.240
So I booked an interview
with Sandra Day O'Connor

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.010
from the 1-800 number on the
tours and information website

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.250
for the Supreme Court.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.920
I cold-called Michael
Dell from the 1-800 number

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.080
on a commercial where you're
supposed to buy your computer.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.160
My fax cover sheet
was my face placed

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.750
against the glass of
the copy machine--

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.480
to Michael Dell-- just trying
to stand out in some silly way.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.750
Mike called the director
of "Saturday Night Live"

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.890
every three days
for three months

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.330
until she finally
picked up, on stage

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.620
getting ready for rehearsals
of the MTV Music Awards.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.170
And we just hounded all
of these different people

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.100
that we thought were
really interesting.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.640
And that road trip was
really exceptional for us.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.040
It started as this
simple idea that we

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.970
were going to try and
figure out our own life.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.610
But what changed was-- probably
two weeks into that road trip,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.860
we realized it was
so much different.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.651
It was much bigger.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.390
These conversations
that we were having

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.200
needed to go beyond our lives.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.110
So from that first
road trip, we've

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.470
been spending the last 15
years-- since 2001-- committed

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.630
to this idea of sharing
with other people

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.280
how other successful
individuals have defined

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.000
their own roads in life.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.990
And so I want to
just walk you guys

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.480
through how that's evolved.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.072
The first piece-- when we came
back, we had all this footage.

00:06:22.072 --> 00:06:23.280
We had never edited anything.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.710
We had never filmed anything.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.380
But we thought the best way
to share an experience is

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.680
just to film it.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.180
So we learned how to
edit with a manual

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.770
from Barnes &amp; Noble
on Final Cut Pro.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.070
We learned how to film
from people's advice.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.570
And ultimately,
that first road trip

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.040
became a one-hour special
that we put together.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.960
It aired on maybe eight
public television stations.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.480
But it really started to grow.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.520
And so we decided in 2003
that we would shift and put

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.565
other people on the road.

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:56.940
So our road trip
was the only one

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.245
we were in front of the camera.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:06:59.620
Every year after
that, we've been

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.250
putting new groups
of road-trippers

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.630
out to interview new people
who they really connect with.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.260
So this is just an example of
what it's evolved to today.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.190
We're in pre-production
on Season 13 of the series

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.430
on public television.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.350
We've done 116 episodes so far.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.430
About 85 different road-trippers
have road-tripped with us.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.070
So it's been growing.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.760
We think we're in RV number
11 in terms of purchased,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.600
three currently working.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.680
The original RV is [? in ?]
our conference room.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.355
We had an RV in
Australia, New Zealand.

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:34.470
We've done road trips in
Israel, all different places.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.532
This is the interview archive
that we've put together.

00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:39.990
So if you look at
that show, if you

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.807
look at 116 episodes
of content, we really

00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:46.390
thought that there's got to be
a really dynamic way to explore

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.760
this rather than just episodes.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.220
So we started to pull out
every single interview

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.700
and put it up online.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.420
And so right now we've got
about 425 of the interviews

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.010
that we've got up there, a
couple thousand videos all

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.360
encompassed in that.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.390
And it's people from all
different walks of life.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.420
And we've got schools.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.910
In 2008 we started a nonprofit
that takes this content

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.810
and turns it into curriculum
for high school students.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.060
And just to give you an idea
of the types of people that

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.980
are in this archive--

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.860
If you just think
about the Craigs,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.300
we interviewed
Craig Newmark, who's

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.960
the founder of Craigslist.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.240
We interviewed Craig Brewer.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.340
He wrote and directed
the film "Hustle &amp; Flow."

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.550
We interviewed Craig Venter.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.289
He is the guy who
decoded the human genome.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.480
And Craig Robinson, who's
the former educator,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.309
comedian on "The Office."

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.429
So I wanted to
just show you guys

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.164
what one interview looks like.

00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:46.580
This is an interview with a
team that we put on the road--

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.110
actually from Oakland.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.130
You'll see them twice
in this presentation.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.120
And I think it's really exciting
to just look at one snippet.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.510
This is just three minutes
of Andrew Lins' story.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.289
And what you'll see
is a conversation

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.080
that's much deeper.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.160
We're not asking him, how
much does a conservator make?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.580
What was your
necessary education?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.130
That stuff we can find
online thanks to Google.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.100
We wanted to know the
deeper questions, like,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.930
did you always know
what you wanted to do?

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.560
How do you value
your sense of self?

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.790
What did you do with risk?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.650
And how did you
find an occupation

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.430
that relates to your interests?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.570
And so this is just a
little glimpse into one

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.665
of our interviews.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:28.040
KISURA HENDRIX: I feel
like personal with this.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.290
Nobody gets to do this.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.610
ANDREW LINS: You're right.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.822
You're going to be one of
maybe 25 people to get up here.

00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:35.090
KISURA HENDRIX: Yeah.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.220
Isn't that cool?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.390
That's cool.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.835
And that's your job.

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:45.202
And I think that's just
I think that's amazing.

00:09:45.202 --> 00:09:47.080
ANDREW LINS: When
I was your age,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.720
I was thinking of two careers.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.710
One was medicine
and one was art.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.760
I decided medicine, my
parents would approve of.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.570
Art, no.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.880
So I took a job
first as an orderly.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.370
I helped with the autopsies
and stuff like that.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.090
And then I had a
bad car accident.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.210
I drove a car over a bridge.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.860
That took a little
while to get over.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:20.890
And I reconsidered what were the
most important things in what

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.770
order and what would
give me the best

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.120
feeling of having done
something with my life

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.450
that I wanted to do.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.580
So I said, well, I really
always have loved art.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.240
So I spent several years
doing art after that.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.014
I ran into a professor who
was teaching Baroque art.

00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:39.430
He said, well,
have you ever heard

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.490
of this profession
of conservation?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.930
They seem to combine
art and science.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.720
I said, well, I
better look into that.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.070
So I went to New York and
talked to several people there.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.494
And then I ended up doing that.

00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:55.160
KISURA HENDRIX: You
have been told to us

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.720
as being one of the
best conservation

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.711
people in the country,
if not the best.

00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:03.150
ANDREW LINS: [INAUDIBLE]
I'm going to get

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.365
into a lot of trouble now.

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:05.990
KISURA HENDRIX: I
mean, I'm just saying

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.500
that coming from you wanting to
go into the medical profession

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.980
to please your parents to
doing this, which is completely

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.600
different, are you glad that
you went down the path that you

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.600
did instead of going
to be a doctor first

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.550
You know what I mean?

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.300
ANDREW LINS: Yeah.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.630
I'm glad the more I
reflect back on what

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.230
I've done that I
made the choice I did

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:31.620
because this profession, for me,
satisfies all the things that I

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.030
think are important that
I have the skills at.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.710
No matter what you do, you got
to use as much energy and brain

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.740
power as you've got to do
it as well as you can do it

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.070
all the time because you
don't get the seconds back.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.560
You don't get the minutes back.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.630
You don't get the days
back that have gone by.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.130
And there's so
many things to do.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.810
Do them as well as
you possibly can.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.050
Take it all out and make
it as good as you can.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.550
But do the things that
make you feel like you've

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.260
spent your time well.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.876
At the end you'll be happy,
if not proud, of your life.

00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:13.310
That's what I think about
more as I get older.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.050
What are you going to think
when you finally have to answer,

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.662
was your life spent well enough?

00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:20.620
NATHAN GEBHARD: So that's
just a little glimmer

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.250
into what these
conversations are like.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.620
The average interview is
probably an hour and a half,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.669
I think.

00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:29.210
When we interviewed the first
photographer for "Rolling Stone

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.050
Magazine," it was a 2 and
1/2 hour interview marathon.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.760
But it's really amazing to
just get in these people's

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.970
very personal stories.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.594
And I think some of
my favorite moments

00:12:38.594 --> 00:12:40.870
are those places where you
watch somebody lean back

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.610
and pause and say, I haven't
thought about this in years.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.180
And you really get
down to the core

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.620
of who these individuals are.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.820
It's been exciting.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.900
If you look at where
we've started to now,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.240
we've done we've
probably traveled over

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.030
120,000 miles across the
[? countries ?] back and forth

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.580
many times.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.895
We're upwards of probably
just over 1,000 interviews

00:13:03.895 --> 00:13:05.310
that we've conducted.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.740
And all of this content
has been just in our head.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.650
And it's been sequential in
terms of the television series,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.382
in terms of the curriculum.

00:13:12.382 --> 00:13:14.840
When we started to think--
about two years ago-- about what

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.940
would a book be like,
we really started

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.820
thinking-- we did not want to
write a book about our story.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.134
We didn't want this
anecdotal thing of like, hey,

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:26.050
we did this road trip.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.180
We figured out our life.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.070
As long as you take a road
trip too, you will as well.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.560
It was like there's so many
of the me-too five-point step

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.410
solutions that guarantee
success after 100 pages,

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.449
or something like that.

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:40.740
And we really didn't want that.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.920
We wanted something
that encapsulated

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.960
thousands of
conversations and hundreds

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.830
of hours of interviewing.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.090
Actually, that's the
other way around, right?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.160
So we ended up starting about
two years ago on a book.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.980
It just came out.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.464
And I wanted to show you
just a little bit of a piece

00:13:57.464 --> 00:13:58.880
that we put together
for the book.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.504
And then we'll dive in [? for ?]
the rest of the session on it.

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:03.178
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:14.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: The reason
why I went on this road trip

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.374
is to talk to a bunch of people
who have made careers out

00:14:17.374 --> 00:14:18.540
of something that they love.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: What were
you doing in your 20s

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.550
or in college?

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.010
What were you thinking?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.520
MALE SPEAKER: Did you
really not feel pressure?

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your family
expects so much of you.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.300
Society expects so much of you.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.700
MALE SPEAKER: How do you
bridge that gap between what

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.855
I want to do and doing it?

00:14:28.855 --> 00:14:30.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: As I've
been going along this trip,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.646
I've been really
trying to pay attention

00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:34.150
to people who have
made something,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.030
a lifestyle, a career,
when they haven't had

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.405
a blueprint, because I feel
like I don't have a blueprint

00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:39.200
and I'm just trying
to figure it out.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.199
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's OK.

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:41.962
This is all a part of
an evolution that's

00:14:41.962 --> 00:14:43.405
building me to go somewhere.

00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:44.848
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:51.110
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I'll
tell you this story.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.922
I sort of see it
as your future self

00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:54.130
is leading you in some sense.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.786
FEMALE SPEAKER: The 20s, to me,
it's about having experiences.

00:14:56.786 --> 00:14:59.369
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] very
important thing I want to tell.

00:14:59.369 --> 00:15:00.093
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
encourage young people

00:15:00.093 --> 00:15:01.301
to question everything.

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:02.267
MALE SPEAKER: It's the
journey that [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.716
MALE SPEAKER: Success
isn't magical.

00:15:03.716 --> 00:15:04.682
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's like a trip.

00:15:04.682 --> 00:15:05.648
MALE SPEAKER: You just
have to run after it.

00:15:05.648 --> 00:15:07.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is it
that's going to make you happy?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.663
FEMALE SPEAKER: This was
a 45-minute conversation,

00:15:09.663 --> 00:15:11.030
and it changed my entire life.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.982
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:27.410
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think if I
could articulate the hardest

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.035
thing about putting
this book together,

00:15:29.035 --> 00:15:31.470
it was that we wanted to
honor the reality of how

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.281
people figure out their lives.

00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:37.530
And we didn't want to gloss
over the complexity of it.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.400
So to give you a perfect example
of this, within 100 miles,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.530
we interviewed two
people, Deon Clark,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.870
who's a nuclear engineer,
and Paul Salopek,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.460
who's a two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.750
And Deon Clark was
this engineer who

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.880
said the best thing you
can do is take a skill

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.250
and focus it and dig as deep
as you can in that skill.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.225
And you will gain so
much expertise around

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:00.640
that that you'll be invaluable.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.660
And you can take that
skill anywhere you want.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.050
And then 50 miles, 100
miles later, Paul Salopek

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.980
had a totally
different experience.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:16.980
Deon was a nuclear engineer
on a nuclear submarine.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.020
So he was running a
submarine at age 19

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.530
with 30 people underneath him.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.902
Paul Salopek had a totally
different experience.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.610
He had explored all
these different types

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.449
of places in his life.

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:30.990
And he said the best
thing you can do

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.510
is go broad, to
have a great amount

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.800
of different experiences,
and to put those together

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.220
in a very unique way.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.650
And so in 100 miles, we
have two people saying

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.610
the exact opposite thing.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.180
And so as we put
this book together,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.640
we were really trying to
think, how do we honor that?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.510
How do we put that together?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.610
And ultimately, we decided
to come up with this.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.660
And it's what we call this
process of self-construction.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.680
It's a circular process,
let go; define; become.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.690
It's one that you repeat
over and over again.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.290
And it's really
an open framework.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.150
If software had an analogy,
this is an open source platform.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.950
What we really
felt was important

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.890
here is this process that we saw
consistently across the board.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.200
That people had this noise of
society, this peer pressure.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.109
They ultimately had to let that
go before they could really

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.859
think about who they
were in their own right.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.180
Then they had to define
what was important to them

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.150
with that noise away and
then actually become that.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.920
And that only lasts for so long.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.872
You do that, your life
changes, your values change,

00:17:30.872 --> 00:17:32.330
your interests
change, and then you

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.690
have to pick that
process up again.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.855
And so this has really been the
core piece of the book, let go;

00:17:39.855 --> 00:17:40.480
define; become.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.930
And what we'll do for
the rest of the session

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.360
is just walk through that.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.606
And I'm going to try
and bring as many people

00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:48.980
from the conversations
that we've

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.480
had into the presentation.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.702
Everybody that you see here is
both in the book and then also

00:17:53.702 --> 00:17:55.160
as part of the
book, you get access

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.110
to all of the video
archive of it.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.790
So the first part is let go.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.770
It's very simple.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.640
It's just about stepping away
from all of that noise, all

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.960
of that static,
and really getting

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.300
to the core of who you are.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.990
And a key part of that is this
idea of shedding the noise.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.850
The noise as we define
it is everything

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.440
that comes at you in
a way that doesn't

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.640
take your own individual
identity into account.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.142
It's that inauthentic
you should be a lawyer,

00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:26.100
you should be a doctor,
you're not smart enough

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.150
to be a doctor, you could
never go to college,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.270
you have to go to college.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.130
It's all of these
different elements

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.851
that we're always
inundated from.

00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.350
And they can come
from our families.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.440
They can from our peers.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.420
But they can also
come for ourselves.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.240
That self-doubt is,
in many respects,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.940
noise that has come
from the outside

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.200
and that we've
accepted it as our own.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.740
And to just illustrate
an example--

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.610
if any of you saw "Boyhood"--
this is Richard Linklater.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.290
He wrote and directed the film.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.150
When he told his parents,
I'm interested in writing.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.342
I think I'm going to be
a writer, a director,

00:19:00.342 --> 00:19:01.466
they really scoffed at him.

00:19:01.466 --> 00:19:04.760
And they said, no, this
family, we don't do that.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.040
We're a family of
doctors and lawyers.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.790
And I think they were
really well-meaning,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.190
but that was their experience.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.710
And the best that they could
think about from a writer,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.840
he said was they
said, well, maybe you

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.710
could write children's books.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.320
But he really had this place
of just realizing that he

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.070
needed to let that noise go.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.070
And he really went
on his own pursuit.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.800
He worked at an offshore
oil rig for an entire year

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.290
to save up enough money
so that the next year he

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.750
could move into a
small apartment,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.760
buy as many film books and
as much film equipment,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.917
and learn the art
of film on his own.

00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:42.875
And that was his process
of shedding the noise.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.320
This is one of my most
painful and favorite quotes

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.400
to illustrate the noise.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.980
This is Glenna Goodacre.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.110
She had her first class
ever in sculpting.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.037
This is what her teacher said.

00:19:58.037 --> 00:19:59.620
"I had a sculpting
teacher who told me

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.720
I was stupid, dumb, and
ignorant and couldn't

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.530
see three-dimensionally."

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.280
Glenna Goodacre is the woman
who sculpted the Sacagawea $1.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.190
She's also the woman who
is most notably recognized

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.940
for the Vietnam Women's
Memorial in Washington, DC.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.917
You can imagine what that had to
feel like for her and the power

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.500
that it took for her
to overcome that.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.180
So as you guys just pause
for a moment, think what

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.330
is your noise?

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.410
What were those pieces that
came either from yourself

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.067
or from your peers that
really stuck with you?

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:38.650
And did those shape
your life, or were

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.110
you able to resist them?

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.850
As we look at
resisting the noise,

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.940
there's a couple
stories I'll share.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.940
This is Caroline Thompson.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.920
She's the screenwriter for
"Corpse Bride" and "Edward

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.080
Scissorhands."

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.730
And she had this beautiful
analogy that I love,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.410
which is just the
noise is sometimes

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.680
these tapes in our head.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.964
And we just have to eject
those tapes and put in our own.

00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:06.630
We have to start writing our own
scripts as opposed to accepting

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.845
the scripts of other people.

00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:10.470
And when we really
look at it, I wanted

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.330
to take you guys back
to that Oakland team

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.686
that we saw earlier.

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:15.560
This is Jeff Johnson.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.600
They interviewed him
about 2,000 miles later

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.460
than the other
interview that you saw.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.290
And he speaks
really articulately

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.260
both about the noise that we get
from others as well as the box

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.469
that we put ourselves in
when we accept that noise.

00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:31.260
KISURA HENDRIX: I want
to ask this question

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.540
because, like I said, I've
wanted to go to law school

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.685
all my life since I was little.

00:21:36.685 --> 00:21:38.810
And now I find that I don't
want to do that anymore

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.480
but instead I want to
take this path over here

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.200
and I want to do
something in music.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.510
And I feel like I'm
giving up on law school.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.470
So what is giving
up and what is just

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.432
deciding to do something else?

00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:56.450
JEFF JOHNSON: Man, here
is the key to the cell

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.780
that you've created
for yourself.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.410
What I'm saying
is, you ever wanted

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.795
to do something so much
that you tell everybody

00:22:03.795 --> 00:22:06.390
you want to do it, you
share with everybody

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.000
that this is what
you're going to do.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.790
And then now what you're
trying to live up to

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.900
is the expectations that you
created for everybody else.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.730
So my mom and them is expecting
me to go to law school

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.950
not because they told
me but because I said

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.340
that's what I was going to do.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.500
But the bottom line is
you created that cell.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.690
Nobody else created it for you,
which means you got the keys

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.190
to say, you know what,
y'all, I changed my mind.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.170
I don't want to do this no more.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.240
And if people agree
or disagree, so what?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.640
They don't have
to live your life.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.630
They don't have to
go work every day.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.186
They don't have
to pay your bills.

00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:44.810
They don't have to
raise your children.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.268
They don't have to
be the ones that

00:22:46.268 --> 00:22:48.240
are responsible for your
light and your gift.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.810
So if you decide that you
don't want to do that anymore,

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.685
then tell the people
who said, you know what,

00:22:52.685 --> 00:22:54.350
y'all, some stuff
has happened to me,

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.890
and I don't want to do this.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.630
And you've got to
be honest enough

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.890
with yourself to understand,
is this something

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.260
I was created to do, or is
this just something I like?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.150
Is this something I
was created to do,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.460
or is this something I think
is going to make me look good?

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.660
Because what I see
a lot of people--

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.694
a lot of young people
doing especially--

00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:14.860
is they think that they
were created to do something

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.318
because they ain't
see nothing else

00:23:16.318 --> 00:23:18.040
or they haven't
opened their minds up

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.380
to other opportunities.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.460
But so often we
confine ourselves

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.670
to this little box of doctor,
lawyer, engineer, teacher,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.980
business person.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.500
Free yourself [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.722
This is my key.

00:23:31.722 --> 00:23:33.180
ABEL HABTEGEORGIS:
I appreciate it.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:33.770
[? JEFF JOHNSON: Thank you ?]
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.430
ABEL HABTEGEORGIS: The
conversation, the wisdom,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.096
everything, man.

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:37.747
[? JEFF JOHNSON: Thank ?] you.

00:23:37.747 --> 00:23:39.330
NATHAN GEBHARD: What
I love about Jeff

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.370
is just the idea that we
put ourselves in the box.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.550
And as we looked at how
we wanted to round out

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.140
that first section of let go.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.940
It really ends with this chapter
called "The Blank Canvas".

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.530
And the take there is if we
really accept that noise,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.270
we're living a life
of paint by numbers.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:02.250
And the more we can strip away
and wash those instructions

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.410
manuals away, the more we can
really start from a clean slate

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.290
and really think
about who we are.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.920
And so that's how we end
that process of let go.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.190
And that brings us into define.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.370
I think the thing
about define for us

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.370
is that-- I think before
we started on the road trip

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.430
we had this expectation that
all of these different people

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.990
had always had it figured out.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.950
So when we sat down with
Howard Schultz from Starbucks,

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.910
we figured he always knew
he was really into coffee

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.824
and he just knew how to do that.

00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:39.240
When we sat down with David
Neeleman, who started JetBlue,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.480
we just figured that guy,
he's all about planes,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.710
straight line to success.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.377
Wanda Sykes, same thing.

00:24:45.377 --> 00:24:47.460
She probably was the
funniest person in her class,

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.140
always had confidence
up on stage,

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.710
and she killed it every time.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.872
After those
interviews, we realized

00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:55.830
that Howard Schultz was
the first in his family

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.990
to go to college.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.580
And in college he was so
poor he was donating blood

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.570
to have enough money to eat.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.490
You hear David Neeleman talk
about being an executive vice

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.145
president at Southwest
Airlines and then being fired

00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:10.160
and how devastating
that was for him and how

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.620
he had to rebuild his sense
of self and his identity

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.060
and what he wanted
to create, which

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.160
ultimately resulted in JetBlue.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.640
And we learned that
Wanda Sykes for years

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.460
was working at the NSA.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.120
That was her way
of paying the bills

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.020
while she gained this
confidence, while she

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.820
became a comedian.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.510
And so it was a really
eye-opening piece to us

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.980
to think that people didn't
just become instantly.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.670
They moved in incremental steps.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.900
And I think a great example
of that is this guy.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.410
He is one of my favorite
interviews of recent.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.060
His name's Adam Steltzner.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.900
When Adam was first
looking around,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.880
the only thing he knew he was
interested in was nothing.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.430
He had no driver.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.330
He was not particularly
compelled by anything.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.280
He would start things
and then back off them.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.970
He isn't sure if he
graduated from high school.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.300
He was one grade
away and decided,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.910
I just won't go back and check
those transcripts to see.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.480
And at the point of his
story really starting,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.740
he said, I was
playing in a band.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.570
And every night I was driving
home over the Bay Bridge,

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.890
and I noticed that the
stars moved in the sky.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:28.280
And he says this in an
admission of ignorance and irony

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.922
that he had no idea that
the stars moved in the sky,

00:26:31.922 --> 00:26:33.880
that the moon is in a
different place each day,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.130
that Orion is not here, but
it's there the next month.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.500
And so on that simple little,
why do the stars move,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.480
he decided to go to
an astronomy class

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.822
at a local junior
college, and just say,

00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:48.030
I'm going to figure this out.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.220
Why?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.770
And it just bit.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.480
That was an interest--
this idea about space

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.330
and how these things
come together,

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:01.290
how formulas can really governed
the rules of how things move,

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.910
both in space and on earth.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.700
And he just started
to follow that.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.980
And that was a drip, and then
the next degree was a drip.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.460
And he all a sudden
finds himself enraptured

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.160
by this interest of the stars.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.390
He lands a job at JPL.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.805
And he starts
engineering landings.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.930
He became the go-to guy
for complex problems

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.320
about how to land
things in space.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.790
And to start from the guy that
didn't know the stars moved,

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.980
he ultimately was the one
that engineered the landing

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.260
or led the landing on
the Mars Curiosity Rover.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.030
So when you saw that-- what
was it-- they called it,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.020
I think, seven minutes of
terror, that was his team

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.400
putting that together.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.220
And he's ultimately responsible,
him and the team at JPL,

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.760
for landing that rover.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.760
And it just was such an
empowering piece for us

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.140
to realize people didn't
always have it figured out.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.890
And I think that his
story is so much more

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.974
consistent than the very few
minority of the individuals

00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:04.640
that we met with that
said, oh, I always

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.360
knew I wanted to be a writer
and I just became a writer.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.870
That is the almost 0%.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.570
And I think that really ties
into this idea of career.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.190
From our perspective,
from all these

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.860
1,000 plus interviews,
what we really see

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.690
is that our current way in
which we approach career

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.160
is like taking binoculars
and looking at it backwards.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.200
If we look at that experience
of going to the career center,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.260
more often than
not it's this idea

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.280
that you just pick an
occupation in the future

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.540
and then reverse
engineer backwards.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.580
If you're in a career,
it's pick the next career

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.577
and then reverse
engineer backwards.

00:28:40.577 --> 00:28:41.410
What are the skills?

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.490
What are the
degrees that I need?

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.590
But what we saw was the
total different approach.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.720
The people that really
found themselves happy

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.960
and engaged in the work
that they were doing,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.230
they followed a simple thing.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.620
And it was just a
simple piece, which is

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.450
they followed their interests.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.460
This is Richard Meier.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.681
He was the architect
for the Getty Museum.

00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:02.180
And he said, "When
I was growing up,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.280
my parents had a
basement in their house,

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.410
and I had a drafting board where
I would make drawings and model

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.740
boats and paper airplanes.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.520
I just liked making things."

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.536
He didn't say, I want
to be an architect.

00:29:16.536 --> 00:29:18.160
I think for the most
part, when we say,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.770
I'm going to be a
consultant, it's

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.460
to end that awkward conversation
at the family barbecue.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.900
What we saw was
people really gaining

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.222
their own sense of identity
was when they just said,

00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:31.180
I have this interest and
I'm going to pursue it

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.900
and I'm going to
see where it goes.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.520
And so if there
was one core piece

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.770
that I would say that is
about "Roadtrip Nation," that

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.210
is about this book, it is
pursue your interests, not

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.450
an occupation.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.640
And we have seen that
time and time again.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.950
When we started to think
about pursuing the interests,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:54.470
we also looked at how
to put that together.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.769
And what we saw was this
idea of this framework

00:29:56.769 --> 00:29:57.560
called the roadmap.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.120
And that's ultimately what
we named the book after.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.420
It's this idea that
you're mashing together

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.430
multiple interests.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.290
Because when we
went to JDK Design,

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.210
we weren't just
interviewing a designer.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.585
We were interviewing
the designer

00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:11.700
that puts art on snowboards.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.780
When we went and
saw Adam Steltzner

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.060
it's not just science
or engineering.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.480
It's those combined
together with space.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.640
It's all these people combining
multiple things together.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.360
And what we started to look
at was more often than not,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.710
there was something deeper.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.400
There was this thing which
we refer to as a foundation.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.400
So for me, like Richard
Meier, it really

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.650
doesn't matter what I'm doing.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.090
I will be lit up
with almost anything

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.444
as long as I'm making things, as
long as I'm building something.

00:30:40.444 --> 00:30:42.860
The interests that I have--
design and technology-- that's

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.360
the way I manifest it.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.330
But making things,
whether it's LEGOs

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.279
with my daughter, a website,
a boat, anything, that's

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:51.320
really what lights me up.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.660
And so we saw time
and time people

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.965
were finding their
own foundation

00:30:55.965 --> 00:30:58.540
and then combining
multiple interests.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.430
And so this is a really good
example of an interview--

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:05.220
just up the road-- from Anna.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.240
ANNA HORJILLOSA: I
went to UC Berkeley.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.660
And I started out as a
philosophy major and an art

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.350
major.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.670
And then I took anthropology.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.510
And then I thought, you know,
I'm going to do theater.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.810
And after I got out,
I was like, I'm just

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.380
going to try to get a real job.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.280
But I wanted to be in a
place that felt right.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.510
And I applied to the
Asian Art Museum.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.905
I applied for the program
assistant position

00:31:29.905 --> 00:31:31.930
in performing arts.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:37.290
And I have museum experience,
I had my anthro background,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:37.980
I had theater.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.820
It just came together.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.670
And it was totally unplanned.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.820
The thing is I never knew a job
like what I have now existed

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.160
or could exist.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.870
I just sort of positioned
myself with things

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.260
that really felt right.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.180
It's really a matter of
instinct on some level

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.040
and a broad plotting of things.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.084
Your path is what
you make of it.

00:32:02.084 --> 00:32:04.500
There are positions out there,
there are careers out there

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.050
that you can fit into,
but there are also things

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.280
that you can make yourself.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.280
And you have to just trust
that you have something

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.674
unique to offer and to
be consistent with that

00:32:18.674 --> 00:32:19.340
in your choices.

00:32:22.699 --> 00:32:24.990
NATHAN GEBHARD: And what I
really love about her is she

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.760
is mashing these pieces up.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.200
She's mashing up
anthropology, theater,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.069
and in the context of a museum.

00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:33.110
And to give you guys some
more examples of people

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.250
we've interviewed,
this is Peter Travers.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.510
He's a film critic at
"Rolling Stone Magazine."

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.060
He's all about sharing stories
with film and journalism.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.810
And you could probably
add in music there,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.190
if you wanted, from
"Rolling Stone."

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.380
We've got Jessica Matthews.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.782
She's CEO of Uncharted Play.

00:32:47.782 --> 00:32:50.115
She's all about helping people
in sports and technology.

00:32:50.115 --> 00:32:51.170
You might have seen her.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.350
She was one of the engineers
of this soccer ball

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.590
that small rural communities
in Africa could play with.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.950
And during the day,
while they're kicking it,

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:04.280
through the motion generated of
movement, it's storing energy.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.810
And they can then plug an actual
light into that soccer ball

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.580
and use it as light in
their homes in the evening.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.690
It's an amazing story.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.805
And she is combining
science into sports

00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:15.055
and helping people altogether.

00:33:17.632 --> 00:33:19.840
If you look at Jehmu Greene,
when we interviewed her,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.980
she was the president
of Rock the Vote.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.060
She [INAUDIBLE] that
she believes in,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.950
but she's not doing
that in the abstract.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.640
She's doing it in
music and politics.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.210
And when we sat down
with Ariel Helwani,

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.490
he was all about
accomplishing goals.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.390
This was a guy who really
had this goal of getting

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.310
into MMA reporting, but
he was deathly afraid

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.410
of the limelight.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.750
He was petrified
of other people.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.030
When he was in college,
he lived in the dorms,

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.950
and he literally would wait
till 2:00 in the morning

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.350
to go brush his teeth.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.710
He was that afraid of
people, but his goal

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.290
was to be a reporter for MMA.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.690
I have no idea why he chose that
goal, but that was his thing.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.760
And he started small.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.820
He started in a
local radio station

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.190
where he could just put his
headphones on and his hoodie

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.580
and talk into the mic.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.090
Then he started a
blog, added some video

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.670
to that blog of doing
interviews with fighters,

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.270
and all of sudden,
he is the guy at AOL.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:25.429
He's one of the key
people in the MMA space.

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.429
Now I wanted to just take
a little bit more time

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.060
to tell you a story that
really articulates, I think,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.010
a lot of what we've talked about
before in terms of shedding

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.330
the noise, in terms of evolving
this idea of drip, drip,

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.659
splash, and then
mashing up of interests.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.070
So this is Jimmy Chin.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.739
He's a skier.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.100
He's a rock climber.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.790
He's an adventurer.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.189
He's a North Face athlete.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:49.980
Probably a month before
we interviewed him,

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.560
he had just shot the photo
of the cover of "National

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.659
Geographic" with Alex
[? Hahn ?] just standing

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.949
on the ledge with no ropes.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.030
So that was Jimmy Chin's photo.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.710
But he came from a very
traditional family.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:07.210
His parents were very
much focused on education.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.370
And he did a lot of
things to make them happy.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.270
He was an accomplished
violin player.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.069
He really pursued
college in a place

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:17.860
where it wasn't maybe
necessarily the thing

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.550
that he would have chosen.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.430
But he did these things
to make them happy.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.060
And he said that the one thing
he chose for himself to do

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.730
was rock climbing.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.150
And so he said after
college to his parents,

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.290
just give me one year.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.980
I'm just going to climb for one
year, ski for one year, and see

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.262
what happens, and then
I'll go get that job.

00:35:37.262 --> 00:35:38.095
I'll be that lawyer.

00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:40.178
He literally thought that
there was three options,

00:35:40.178 --> 00:35:44.080
just be a doctor or be a
lawyer or be a business person.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.090
And I think all of those are
totally admirable occupations.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.270
They just weren't
right for Jimmy.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.360
So he said, just give me
time to live my piece first.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.290
So he started.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.572
And he started at literally
just this simply rock climbing.

00:35:58.572 --> 00:36:00.880
And that interest grew.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.010
And he was getting more and more
accomplished in rock climbing.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:07.630
And then one day on a
climb, one of his buddies

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.770
was trying to learn
to take photographs

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.210
and wanted to start a business
of taking photographs.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.810
And they were on this pitch.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.500
And his buddy couldn't quite
get the angle that he wanted.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.583
So he handed the camera
to Jimmy and he said, hey,

00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:19.970
will you just take this photo?

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.871
Whatever you can,
just take a photo.

00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:23.370
Whatever.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.870
A couple of weeks went by, and
that friend came back to him.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.465
And he was like, yeah,
yeah, I sold a photo.

00:36:28.465 --> 00:36:30.120
It was your photo.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.770
The only photo this
guy sold was the photo

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.420
that Jimmy took on that camera.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.390
And at the time, Jimmy
was living in his car.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.330
He was rock climbing.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.400
And he got $500 for that photo.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.780
And he just sat there and
he said, if all I need to do

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.890
is sell 12 photos and I can
live for the entire year.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.499
And he just kept going.

00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:53.290
It was just this pursuing
of this interest.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.750
He lived in that
car for six years,

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.610
but his skills and his
interests were evolving.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.820
It went from rock
climbing to high Himalayan

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.570
climbing to these really
extensive expeditions.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:11.200
And then it even went further
to leading really complex

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.420
expeditions in remote locations.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.340
And what's interesting
about Jimmy's story

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.260
at this point was
he said, you know,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.170
I couldn't have led
these expeditions

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.045
without that education that I
had, without these experiences

00:37:22.045 --> 00:37:24.720
that I've had before,
because people didn't need--

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.940
when they're going to go climb
a crazy peak-- you couldn't

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.300
get a team that said, OK,
I need one photographer.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.680
I need one videographer,
one climber,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.390
and then one operations guy.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.050
You need somebody that brings
all of those things together.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.004
And Jimmy, through
his experience,

00:37:39.004 --> 00:37:40.670
through that pursuing
of these interests

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.140
and this step by step approach,
really created this place

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.520
where he was one of the
few people that could

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.035
take on some of these things.

00:37:48.035 --> 00:37:52.280
And when I asked him what advice
would you have to people trying

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.830
to define their own road,
he simply used this climbing

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.500
reference, which I think
really applies, which is,

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.460
[? "Commit ?] and
figure it out."

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.320
He committed to rock climbing.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.950
That evolved to photography.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.812
That evolved to leading
these expeditions.

00:38:04.812 --> 00:38:08.330
That evolved to videography, to
starting a production company.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.909
And if you have any interest on
Instagram, check out his feed.

00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:12.825
It's really inspiring.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.840
So at this point, just
reflect on your own roadmap.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.010
Imagine what are the interests
that you would smash together.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:27.500
If noise was nonexistent, if
you really had that freedom,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.870
what would be that thing
that you would take?

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.532
And this gets us into
the become piece,

00:38:33.532 --> 00:38:34.740
the last section of the book.

00:38:38.372 --> 00:38:40.080
As we started putting
this book together,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.915
I think the worst advice that
I think I've ever received

00:38:43.915 --> 00:38:47.150
and I could give to anybody
would be follow your passions.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.937
Because I think there's
a huge problem with that.

00:38:50.937 --> 00:38:53.020
It makes it sound like you
should know it already.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.740
It makes you sound like this
thing is so big that you've

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.640
only got one passion.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.880
It's like find that right
one partner in this world,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.390
the perfect match.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.280
And what we saw
was people did not

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.660
approach their life that way.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.410
They dipped their
toe in the water.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.140
A woman that we interviewed
over here at Google,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.270
she said, you're looking at
me now in this occupation

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.230
and in the success that
I have, and you think,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.420
I'm doing so well, but you
didn't see all the steps

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.110
that I got here.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.500
And her analogy was beautiful.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.430
She said, it's like
you're looking at somebody

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.330
who's swimming in cold ocean.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.920
They didn't just run
in there and jump

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.472
and say, oh, this is great.

00:39:29.472 --> 00:39:30.680
She's like, I ran down there.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.610
I put my toe in the water.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.276
It was freezing.

00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:33.575
I backed off.

00:39:33.575 --> 00:39:34.200
I ran in there.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.158
I got down to my knees.

00:39:35.158 --> 00:39:36.070
It was too cold.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.810
I failed again.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.980
I ran back off.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.630
And eventually she gets to the
place where she's neck deep

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.140
and then she's swimming.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.390
But we connect to these dots
that really aren't there.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.420
And so this idea that you should
follow your passion-- passion's

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.480
the destination if
you do it all right,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.910
but it's not an approach.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.670
It's really following
your interests

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.990
and exploring that passion
and finding validation

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.480
where your interests
meet your skills.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.630
Then you arrive at
that place of passion.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.640
But it's just not a reasonable
bit of advice to give anybody.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.870
And we have not seen
that come into play

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.200
with the people we interviewed.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.527
I think the most apt
example of these baby steps

00:40:17.527 --> 00:40:19.110
is this interview
that we had with Jad

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:24.085
Abumrad, the co-founder
and host of "RadioLab."

00:40:24.085 --> 00:40:26.110
And he has this
great analogy that he

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.667
pulls called the adjacent
possible from science.

00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:30.750
So we'll just tap into it.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.840
ZACHARIAH COWAN: One
thing that comes up

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.610
a lot is we're
about about defining

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.160
our own roads as opposed to not
taking somebody else's road.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.120
But how did you take it
to that next level of,

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.920
you need to be more open
to other options and things

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.530
like that.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.410
JAD ABUMRAD: Let me get
abstract for a second.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.035
I'm going to bring
in some highfalutin,

00:40:50.035 --> 00:40:53.690
and you can tell
me to be concrete.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.720
But there's this
theory in evolution

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.870
called the adjacent
possible, which

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.290
is that if you imagine
the primordial soup is

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:05.200
full of all these chemicals.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200
Arsenic was in there.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.724
There's amino acids
floating around.

00:41:07.724 --> 00:41:10.140
Those things aren't going to
suddenly bump into each other

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.110
and create a human
being, or even a flower.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.950
So it's not part of the
possibility of that space

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.910
to create the flower.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.550
But you can take an amino acid
and you can take a fat cell.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.980
You can slam them together.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.770
Suddenly you've got a cell
and suddenly that cell

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.310
has more possibilities--
a two-celled organism.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:32.225
And eventually an amoeba or
something-- I don't know.

00:41:32.225 --> 00:41:33.600
So you have to
ask yourself, what

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.050
is your adjacent
possible, in some sense.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.060
Right now you're, in a way,
in your own primordial soup

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.480
of dreams, but you have to
think of your possibilities

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.350
in both the most expansive and
the most constrained-- like,

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.170
OK, you know, I can't
be Michael Jordan

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.130
but maybe I could go
play in a pickup game

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.450
and work on my jump shot,
something like that.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.741
There's a way in which you
always have to ask yourself,

00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:03.509
what is possible right
outside my border?

00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:05.550
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think
that piece of possibility

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.920
is very in line with
everything that we've

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.302
experienced with "Roadtrip."

00:42:11.302 --> 00:42:14.070
We had no idea how to film.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.240
We had no idea how
to write a book.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.450
But we figured there was
some baby steps that we

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.720
could take along the way.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.594
The other piece that I love is
this quote by Veronica Belmont.

00:42:26.594 --> 00:42:28.760
She says, "If you're really
passionate about a topic

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.218
and you want to
work in that field,

00:42:30.218 --> 00:42:32.450
you should already be doing it."

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.960
And I think that that
translates and is

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.140
a main piece for the
chapter in the book

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.440
called Practice Shmactice--
the idea that-- what

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.736
your coaches would always say
is-- practice makes perfect.

00:42:44.736 --> 00:42:47.110
And I think we would really
say that from our experience,

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.090
doing makes perfect.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.110
There probably is no
such thing as perfect.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.360
But it's the actual
act of doing.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.890
If you want to be
an actor, you're

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.120
an actor the second you
turn that camera on yourself

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.030
and start acting.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.785
If you want to be
a writer, you're

00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:02.010
a writer the second
you start a blog.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.530
If you're into editing,
start that now.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.120
I think the world
has changed in a way

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.100
that the avenues to get
into something that you're

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.280
interested are right
in front of us.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.480
We could open a store
on Etsy for free.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.260
We can do all of these
different things.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.790
There are many different ways
to engage in your interest.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.760
And her point, I think,
is just so poignant

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.670
because we should
already be doing it.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.035
We should already be
using every decision

00:43:26.035 --> 00:43:29.855
that we make in tying that into
the interests that we have.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:37.990
The other piece-- as we think
about becoming, is failure.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.900
And this is a guy that we
interviewed, Craig Brewer.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.350
He wrote a film called
"Hustle &amp; Flow."

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:48.480
And the song in "Hustle &amp; Flow"
was nominated for an Oscar.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.430
And he was an amazing guy who
told us this story about a film

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.940
that he had shot,
spent $40,000 on,

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.350
and never-- it was
so bad he didn't even

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.662
pay to have it developed.

00:44:02.662 --> 00:44:04.630
Can you imagine spending
$40,000 on something

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.660
and then just saying it's so
bad I can't go any further?

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.410
So this is somebody that was
really experienced in failure.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.400
And if you ever see the
film "Hustle &amp; Flow,"

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.710
it very much ties into
his own personal story

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.945
in a very dynamic way.

00:44:17.945 --> 00:44:19.570
But he talked about
getting to failure.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.465
And I think that
the idea of failure

00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:24.090
is something that we
hear all the time,

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.465
like, learn from your failures,
learn from your failures.

00:44:26.465 --> 00:44:30.600
And I know culturally at Google
this probably resonates well.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.519
You guys are exceptionally
well at just rapid iteration.

00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:36.560
But I think for the most
part, when we apply this

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.730
to our lives, learn from your
failures translates into avoid

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.610
failing, and then if
you do, just cover it

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.027
up by saying I'm learning.

00:44:45.027 --> 00:44:47.110
And Craig takes a totally
different approach here.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.050
He says if you want
to get to something,

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.330
you have to actually
seek out failure.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.954
And I'll let him do the talking.

00:44:53.954 --> 00:44:56.370
MALE SPEAKER: I wanted to go
into film when I was younger,

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.170
but I didn't feel
like I had what

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.765
it takes to become a filmmaker.

00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:06.745
I didn't feel like I could put
out my creativity out there.

00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.577
I didn't feel I had
the guts to do that.

00:45:08.577 --> 00:45:09.660
CRAIG BREWER: Interesting.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.850
MALE SPEAKER: So now I
feel like I could do it,

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.020
but I guess that's
the main question

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.150
for me is like-- one
of the main questions

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.970
is, what are my fears?

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.100
CRAIG BREWER: What
are some of them?

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.710
MALE SPEAKER: Fear of failure
is definitely always there.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.290
CRAIG BREWER: Well, are you
perfectly clear on the fact

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.860
that you will?

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.560
Are you cool with that?

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.236
I mean, you know that you're
going to fail repeatedly.

00:45:36.236 --> 00:45:37.130
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.640
CRAIG BREWER: Yeah.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.800
I mean, it's going to happen.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.883
I mean, the only way that
you're going to get good

00:45:40.883 --> 00:45:41.570
is if you fail.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:46.110
So get to failing.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.889
Get that process going.

00:45:48.889 --> 00:45:50.430
Don't put that off
because it's going

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.770
to hurt more when you're older.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.990
And what ends up
happening that I've seen

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.250
is people don't want that hurt.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.610
And so they get
married, they have kids,

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.340
and then they blame
their families

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.300
and their circumstances
for the fact

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.010
that they didn't want to fail.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.210
They didn't want to risk.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.030
They didn't want to
feel that kind of pain.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:18.140
So I say that if you want
that enrichment of success,

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.790
then get busy failing
because it will happen.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.580
NATHAN GEBHARD: And when we
talk about which failures

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.350
do you choose, I
think most of us

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.710
think in this duality
of safe versus risk.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.630
And we had this great interview
with Jonathan Poneman.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.520
He was the founder
of Sub Pop Records.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.030
They covered anybody or
managed anybody from Nirvana

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.610
all the way up to The Shins.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:49.160
And he said, if you look at
making decisions between safety

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.760
and risk, the natural
inclination that we

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.220
as humans have is to
protect and not to choose

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.030
some risky things,
is to be safe.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.930
And he said the
way he approached

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.180
life and the
perspective shift that

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.840
enabled him to make
those decisions

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.490
was to change the dynamic and
make the decisions not on what

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.010
is safe or risky, but on what
is necessary versus unnecessary.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.880
For him, happiness
was necessary.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.610
For us, it might be our
family is necessary.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.490
Whatever it is that is
necessary versus unnecessary,

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.950
it's a much easier way to
look at a yes or no decision,

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.640
what things do you explore.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.140
Those things that give you life,
those things are necessary,

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:31.590
versus worrying about
things that are risky.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.340
To leave you guys with
a challenge today,

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.570
we thought just very simply,
reflect on your own roadmap.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.970
Reflect on the thing
that drives you,

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.590
that the thing that you would
be happy doing no matter what,

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.682
that foundational element
and those interests combined.

00:47:45.682 --> 00:47:47.390
If you were to shed
that noise and really

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.590
think about how all of
that could come together

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:54.260
in a dynamic way, very
simply just today,

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.110
what's your adjacent possible?

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.820
What's the small,
little thing that you

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.094
could do today that just
gets you one step further?

00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:01.510
And it might be
that you're loving

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.426
exactly what you're doing
now, but how can you

00:48:03.426 --> 00:48:04.510
take it further?

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.260
Can you follow somebody
new on Twitter?

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.950
Can you take a new class?

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.700
Can you explore some interest
that you've never had?

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.260
Whatever it is, break it down
into some baby, baby step,

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.890
and just go for it.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:20.720
And to close it off,
before Q&amp;A-- this

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.361
is how we closed the book.

00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:24.860
If you open up the book, this
is the last quote in the book.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.160
And rather than read it to you,
I'd rather her just share it.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.840
So this is Staceyann Chin.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.720
She's a poet and activist
we interviewed in New York.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.110
STACEYANN CHIN:
Attempt the impossible,

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:40.910
do the crazy, stand
on a limb, and teeter.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.780
I say, teeter away.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:50.450
Reach, leap, attempt things that
everyone says can't be done.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:57.430
Run, jump, move, walk,
get your crazy done.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.910
You are your bravest self.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.610
And when I say brave, I
don't mean the quiet courage

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:06.550
that it takes to raise a child.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:12.490
I mean the courage to do
what no one else is doing.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.930
These are the years
to climb a mountain.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.740
These are the years
to break an arm.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.800
These are the years
to fall in love

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.160
and recover and fall in
love again and recover

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.050
and to make love in
100 different cities

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:32.620
and shave your head
and take a year off

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.380
from your life to
do something that

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.640
makes no sense to anyone else.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.486
Do it, do it, do it
now, and live it.

00:49:42.486 --> 00:49:43.860
If you want to
write, if you want

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.550
to make films, anything
you want to do,

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.180
you have to live to be
able to do it first.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:48.815
So live.

00:49:48.815 --> 00:49:50.680
Live, live, live, live.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.910
Get it out of your
system, so that when

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.660
it is that you have
an ankle that is sore

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.140
and you have bills
to pay, that there

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.409
are no regrets behind you.

00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:03.950
The heaviest thing you will have
to carry as you move forward

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:05.110
is regret.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.115
Make sure you're not
carrying too much.

00:50:08.115 --> 00:50:09.490
NATHAN GEBHARD:
So with that, I'd

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:11.550
like to bring up
my other co-authors

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.820
and field any Q&amp;A
that you guys have.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.840
So as a matter of
introduction here,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.160
we have Alyssa, who
runs all of our copy,

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.010
Willie, who directs our
public television series,

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:24.860
Jamie, who's also a
director and filmer,

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.070
and Annie who runs all of
our educational curriculum.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.572
So this is the team that
put this book together.

00:50:30.572 --> 00:50:32.280
There's a much larger
team at the office,

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.680
but primarily this
was that core team.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.970
None of us are writers.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:37.730
We all do different things.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.080
ALYSSA FRANK: Hey, hey,
let's be [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.038
NATHAN GEBHARD: Oh, OK.

00:50:40.038 --> 00:50:40.880
Sorry.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.110
ALYSSA FRANK: This is
how I pay the bills.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.318
NATHAN GEBHARD: Aside from
Alyssa, we're not writers.

00:50:44.318 --> 00:50:46.925
So with that, if you
guys have any questions,

00:50:46.925 --> 00:50:49.437
we can jump into that or
I'm sure you guys probably

00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:51.020
have some things
that I missed and you

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.520
can share that or share some
experience of writing the book.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.360
I think a fun fact
here is that we really

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.760
wrote the book on a Google Doc.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.550
[? Yeah. ?]

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.320
NATHAN GEBHARD: So
thank you for that.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.450
We really appreciate it.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.280
MALE SPEAKER: I had a question
about the interests element

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.490
of it because it also is to say,
oh, just follow your interests.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.776
And a lot of people don't
know-- and especially when

00:51:09.776 --> 00:51:11.275
I mentor students
and stuff, they'll

00:51:11.275 --> 00:51:12.570
say, well, I like basketball.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.620
It's like everybody's not
going to be in the NBA.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.010
And there's not a lot of
those opportunities out there.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.510
Getting into sports marketing
is really difficult and stuff.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.430
So how do you choose
which interest to pursue.

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:24.930
And then also, how
do you identify

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:29.490
what interests are the passion
points or the strong ones,

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.090
I guess?

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.590
WILLIE WITTE: I'll start by
just saying the first thing that

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.006
came to my mind-- because I
think you're absolutely right.

00:51:35.006 --> 00:51:36.160
That's an awesome point.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.680
So I come from the public
television series side.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.716
And so a part of my job is to go
through this pool of applicants

00:51:41.716 --> 00:51:43.840
of young people that are
looking for what they want

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.964
to do with their life and
take them out on the road

00:51:45.964 --> 00:51:48.740
and try and get into their heads
and capture their journeys.

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:52.987
And I think the biggest
element of that experience

00:51:52.987 --> 00:51:55.070
and a lot of what we're
trying to do with the book

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.986
is to emulate this element
of that experience.

00:51:56.986 --> 00:51:58.660
And that's the
exposure side of it.

00:52:02.492 --> 00:52:03.950
And basketball's
a perfect example.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.408
When we go to high schools and
we bring our curriculum out,

00:52:06.408 --> 00:52:08.346
that actually comes up
maybe 50% of the time.

00:52:08.346 --> 00:52:09.720
I want to be a
basketball player.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.636
And one of the first
things that we tell them,

00:52:11.636 --> 00:52:14.035
and one of the things that
is a good metaphor for what

00:52:14.035 --> 00:52:15.910
happens no matter what
they're interested in,

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:18.222
is realizing how deep
that rabbit hole actually

00:52:18.222 --> 00:52:19.680
goes within the
world of basketball

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.430
and how many different types of
jobs there are in that realm.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:28.410
And so that exposure piece is
a huge part that comes from,

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.110
I think, pursuing
that initial interest,

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:33.280
and then seeing what
else comes around that.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.820
And I think what Nate brought
up in the beginning, which

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.341
is the cyclical nature
of the roadmap experience

00:52:41.341 --> 00:52:42.840
that we were trying
to come up with,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.090
is go into which
ones do you explore.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.070
It's almost like instead
of picking that one that's

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.140
going to be the one that
you stick with forever,

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.390
it's more like pick
that first one.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.070
What's next?

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.680
What do you want
to try right now?

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.137
And then once you
get into that world,

00:52:58.137 --> 00:53:00.720
you start experiencing that, a
lot of things will be revealed,

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.930
like, am I good at it?

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.280
Or, is it as interesting?

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.340
Is it sustainable?

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.744
All these things
will be revealed

00:53:08.744 --> 00:53:11.160
to the point where at some
point-- like I have in my life,

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.285
I think like how most people
that we've interviewed

00:53:13.285 --> 00:53:15.320
have in their
life-- they'll have

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.070
to step back and reevaluate
that and maybe think,

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.240
oh yeah, actually now
I'm interested in this.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.307
So that's where that
cyclical nature comes in.

00:53:23.307 --> 00:53:25.890
And I think that that's one of
the most comforting things I've

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:28.680
seen the road-trippers learn
when they're out there is,

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.755
oh, I'm not deciding
what I'm doing forever.

00:53:30.755 --> 00:53:35.840
I'm deciding what I'm doing this
year, and I'll reevaluate that.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.680
And like Jimmy Chin,
like so many people, what

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.160
I did choose, what
I did explore,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.350
will become valuable
in some unexpected way.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:44.460
But, yeah.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.530
ALYSSA FRANK: I think it's
also about recognizing

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:54.970
how your interests
intersects with your skills.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:54:00.180
Because, yeah, I think a lot
of us think so myopically.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.597
Like, oh, I like basketball.

00:54:01.597 --> 00:54:02.430
I want to be Jordan.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.940
Oh, I like rap music.

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.915
I want to be a rapper.

00:54:04.915 --> 00:54:07.660
And I think that it's
about recognizing,

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.287
OK, well, maybe
with basketball--

00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:13.120
I certainly couldn't
be a basketball player,

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.510
but I could write about it.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.410
I could get into marketing.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.010
I could design the ball.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:24.430
There's just I think an
infinite amount of ways

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.800
to materialize your interests.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.300
And it's not always
obvious, but you

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.990
have to just figure out
where they align together

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.744
with your skills.

00:54:34.744 --> 00:54:37.160
There's a chapter in the book
called Skills Pay the Bills.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.430
So obviously you have to attach
it to some economic engine

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.840
in order to have a career
that pays those bills.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.720
MALE SPEAKER: So it seems
like a lot of the folks who

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.280
were on those road trips,
they were young people, right?

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.740
People who were right out
of college or early 20's,

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.260
that kind of age group.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.550
Do you think that your
message changes at all

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:05.530
for people who are not that
young, who are maybe mid-career

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:09.570
or later in life?

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.855
Does the calculus change
as far as risk tolerance?

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.747
How do you convey your
message to people who aren't

00:55:19.747 --> 00:55:20.955
in that same age demographic?

00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:24.610
Or is it the exact same?

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:25.590
NATHAN GEBHARD: You go.

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.340
ANNIE MAIS: That's a
really good question.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.660
And we get that question often.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.760
And I think Nate
touched upon it too--

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.550
just the idea of
these inflection

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:35.140
points, and that whether
you're a middle school

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.860
student, someone who is just
entering college, graduating

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.010
from college, trying
to figure out,

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.713
is this first job of
mine right for me,

00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:44.296
do I need another job, what am
I going to do next, all the way

00:55:44.296 --> 00:55:47.283
to, oh no, I retired, but
I still have 30 years left

00:55:47.283 --> 00:55:48.840
to live, what am I going to do?

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.085
I think whenever you're
at a place in your life

00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:52.710
where you have to
start thinking, well,

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.055
what do I enjoy, and maybe
it's changed a little bit,

00:55:56.055 --> 00:55:57.930
I think you can still
go back to this process

00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:59.013
of let go; define; become.

00:55:59.013 --> 00:56:02.700
And I know, Nate, you've spoken
a lot about just the risk then

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.820
and the change in
that equation that you

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.030
were talking about that what
if you have a mortgage to pay?

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.800
What if you have
four children at home

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.400
and you might not be able to
just pick up and get in a van

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.760
and go climb a mountain?

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.220
So it does definitely change.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.840
But I think that's why we tried
to simplify the message of let

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.380
go; define; become, because you
can alter each of those three

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.590
words to fit where you're
at, at whichever inflection

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:25.360
point you're at.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.840
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think you
hit the nail on the head

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.340
from my perspective, which
is that tolerance of risk.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.680
Where we were at when we
started "Roadtrip," sure,

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.890
we could leave for three
months and do that deal.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.550
Now with three
young daughters, I

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:39.930
don't have that flexibility or
that ability to take that leap.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:44.120
A really good example of that is
this guy named Tinker Hatfield.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.450
He came from a sports
family, but came out

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:52.300
and was working as an architect
and really found himself

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.510
wanting that sports piece.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:58.930
And he didn't say, oh, I'm
just going to quit and start

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.110
a totally new life.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:03.220
I think his approach was,
how can I take a lateral move

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.550
into the sports piece?

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:11.620
And for him, as he divulged into
his own interest, it was sports

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.030
and it was design.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:17.260
And architecture's a proximity
to that, but it's not true.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.860
And so what he did is
he literally just went,

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.320
well, maybe I can be
an architect at Nike.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.470
And so he made
this lateral move.

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:27.160
And then once he was at Nike,
then he started drilling down.

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.493
And so it wasn't like, I'm
going to quit, make no money,

00:57:29.493 --> 00:57:30.700
live in my car story.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.380
It was, OK, I've got
these responsibilities.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.090
I'll make a lateral move,
and then I'll move down.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:38.800
And he is ultimately the guy
that led all of the design work

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.970
for all of Jordan shoes.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:42.030
And he's now the Vice
President of Innovation.

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.785
And I think it's about
adjusting that level of risk

00:57:44.785 --> 00:57:45.910
for that time in your life.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.960
And certainly earlier and later,
there's those opportunities,

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.050
particularly as it
relates to family,

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.196
where you've got more latitude.

00:57:53.196 --> 00:57:54.820
And sometimes those
leaps can be bigger

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.750
and sometimes they need
to be more incremental.

00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:57.200
JAMIE ZEHLER: Yeah.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.120
And one thought that I had
[? while ?] you were talking

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.828
about that-- and it's
not so much related

00:58:00.828 --> 00:58:03.489
to risk-- but I think
working here and seeing all

00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:05.530
these interviews, one of
the big things I've seen

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:09.057
is reevaluating how much you're
allowed to change who you are

00:58:09.057 --> 00:58:10.890
in your life and at
what age you're supposed

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:11.848
to have it figured out.

00:58:11.848 --> 00:58:15.450
And so lots of people who've
gone back to school at 30, 40,

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.030
50, and getting rid of
the noise that there's

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:21.390
an expectation of at 20 you
have to have it figured out

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.181
and that's who you are
for your whole life,

00:58:23.181 --> 00:58:25.172
and opening up the
possibility of like,

00:58:25.172 --> 00:58:26.880
it's OK to decide that
you're going to be

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.570
somebody else at 40 or 50.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.652
And socially, I think that's not
really acceptable necessarily,

00:58:32.652 --> 00:58:35.110
but hearing it over and over
again from multiple people who

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.740
have done it has, for me, broken
down the sense of one identity

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.026
for your whole life.

00:58:40.026 --> 00:58:42.604
NATHAN GEBHARD: Pam Gaber is
a good story in that respect.

00:58:42.604 --> 00:58:43.395
JAMIE ZEHLER: Yeah.

00:58:43.395 --> 00:58:45.936
ALYSSA FRANK: Yeah, I think we
get so defined by our careers.

00:58:45.936 --> 00:58:48.610
I think when you go to a party
the question is, what do you

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:49.680
do?

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:56.050
And it's sort of the sole
source of our identity.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.430
But we all have this plethora
of interests that we pursue.

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:02.260
And the things that we
might be most interested in

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.430
isn't even the thing
we do 40 hours a week.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.590
But I think we live in
a time where there's

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:12.569
unprecedented resources
to explore those things

00:59:12.569 --> 00:59:14.110
and cultivate those
little interests.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:18.720
YouTube tutorials,
lynda.com, there's

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:23.180
just so many resources out
there to take little steps.

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.880
And it doesn't have
to be a giant leap.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.820
But I think that those
iterative, little things, they

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.899
accumulate over time and
can lead to [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:32.899 --> 00:59:34.940
NATHAN GEBHARD: Well,
thank you, guys, very much.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.540
Thanks, guys.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.690
