00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.660
- [Instructor] We are
told a transverse wave

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.030
travels to the right along a string,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.620
they draw it right over here.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.330
Two dots have been painted on the string.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.980
In the diagrams below, those
dots are labeled P and Q,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.950
so that's these dots here.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.180
The figure below shows the
string at an instant in time.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.620
At the instant shown, dot
P has maximum displacement

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.960
and dot Q has zero
displacement from equilibrium.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.370
At each of the dots P and Q, draw an arrow

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.640
indicating the direction
of the instantaneous

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.740
velocity of that dot.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.990
If either dot has zero velocity,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.160
write V equals zero next to the dot.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.250
So pause this video and
see if you can have a go

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.900
at it on your own before I
work through it with you.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.460
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.110
So, let's think about the
instantaneous velocity

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.940
of this dot right over here.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.500
And to help us think about it,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.190
let's think about what's going on

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.990
on either side of this dot.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200
So, if we think about this
point right over here,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.450
what's gonna happen a little bit after

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390
this moment in time we're looking at?

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.020
Well, the wave is
traveling in that direction

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770
so in a little while,
the wave is gonna look,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.970
in a moment after that,
the wave is gonna look

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.800
something like this.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.150
The wave is gonna look
something like this.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.480
So, this dot is in the
process of moving down.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.090
And what about this dot right over here?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.830
Well, this dot a little bit later

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.780
is going to be higher, so it's moving up.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770
And it's this point where
we're at our maximum,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.490
when we're at our maximum
displacement from equilibrium,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.130
we are going from moving down to going up

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.250
right at that moment.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.570
So right at this moment
of maximum displacement,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.550
we have zero velocity.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.110
So let me do that in
red so you can see it.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.290
So here, at point P, we would
write V is equal to zero.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.710
Now what about at point Q?

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.520
Well, we just sketched
what's going to happen

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.410
a moment later.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.500
Our transverse wave is
gonna look like this

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.090
and so point Q is going to be up here.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.220
So point Q is moving upwards.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.810
So if we want to draw its velocity vector,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.810
it would look something like that.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.960
Now let's do the next part.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.650
The figure below shows the
string at the same instant

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.490
as shown in part A-one.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.540
At each of the dots P and Q, draw an arrow

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.170
indicating the direction
of the instantaneous

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.060
acceleration of that dot.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.810
If either dot has zero acceleration,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.700
write A equals zero next to the dot.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.780
So pause this video again and see

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.720
if you can have a go at it.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.740
One way to think about it
is all the points around P

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.220
and actually all the points
in this area right over here

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.950
are going to have a net
upward acceleration.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.840
So even though this point
for example right over here

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.720
has a velocity downwards,
that downward velocity

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.220
is becoming less and less
and less as you get closer

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.840
to P and then it flips around,
becomes an upward velocity,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.190
and becomes more and more
upward as we get closer

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.660
and closer to this point.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.580
So everything in this area right over here

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.060
has a net upward acceleration.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.540
So P would have a net
upward acceleration as well.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.700
It has zero instantaneous velocity

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.810
but we're, at that
moment, we're going from

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.070
a downward velocity to an upward velocity.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.713
So we have an upward acceleration.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.530
What about at point Q?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.790
Well, one interesting thing to appreciate

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.760
is that everything in this
region right over here

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.584
has an upward acceleration
and everything over here

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.370
has a downward acceleration,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.140
and then everything over here
has an upward acceleration.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.700
And so point Q is at that transition point

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.350
where we're going from
a downward acceleration

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.200
to an upward acceleration.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.800
And so here, right at
that point at this moment,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370
you're going to have zero acceleration.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.163
So here, we write
acceleration is equal to zero.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.820
And then it says, the
figure below represents

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.980
the string at time t equals zero,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.600
the same instant as shown in part A

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.230
where dot P is at its maximum
displacement from equilibrium.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.940
For simplicity, dot Q is not shown.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.940
On the grid below, draw
the string at a later time,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.140
time t is equal to
capital T divided by four,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.750
where capital T is the period of the wave.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.390
So pause this video again
and see if you could do that,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.460
you can even sketch it out
if you don't have access

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.630
to this drawing right here.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.920
To think about a full period,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.690
we can look at a full
wavelength of this wave

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.570
and so one way to do it
is you start at a point

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.410
and then you see, well
how far do you have to go

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.870
to get to this same point again?

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.020
So we went up, we go down,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.286
you could say we're at the same point

00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:59.700
but here, we're going up,
and here we're going down.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.300
So we wanna go back to
when we're going back up.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.950
So that is a full wavelength.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.910
A full wavelength here is 24 centimeters.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.110
So after one-fourth of a period,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.890
this wave would've shifted
one-fourth of this length.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.670
And so, one-fourth would
be one of these sections

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.760
right over here.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.980
So all I will do is draw the same wave

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.180
but instead of starting
here, I'm gonna start here.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.570
One-fourth of a wave length to the right.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.530
But then I'll draw the exact same wave.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.060
It just shifted.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.980
So notice, it has shifted one-fourth

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.323
of a wavelength to the right.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.520
And so it will look something

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.150
like that.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.210
And then if we look at the
next parts of the question,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.090
on your drawing above, draw a
dot to indicate the position

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.170
of point P on the string
at time t is equal

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.110
to the period divided by
four and clearly label

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.180
the dot with the letter P.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.890
So let's just remind ourselves
of where P was before.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.270
P is at this point that's halfway

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.280
between 12 and 24 centimeters.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.960
So that's gonna be at 18 centimeters.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.940
So it's right over here.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.930
So at this point, P is
going to be right over here.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.810
So from T is equal to zero to T is equal

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.600
to the period divided by four,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.713
P went from down here up to here.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.210
And then last but not least, it says

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.710
now consider the wave at time
T is equal to a full period.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.030
Determine the distance
traveled, not the displacement,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.510
by dot P between the times t equals zero

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.850
and t is equal to capital T.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.170
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.860
So we already saw at
time t is equal to zero,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.780
P is right over here.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.180
And so what's gonna
happen over a full period?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.440
Well, over that time
period, P is gonna move

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.770
all the way up to positive
eight centimeters on our Y axis

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.360
and then all the way back
down over a full period.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.790
And so if you this displacement,
you'd say it's zero,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.940
you're back to where you
started but the distance,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.180
well it would've traveled
eight, 16 centimeters up

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.900
and then 16 centimeters back down.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.223
So the distance traveled
would be 32 centimeters.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.373
And we're done.
