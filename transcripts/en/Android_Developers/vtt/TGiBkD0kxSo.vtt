Hello everyone, this is Dael Yu, CEO and Game Creator at Daeri Soft.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.748
We have been developing light games

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.348
like casual games or puzzle games since 2008.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.298
Currently, our main title is Freestyle Baseball 2.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.368
My experience as a graphic designer for games gave me the motivation to enter the games industry.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.198
You know, everybody dreams about creating their own game.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.748
So I jumped into games industry with my retirement allowance.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.998
Free style Baseball 1 is a PvP game, matching players from all around world in real time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.028
I found out that the Real-time Multiplayer function from Google Play game service supports

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.648
both server functions and player-matching with global users.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.348
I had a very good experience while using those services.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.698
It turns out that player retention and real time multiplayer were closely related.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.898
Our game was released in September and displayed in the Global Featured section.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.898
The game was exposed to about 140 countries.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.178
We got 130K downloads per day

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.698
and 1M downloads per month.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.998
The download figures were as follows.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.298
15% in America,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.898
10% in Korea,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.398
10% in Japan

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.498
and 8% in Taiwan.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.048
In terms of retention figures, we had about 45% per day

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.448
in the case of Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.418
In the case of America, the figure is about 35~40% per a day.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.498
In addition, we received a lot of help when we conducted pretesting.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.298
First, we tried an icon,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.598
the figures of download increased by about 10~15%.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.798
As I mentioned before, the result came out 10% increase whenever we proceeded to step 2 and step 3.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.698
It showed great increase of about 200~300% when we conduct last step.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.548
As a result, we have a very positive situation,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.348
because the total download figure hit 130K per day for global markets.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.168
We have a plan to utilize the real-time API function of Google Play

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.468
so that gamers all over the world can easily enjoy the Freestyle Sport World built by Daeri Soft.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.348
We will do our very best to become a global sports game developer.
