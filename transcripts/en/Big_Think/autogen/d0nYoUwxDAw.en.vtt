00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780
what we know is that when you do brain
 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.990
what we know is that when you do brain
imaging studies of people with OCD and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
imaging studies of people with OCD and
 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.020
imaging studies of people with OCD and
you compare their brain to the brain of

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030
you compare their brain to the brain of
 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.390
you compare their brain to the brain of
people who don't have OCD that there is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
people who don't have OCD that there is
 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.099
people who don't have OCD that there is
a hyperactive circuit in the brain

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109
a hyperactive circuit in the brain
 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.170
a hyperactive circuit in the brain
that's been linked to OCD and that

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180
that's been linked to OCD and that
 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.000
that's been linked to OCD and that
hyperactivity in that circuit has been

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010
hyperactivity in that circuit has been
 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.520
hyperactivity in that circuit has been
confirmed through animal studies now we

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530
confirmed through animal studies now we
 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.260
confirmed through animal studies now we
don't think it's only that circuit we

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
don't think it's only that circuit we
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.670
don't think it's only that circuit we
think there are other circuits that are

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680
think there are other circuits that are
 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920
think there are other circuits that are
likely involved as well but there's a

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930
likely involved as well but there's a
 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.850
likely involved as well but there's a
real clear neuroscience of this behavior

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860
real clear neuroscience of this behavior
 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.340
real clear neuroscience of this behavior
of obsessions and compulsions how the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350
of obsessions and compulsions how the
 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.370
of obsessions and compulsions how the
brain get that way and here we know less

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380
brain get that way and here we know less
 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.290
brain get that way and here we know less
about that what we do know is that in

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
about that what we do know is that in
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.990
about that what we do know is that in
some families but not in all families

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
some families but not in all families
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.420
some families but not in all families
OCD seems to run in those families and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
OCD seems to run in those families and
 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.850
OCD seems to run in those families and
certain genetic studies suggest that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860
certain genetic studies suggest that
 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.090
certain genetic studies suggest that
there is a familial contribution to OCD

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100
there is a familial contribution to OCD
 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.939
there is a familial contribution to OCD
but again not in all cases but exactly

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949
but again not in all cases but exactly
 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.879
but again not in all cases but exactly
how that particular brain circuit went

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889
how that particular brain circuit went
 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.210
how that particular brain circuit went
awry in that particular patient we don't

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220
awry in that particular patient we don't
 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.570
awry in that particular patient we don't
know that we're working on it we don't

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580
know that we're working on it we don't
 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.970
know that we're working on it we don't
know yet
