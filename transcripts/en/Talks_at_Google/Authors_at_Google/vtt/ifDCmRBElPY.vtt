MALE SPEAKER: Hello
and welcome, everyone,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.020
to another talk in our
Google authors series.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.590
Today we have a special speaker.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.070
Guy Spier is going to
talk about his book,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.040
"The Education of
a Value Investor."

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.450
I know at least a couple
people in this audience

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.840
who read this book in one night.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.000
And unlike most memoirs where
the person who's writing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.400
is the hero, this
is a strange book.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.560
This is a book where
the person who's writing

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.020
is highlighting his shortcomings
and putting a magnifying

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.660
glass to amplify the good
points in other people

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.430
that he's come across in his
journey of investing in life.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.130
And there is much more than
just investing in the book.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.120
And for those of us who
met Guy over lunch shortly

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.430
before this talk, it was
just privilege and honor

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.020
to share his company.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.860
He's a very lively, very
enthusiastic person,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.980
and I'm sure you're going to
get the same sense of candor

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.940
in the talk.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.350
So without further ado,
ladies and gentleman,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.370
let's welcome Guy Spier.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.030
GUY SPIER: Thank you everyone.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
I should tell you that I've done
TV appearances for this book.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm much more nervous
to come and speak

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.270
to you than I am to
speak on any television.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.350
And I had the
hardest time putting

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.730
this-- I put some slides
together-- I had the hardest

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.890
time doing it, partly
because I've never,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100
ever given a talk to what
is primarily-- I mean,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.510
I met some guys from
finance, that does exist--

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.850
but I've never given
the talk to engineers.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.780
And I feel like, especially on
the Google campus, you, I feel,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.530
know a lot more than
I do about the world.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.062
In fact, I'd like to sit
down and interview you,

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:44.520
but I guess that's
not how it goes.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.660
I need to talk about me.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.670
So I'm really
pleased to be here.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.420
I would also tell
you that if you

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.160
would have taken
me eight years ago

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and told-- asked me if I would
believe some of the things that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.610
happened in my life happened, I
would've been quite surprised.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.800
And I was after
success in my life,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.380
but I didn't really
know how to go about it.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.110
And I feel like over
the last few years,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.010
partly by stumbling across some
things and staying with them,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
partly through a tremendous,
very difficult beginning

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.280
to my career where I worked at
a terrible place, you will see,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.890
I started figuring
out-- and I don't know.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.910
I'm with a bunch of
scientists and engineers,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.530
and I studied sciences
at high school,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.490
but I feel like I
started figuring out

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.540
the ways in which
the universe works,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.500
maybe the laws of
attraction, and I'm just

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.920
blown away that
I'm standing here.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.340
Sarab meets me at
the airport yesterday

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.170
and he's so excited to meet
me, and he's treating me

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.120
like I'm some kind
of special person.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.530
I'm thinking, I'm just like you.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.160
I know as little as you do.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.490
So with that, I'm going to talk.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm going to try and keep
it to under half an hour.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.370
I'm just going to blast
through some things,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.950
just to give those of
you haven't read the book

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.200
a sense of who I am, and
what I want to talk about,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.700
and what I think
I can talk about,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.000
and then we can try
and make it attractive.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.220
So, what do we have here?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.670
I really think I don't
understand-- well,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.530
I do understand,
and it's got nothing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.300
to do with all the things that I
thought success had to do with.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.720
So I really I'm blown
away that I'm here,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.255
because I feel like
I'm quite normal.

00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:31.280
Or I'm like everyone else.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.590
I'm not-- I'm not
special in any way.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.591
And I never thought
I could write a book,

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.090
and there are some
incredible things

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.060
that came together for
me to write a book.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.670
I'm not a natural author
and I'm not a great writer.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.040
But that was the
guy that I wanted--

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.970
When I graduated
business school,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.840
I would never have said, if
one of you would have asked me,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.590
what do you want to be, I would
have given you some mumbo jumbo

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.160
about, I want to get
into the capital markets.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.150
And I find it really
interesting to be

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.900
at the nexus between where
savings meets investment,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.390
and it's really fascinating,
and maybe fund some companies.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.550
But basically I had
an image of this guy--

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.260
and I see that now, I
didn't see that then-- I

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.870
had an image of this Gordon
Gekko guy in my head,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.899
and I kind of fancy
that lifestyle.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.720
I wanted to be a
master of the universe.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.490
I'd read about people
like George Soros

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.290
and I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.330
And I wanted to be rich.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.830
I wanted to control companies.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.380
I wanted to control people.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.870
And I had an
educational experience

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.100
that I think that
many of us have had.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.170
I know how to take exams.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.590
I'm quite good at studying.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.750
If you put me under
pressure I do well.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.310
And so I blasted
through my education

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.210
and I thought the
world owed me living.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.800
And don't ask me how-- well,
I guess you can ask me,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.270
because I'm here
for you to ask me.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.350
So I graduate business
school and I end up

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.900
working at a place.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.190
So, I don't know, I'm sure some
of us have seen this movie.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.750
So the firm that this
was modeled after

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.820
is called Stratton Oakmont.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.640
And the firm that I worked
at, where the large part of it

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.370
is being shut down, is called,
or was called, D.H. Blair.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.900
And there were people who
came from Stratton Oakmont

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.600
to D.H. Blair and vice versa.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.050
So I was an investment
banker looking for deals,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.110
and I watched that movie
and I thought, wow,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.730
that is really-- it's
exaggerated, but accurate.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.650
So they take it-- they take
exactly the same things that

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.320
were happening at the
firm that I worked at

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.340
and they turned the volume up.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.290
And I ask myself today why on
earth I went to work there,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.810
but then even having
gone to work there-- I

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.690
spent 18 months there.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.980
And so within 18
months of graduating

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.500
from Harvard Business School
with this great education,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.290
and I was unemployable,
because once I left that place,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.800
and I did finally
leave that place,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.960
people either said,
either this guy who's

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.140
willing to play close to
the line the way people

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.110
from Stratton Oakmont
and D.H. Blair did play,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.360
or he's just stupid, either
way, we don't want to hire him.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.000
And I also, when I go
back and look at it,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.140
and I see people like this guy
[? Mark ?] Martoma, who's just

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.184
been given nine years in
prison, I would like to say,

00:06:28.184 --> 00:06:30.100
and I think many people
would say, oh no, well

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.200
I'm completely different to him.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.200
And I'd like to stand
here in front of you

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.740
and say, oh, I was.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.120
I think there's a
lot of me in him.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.600
There's lot of him in me.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.690
I was a greedy guy willing
to make compromises

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.050
and some-- the head
of the firm two years

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.830
prior had promised
me the opportunity

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.671
to make a lot of money very
fast and I went for it.

00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:54.170
And I was in the place where
in order to make a lot of money

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.560
very fast, I would have
to push the boundaries.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.260
That's the way it was set up.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.520
[? Mark ?] Martoma,
the same thing.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.200
He was put in a position where
in order to make a lot of money

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.710
he would push the boundaries.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.340
The senior people
at his firm, just

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.270
as the senior people at
my firm, knew exactly what

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.050
situation they'd put me In.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.810
And I actually, to this day,
I think that if I had not

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.620
discovered this savior, Warren
Buffett, who I started reading

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.374
about while I was
working at this firm,

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.540
I don't know exactly what
would have happened to me,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.370
and it kind of scary
to think about.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.400
And I see [? Mark ?]
Martoma and I think, maybe

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.640
I would have gone
in that direction.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.600
And it also bothers
me terribly to know

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.710
that I'm really well-educated,
I studied moral philosophy,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.110
I was at Oxford, I had all
these philosophers around me.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.050
That's what we do.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.750
We study right and wrong.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.260
And how is it possible that
I am then finding myself

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.540
in the place that is
morally compromised

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.172
and I don't actually get
the hell out of there,

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.380
or I don't blow the whistle,
or I don't do something?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.220
I think that's a really
important question

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.440
for American society,
global capitalism to answer.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.500
I don't think it's
been fully answered.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.200
I think that there are people
like me, the version of me

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.840
20 years ago, who
will always go back.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.590
There will always be young
guys who want to get rich fast.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.340
And so the [? Mark ?]
Martoma's or the rogue traders

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.780
will always exist.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.426
And so what do
you do about that?

00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:22.300
Well, one thing you can
do is write about it.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.130
Try and write about it
honestly, and then maybe you

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.480
generate a debate,
and maybe the world

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.400
sees a few things differently.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.480
So I was at an absolute
low, and there I

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.010
am, a highly educated
guy, and I couldn't

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.490
find the-- I couldn't
find a job out of there.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.310
And so something happens to me
which is absolutely wonderful.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.400
I discover Anthony Robbins.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.940
So I don't know who's been to
an Anthony Robbins seminar,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.860
but the amazing thing
is I was so arrogant.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.912
And I thought that
I knew everything,

00:08:54.912 --> 00:08:57.370
and that everything to learn
was to be learned from Harvard

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.570
Business School and from
Oxford and similar places,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.400
that I didn't believe that
a guy like Anthony Robbins

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.850
could teach me anything.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.912
But at around that time I came
and did an Anthony Robbins

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:08.620
seminar, actually not
far away from here.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.390
It was somewhere
in the Bay Area.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.550
And it kind of opened
me up to a whole new way

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.810
of looking at the world.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.700
And again, I think that
I started figuring out

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.950
rules for how to improve
my life from that point.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.850
And then fast
forward 10 years, I

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.240
got some modicum of success and
people start misattributing it.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.406
They start saying,
oh yeah, you have--

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:37.110
you went to this elite
educational, you're very smart.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.040
Or you have the right friends.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.195
Or you have-- there's
a family business

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:43.290
that invested with you.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.890
And I felt like they were
misattributing any success

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.510
that I had to the wrong
things and I found myself

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.879
time and time telling people,
no, it's not like that.

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.420
There are other
things that happened.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.660
There are other things that
actually-- this sort of sounds

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.930
strange to say There's
a technology of success.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.220
There's a top technology of
going about succeeding in life

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.300
that I didn't-- I learned it
because I had this terrible

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.730
fall straight out
of business school.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.460
So if there's three ideas that I
would love for you to take away

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.820
from this talk, I'll feel
like I've achieved something.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.135
So you thought you're coming
to hear a talk about investing.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.690
Everybody understands compound
interest and the key thing

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.720
is-- and humans evolved
to be hunter gatherers.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.154
That's how our brains are wired.

00:10:36.154 --> 00:10:38.070
A whole bunch of things
we don't do very well,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.750
we don't evaluate
probabilities very well.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.290
And we cannot conceive
of compound interest.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.600
We cannot conceive of something
gradually increasing and then

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.100
the linear slope of
that keeps going up.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.440
We just think in terms
of linear slopes.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.910
And I feel like
once I understood

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.000
that I saw that all the time.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.750
So there's this idea
that compound interest

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:05.987
is the eighth miracle of-- is
the eighth wonder of the world.

00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:08.320
And it's quite extraordinary
that if you just compound--

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.740
and you can do the numbers,
I show them to my investors

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.430
every year-- if
you just compound

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.870
any rate for a long
period of time,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.600
then the amounts get very,
very large very, very quickly.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.840
But the point that
I want to put to you

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.510
is that you can compound
goodwill over time.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:31.190
And so, as part of
my journey, I started

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.010
in-- I ended up
starting to invest

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.720
and I fell in love with Warren
Buffett and Charlie Munger.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.350
Anything Warren Buffett and
Charlie Munger I'd consume it.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.570
Charlie Munger gave
a talk where he

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.750
talks about the 24 standard
causes of human misjudgements.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.970
Anybody who hasn't listen
to that talk, believe me:

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.956
it's better time spent
listening to that talk

00:11:51.956 --> 00:11:52.830
than listening to me.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:58.500
It's really an amazing set of
24 things that once I heard it

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.260
I started seeing those
patterns again and again.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.430
So [INAUDIBLE]
talks in the book--

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.080
talks in his book,
"The Psychology

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.490
of Human Misjudgement," about
the power of reciprocation.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.660
And he talks about these
Hare Krishna people

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.707
in airports, where they
handing out flowers.

00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.790
They're giving out free
flowers and you say, well,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.350
why are you giving
me a free flower?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.620
They say, this is just
to a gift from us.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.600
10 yards later there's a place
where you can make a donation

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.390
and it's just
incredibly effective.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:33.060
So I started conducting
my own version of that

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.990
and I started just-- and it's
partly born out of desperation,

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.740
because the standard
routes to career success

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.190
were now closed to me--
I was handing out gifts

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.810
to the doorman, the person
I met in the street.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.150
I was writing thank
you notes to people.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.780
And I was determined, because
he describes also in the book

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.290
the salesman who was the most
successful car salesman who

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.430
sold I don't know how
many cars in a year,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.450
but he sent out
thousands of notes

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.620
that basically said, I like you.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.180
And so all of my friends
are looking at that

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.680
and they're saying,
that's ridiculous.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.590
That's not a strategy
for success in life.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.090
I mean, what is that
going to get you?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.500
It wasn't going to get
me anything short term,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.270
but I'm slightly crazy in that
way and when something grabs me

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.780
I just do it.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.720
Sometimes if it fascinates me
I do it with a great intensity.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.360
So I set myself the
goal of, I think

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.570
it was five notes, three
notes a day, five days a week,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.294
and just kept sending
out notes and sending out

00:13:38.294 --> 00:13:39.460
notes and sending out notes.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.190
And if I sum up the number
of pieces of direct mail

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.290
that I've sent out to the
planet, it's more than 10,000,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.218
it's probably more than 20,000
of 30,000 over the last eight

00:13:50.218 --> 00:13:50.980
or nine years.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.910
But I just think
that so much of what

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.800
is good has happened in
my life, including meeting

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.540
some key people, is the direct
result of just compounding

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.780
human goodwill.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.645
Simple as that.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.200
Just to take that
third idea, and I'm

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.210
excited to talk to a group
of engineers about this,

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.910
is-- I don't know if anybody's
played around in bathtubs,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.240
but take a rubber duck or
something in a bathtub,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.750
and if you start making
some waves in the bathtub,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.070
and if you start figuring
out, even with just a rubber

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.240
duck, if you start figuring
out the resonant frequency

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.520
of the bathtub, even with
the relatively small,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.200
not a very strong impetus,
you can eventually

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.220
get the whole bathtub
moving in one single wave.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.620
And I can't explain this
and I can't give you

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.640
scientific backup, but I think
that every person, or many

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.000
of the people that I see have
achieved success in life,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.310
is what they've actually
done is that they found a way

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.220
to interface to the
world in a frequency,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.310
and I don't know what
that frequency means,

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.430
but it's a frequency
that resonates.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.110
And once you start feeling
that resonation happen things

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.760
reinforce themselves
and crazy things happen.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.324
Like Sarab calls out
of the blue and says,

00:15:19.324 --> 00:15:21.240
do you want to come and
give a talk at Google,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.920
which just blows me away.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.430
Or, in the book, some people
who came out of the woodworks

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.620
to help me to-- I'm
not a great writer.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.320
I finished in December
with a so-so manuscript,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.820
and then a friend came
out of the woodworks who

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.270
helped me to turn it into
a really good manuscript.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.660
So that idea of finding
what is the frequency

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.990
with which I can
resonate in the world

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.060
that the world resonates back
for me is a really fluffy idea,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.970
but I found it really powerful.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:57.297
And if we just go back to
this idea of authenticity--

00:15:57.297 --> 00:15:58.880
there was a sudden
period in New York,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.230
I call it my New
York vortex, where

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.880
I was trying to be a big,
swinging appendage hedge fund

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.890
manager.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.190
And I was trying to resonate
with the world in that way,

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.230
and I'm a smart
enough guy that I

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.100
could do a pretty
good job of it.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.640
And so the world
started resonating back.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.340
And in a certain way I
got money into my fund.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.480
I got all sorts of-- some
good things were happening,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.290
but it didn't reflect
who I was on the inside.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.450
And so I couldn't really
be authentic about it.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.700
And I think that the people who
achieve extraordinary things

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.640
in the world are the
people who manage

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.570
to get the world
resonating on the outside.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.140
And they also--
that's the same sort

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.420
of resonance on the inside.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.460
And you have that amazing
statement by Mahatma Gandhi,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.750
"Be the change that you
want to see in the world."

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.190
And it's just amazing to see.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.630
I mean, he had that, so what he
felt the whole nation of India

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.320
was focused on.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.199
What he felt about
violence, for example,

00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:57.490
and he'd go on a hunger strike.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.450
And people like that can become
extraordinarily effective.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.619
And it's just an interesting
idea and I bring it up later.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:13.079
So whenever I was not succeeding
in the world, what I eventually

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.849
found out was that if
I looked inside myself

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.750
and looked to reorder, or
to do work inside myself,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.680
the outside world
took care of itself.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.520
So I hope I get that across.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.210
And I don't have a watch,
because basically at around 30

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.270
minutes I am just gonna stop.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.095
So you know that I'm not
an engineer, but-- yeah,

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.775
but I want to make
it interactive,

00:17:35.775 --> 00:17:39.469
so-- and I want to, at
the half-hour, you just

00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:41.010
got to shut me off,
because I could--

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.065
and I just think it's more
fun to be interactive.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.180
And I had a hard time
putting this talk together

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.737
as well, because I could
either tell a life story,

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.570
but I didn't just want
to tell a life story,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:59.090
and I think all of these
things feed into each other.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.990
So the inner
journey idea, or I'm

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.630
an investor-- I was talking
to some of the people

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:10.140
at lunch-- the idea of
optimizing something

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.380
is not just an engineering
idea or an idea from physics.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.370
It's an idea that's-- it's
just deeply elegant to us.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.937
The idea-- you know,
I was thinking,

00:18:20.937 --> 00:18:23.020
oh my god, I'm going to
be meeting with engineers.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.960
I was trying out some of the
maths I learned 30 years ago.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.540
So the biggest--
one of the things

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.380
that I regret the most about not
continuing on a science track

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.840
is, I just remember that the
first day, about 14 years old,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.680
we studied calculus.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.430
And I had this idea
of at the limit.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.990
At the limit the slope of this
curve becomes dot dot dot,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.180
dx/dy, I remember.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:50.796
And I was just like, this
is kind of magical to me.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.360
But the real world
is not like that.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.320
The real world is not
like that, because it's

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.140
unbelievably complex.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.870
There's complexity that's taking
place that we just can't model.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.496
There's discontinuities
that take place.

00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:06.540
There's crashes in the market.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.520
There's avalanches.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.500
There's all sorts of things that
we just cannot predict how they

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.400
will go.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.070
I learned more about
the way economics

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.750
works by stumbling across
this idea of complexity.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.420
So this was, I think-- there's
actually an investor, Bill

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.720
Miller, started off on
the complexity idea.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.210
But then the way I
identified it with the most

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.470
was this-- these ants.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.930
So there's a great book
by Holldobler and Wilson,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.770
"Journey to the Ants,"
where it just comes down

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.080
to these ants optimizing some
pretty complex things using

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.500
a very, very simple set of
rules with distributed agents.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.040
And I realize that
thinking of the world

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.890
as like a rainforest,
or as like ant colonies

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.450
optimizing whatever it is
that they're optimizing,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.524
is a better way to
think things then.

00:19:57.524 --> 00:19:58.440
So that's the outside.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.630
Then if we go to the
inside of ourselves,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.960
it's just a fiction to
say that we're rational.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.480
We-- we're rational in very,
very limited circumstances.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.460
It's a very good
assumption to make,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.570
but there is so much evidence--
I mean Dan Ariely's book,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.900
"Predictably Irrationally."

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.640
We know that we're not rational.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.580
So I think that there's this
strange thing that happens,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.220
and again it's kind
of a tool that I

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.510
feel is a tool for success.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.450
At the minute I recognize
my own weaknesses,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.260
and I'm honest and open
and upfront about them,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.020
I can start doing
something about it.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.540
So I think I'm a better investor
because I just accept upfront

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.990
that I'm not rational.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.630
I have to deal with it and
then I can do workarounds.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.560
I can figure out what I'm
going to do to make it better.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:49.200
And worth adding to that is that
how many times has any of us--

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.700
or how many times have I, 'cause
I'm the guy who's speaking,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.050
I can't project it onto
you, I guess-- sort of like,

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.120
oh, I'd rather have
Stephen Spielberg's life,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.000
but we're not.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.850
I'm in my life.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:05.660
I can't have Steven
Spielberg's life, but-- so

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.210
everything's path dependent.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.160
And that's all
against optimization.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.694
We're just not in a situation
where-- we're not with the gas,

00:21:12.694 --> 00:21:15.110
we're not in a closed container
that things are constantly

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.630
developing.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.020
So I think I'm a stronger
and better person

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.580
to say that I'm not rational.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.819
I think teams work
better when we're

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:23.360
upfront about what
we're not good at.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.818
And I don't how it
works at Google,

00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:27.492
but I've had a-- I used to
have a hard time with it.

00:21:27.492 --> 00:21:28.950
I'm better with a
small team that I

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.609
work in being upfront about
the things that I'm not good at

00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:34.400
and having them be
upfront about the things

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.441
that they're not good at.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.950
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.600
I spent-- so I
discover Warren Buffet.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.080
I also discovered something
incredibly powerful,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:56.230
which Anthony Robbins calls
matching and mirroring.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.870
So I'm sitting in the office
of this "Wolf of Wall Street"

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:01.410
type place.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.420
I've discovered Warren Buffett
and I have this feeling,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.960
I want his life.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.920
I don't want my life.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.490
And what do I do about it?

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.140
And Tony Robbins teaches this.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.580
Mohnish Pabrai calls it cloning.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.580
And I just started
doing what I thought

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.660
Warren Buffett would do
if he was in my shoes.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.190
And literally I sat
and I said-- well,

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.710
I would read my
own annual reports.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.070
So I read the Berkshire
Hathaway annual report.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.950
And then I saw we
had these investments

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.075
in these various companies.

00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:32.380
I ordered up those
various companies and--

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.430
I don't know how to communicate
with you this feeling

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.510
of somehow-- and I'm
not a religious guy,

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.490
I feel like I'm a rational
guy-- but somehow I

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.300
was connecting up
to something that

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.160
was giving me wisdom and leading
me in a better direction.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.910
And I've since learned
more about that

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.100
and it's been an incredible
force for change in my life.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.150
And just going back to
that first job that I had,

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.500
I ask myself, if
I had not started

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.390
reading the Lowenstein
biography of Warren Buffett

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.085
and his force field
was not influencing me

00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:14.210
and I was not thinking what
would Warren Buffett do

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.972
in my shoes, I don't know where
my career would have gone.

00:23:16.972 --> 00:23:18.930
I don't know where my
morality would have gone.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.800
I think it may have
ended in a bad place.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.610
And the fascinating
thing for me as well

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.980
is that what Warren Buffett
would have done in my shoes

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.480
is he would have gotten up,
walked out of the office,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.820
and never come back.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.500
Instead, it took me 18--
well, until I figured out

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.480
was going on it was maybe
six months-- it took me eight

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.070
months to a year to
actually do that.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.640
So I didn't even model
Warren Buffett that well,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.310
and I still-- it still
improved my life dramatically.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.080
And so I just find
it fascinating

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.420
that the minute we just
start trying to think, well,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.086
what would somebody
that I deeply admire

00:23:53.086 --> 00:23:55.570
do, somebody who's way
better at this than I am?

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.030
And even if we do a
small fraction of that--

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.830
and I've done a very,
very small fraction of,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.320
in terms of investing, of
what Warren Buffett has done,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.500
he's got much better
returns than I have,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.640
he's much smarter than
I am-- but even just

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.130
a fraction of that success
is extraordinarily good.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.260
So part of my
nervousness in speaking

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.370
to you is that you
guys are dealing with,

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.790
at least my
perception is, you're

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.540
dealing with things that are
closer to physical reality.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.290
The properties of what
you're dealing with

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.970
and what you're
trying to manipulate

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.400
is in-- somehow
is based in things

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.420
that are less changeable.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.170
And I think that
when you-- somebody

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.020
like me who ended up going, I
was saying earlier that the two

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.430
universities I attended are
not the MIT's and the IIT's,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.060
they're quite politically
oriented universities.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.380
A world in which things
are much more fluid

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.030
and things change a lot:
I feel like those tools

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.650
are incredibly helpful.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.190
They may be less helpful
in an environment

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.490
where actually just solid
scientific knowledge

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.380
is what you need,
but if at some point

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.150
you guys are going out
of this environment

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.610
into another environment I think
those tools are very useful.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:12.660
Later-- so part of this book is
this lunch with Warren Buffett.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.350
So I fell in love
with Warren Buffett

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.694
and then I kind of
started disliking him,

00:25:16.694 --> 00:25:18.110
because I started
realizing that I

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.910
couldn't touch what he'd done.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.490
So it's like I was angry
at him in a certain way.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.410
And I was nervous to
meet him at the lunch

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.220
and I had this friend, this
Indian friend, Mohnish Pabrai,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.470
who I only would have
met if I'd been--

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.970
started to write
thank you notes.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.320
There's absolutely clear and
there are many other things

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.750
like that that have
shown up in my life.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:43.730
But the benefit to me of
meeting Warren Buffett

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.410
is that it forced me to give
up the idea that I could ever

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.880
be like him and it freed
me up to be myself.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.740
And I think that there-- in
the value investing world

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.750
there are a lot of
people who really want

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.726
to be the next Warren Buffett
or can't give up on this idea.

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:01.100
So there's this
interesting thing

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.480
that these models of
behavior are absolutely

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.350
wonderful until you
take it to extreme

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.830
and then you end up--
it's not productive.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.440
So you still have to be yourself
while modeling other people.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.600
So how long have I been
talking for, Sarab?

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.580
MALE SPEAKER: You have
five more minutes.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.940
GUY SPIER: So five more minutes.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.490
I got some-- I've got some
questions, if one of you

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.080
take me on a question on it.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.610
I have a worked
investment example

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.620
to show you how I take some of
the insights that I've learned

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.270
and use them in
my investing life.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.252
I'm irrational, I'm
not Warren Buffett,

00:26:35.252 --> 00:26:36.710
I'm not as smart
as Warren Buffett,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.910
the world is path dependent,
we can't optimize.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.490
What do we do about that?

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.990
And I'll just give
you-- so another thing

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.450
that I've learned about trying
to drive myself toward success

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.440
is, rather than trying to fixate
on some goal that may or may

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.550
not be attainable, is an
idea that, I don't know

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.230
any other way to express it,
of finding ways to consistently

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.560
tilt the playing field just
a little bit in my direction,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.650
because I think it's so hard to,
at least in the world where I

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.530
exist, to say, I'm going to go
and buy an insurance company,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.640
or I'm going to go and build
the next Berkshire Hathaway,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.000
or I'm going to go and have
the best investment returns,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.625
I'm going to find
the cheapest company.

00:27:16.625 --> 00:27:18.770
All of those things
are really hard to do,

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:24.060
but finding rules that tilt the
playing field are a lot easier.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.670
And they truly-- I don't
think I've tilted the playing

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.566
field by very much, but
tilting the playing field

00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:31.190
by a little bit got
me in front of you,

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.190
which is pretty-- I really do
think it's pretty extraordinary

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.090
and an amazing testament
to the power of that.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.191
And so the thank you notes is
one way of tilting the playing

00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:41.690
field.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.045
Sending out thank you notes,
creating goodwill, leaving

00:27:45.045 --> 00:27:47.170
a little bit more on the
table in every interaction

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.300
that I have leaves people with
a positive impression of me

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.640
willing to help or
willing to do something

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.420
and that comes in
in unexpected times.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.300
But now I'm going to go
to some very specifics.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.100
And so this comes
down to investing.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.190
Just straight-- some of the
things that I write about,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.830
and I'll just talk
to some of them.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.470
And these are
directed-- investors

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.970
would be looking
at these and saying

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.734
half of these are heresies.

00:28:19.734 --> 00:28:21.400
And I don't want to
discuss all of them,

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:28.250
but I want to pick
one that I can't even

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.050
see there, 'cause there are more
rules than there are up there,

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:39.570
but that second one is
such a powerful thing,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:44.240
and so easy to implement, and
it resulted in such an increase

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.310
in my quality of life.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.840
So I'm in New York and I'm
running about $50 million

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.760
and I get into some
databases and now

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.500
all manner of brokers and
other people are calling me up.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.400
And the phone's
ringing off the hook.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.680
And for some time that
feels really good,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.480
'cause I have-- I need
to feel significant

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.760
and now these people are
paying attention to me.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:09.890
And they all have
an axe to grind.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.800
They all have a
commission to make.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.610
They all have something
that skews the environment,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.820
puts me into their
sales force field.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.650
And I will tell you that you
cannot believe how many people

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.190
still operate by choosing
whatever's most available,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.820
because a salesperson
pulls them up.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.310
The minute I figured
out this rule,

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.260
and this is like if you think
of ants solving complex problems

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.050
about where to build their nests
and where to find food sources

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.270
and where to direct
their energies by a very

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.980
simple set of rules that
Holldobler and Wilson have

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.950
identified, I think that is
one straight, simple rule.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.295
So I started doing it.

00:29:48.295 --> 00:29:49.170
People would call up.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.940
They'd say, oh, this
is a sales call.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.246
I'm really sorry,
but I will not be

00:29:53.246 --> 00:29:55.620
able to buy your product
because you're selling it to me.

00:29:57.937 --> 00:30:00.020
How are you going to find
out about new funds over

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.730
or how are you going find
out about great tech stocks?

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.020
And I'd say, well-- I'd
ask one of my peers on,

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.660
and this is before the
internet is really taking off,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.850
I'd ask one of my peers,
I'm not going to ask you.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.930
So the phone stops
ringing instantly

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.960
and I just created a
whole area of quiet calm

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.250
where there used to be noise.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.450
And so just simply-- and
it's interesting thing

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.230
that that doesn't
direct me to success,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.700
but it just creates
one condition.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.459
I think that doing
that consistently

00:30:29.459 --> 00:30:31.000
tilts the playing
field a little bit.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.370
Just to go specific into
the investment world,

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.660
a friend of mine calls me.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.360
So, no, a deal guy
is in Zurich and he

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.214
wants to talk to
me about a deal.

00:30:42.214 --> 00:30:44.380
So he calls me up he says,
hey, we've got something,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.960
it's very interesting.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.440
Can I come by to the
office and talk about it?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.480
And the answer is, no, thank
you very much, send me a PDF.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.930
No, but I'm in Zurich
today, and it's timely,

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.030
and I really want
to talk you about.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.690
So then the answer
goes like this.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.990
It says, look, you
can come to the office

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.850
and talk to me
about it, but then I

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:05.140
won't be able to invest in
it, because that's my rule.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.890
And so now he's stuck,
because he really

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.190
wants me to invest in it.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.990
But the simple rule
of saying, I'm not

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.030
going to take a
sales call, send me

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.910
the information in written
form so I can evaluate

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.210
in a non salesy-heightened
environment

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.360
where my mind is going
to be messed with,

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.260
is just a better
way to do things.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.950
Warren Buffett says he doesn't
participate in open outcry

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:30.730
auctions.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.750
It's exactly the same idea.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.520
And people come to
him and they say,

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.450
but this is the most amazing
deal, and yes it's an auction,

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.360
and he's just saying
that-- he's saying over

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.350
a lifetime of making
those kinds of decisions,

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.600
if he doesn't show up at
any open outcry auction

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.790
or when anything
is being auctioned

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.790
he's going to do better.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.705
So it's a strange
thing because it's not,

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:54.830
it's not saying, well, I'm
shooting at that target.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.913
I'm saying, well, if I
just get enough things away

00:31:56.913 --> 00:31:59.270
from that target eventually
something will hit it.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.390
It's a sort of a backward
way of creating--

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.030
I guess it's just the creating
of conditions for success.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.890
And if you ask me about
it I'll come back to this.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:13.750
But TED Talks are 18
minutes, so I've already

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.180
gone over my TED Talk
time by, you know.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:23.790
And so I titled this
chapter-- so those rules,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.940
those kind of heuristics,
accepting that

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.050
I'm-- my limitations, I think,
are powerful for investing.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.100
I think that a lot
of people who invest

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.200
and who sell their
investments, they

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.410
want to try and convince
you that they're

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.445
doing it all in a certain way.

00:32:38.445 --> 00:32:39.820
And I think that
most of them are

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.770
using some kind of
heuristics, but they just

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.936
don't want to talk about it.

00:32:42.936 --> 00:32:45.360
And I think the
industry that I'm in

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.900
should be more honest with
the people who are not

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.330
in the industry about what
they're actually doing.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.950
And many people want to
hear, oh, well, we optimize,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.840
we review the
portfolio once a month,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.820
and when a stock comes to
80% of its intrinsic value

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.900
then we sell it.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.060
And I just think that
is so out of sync.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.570
For everything we
know about what

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.500
humans are, why is the
financial industry not

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.450
talking more honestly about it?

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.000
I decided that I would rather
talk honestly about what I do,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.370
and that I'm trying to manage
my irrationality, than kind of--

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.200
and when I started
doing the book,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.530
I definitely had
the agenda item.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.710
I'd like to drum up business.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.980
And I was lucky enough to have
been around some great people.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.810
And I'd read the autobiography
of Mahatma Gandhi, where

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.280
he talks about, within the
first third of the book,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.560
about going with prostitutes.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.710
So here's a guy writing
his autobiography,

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.280
he's a leading man of India,
he's revered as a saint,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.160
and he wants to tell the world
that he slept with prostitutes.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.030
And I thought, well, if he
can be that honest maybe

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.680
I should be honest, too.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.802
But I started off
the project hoping

00:33:51.802 --> 00:33:54.176
to drum up business, or at
least having that as somewhere

00:33:54.176 --> 00:33:55.216
as an agenda item.

00:33:55.216 --> 00:33:56.590
And I was lucky
enough to realize

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.720
that it was more
valuable for me,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.300
and I would live a
more meaningful life,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.250
if I was authentic and honest
than if I tried to cover up

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.389
some things that I didn't like.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.530
So I think there is
a lot of stuff that

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.340
gets told by the
financial industries

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.964
to the American public which is
just sales talk, because that's

00:34:15.964 --> 00:34:17.110
what they expect to hear.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.130
And I think the financial
industry, especially having

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.889
failed the United States
in the world in 2008, 2009,

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.820
with a lot of rich people
in it, has an obligation

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.639
to be more honest
about what's going on.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.080
I don't think it's
not hard to do.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.300
We just got to get
more people doing it.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.281
But what really blew me away
about-- so the thank you notes

00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:38.739
led me to this guy,
Mohnish Pabrai,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:42.190
and I started
studying how he lived.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.080
And I just feel like this
technology of success in life

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.909
that I feel like I've uncovered
is more valuable than anything

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.550
I learned about investing.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.620
And I'll just run through a
few of those really quickly.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.020
So some more kind of heuristic
rules, like the ants.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.630
So I used to try and sell to
people at cocktail parties

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.520
and I figured out
the various-- again,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.550
it's like the don't
take sales calls.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.990
It's like, meet somebody,
do something for them,

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.780
see how they respond.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.780
And there's, there's
basically-- I mean,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.310
I guess the "Give and Take"
book does it very well, by Adam

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.470
Grant, but there are the takers,
the matchers, and the givers.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.120
And you do-- I do
something for someone,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.440
you figure out very
quickly whether there

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.210
are takers or matchers.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.780
Takers or matchers we want
to deemphasize in our lives.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.891
Givers-- we want to spend all
the time we possibly can around

00:35:29.891 --> 00:35:30.390
givers.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.030
And as an example
of-- at first, when

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.170
you start giving like that,
you get all the takers.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.087
They get drawn to--
they got drawn to me.

00:35:38.087 --> 00:35:39.920
And so there's a lot
of sorting that goes on

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.044
and a lot of ways in which
you have to get them out

00:35:42.044 --> 00:35:44.250
of your life, but
then over time,

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.000
and I'm talking
about 5 or 10 years,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.890
I suddenly find
myself surrounded

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.870
by people who give
all around me and that

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.702
sets the conditions for success.

00:35:53.702 --> 00:35:55.160
And so here's
something else that I

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.030
think is-- I get really
excited about this.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:02.050
So all of the stuff
that I did, have--

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.420
having uncovered
these ideas, are

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.440
ideas I could've never justified
to any marketing department,

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.580
because it looks like
totally wasted money.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.380
And so we have this-- it's
an incredible opportunity

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.280
for any individual
or anybody who

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.400
controls their
lives-- so we have

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.840
this incredible bias in
the world towards activity

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.680
that you can show a return
in a relatively short period

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.120
of time, because no manager of
any business or any marketing

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.200
department is going to
be able to stick around

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.730
if he's investing in, unless
It's a very unusual business,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.500
if he's doing
investments, they're

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.000
going to take-- He says,
well, it may never pay off.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.410
But it might take 10 years.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.640
And I feel like many of the
activities that I've done

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.530
are things that I
started with no payoff.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.326
And then we have this
very, very-- a slope

00:36:50.326 --> 00:36:52.700
that is a little bit better
than what it would have been,

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.980
and is imperceptible.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.064
And we think in linear terms
and most people just discard it.

00:36:57.064 --> 00:36:58.480
And if you're
willing to just keep

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.370
doing those things for like 10
years then suddenly that slope,

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.240
because it's a growth,
it's not linear,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.050
is pulling away from the slope
that it would have been on.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.256
And when people start
noticing it it's 10 years out

00:37:12.256 --> 00:37:13.380
and then they misattribute.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.610
So these-- that's
one simple idea

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:20.320
of getting a slightly better
crowd of people around us.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.880
I mean, Brene Brown has
talked about being vulnerable.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.400
I never understood that
empathizing to people

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.050
is a business tool.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:33.227
And time and again I've realized
that just, rather than just-- I

00:37:33.227 --> 00:37:34.810
mean, it happened
to me the other day.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.280
So I met a journalist who
writes for "The Huffington

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.790
Post" called Dorie Clark.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.060
I showed up and all I wanted
to do was talk about my book.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.110
And instead I had, from some
miraculous divine inspiration,

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.940
I held back and I actually,
even though it was set up

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.739
in such a way that what I had
to do was download to her,

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:55.530
here's what you need
to write about my book

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.580
for "The Huffington Post"
or "Forbes" or a couple

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.140
of other publications,
I held back

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.580
and I just said,
tell me who you are.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.890
I spent-- we spent half an
hour talking about two books

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.560
that she's written that I hadn't
had the wherewithal to read up

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.240
upon, which I should
have done, and she

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.840
realized she had somebody who's
actually interested in her.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.700
And it wouldn't necessarily
have happened in all cases,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.990
but she ended up inviting
me to an author dinner

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.214
and I found a friend.

00:38:24.214 --> 00:38:25.880
And that was a much
better relationship,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.500
and there's something
that can grow out of that.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.416
There's optionality that
can come out of that.

00:38:29.416 --> 00:38:32.600
I never understood that
that idea of empathy

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.022
is actually a great
business tool.

00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:36.230
And I think if you're wrong
environment it definitely

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.480
is not going to work.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.830
If you're around givers
it definitely will work.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.557
And the same with
being vulnerable.

00:38:43.557 --> 00:38:46.140
When I sat at my-- stood at my
partnership meeting, they said,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.290
how do you sell?

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.220
What is your sales--
what was it--

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.010
what is your process
for selling stocks?

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.560
And I say, I said in front
of my partners, I said,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.749
I actually have a
rare, very bad process.

00:38:56.749 --> 00:38:58.040
I don't know how to do it well.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.000
I don't believe
anybody does it well.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.840
In this world, people
are drawn to that,

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.310
and over time that accumulates.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:09.512
So we can get back
to it, if you like.

00:39:09.512 --> 00:39:10.220
They're up there.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:17.840
So I touched on this and
I'm going to close on this.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.660
So-- and I'll just give,
I'll give one example.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.560
So there are investors
who are more successful

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.210
than I am, and I've
seen investors who--

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.940
so, the classic thing is there's
a conference call the Value

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.620
Investing Congress,
and some very, very

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.841
persuasive and unbelievably
smart people present there.

00:39:38.841 --> 00:39:41.090
So there's a couple of people
who are big stars there,

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:45.130
a guy called Bill Ackman and
a guy called David Einhorn.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.530
If any of us were to sit
in a presentation with Bill

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.790
Ackman and David
Einhorn, we'd run out

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.390
and buy whatever stock
they're talking about and--

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.960
or sell short
whatever stock they're

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.920
talking about selling short.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.836
And sometimes they work
out and sometimes they

00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:06.850
don't, but this idea that,
this-- what we do in the world

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.520
has got to resonate
for us internally.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.050
And what I realized, and
I'll just share this.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:19.000
So I have this relationship
with Mohnish Pabrai

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.270
and people think that I say
intelligent things to him.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.630
I don't.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.460
I think that what's
going on there is,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:30.370
or part of what's going on,
is that he is naturally,

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:35.150
because of the way his mind
works, less averse to loss.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.940
And I have this
family history where

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.650
my family was, ancestors
of mine were kicked out

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:43.540
of Germany in the '30s, and I
think that that ricochets down

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.420
the generations and I have
a mortal fear of loss.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:53.080
And so I think that it's
beneficial for Mohnish Pabrai

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.930
to talk to somebody about
the investing world who

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.910
has a mortal fear of
loss, because it's

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.250
a-- you can read something
into the situation

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.360
that he couldn't read himself.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.920
I think that I responded
better to the financial crisis

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.590
by not denying that
history of mine, but just,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.140
again, being honest
about it, knowing

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.700
that was part of who I am,
and then acting synchronous

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.730
with that, or acting in
concert with that idea.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:24.110
And I guess the simple
idea is that whenever

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.380
I've looked for answers
outside of myself

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.542
I haven't found
very good answers.

00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:33.470
And the minute I looked
for answers inside myself

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.310
the world changed.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.570
And here's a better example.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.710
It was really hard for
me to admit to myself

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.760
that classmates of mine-- Bill
Ackman's from the year above me

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.620
and another guy who's
famous for being

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.050
a very successful hedge fund
manager, this guy Chris Hohn--

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.850
it was very hard for
me to admit to myself

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.280
that I was envious of them.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.130
But for as long as I didn't
admit I was envious of them,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.450
I kept trying to live
this life in New York

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.900
City of being a big
successful hedge fund manager.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.220
The minute I took the pain
and was willing to say, no,

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.130
you're just envious
of them and you

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.630
should stop being
envious of people.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.860
Envy-- all emotions--
report call to action.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.690
The emotion of envy
is a sign that there

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.550
isn't something
right in your life.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.440
And the minute I
redirected that energy--

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.850
and we're talking wasting
large amounts of money renting

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.480
big fancy offices with glass,
with wall-to-ceiling glass,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.000
and trading Roman
analysts and [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.090
that cost a lot of
money all because I

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.720
was unable to admit
to myself that I was,

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.370
I had envy for something that
I shouldn't have envy for.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.610
And the minute I redirected
that and said, well,

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.960
how would I reset up my life
given that I, either I'm

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.650
not able to or I'm not
successfully getting to where

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.887
these people are, I found
answers and the answer's, well,

00:42:52.887 --> 00:42:54.470
stop living that
kind of life and live

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.660
a life that's more in sync.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.260
So the inner journey is
a great business tool.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.520
And with that, I'm going
to stop and take questions.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.190
If somebody asks me to go
through investment idea,

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.290
just to give a sense, I
will, but only if you ask me.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.380
So the floor is yours.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.920
The question was, how do
I decide how much cash

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.920
to have in my portfolio or
other kind of high level

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.540
decisions like that.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.140
And so I think that that
is a classic example

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.370
of false optimization.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:30.440
It's a classic example of trying
to find the answer to something

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.330
that doesn't exist
and it's a waste

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.850
of brain cells in a certain way.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.040
So another idea that
I didn't touch on

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.910
is this guy Gerd Gigerenzer,
so the wonderful experiment

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.460
is you take children,
you put them in a room,

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.350
and then they have
to take an exam.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.022
So in one control group
you put them in a room,

00:43:50.022 --> 00:43:52.480
there's nothing on the table,
you go wait for five minutes,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.480
they go take the exam.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.700
The other room, there's
chocolates on the table,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.382
you say to the children,
don't eat the chocolates.

00:43:59.382 --> 00:44:00.590
You can't eat the chocolates.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.970
Now go to take the exam.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:02.970
And the children comply.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.386
They don't eat the chocolates,
but they perform much worse

00:44:05.386 --> 00:44:06.030
on the exam.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.030
And the idea is that
there is-- the brain

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.800
has a certain
amount of willpower.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.020
There's a limited
amount every day.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.960
And literally just
preventing themselves

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.520
from eating the chocolates
is using up that willpower

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.569
and it reduces their ability
to concentrate on the exam.

00:44:22.569 --> 00:44:24.110
That's why anything
important that we

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:27.320
want to do in life,
like I've figured out

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.900
that the only time
for me to workout

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.150
is first thing in the morning.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.430
It's the only time I have
the willpower to do it.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.170
Even if I wait an hour
or two we're done.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.950
And so we really want to
conserve our willpower

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.760
for things that
count, and I think

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:46.060
that following the stock
tickers, having a screen open,

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.350
which is constantly--
So we know that reading

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.030
is more stressful if
you're on a web screen

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.800
because your brain
is constantly trying

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.190
to decide whether to
click on the link or not.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.390
And if you have a-- and
that literally uses up,

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.380
it uses our brain energy
and if you have just a page,

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.780
that, all of that
question mark goes away

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.230
so we can focus on the page.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.760
So it's all about
conserving energy

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.843
for the things that count.

00:45:09.843 --> 00:45:12.010
And so if you're coming
from my perspective,

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:15.540
and I really can't predict
where the market will

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.040
go in the short run.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.180
And I don't even
know-- I can't even

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.430
be certain that the companies
that I'm investing in,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.012
I can't be 100% knowledgeable
that I know enough about them

00:45:27.012 --> 00:45:27.970
to make the investment.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.800
What I'm trying to do,
like an ant colony,

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.760
is to create habits
and behaviors that

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.100
improve the probability that
I will outperform the market.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.340
And that comes down to, in
the case of cash for me,

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.720
I'm not trying to manage
the amount of cash.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.750
If I see something that
makes a huge amount of sense,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.640
I'm doing it, and
if I see, if I don't

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.710
see something that makes
a huge amount of sense,

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.230
I let the cash build up.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.880
The same way I'm not trying to
sell investments when they get

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.320
to-- probably if they get
ridiculously overvalued I would

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.390
like to believe that I
would sell them, but--

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:09.020
So one of my investors
asks me, do you

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:14.590
sell at, if the value is
100, do you sell at 50, 60,

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.370
at 100, 120?

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.870
And I kind of try to
explain that it's not

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:20.440
like I know the value is 100.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.420
I kind of know that it's
probably undervalued at 50

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.430
and it's probably
overvalued at 200.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.920
In the middle of that range,
that's the kind of uncertainty

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.900
that I'm dealing with.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.510
In the middle of that
range, what I'm trying to do

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.862
is minimize transaction
costs, because we

00:46:35.862 --> 00:46:38.570
know that transaction
costs are really important.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.660
I don't know if that's helpful.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.920
AUDIENCE: In your eight
rules, I was curious,

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.020
number six was, "Never trade
when the market is open."

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.040
I was just curious why
that's one of the rules.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.870
GUY SPIER: Yeah,
so one of the rules

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.580
is, "Never trade when
the market is open."

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.735
If it said never
then I should correct

00:46:57.735 --> 00:46:59.110
it, because what
I should say is,

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.440
try not to trade when
the market is open,

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.757
because I think there
are, in the real world,

00:47:03.757 --> 00:47:05.590
they're always exceptions
that you want it--

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.030
So I try to leave myself the
freedom to break those rules.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:18.385
But, so, who-- trade station.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.150
You get your monitor.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.600
You get your access.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.440
You can trade at any time.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.880
You can react to prices.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.350
I mean, it gives this
completely false impression,

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.660
at least of what
I'm trying to do.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.660
And I think that it's, it's
selling people false hope.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.510
I think that the traders that
make money-- somebody I know

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.700
was a chief-- he
recently left his job,

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.720
but he was a chief currency
trader for Goldman Sachs,

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.450
for Citigroup.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.100
Citigroup gets
huge flows and they

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.220
work hard on
getting those flows.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.680
They are not making money
because they have any,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.740
any-- they're make money
because they can charge

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.610
a big ask spread,
and because they

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.170
have temporary knowledge
of a huge order that's just

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.060
come in that they can,
that they can price away

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.950
from the market a
little bit, and then

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.880
they can resell it
to somebody else.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.100
So maybe if you're a chief
currency trader at Citigroup

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.420
that trading idea works, or that
approach to the markets work,

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.230
but I think in the vast
majority of circumstances--

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.500
I mean, I'm trying to buy
something today that will,

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.710
that will go up ideally
3x over three years or 4x.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.580
Just very, very large
movements in price.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.980
And I am blown away
by the number of times

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.670
that I, who at the time
thought he was rational,

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.280
I now know better,
would be dissuaded

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.640
by the price
movement on the day.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.905
So the thing is priced at
10 and we know in retrospect

00:48:44.905 --> 00:48:47.890
that it was going to go
to 50 and I didn't buy it

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.930
because it was training
up by two, by two basis

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.000
points or something, and
that really impacts you,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.030
and it's crazy.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.070
So there's a-- I found
that it's just simpler.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.110
And it's actually,
it's not I found,

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.000
I learned it directly
from Mohnish Pabrai.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.550
He showed me the rule and it
was obvious to me the minute

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.570
he said it.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.700
Just don't allow yourself to
trade when the markets open.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.020
Decide the night before
what you're going to do

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.150
and then put the trade in.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.524
Decide-- I mean,
the debt doesn't

00:49:13.524 --> 00:49:15.840
mean you shouldn't put limit
orders in or find some way

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.380
to make sure that-- but think
about it in a quiet environment

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.330
and then, and then
allow it to happen.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.680
And--

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.980
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.190
Hi.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.330
So, here at Google there
is a strong community

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:34.280
of people who believe in
passive investing indexes.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.520
And so you said on
several occasions,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.020
don't optimize, don't
optimize, so I wonder,

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.060
why not just do that, like,
invest in the S&amp;P index?

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:49.372
GUY SPIER: I think it's a great
idea, and John Vogel is-- oh.

00:49:49.372 --> 00:49:51.250
So the question
is, why not just--

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.300
AUDIENCE: I actually have a
follow-up to this as well.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.100
So yesterday-- so I
believe you, actually

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.940
your fund, Aquamarine Fund,
is bidding the S&amp;P index

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.550
since the beginning [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.800
But yesterday somebody showed
me some interesting data

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.280
that was some
funds that, they're

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.760
supposed to be value-investing
funds, such as, let's

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.140
say, the Sequoia Fund, and
[INAUDIBLE] and know that,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.640
but even like Warren
Buffett and Berkshire,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.410
I think they're actually
lagging behind the S&amp;P index.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:25.786
And just out of
probability there

00:50:25.786 --> 00:50:28.326
is always going to be someone
who is going to beat the index,

00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:29.020
right?

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.240
So I wonder, how do you
know that you're not

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.320
that random person and
it's bound to happen?

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.788
And how do you know you're--

00:50:37.788 --> 00:50:40.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.230
--how do you know you're
going to keep actually--

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.610
It seems like an awful lot of
effort to do what you're doing.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.520
I mean, in the end do
you know that you're

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.686
going to be above the index
after 10 years from now?

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.307
GUY SPIER: I could answer that
very easily and just say, no.

00:50:57.307 --> 00:51:00.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.690
Look.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.130
Indexing is a great idea.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:06.390
The index is a
really hard opponent

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.760
to beat because it doesn't
pay transaction costs.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.750
I would say that if
you do the index,

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:13.180
and John Vogel is a
really well-known guy.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.690
There's vanguarding indexes
and they've, they've

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.760
done a service to investors.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.530
And I was telling
somebody over lunch

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:22.830
today that to say,
to look at the index

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.331
is a baseline, is a
great place to start.

00:51:25.331 --> 00:51:27.580
But what I would say is that
if you're going to index,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.190
pick the right index.

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:35.930
So if you take the S&amp;P during
the financial bubble of 2009,

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.540
it was very skewed by some
very overvalued companies

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.210
and there's this market
cap weighted index.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:45.720
So the more these companies
became overvalued,

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.440
the more they had
to be in the index.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.750
And so you were investing
in an index that was skewed

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.846
towards the opposite
of value investing,

00:51:52.846 --> 00:51:54.220
going into the
biggest companies.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.280
So I would want to
pick an index that

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.389
doesn't have those skews
in it, like the Dow Jones

00:51:58.389 --> 00:51:59.680
index doesn't have those skews.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.080
So I'd want to spend
a little bit of time,

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.800
and probably
everybody in this room

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.540
is capable, to understand
how the index is constructed,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.372
to know that it's the
right index to use.

00:52:08.372 --> 00:52:10.580
So there's absolutely no
question that is a smart way

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.480
to do things and
it's a good baseline

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.780
for even people who
are doing other things.

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.830
So to the second part of
your question, how do I,

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.860
we all know that Nassim, it's
from Nassim Taleb's book,

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.210
but you take, you take a
bunch of individuals, 1,000

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.420
individuals, have
them all flips coins,

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.990
and probabilistically
after a number of rounds

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.810
of somebody who's just flipped
heads all the way through

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:37.180
and then you interview them,
and they really did believe,

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.380
that they really
believe that, I knew it.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:39.880
I knew it.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.805
They feel like they
have a lucky hand

00:52:42.805 --> 00:52:45.070
and it's really powerful stuff.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:51.340
And so I don't know.

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.330
I have to say that.

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.060
I don't know.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.950
So there's this
amazing article written

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.600
by Warren Buffett called "The
Super Investors of Graham

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.840
and Doddsville."

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.280
I highly recommend it.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.530
I'm sure it's on the internet.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.220
I'm sure it's sitting in your
server's multiple places,

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.660
but, replicated
across the world.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.440
But he tried to
answer that question

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.520
and he just said, look, what if
the monkeys flipping coins all

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.210
studied at Columbia Business
School under this guy

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.540
called Ben Graham and
they all talk about buying

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.650
things at a discount
to intrinsic value?

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.730
Then at some point
you might have

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:32.060
to ask whether this is
not just flipping coins.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.110
And so I think that the
probability right now

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.780
that Berkshire Hathaway,
fourth or fifth largest

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:41.830
company by market cap in the
United States, is a fluke

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:46.120
is getting pretty low, so
clearly there are some ways

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.420
that some people
can act in the world

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:53.590
to beat those indices, which
are incredibly hard to beat.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.960
I'd very much like to
be one of those people

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.045
and I have some huge
handicaps, because I'm not

00:53:58.045 --> 00:54:00.540
as smart as Warren Buffett
and I don't live in Omaha.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.930
I think that I'm
much better off today

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.360
because I figure out those
weaknesses and I'm working,

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.470
I'm working to
compensate for them

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.900
the way I think Warren
Buffett naturally did.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.900
So I actually think that
Warren Buffett, everything

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.364
that I'm talking about,
I'm excited because I

00:54:18.364 --> 00:54:20.530
feel like I've uncovered
some really valuable things

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.920
that the world
isn't talking about.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.560
I think Warren Buffet
understands them.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.140
He just has, he
gets more fun out

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.485
of investing than talking
about these things.

00:54:29.485 --> 00:54:31.110
And if you go to the
Berkshire meeting,

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:35.420
and I invite you all to join me
at the south door of the Omaha

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.010
Convention Center at
5:30 AM on the Saturday

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.637
morning of the Berkshire
meeting, I'll be there,

00:54:40.637 --> 00:54:42.470
a guy called Alex
[INAUDIBLE] will be there,

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.928
Mohnish Pabrai will be there,
a whole bunch of other people

00:54:44.928 --> 00:54:47.020
and it's a great example
of just get around

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.630
people who are better than
you and you can only improve.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:54.460
But they say every year that
if, for a long enough period

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:59.220
of time, they don't outperform
the indices than there's

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.970
questions that
have to be raised.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:05.100
And I think that they've hit
a five year period where they

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.610
did not perform but then they
started out performing again.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.360
And I think that all
of their shareholders

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.570
would not have wanted
to remove the management

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.070
and have somebody else run it.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:15.840
And it's a question
that is something

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.940
that I tell my
shareholders every time.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.670
So.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:20.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.550
Have you, you're in the value
investing space, have you

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.010
thought about how to apply
your investing philosophy

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:29.250
in a growth, venture
capital, new emerging

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.140
technologies kind of investment?

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.410
GUY SPIER: People of my ilk,
I think, often have tech envy

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:45.710
and we would love to
invest in businesses

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:49.290
that are in growth mode.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.250
So if I think about--
so I'll give you

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.100
an example of why it's so hard.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.840
I had an investment in
a company called ITG.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.170
Investment Technology Group.

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:04.650
So ITG, in an age where
the internet was just

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:09.240
getting going, had, had created
a stock crossing network

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.120
that enabled people
to put their--

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.880
it was well before
these, all this stuff

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.440
that "Flash Boys" talked
about-- but it enabled people

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.910
to put their stock so
they couldn't trade, very

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.700
large institutions,
like huge volumes

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.390
that they wanted to
put in the market,

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:28.690
into a blind pool where,
if two people matched

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:30.840
opposite sides of
the trade, it worked.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.870
And you've got to
match and then they,

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.950
and then ITG would
take the commission.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.620
They had spent 15
years building it.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.750
It was called Posit.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:40.960
I think it still exists.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.770
They'd spent 15 years building
it up and it looked beautiful

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:48.710
and I felt like I'd discovered
a kind of a Costco, the low cost

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.040
operator, the thing that
offers the clients the best

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.470
value for money in
the financial markets.

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:55.407
And then at the time,
I don't remember

00:56:55.407 --> 00:56:56.990
the name of the
network, but something

00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:00.840
came up within three months
and achieved the same volumes.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.060
And then within a
year or two later

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.150
there were dozens
of competitors.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:08.990
And ITG is still around, but
the beautiful growths prospects

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.770
than existed just weren't there.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:13.960
So I think that what is so
hard, and I've tripped up

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.410
on this on a number
of occasions,

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:18.790
is that you're buying the future
and the future's not certain

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.999
and you'd like to
believe that the company

00:57:20.999 --> 00:57:22.540
that you've invested
in, and I'd like

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.070
to believe that the company
that I've invested in,

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.360
is going to be the winner.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.790
But it's just so hard to do.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:29.890
That said, a very famous
value investor, Bill Miller,

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.590
at the time that AOL was the
dominant internet company,

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:36.770
made a huge amount of money.

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:38.627
This was a time when
AOL was marketing

00:57:38.627 --> 00:57:40.210
their service, their
internet service,

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.569
by sending direct mail
out with these CDs.

00:57:42.569 --> 00:57:43.485
Can you even remember?

00:57:43.485 --> 00:57:43.985
Yeah.

00:57:43.985 --> 00:57:47.890
We don't even have CD drives
anymore in our computers.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.770
But he'd figured
something out, but then he

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.709
lost a huge amount of
money in the tech crisis.

00:57:53.709 --> 00:57:55.750
And there are some value
investors today, there's

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:58.602
a guy that I respect
an awful lot who has,

00:57:58.602 --> 00:58:03.080
who had a very large
position in Amazon,

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.122
and so I get envious
because I look at it

00:58:06.122 --> 00:58:08.580
and he made four times his
money so far and I-- believe me,

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.996
there are plenty
of my investments

00:58:09.996 --> 00:58:12.060
that have not made
four times my money.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:17.630
And I understood, after talking
to him for a couple of days,

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.630
I understood a lot more
about Amazon than I did.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.640
But I just found, I've
discovered that in my case

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.920
by, in doing that, I get
it wrong more often than I

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.510
get it right.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:28.290
So I think it's really hard.

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.790
And there's an idea written
up where buying the future

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:35.200
is not a great thing
to do because it often

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.720
doesn't turn out that way.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.110
So I don't think it
actually works very well

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.100
and I have a certain
amount of angst,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.510
because I think that what
everybody in this room is doing

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:46.790
is creating a
better world for us.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.910
And what actually am I doing?

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:52.840
I'm helping, I'm helping
some rich people get richer

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.620
and maybe I'm
allocating some capital,

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.760
but I think that
what's going on here

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.630
is actually a lot
more meaningful.

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:04.100
And I think that, especially
visiting the Google campus,

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.980
I think in a different
version of my life

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.140
I would've stayed studying
mathematics and physics

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.990
and maybe gone to an
MIT and ended up--

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:13.730
And so I'll leave
you with this idea.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:16.380
So all of you know the grass
on the other side of the road

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:17.150
is always greener.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:23.290
So I was, I was a
classmate of Mark Pincus,

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:24.932
so I got to know him.

00:59:24.932 --> 00:59:27.390
He's in the section, my section
at Harvard Business School.

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.240
He taught me a lot
about playing chess.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.570
He was a game player then.

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:31.760
He just loved games.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.130
That's what he loved to do.

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.020
I think actually Mark Pincus is
a great example, with a zinger,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.960
of how, when you're inner
world, your love of games,

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.350
is aligned with the outer
world, extraordinary things

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:42.756
can happen.

00:59:42.756 --> 00:59:44.880
And then, when you realize
that your outer world is

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.379
all about management and that's
not what your inner world is

00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:49.970
about, you need to leave and
you need to do something else.

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:54.570
But he-- so I visit
him in San Francisco

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.590
a few years after
business school

00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:59.390
and I've, I've fallen in
love with Warren Buffett

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.800
and I'm doing value investing
and he just looks at me,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.447
he says, look, Guy, you could
make large amounts of money,

01:00:06.447 --> 01:00:08.030
but at the end of
the world who cares?

01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:09.462
I'm here changing the world.

01:00:09.462 --> 01:00:11.170
And I think he's got
a really good point,

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:15.154
and, and-- So I have a certain
amount of angst about it,

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:16.570
but I'm not going
to change what I

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.690
do now 'cause I'm
enjoying my life.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.150
AUDIENCE: The talk you
gave today reminds me,

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:25.680
Warren Buffet talk about
in the school system.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.180
I think that was all you
talk about today, right?

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.620
Yeah.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:36.600
Can you tell me a little
bit more about, how do I,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.990
[INAUDIBLE] you mentioned
about envy, right?

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.750
Warren Buffet also say
that it's not greedy,

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.841
but it's envy that will
destroy the world, right?

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.340
Yeah.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.480
Could you tell me how can you
not envy people, be humble?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.600
I have, some of my friend,
was working in, was,

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.170
she was working at company
which was bought by Facebook,

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:00.594
so he [INAUDIBLE], so
obviously people got envy,

01:01:00.594 --> 01:01:03.930
so could you please--

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:08.010
GUY SPIER: So I asked Warren
Buffett that question and I--

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.260
so I said it to him like
this, and I wasn't, I

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.200
wasn't ready to
admit to the extent

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.260
of my envy for certain people.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.480
So I put it in like this, and
the answer will scare you.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.177
I said, OK-- so,
by this time, he's

01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:20.510
convinced me to call him Warren.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.760
Earlier on I'm saying Mr.
Buffet and he's stopping.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.260
So I say, so Warren, I want
to put you in these shoes.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.180
I'm a manager of yours
and I come to you.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.330
And I'm a manager of a
substantial business of yours

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.600
and you rely on my performance
for the success of Berkshire

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.280
Hathaway and I come to
you with a confession.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.430
And I say, I'm deeply envious
of a peer in my industry

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:44.130
and it's just eating me up.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:46.690
And I know that
it's going to force

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.465
me, get me to make
decisions that are not

01:01:48.465 --> 01:01:51.100
good for the business, but
what do I do with this envy?

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.112
And I'm hoping for pearls of
wisdom to fall from heaven

01:01:54.112 --> 01:01:55.820
and I said, so what
would you say to him?

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.657
And he's like, I don't know.

01:01:57.657 --> 01:02:02.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.950
And I don't know where
I, I, I got this from.

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.100
He did talk to us about
this inner scorecard

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.270
idea at the lunch extensively.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:12.120
And just so that you know
it, for those of you who

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.440
don't want to buy the book,
which I totally understand,

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.190
he says-- there are many
books out there-- he says,

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.750
would you rather be
considered by the world

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.880
to be the best
lover in the world,

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.820
but between you and
your wife to know

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.250
that you really suck,
or would you rather

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.660
for the world to think that
you're pretty bad at being

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.280
a lover, but for
you and your wife

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.930
to know that you're
the very best?

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:35.010
And obviously that
was a distinction

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.670
that I had not really
fully understood and made.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.110
And it was really hard
for me, because I realized

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:44.040
how much of my life I'd lived
by an external scorecard

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.100
and I realized in
writing the book

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:51.270
how much of the environment that
we all operate in is so-- exam

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:54.620
results, all sorts
of evaluations.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.510
Those are all in a certain
way, in many cases,

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.110
external scorecard.

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:02.060
And I was telling Sarab that my
children are in a Montessori,

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.989
Montessori school right now.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.280
I think maybe one of the big
things that the Montessori

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.655
school system does is it
teaches you, and in a scorecard,

01:03:08.655 --> 01:03:12.110
it teaches you to focus on the
things that give you true joy.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.730
But I'll tell you what
really does deal with envy,

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:19.090
and this works, is that,
a really powerful idea,

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.840
emotions are a call to action.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.690
So anger is an, is an indication
that your boundaries have been

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.350
violated, so you need to
protect your boundaries.

01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:30.940
For example, being
sad and being in pain

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.090
means that you need to
seek nurture and security.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:38.290
Envy is a signal-- so
the misdirection of envy

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:44.100
is, I hate that guy I want
his life, and I don't have it.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.215
And so that's envy.

01:03:46.215 --> 01:03:48.340
And I don't know why it's
associated with the color

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.440
green.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.750
The call to action is there's
something wrong in my life

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.560
that I need to change.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.990
And I promise you,
example, the morning

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:02.690
I woke up next to my wife,
totally in love with her,

01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:04.910
having had an
extraordinary night.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.660
I was not envious of anyone.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.000
My life was really good.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.410
The days that I've spent
on a windsurfer, yeah,

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:14.720
just surfing those waves, with
a blue sky and strong wind,

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.120
I was not envious of anyone.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.860
You could give me Bill
Gates, Warren Buffett, Steven

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.370
Spielberg, you name it.

01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:22.620
When you're in those
moments you're not envious.

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.456
So I think that, what I came
away from that lunch was,

01:04:26.456 --> 01:04:29.490
increased recognition
of my own envy,

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:33.440
and increased recognition
of how much my life was

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.400
on an external scorecard,
and the absolute desire

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:37.960
to change it.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.660
And for me that meant
leaving New York.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.909
I realized that New York
wasn't a healthy place to me.

01:04:41.909 --> 01:04:44.530
So I think there is a
way to deal with envy.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.270
It's fixing what--
fixing-- ensuring

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.320
that we go to bed every
night happy with what

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.820
we did during the day.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.340
And if we're not
doing that, then we

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.152
need to try really
hard to get to a place

01:04:54.152 --> 01:04:55.110
where we're doing that.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.160
And once we're doing that
we won't have any envy.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.840
So thank you all for coming.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.790
I hope I, I hope I [INAUDIBLE].
