00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.415
Let's do another performance comparison quiz. Let's say

00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:05.395
now we have the new laptop that can compress

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:07.380
this video in ten minutes. But we drop

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.940
this laptop, and it falls down the storm drain.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.840
So we have to use the old laptop that took four hours to do this. So what

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.120
is the speedup of using the old laptop instead

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.140
of the new one that fell down the drain?
