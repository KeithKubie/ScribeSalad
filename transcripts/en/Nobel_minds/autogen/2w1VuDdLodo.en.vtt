neutrinos were first discovered they

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
neutrinos were first discovered they
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.680
neutrinos were first discovered they
were discovered because they carried

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
were discovered because they carried
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350
were discovered because they carried
away energy and momentum from nuclear

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
away energy and momentum from nuclear
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240
away energy and momentum from nuclear
reactions and we couldn't explain them

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
reactions and we couldn't explain them
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.549
reactions and we couldn't explain them
unless we could imagine that these

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559
unless we could imagine that these
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.139
unless we could imagine that these
particles would exist everything we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
particles would exist everything we
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880
particles would exist everything we
could tell at the time was that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
could tell at the time was that

neutrinos had no mass they traveled at

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
neutrinos had no mass they traveled at
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.410
neutrinos had no mass they traveled at
the speed of light or are very nearly

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420
the speed of light or are very nearly
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.330
the speed of light or are very nearly
but then in recent times we've seen

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
but then in recent times we've seen
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130
but then in recent times we've seen
evidence that they do have mass it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
evidence that they do have mass it's
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860
evidence that they do have mass it's
only very small so the way that we found

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
only very small so the way that we found
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250
only very small so the way that we found
out was number one we know that the Sun

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
out was number one we know that the Sun
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469
out was number one we know that the Sun
makes neutrinos and we were not getting

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
makes neutrinos and we were not getting
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179
makes neutrinos and we were not getting
the right number of neutrinos here on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
the right number of neutrinos here on
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460
the right number of neutrinos here on
earth in our detectors so we had to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
earth in our detectors so we had to
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380
earth in our detectors so we had to
imagine that the neutrinos were turning

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
imagine that the neutrinos were turning
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.890
imagine that the neutrinos were turning
into something else on the way so the as

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
into something else on the way so the as
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050
into something else on the way so the as
it seems to be true the neutrinos that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
it seems to be true the neutrinos that
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179
it seems to be true the neutrinos that
are manufactured in the sun by nuclear

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
are manufactured in the sun by nuclear
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550
are manufactured in the sun by nuclear
reactions are turning into a different

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
reactions are turning into a different
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080
reactions are turning into a different
kind of neutrino before they get here

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
kind of neutrino before they get here
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969
kind of neutrino before they get here
and so that's why we couldn't see them

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
and so that's why we couldn't see them
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.399
and so that's why we couldn't see them
all similar things now have been

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
all similar things now have been
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080
all similar things now have been
observed with neutrinos that we might

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
observed with neutrinos that we might
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.289
observed with neutrinos that we might
manufacture in nuclear reactors and so

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
manufacture in nuclear reactors and so
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230
manufacture in nuclear reactors and so
it seems to be true neutrinos do have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
it seems to be true neutrinos do have
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.679
it seems to be true neutrinos do have
mass it's very small but it can be

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
mass it's very small but it can be
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.990
mass it's very small but it can be
measured a little bit and this is a very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
measured a little bit and this is a very
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700
measured a little bit and this is a very
difficult measurement it's but we're

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
difficult measurement it's but we're
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.790
difficult measurement it's but we're
pretty sure neutrinos have mass
