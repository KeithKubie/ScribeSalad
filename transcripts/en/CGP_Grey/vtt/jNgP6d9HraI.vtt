00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.290
1066!

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.719
The start of the royal family on these fair
isles.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.250
Well, there were kings and mini countries
before that and druids before that, and Pangaea

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.980
before that, but we have to start somewhere
and a millennia ago is plenty far -- if that

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.660
leaves out Æthelred the Unready, so it goes.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.540
William the Conqueror, conquered in the 'Norman
Conquest' -- Norman here being code for *French*.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.160
Because it's the olden days, people had lots
of kids, but to keep things simple this family

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.390
tree is going to leave out many of them on
each branch because not every child matters.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.130
So William had three kids we care about: William
II, Henry I and Adela.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.390
If you've seen the video about royal succession
-- click here if you haven't -- you'll know

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.210
that formal rules for passing on the crown
will get established, but for now, it's a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.309
free-for-all, home team advantage to the eldest
son, but never forget bigger-army diplomacy.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.870
Upon William the Conquerors death, William
II became king.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.820
William II didn't marry, and on a bros day
out with Henry died in a 'Hunting Accident'

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.350
that gave Henry I the crown.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.129
Henry I had at least 26 children of which
only two were 100% legit.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
He declared his daughter would rule next (after
his son died in a ship wreck) and swore his

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.890
knights to honor Empress Matilda by crossing
their hearts, hoping to die, sticking a needle

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.320
in their eye -- *but* when Henry I died while
Matilda was in France, many ignored this while

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.220
her cousin Stephen raced to Westminster using
faster army diplomacy to get coronated first.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.610
Empress Matilda did eventually return and
start a decades-long civil war -- that was

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.690
pretty much a stalemate because turtling in
the 1100s was an effective RTS tactic.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.060
While she did rule part of the island, as
Matilda never had an official coronation,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.600
her monarchical status is disputed.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
Now, as Stephen's children were either dead,
disinterested, or a nun -- his crown went

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.250
to his nephew, Henry II who had four sons:
Henry the Young, Richard the Lionheart, King

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.360
John… and Geoff.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.170
(Guess who died before his turn?)

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.400
Henry II saw the history thus far of conquering,
assassination, (maybe) usurpation, attritional

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.690
war -- and decided waiting until after the
death of the current king before sorting out

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.490
the *next* king didn't work.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.300
So Henry II changed the system and crowned
Henry the Young co-king with him, invoking

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.700
the rule of two: one is none.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
Two is one.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.290
If it's important, you need a backup.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.590
It was a good plan for stability, helped by
the young King's popularity, but unfortunately

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.960
-- the apprentice rebelled against the master,
rallying his brothers -- which resulted in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.891
another civil war of disputed monarchs during
which Henry the Young died of dysentery, Henry

00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:09.729
the Elder died of fever, and Richard I took
the crown.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080
After Richard came John and four eldest son
successions in a row: John to Henry III (insert

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.730
Magna Carta here) to Edward I (Longshanks)
to Edward II -- to Edward III.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.819
Actually Ed II was overthrown by Isabelle
of France A.K.A the She-Wolf of France A.K.A.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.819
his wife.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.720
After deposing her husband, she acted as regent
for their son.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.170
Every one of these arrows glosses over a bit
of complexity.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.689
Edward III had five sons: Edward the Black
Prince, Lionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas,

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.140
none of which would wear the crown.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.969
When Edward III died, his throne would have
gone to The Black Prince, but he was dead

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.719
at the time so the crown went to his boringly
named son Richard, now the second.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.630
There's a bunch of drama lamma stuff around
Richard the second which your English teacher

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.670
might force you to read about -- but spoiler
alert, history's ending is always the same:

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.670
bigger-army diplomacy, this time from Henry
IV who gets the crown and Richard II gets

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.180
starvation in captivity.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.480
Another Henry before we get to the War of
the Roses:

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
A war that strikes terror (and boredom) in
the minds of students of history the nation

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.069
over who have to deal with *this* family tree
'simplified' to explain why everyone was angry,

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.269
but the shortest version ever is Edward III's
great, great, grandsons duked it out, even

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.310
though one of them was dead for part of the
fight -- but we can't get into that now so

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.870
Henry VI to Edward IV to Henry VI to Edward
IV.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.870
The end.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.909
Edward IV, on his deathbed left his crown
to his son.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.019
But being twelve he needed protection, so
Richard, his best-ist uncle in the world,

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.689
promised to take super-good care of him.

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.999
Edward V then promptly disappeared under suspicious
circumstances that left Richard to become

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.999
Richard the third.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.299
But he didn't stay king for long because Edward
III's great, great, great, great grandson

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.499
Henry VII -- took the crown, put a ring on
Elizabeth of York to lock down that royal

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.680
legitimacy and then sired Henry VIII -- splitter
of churches, and ladies.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.029
Henry VIII thought it was high time to formalize
the rules of inheritance, so he wrote them

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.689
out in his will -- basically saying oldest
boys first, girls only if there aren't any

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.719
boys -- and Parliament approved the rules.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.859
Which should have made everything neat and
tidy, but we're about to enter the really

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.969
messy time...

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.810
… Because Henry's son lived just long enough
to screw it up -- inheriting the throne at

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.980
9 there was, of course, a scheming protectorate
running things, yet he still declared at 15

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.260
that his father's rules were dumb and his
sisters were dumb and that his first cousin

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.480
once removed, Lady Jane Grey, should be the
next monarch instead.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.680
Then he died and Lady Jane Grey became queen
at sweet sixteen, sort of -- in a disputed

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.170
status way for nine days, until beheaded by
Mary, the first really, truly officially nobody

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.389
doubts it Queen.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.690
Mary didn't have any kids, and passed the
crown to Elizabeth I who became the second

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.280
queen in a row… to also not have children.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.710
But, no problem because Lady Jane Grey was
next in … oh.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.710
Right.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.940
Now, this is the point at which we acknowledge,
Scotland Exists.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.449
They'd been doing their own royal thing which
for our purposes joins the English branch

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.460
where Edward III's great granddaughter married
into it in the 1400s and then goes: James,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.690
James, James, James, James, Mary Queen of
Scotts, James.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.650
Bringing us back to the 1600s.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.090
Henry the VIII's sister importantly also married
into this line of the family giving it English

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.780
legitimacy points in the eyes of the English
Parliament, which asked to borrow Scotland's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.419
James, making him king of two countries with
two numbers in his name depending on where

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.580
you're counting from.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.879
James had a son, Charles I, and you might
think this unification of the monarchs means

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.879
the very messy time is over.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.919
But no.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.169
Because Cromwell.

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.580
Cromwell didn't like kings and beheaded Charles
I: declaring no royals no longer, making himself

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.669
The Lord Protector which was in no way like
a king -- even though he was in charge and

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.039
it was a hereditary office passed to his son.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.960
But the Cromwells didn't last -- mainly because
his son was a fancy country squire who didn't

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.560
follow rule 0: keep the army happy -- giving
Charles's son, Charles II, the ability to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.449
reestablish the monarchy.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.210
Charles II had lots of children, all of which
were illegitimate, leaving his brother, James

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.509
II next in line.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.770
But James II was *Catholic* and ever since
Henry split the church, Catholics had terrible

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.949
approval ratings.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.819
But conveniently, he had nice Protestant daughters,
one married to a Dutch Prince who by the nature

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.750
of these things was the grandson of Charles
I. Bonus English legitimacy points, plus,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.169
who doesn't like the Dutch?

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.220
With James so unpopular and William and Mary
so popular, the army and nobles pretty much

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.479
invited the royal couple to 'invade' and James
II fled.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.879
William and Mary ruled as co-monarchs, but
without children the crown went to Queen Anne,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.669
who also didn't produce any heirs, though
not from lack of effort -- she was pregnant

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.090
*seventeen* times.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.610
Again, finding themselves with a no-royals-no-longer
situation, Parliament decided it was really,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.599
truly seriously the time to sort out the rules
of inheritance to avoid pretenders from every

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.689
branch of this messy tree fighting over the
crown.

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.110
Parliament did a royal reboot to clear the
cruft, defining Sophia of Hanover -- the granddaughter

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.639
of James dual numbers to be the new starting
point for all claims to the crown.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.389
These rules finally stuck, thus ending the
very messy time.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.409
George I, son of Sophia, was the first king
under the new rules, then his son George II,

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.939
to George III, and even though he lost America
and his mind, never fear, the rules are here,

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.030
so the crown continued to calmly descend the
family tree, going to George IV, who didn't

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.630
have any surviving children, to William IV
who had ten children -- all illegitimate,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.910
then passing through his dead younger brother
to Queen Victoria who started her reign in

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.919
1837 and made it to just over the finishing
line of the 20th century.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.919
Which is a doubly impressively long time given
the state of medical technology then.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.419
After the end of her age, the crown went to
her son Edward VII to George V…

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.569
to Edward VIII who *finally* breaks up this
neat and tidy (and somewhat boring) line of

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.700
succession by committing a scandal: marrying
a commoner.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.310
An American Commoner!

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.060
An American Commoner *divorcee*! *twice over*

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.060
::Gasp::

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.229
Actually, the divorces were a real problem
and weren't compatible with the Monarch's

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:52.380
role as Head of State *and also* the Church
of England in the 1930s.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.389
Edward abdicated to his brother George VI
-- who was reluctant to take the crown, and

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:03.229
then had to oversee World War II and the subsequent
breakup of the British Empire -- which drained

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.860
the reluctant King's health, who died at 56
leaving the crown to Elizabeth the Second,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.010
in 1952 at the age of 25.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.900
Seven years older than Victoria, her great
great grandmother was on her coronation day,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.330
but in early September, 2015, Elizabeth became
the longest-reigning Queen in not just British

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.930
history, but world history.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.789
From Elizabeth II the crown continues on to
Charles, the longest heir apparent in British

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:30.599
history, to his son William, to his son George.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:59.220
And that, is a brief history of the royal
family.
