00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:04.667
In this video, I want to introduce you to the number i,

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:10.333
which is sometimes called the imaginary, imaginary unit

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.562
What you're gonna see here, and it might be a little bit difficult,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:17.333
to fully appreciate, is that its a more bizzare number than

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.178
some of the other wacky numbers we learn in mathematics,

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:25.983
like pi, or e. And its more bizzare because it doesnt have a tangible value

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:29.002
in the sense that we normally, or are used to defining numbers.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:35.667
"i" is defined as the number whose square is equal to negative 1.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:44.002
This is the definition of "i", and it leads to all sorts of interesting things.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.324
Now some places you will see "i" defined this way;

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:50.968
"i" as being equal to the principle square root of negative one.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:55.240
I want to just point out to you that this is not wrong, it might make sense to you,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.800
you know something squared is negative one, then maybe

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.674
its the principle square root of negative one.

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:02.671
And so these seem to be almost the same statement,

00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:04.900
but I just want to make you a little bit careful, when you do this

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.733
some people will even go so far as to say this is wrong,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.467
and it actually turns out that they are wrong to say that this is wrong.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.841
But, when you do this you have to be a little bit careful about what it means

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:16.649
to take a principle square root of a negative number, and it being defined

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.900
for imaginary, and we'll learn in the future, complex numbers.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.918
But for your understanding right now, you dont have to differentiate them,

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:26.587
you don't have to split hairs between any of these definitions.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:31.333
Now with this definition, let us think about what these different powers of "i" are.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.321
because you can imagine, if something squared is negative one,

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:37.667
if I take it to all sorts of powers, maybe that will give us weird things.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.566
And what we'll see is that the powers of "i" are kind of neat,

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:45.302
because they kind of cycle, where they do cycle, through a whole set of values.

00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:50.225
So I could start with, lets start with "i" to the zeroth power.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:53.569
And so you might say, anything to the zeroth power is one,

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.005
so "i" to the zeroth power is one, and that is true.

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.978
And you could actually derive that even from this definition,

00:01:59.978 --> 00:02:03.646
but this is pretty straight forward; anything to the zeroth power, including "i" is one.

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:07.000
Then you say, ok, what is "i" to the first power,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.667
well anything to the first power is just that number times itself once.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.002
So that's justgoing to be "i".

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.324
Really by the definition of what it means to take an exponent,

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.000
so that completely makes sense.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.993
And then you have "i" to the second power.

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:22.933
"i" to the second power, well by definition,

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:29.002
"i" to the second power is equal to negative one.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:33.000
Lets try "i" to the third power ill do this in a color i haven't used.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.634
"i" to the third power, well that's going to be "i" to the second power times "i"

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:44.838
And we know that "i" to the second power is negative one,

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:48.067
so its negative one times "i" let me make that clear.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.067
This is the same thing as this, which is the same thing as that,

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:52.965
"i" squared is negative one.

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:58.492
So you multiply it out, negative one times "i" equals negative "i".

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:01.325
Now what happens when you take "i" to the fourth power,

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:06.897
I'll do it up here. "i" to the fourth power.

00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:10.659
Well once again this is going to be "i" times "i" to the third power.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.235
So that's "i" times "i" to the third power. "i" times "i" to the third power

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:21.990
Well what was "i" to the third power? "i" to the third power was negative "i"

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.306
This over here is negative "i". And so "i" times "i" would get negative one,

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:31.650
but you have a negative out here, so its "i" times "i" is negative one,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.000
and you have a negative, that gives you positive one.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.966
Let me write it out. This is the same thing

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:43.167
as, so this is "i" times negative "i", which is the same thing as

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:46.975
negative one times, remember multiplication is commutative,

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:49.251
if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers you can just switch the order.

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.316
This is the same thing as negative one times "i" times "i".

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:55.984
"i" times "i", by definition, is negative one.

00:03:55.984 --> 00:03:59.839
Negative one times negative one is equal to positive one.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.672
So "i" to the fourth is the same thing as "i" to the zeroth power.

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.319
Now lets try "i" to the fifth.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.266
"i" to the fifth power. Well that's just going to be "i" to to the fourth

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:14.653
times "i". And we know what "i" to the fourth is. It is one.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:19.669
So its one times "i", or it is one times "i",

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.341
or it is just "i" again. So once again it is exactly the same thing

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.012
as "i" to the first power.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.067
Lets try again just to see the pattern keep going.

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:27.006
Lets try "i" to the seventh power.

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:28.400
Sorry, "i" to the sixth power.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.319
Well that's "i" times "i" to the fifth power, that's "i" times "i" to the fifth,

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.570
"i" to the fifth we already established as just "i",

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.235
so its "i" times "i", it is equal to, by definition,"i" times "i" is negative one.

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:47.997
And then lets finish off, well we could keep going on this way

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.598
We can keep putting high and higher powers of "i" here.

00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:52.502
An we'll see that it keeps cycling back.

00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:56.263
In the next video I'll teach you how taking an arbitrarily high power of "i",

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.333
how you can figure out what that's going to be.

00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.489
But lets just verify that this cycle keeps going.

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:06.667
"i" to the seventh power is equal to "i" times "i" to the sixth power.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:11.914
"i" to the sixth power is negative one. "i" times negative one is negative "i".

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:14.839
And if you take "i" to the eighth, once again it'll be one,

00:05:14.839 --> 99:59:59.999
"i" to the ninth will be "i" again, and so on and so forth.
