1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
You know, I am always getting ready
for home invasion or a situations mart.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,210
It might be the problem is that they're
just too many things to worry about.

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:09,781
I can also,

4
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:14,400
I also have to worry about fucking ticks
and things that I can't see like flesh

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:17,010
eating bacteria and Murcia
worry about more than anything.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,540
Leslie asteroidal impacts you
too. Yep. Oh really? Yeah.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,810
Because they can come and then wipe out
civilization almost instantaneously.

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,680
There was something that I just retweeted
a yesterday of the Graham Hancock put

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,670
up. They found a new impact
site at 12,500 years ago,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,670
that that coincides with
the end of the ice age.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,320
This is one of the things that he and
Randall Carlson had been saying ad nauseum

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,350
and now Brian or Robert Schoch rather
who's a professor at Boston University.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,370
Did you hear about the,
uh,

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,710
explosion on the media the
next December, December? Yeah.

15
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:57,711
This media that exploded in December
had something like 50 times the power in

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,350
the atmosphere. Oh, 10
10 atomic bombs. Jeez.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,330
10 Times the power of the atomic bomb
that exploded in Hiroshima. Wow. Yeah.

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,090
And it exploded in our
atmosphere. But no, there's um,

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,740
this impact that they think happened
and well, there's two concepts. Uh,

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
Robert Schoch thinks that
it might've coincided.

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,280
These impacts might've coincided with,
uh,

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,620
he believes there's a great deal of
evidence for a mass coronal ejection that

23
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,720
there was some sort of a solar flare,

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,440
massive solar storm that happened,

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,200
which can periodically
happen every few thousand,

26
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:38,400
every few hundred years something can
happen. And when that does happen,

27
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,820
it just wipes out everything.
And he said that there was thunderstorms.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,960
So like there's, they sit thunderstorms
or lightening storms that were like,

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,780
like the hail that was coming out
outside that we filmed today. But that,

30
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,050
but like lightening put that back up
please. Jesus. So this is the, uh,

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,450
impact created that they found in
Greenland. Um, it's say 30 miles,

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,300
31 kilometers across, which
is not 15 miles. Yeah.

33
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:07,200
Somewhere around 15 miles
in fucking sanely. Huge.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,640
But do you think, um, as you
think about your impending doom,

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,020
which is going to happen,
right?

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,560
I just worry about the civilization
being we're so dependent upon electricity

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,990
and any small catastrophe, oh, this is,

38
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:29,991
they have an an impact
video of where it hit a wow,

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,310
so it's all, all this, this hit like
where there's glaciers right now,

40
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:38,820
but there's this massive
impact they got hit man. The,

41
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:42,870
the people that lived 12,500
years ago got hit. They got,

42
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,700
there's more than one crater too,
by the way.

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,730
This is one of the many craters that they
found during the time period of 12,500

44
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:54,360
BC or 12,500 years ago
rather to 10,000 years ago.

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,540
In that time period,
that 2000 year time period,

46
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,270
they think there was multiple
impacts on the earth. Why? Why?

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,560
I guess it just wasn't our time now.
Well,

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,760
we're lucky we've just been
through a really lucky stage,

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,790
but what he's saying essentially is
that this is what wiped out the Egyptian

50
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,110
civilization.
The first Egyptian civilization.

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,180
This is what wiped out the civilization
that built a, called Beckley tapping.

52
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,210
This is what wiped out the civilization
that preceded Sumir and ancient Babylon

53
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:30,160
and Mesopotamia,
that all those were a rebuild of a,

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,860
I can't wait for him to come back
on again. He's coming back on again.

55
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,810
Graham Hancock cause coming back on again,
I think April debate,

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,060
that other guy that you had on the
podcast, it was great. Yeah. Wolves,

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,730
Michael Shermer, who was actually a
friend of mine who I like, but he's,

58
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,950
he's a skeptic and there's an issue with
skeptics and that the issue is not that

59
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,410
it's not good to be skeptical.
It's very good to be skeptical.

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,350
The problem is when you
approach things as a skeptic,

61
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,270
you're not approaching
them as a scientist.

62
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,680
And I'm not saying that Michael Does this,

63
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,880
but that I think he did in that debate.
I think it was a mistake. People,

64
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:05,881
they approach these things looking
to debunk them rather than objective.

65
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:10,390
Really assessing all the possible
evidence. Right. And so because of that,

66
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,790
you miss out on big thing.
Like this is evidence.

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,360
This is not like big foot
tracks or some shit like that.

68
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:21,361
This is fucking real evidence of a crater
that they have dated back to 12,000,

69
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,830
500 years ago.
Yeah.

70
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,840
But people have a hard time believing
in doomsday scenarios because it kind of

71
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,980
like,
you know,

72
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,940
when you talk about taking the entire
chessboard and throw it in the air and you

73
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,650
have evidence for it, look at global
warming and stuff like that. There,

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,050
there is a,
I really believe that people have,

75
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,320
whether it's late and are not a religious
notion that we are ultimately sacred

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,090
and that God would never do something
that terrible to us on moss. And I really,

77
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,230
I really believe that like
humanity itself to go away. No,

78
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,790
because that would make no sense where
we're moving in a certain direction.

79
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,450
We're making progress. There's,
there's this sort of neural net,

80
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:09,430
it's becoming easier to understand what
it is to be each other, uh, you know, uh,

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,600
and, and that's kind of what virtual
reality and being able to download other

82
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:17,890
people's brains will eventually do.
That probably brings us into one,

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,640
I guess universal consciousness,
but you can go on and on.

84
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,570
So the idea that that would be all
obliterated before it happens before the

85
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,990
singularity, for example,
happens is too much to bear.

86
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,030
It would make no sense for us because we
have this narrative that we all kind of

87
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,370
adhere to.
It's very easy to do that.
