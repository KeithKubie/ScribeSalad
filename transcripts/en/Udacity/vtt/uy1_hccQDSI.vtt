00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.490
People have many different conceptions of what data

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.470
scientists do. Some might say that a data scientist

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.320
is just a data analyst who lives in

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.270
California. While others might say that a data scientist

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.470
is a person who's better at statistics than

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.430
any software engineer, and better at software engineering than

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.250
any statistician. As you can see, definitions vary wildly

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.570
from place to place, and from person to person.
