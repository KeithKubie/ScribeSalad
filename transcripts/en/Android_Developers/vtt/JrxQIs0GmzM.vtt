ROMAN NURIK: Hello and
welcome once again to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.920
Android Design in Action.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.070
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.315
ADAM KOSH: Hey guys.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:15.170
My name's Adam Kosh.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.940
NICK BUTCHER: And my name's
Nick Butcher.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.060
ROMAN NURIK: And we are
back from hiatus.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.940
We took a nice long break to
give ourselves some time to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.250
prepare for Google I/O 2013, and
now that the conference is

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.830
over, we now have a chance to
talk about all the cool things

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.730
that were announced, all the
wonderful design sessions that

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.190
took place, and that's what
we'll be doing today.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.850
So with that, let's just jump
right in, because we have a

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.030
lot to cover since there was
a lot that happened at I/O.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.680
So the first thing we want
to do is look at all the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.480
different sessions
that took place.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.200
There were a lot of design
sessions this year.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.143
I don't know exactly how many--
something like seven or

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:52.750
eight or something.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.610
But they were all jam packed
with different bits of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.440
information on a variety
of different

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.640
subtopics within design.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.820
So the first that we want to
talk about is Rachel Garb's

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.690
and Helena Roeber's
session, "Enchant,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.700
Simplify, and Amaze--

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.740
Android's Design Principles."
So I guess the way we should

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.660
probably do this is we should
each talk a little bit about

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.930
what takeaways there
were for us.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.750
For me, the big takeaway
here was the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.870
association of emotion--

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.120
positive and negative
emotions--

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.590
from the session.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.580
Rather, the association of
positive and negative emotions

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.670
with UIs and how those
play together.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.160
There's a lot of interesting
things about writing guide and

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.890
things like that.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.700
ADAM KOSH: Yeah, and I guess
for me it was interesting

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.743
because I think Rachel
introduces the vision as sort

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:51.130
of being touchy-feely.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.740
And for me, it was always hard
to wrap my head around how

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.360
that relates to design
for myself, because

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.580
I'm more of a developer.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.640
And so I really like the
examples that she gave, like

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.880
actually showing how-- like, for
example, one of the ones

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.130
here is decide for me, but let
me have the final say.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.940
You can see that.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.920
So, for example, when you're
deleting a message, it deletes

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.240
first, and then there's
an undo action

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.490
rather than a dialog.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
same for me.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.450
It's how they actually apply
these very, very snappy

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.720
principles, and she shared how
they actually helped them

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.100
inform their design decisions.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.590
So there's a section in there
where they're assigning

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.310
marbles for things you do well
and bad marbles for things you

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.960
do badly, and that really helps
you to lay up different

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.760
design decisions.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.080
And I thought that was a really
interesting technique.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.180
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and they also
mentioned very briefly

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.280
the Android Baseline Study that
we conducted about a year

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.630
or two ago.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.440
That was kind of one of the
foundations of a lot of these

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.480
design principles.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.970
I think it's mentioned somewhere
near the beginning.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.160
So it was a really good
overview of the design

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.900
principles, and I think that the
closest page on our design

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.660
guide to this session is
obviously the Creative Vision

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.420
Design Principles section,
which goes

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.360
through all of them.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.780
So they went through that in
excruciatingly good detail.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.890
So that was a good session.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.424
Should we move on
to the next one?

00:06:11.424 --> 00:06:11.921
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:12.890
Sure.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.430
ROMAN NURIK: Next was "Agile
UX Research Practice in

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.620
Android." This was by Miki
Konno and Bethany Fong.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.870
And so here, they go through a
bunch of different techniques

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.420
that the Android team uses, as
well as lots of different

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.950
companies out there--

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.740
a couple of different techniques
for really

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.960
lightweight, really cheap
research, stuff that doesn't

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.660
involve millions of dollars
or thousands

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.650
of dollars, or whatever.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.900
It's stuff that you
can basically do.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.970
Like one of my favorites
was the Cafe Study.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.220
You go into a Google Cafe or
into a Starbucks or something,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.940
and you just show your app or
show a very specific flow

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.560
within your app to a few people
and kind of measure

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.790
their reactions in
certain ways.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.600
So it's very, very lightweight,
and very quick,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.070
hence the name agile.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.385
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:59.520
I'll admit I actually haven't
got around to looking at this

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.390
particular session yet, but
it's on my to-do list.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.190
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, these are
each like 40 minutes or so,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.020
so, I mean, it is a
lot of content.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.090
ADAM KOSH: I've got a lot of
backlog of sessions to watch.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.220
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I like the
way that they laid out the

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.330
traditional research process,
and it's like this stage

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.240
followed by this stage
followed by this

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.140
stage, and that's it.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.415
But there's no way that's going
to work in the Android

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:18.236
world where the pace of mobile
app development is just too

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.370
agile, and they can really
compress it down.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.278
So I thought it was really
interesting.

00:07:22.278 --> 00:07:25.361
They stressed how important to
do research is, but showed how

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.714
to do it in an agile way.

00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:28.440
It was really, really,
really great.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.716
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.870
And in the very beginning,
they had this,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.670
I guess this grid--

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.830
not really a grid, I guess a
chart-- of the different

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.200
techniques that you could use.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.880
And they focused more on
the qualitative and

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.400
behavior side of things.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.300
So right around here.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.860
They didn't really spend too
much time talking about the

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.330
other stuff, because sometimes
it can cost more.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.260
Some of it is kind of outside
of the scope of a small

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.390
research team.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.890
So definitely, if you're
interested in this kind of

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.340
area-- this general area of UX
research, they talk about a

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.300
whole bunch of techniques.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.650
And here are, I think, the major
four techniques they

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.090
talk about.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.260
They actually also spent a lot
of time on the Pulse Study.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.840
I think they went into
the most detail

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.235
about this Pulse Study.

00:08:09.235 --> 00:08:10.730
So, yeah.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.720
UX research.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.980
The next session was "Cognitive
Science and

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.980
Design." And this is one
of my favorites.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.730
Alex is a tremendously
good speaker.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.380
He was on the show--

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.560
in I think it was the
notifications.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.720
It was notifications
and something else.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.580
ADAM KOSH: Google Mail.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:29.780
ROMAN NURIK: The
design process.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.752
ADAM KOSH: The Google Mail
design process, yeah.

00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:31.240
NICK BUTCHER: And Google Mail.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.550
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.360
So he was on the show, and
he talked about that.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.690
And he's a tremendously good
speaker, and he did a session

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.830
on cognitive science
and design.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.740
So he mentioned a couple
of things--

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.480
the Gestalt Principles, he
mentioned things like

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.799
proximity closure, et cetera.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.890
We could see here this kind
of triangle and so on.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.130
And this is actually really
important, because it's one of

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.460
the fundamental bases of the
Holo visual language, kind of

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.090
this use of space and topography
to communicate

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.290
hierarchy and structure.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.620
And you can kind of see that.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.260
Even without a whole bunch of
lines, you can still make an

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.260
association or form a mental
model of the relationship

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.350
between these different
groups of circles.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.740
So it's kind of one of the
fundamental bases for the Holo

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.790
visual language, so it's kind
of a good session for that.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.100
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.460
I think I was saying to Roman,
this session, regardless of

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.420
Android or design or anything
else, it's just really, really

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.500
interesting to watch.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.330
And one particular slide I
liked-- and I don't think we

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.410
have it here, but it had a bunch
of different shapes, and

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.870
then they're colored in
different colors, as well.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.450
And he sort of showed how the
colors are very easy to spot

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.080
the differentiation, but
the shapes are not.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.130
So, again, it implies back to
sort of the Holo visual

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.470
language using spacing and
contrasting colors to

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.160
differentiate.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.810
And he also mentioned
affordances.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.490
And I actually really
liked this slide.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.620
There is the previous slide that
showed a bunch of similar

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.210
looking trash cans of different
colors, and then

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.740
this slide showed trash cans
with different colors,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.440
obviously, but also different
slots, and they afford

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.790
different types of things
being put inside them.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.230
So that was a more effective
type of trash slash recycling

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.680
combination.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.860
And one other that I really
liked was a slide about

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.010
peripheral vision.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.650
So he uses this really funny
analogy of a tiger.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.580
You walk into a room, a test
study, and the first thing you

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.840
see is a tiger.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.730
And they did this study, or
something-- or I guess this is

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.050
based on a study.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.470
Your response time to things
right in front of you is

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.680
actually slower than your
response time to

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.360
things around you.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.480
And so your peripheral vision
is very important.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.870
And that's actually one of the
reasons that a lot of things

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.070
on Android are near the corners
and edges of the

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.480
screen, rather than in
the very dead center.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.680
NICK BUTCHER: You should
watch the talk.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.150
It's phenomenal.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.440
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.640
It's really good.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.155
ADAM KOSH: It's really good.

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:51.910
ROMAN NURIK: It's really,
really good.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.580
One last thing I wanted
to mention, since

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.500
this talk is so good.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.430
You also talked about
recognition, so your ability

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.100
to recognize people's faces
versus their names.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.286
Your ability to recognize their
faces is something like

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:06.620
almost constant time.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.470
Like, within 100 people, you'll
instantly recognize

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.310
your friends.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.690
Versus in a list of 100 names,
it'll take you a while to find

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.710
your friends' names.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.910
So really kind of interesting
tidbits here and there.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.590
We've probably spent a lot
of time on this, and

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.580
let's just move on.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.200
The next session was also
very, very good.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.030
It was by Jens Nagel and Rich
Fulcher on the Android User

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.790
Experience Team.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.050
They're both interaction
designers.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.650
In this session, they basically
covered navigation,

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.510
and really more higher
level structure.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.170
So rather than looking at an
app as a set of pixels or a

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.390
set of individual screens, they
looked at it as a whole,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.030
and they talked about
different types of--

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.960
I guess they used this kind of
use case modeling practice to

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.430
look at or to plan out or
map out an application.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.770
So they went into a little bit
of depth on this BarKeeper

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.920
app, where they basically looked
at different people and

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.470
their different use cases and
mapped them out in this not

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.500
really a flow chart, but
more like a diagram.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.490
And this helped them make
decisions about what

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.554
navigation structures they
should use in the app.

00:12:14.554 --> 00:12:16.295
NICK BUTCHER: One of my favorite
bits of this talk is

00:12:16.295 --> 00:12:18.744
where they explain some of the
design decisions behind some

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.450
of the Google or Android
stock apps, like the

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.100
calendar and so forth.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.860
So they went through the process
of how they arrived at

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.130
the particular navigation
structure they used and showed

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.330
variations and why they wouldn't
work and so forth.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.930
It was really interesting.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.030
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.720
I thought it was just really
useful how they showed--

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.480
I think it was several examples
where they show what

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.350
an app could look like with
tabs, with the spinner, with

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.260
the drawer.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.290
I don't know if they show
examples of the six pack or

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:43.950
dashboard patterns.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.050
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.760
It was almost never
the proper place.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.490
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.030
It never turned out to be
worthwhile selecting.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.950
But I thought it was really
useful just because it applies

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:54.490
to any app.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.570
You could go through these
different iterations and see

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.500
how it would work with these
different patterns.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.130
And certainly there's pros and
cons to each of them, which I

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.400
think was the takeaway.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.670
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.350
And I really like how
they separate out

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.580
the structure into--

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.540
well, they have a couple
of common patterns for

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.010
recognizing structure.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.170
So they look at apps that may
have a specific focus--

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.220
like one of the top level
sections is the most

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.980
important--

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.050
and then apps that are very
deep, where they have an equal

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.300
weighting of sections,
but each section

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.500
itself is very deep.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:30.060
And they look at another type
of structural pattern, where

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.510
an app is very, very
interconnected,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.660
which is this case.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.810
So it's really a good way
of structuring or

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.070
thinking about your app.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.140
Rather than thinking about its
features or the individual

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.110
components, think about
it as a whole.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.260
Like what are the different
types of use cases that you're

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.620
trying to solve for
different users?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.940
NICK BUTCHER: And then, of
course, they spent a fair

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.890
amount of time talking
about the navigation

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.510
drawer pattern, as well.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.310
And I think Jens made an
excellent point about how this

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.780
is a community pattern that's
emerged, and how we've spent

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.940
our time taking a look at all
the different community

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.650
implementations and what works
well and what we felt could be

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.590
improved slightly, and how we've
gestated on that process

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.100
and really put a lot of thought
and effort into

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.185
providing some guidance that we
hope will really solidify

00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:18.672
this space so people have some
stability of expectations of

00:14:18.672 --> 00:14:20.110
how this works.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.970
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.190
Yeah.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.210
So the navigation drawer was one
of those patterns that was

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.940
introduced in Jens' and Rich's
talk, and Nick and I covered

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.710
it later, which we'll
talk about.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.730
But definitely we'll probably
do another full episode of

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.060
ADiA on just the navigation
drawer at some point.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.446
ADAM KOSH: There's going to be
a lot of demand for that.

00:14:37.446 --> 00:14:38.370
NICK BUTCHER: It's
a hot topic.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.610
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.600
For sure.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.750
So, moving on.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.700
Then Nick and I did a session
called Android Design for UI

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.790
Developers.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.630
And this was kind of more
like a developer talk.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.370
It wasn't really so much for
designers, but I think

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.770
especially Nick's part, the
responsive design area--

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.600
this was incredibly useful for
both designers and developers.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.710
So at a very high level,
we covered navigation--

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.930
so we covered how
to implement the

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.600
navigation drawer, for example.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.440
And then Nick did a whole big
bit on responsive design

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.590
techniques, and Nick,
I'm sure you want to

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.060
talk about that here.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.670
And then I finished off with
implementing the Holo visual

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.180
language, like how to implement
dividers and touch

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.440
feedback and different
things like that.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.060
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I took the
opportunity of having the

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.955
stage at I/O to talk about one
of my favorite topics, which

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.260
is responsive design.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.770
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.030
talking about some of the
limitations of the scalable

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.435
approach and discussed some
strategies you can use to deal

00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:33.460
with that, to cope with it.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:33.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.460
It's very, very good
information, especially for

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:35.900
developers.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.176
So if you're a designer and your
developers come back to

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.160
you and say, oh, that's going
to take too long and I don't

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.220
know how to do it, whatever.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.960
Just point them to
this session.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.710
There's a lot of good
information here.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.770
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.100
I have nothing else
to add other than

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.950
go watch the session.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.240
It's a good one.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.490
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.390
Really quickly--

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.990
two things that we, again,
talked about for developers--

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.450
the navigation drawer, and then
Nick talked about sliding

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.130
pane layout, which is sort of a
new presentation for master

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.220
detail views--

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.730
and Google Hangouts is
an example of an

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.900
app that uses this--

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.250
where basically on a phone, it's
a single pane that slides

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.120
off the screen to reveal
the master pane.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.970
And on a tablet, they're both
visible at the same time.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.680
There's obviously a lot more
detail to that pattern there.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.690
But in case you're a developer
and looking to implement that,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.990
basically look at the navigation
drawer guide here,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.070
with this link at the top, and
then the sliding pane layout

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.200
link is a link to
the reference.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.600
There's no actual design guide
topic for sliding panes right

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.410
now, but that's kind of the
best place to look at for

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.830
basic information about it--

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.080
obviously in this session,
as well.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.900
Yeah.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.070
So for those watching, our
awesome producer [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.340
has just told us that Nick's
audio is, yet again, on only

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.420
the left channel.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.200
Sorry about that.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.130
If you can't hear Nick and only
one ear is plugged in,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.380
just switch to the other ear.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.300
Sorry about that.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.231
We'll fix that for
the next time.

00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:02.800
ADAM KOSH: It's sort of like
a repeating problem.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.240
NICK BUTCHER: Am I speaking out
of the corner of my mouth

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.680
again [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.790
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.359
All right.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.260
So this is actually an
interesting one, "An

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.440
Engineer's Pragmatic Guide to
Design" from Braden Kowitz.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.360
I heard about this, but there's
still no video up, so

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.030
we can't really talk about it.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.660
ADAM KOSH: We all heard good
things, but there's no video

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.170
up, so we haven't had a chance
to watch it because we

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.869
couldn't attend in person.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:24.960
So we're looking forward
to watching it.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.829
ROMAN NURIK: It looks
really good.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.530
That's all I can say.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.340
But just check out this link
down here at the bottom.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.500
I'm sure the YouTube video will
be posted at some point.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.290
It's just a matter of time.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.410
But, yeah, it's probably going
to be a really good session.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.920
Or if it was a really good
session and you were there,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.140
feel free to say so
in the comments.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.330
And then there was another
session from some YouTube

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.540
folks on "Designing Products
for a Multi-Screen World--

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.505
The YouTube Perspective." It's
Tom Broxon and Josh Sassoon.

00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:57.985
I hope that's right.

00:17:57.985 --> 00:18:00.170
And my favorite thing
about this was

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.530
actually these charts.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.930
They basically did a whole bunch
of research into how

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.030
people use their devices.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.620
So this wasn't an
Android-specific talk.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.910
This was basically looking at
Android, iPhone, TV, iPad,

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.760
Android tablets--

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.828
ADAM KOSH: Every screen that you
could possibly want to use

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:16.380
or consume content in.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.820
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, basically
every screen that's--

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.460
Yeah.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.670
And so they created these like
little diagram journals of how

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.930
people use their devices.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.720
So this is basically like a time
graph, where I think it's

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.190
just kind of a full day.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.720
And they just highlighted the
portions where people were

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.020
using their devices.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.420
And so they made little
observations around, like,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.940
people mostly user phones
throughout the entire day,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.750
kind of snacking a little bit
of time, whereas the TV

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.950
portion of your usage was more
towards the nighttime,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.480
obviously, with very,
very kind of

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.070
heavy continuous portions.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.580
So some of these charts are very
interesting to watch, and

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.830
they definitely made some
good observations.

00:19:03.155 --> 00:19:04.620
NICK BUTCHER: I've yet to say
it yet, but I think it's a

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.630
really interesting space, as
well-- how we deal with the

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.810
multi-device when everyone has
all these different devices.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.630
I think it's really
interesting.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.290
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, another thing
that was really good about

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.380
this is that--

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.750
so YouTube is obviously a very
popular brand, and one of the

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.550
things that's very important to
them is maintaining their

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.270
brand across different
platforms.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.660
And there's especially a part
at the end where they talked

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.500
about how did they reconcile
their brand with the platform.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.605
And I think it was Tom that
mentioned this, but he's

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:35.880
basically like, we want to be
true to our brand, and we want

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.250
to be true to the platform, but
we don't want to sacrifice

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.230
one over the other.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.400
So if you're working with
somebody, or project managers

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.760
or developers that
are thinking--

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.630
or designers--

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.655
that we really need this to be
fully brand consistent, there

00:19:50.655 --> 00:19:56.180
are definitely ways to achieve
that while not letting

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.830
platform conventions stop you
or anything like that.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.838
ADAM KOSH: Yeah, it's a very
common question we get asked

00:20:00.838 --> 00:20:02.110
around that.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.820
ROMAN NURIK: And I think we
want to do another session

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.423
just on this at some point.

00:20:05.423 --> 00:20:06.752
NICK BUTCHER: I think we should
do an entire show on

00:20:06.752 --> 00:20:07.270
that subject.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.590
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.652
There's a lot to talk
about there.

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:10.050
All right.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.250
So moving on from
the sessions.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.470
Those are just some
of the sessions.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.300
I think design was probably
mentioned in more areas.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.210
But we also had a few labs, or,
I guess, workshops at I/O

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.080
that were related to design.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.560
The first was from Nazmul
and Izabel--

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.160
"UX Design for Developers."
So this is a very,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.520
very popular workshop.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.430
I think it was so popular
and there was too

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.910
much overflow, I guess--

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.740
too many people trying to get
in that couldn't-- that they

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.010
actually had to redo
the session.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.410
They did two versions
of the session

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.580
just to fit the demand.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.480
So this was an incredibly
popular session.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.470
They also talked about use
cases, just like Rich and Jens

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.620
did in their talk.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.840
They also talked about
personas-- so basically the

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.120
process of doing some
high level UX--

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.040
I guess thinking through the UX
for your product, thinking

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.280
about who was using it, and
then thinking through the

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.660
different use cases and
prioritizing them.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.410
So basically they went through
the process, I think, of doing

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.520
this for a pizza ordering type
app, and it was basically a

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.170
lot of folks just
wireframing and

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.806
diagramming it out on paper.

00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:19.640
So as you can see here--

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.785
NICK BUTCHER: A quick
note on these labs.

00:21:20.785 --> 00:21:24.360
Unfortunately, these labs
weren't recorded, and so you

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.550
won't be able to watch it, but
some materials might be

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.200
available if you want to work
through the lab in your time.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.440
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.500
So these links here
aren't to videos--

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.760
these links at the bottom
are to the materials.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.440
So for this UX Design for
Developers lab, this link

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.840
actually points you to
developerlife.com/UX.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.820
They started kind of a blog, and
also a Google+ community

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.100
just for this project.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.700
And it's very, very popular.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.825
So if you're interested in UX
design, if you're interested

00:21:54.825 --> 00:21:57.510
in learning about it, definitely
this is a very good

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:02.100
beginner guide to it.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:02.880
Moving on.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.600
Then Nick, Adam, and I, we also
ran our Android Design in

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.610
Action Live lab.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.110
And this is also
quite popular.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.080
We only did one of these.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.030
But basically what we did is we
kind of took an alternative

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.930
approach to a very
similar problem.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.310
Rather than doing the standard
classical personas and use

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.870
cases stuff, we thought about
it a little more from an

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.210
engineering standpoint--

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.700
the different objects you
work with, the different

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.950
connections between them, and
the different ways to group

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.300
screens and such.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.900
And so for about two hours,
folks came to the lab.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.580
They worked with pencil and
paper, and we gave out sketch

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.530
pads and things like that, and
we just had a whole bunch of

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.850
fun going through the process
of creating a mobile banking

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.380
application for teenagers,
which is kind of an

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.340
interesting little
problem there.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.910
But my favorite thing,
I'd say, about

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.600
this was these guys--

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.700
everybody that came,
thanks for coming.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.700
One of my favorite things that
happened was that we actually

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.300
got together a whole
bunch of folks

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.420
from the design community.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:15.360
Like Taylor Ling was there, we
had Lucas Rocha from Pattern,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.840
Walmer from Brazil.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.770
A whole bunch of folks were
there as TAs, so they walked

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.155
around and helped people
as they had questions.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.570
What did you guys think of the
experience of the live lab?

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.560
ADAM KOSH: I thought
it was really cool.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.020
it was definitely something
we haven't done before.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.680
Normally, we're used to doing
code labs at Google I/O, so it

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.900
was something new
and different.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.230
And I was just really impressed
with all of the work

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.620
that the attendees came
up with at the end.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.700
So I think we may post some
of those at some point?

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.736
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
at some point.

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:45.280
ADAM KOSH: Or we'll
see how we go.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.635
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:50.290
I made sure to capture the G+
profiles of all the winners--

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.250
well, the winners.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:56.270
I think the TAs selected like
four or five different apps

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.890
to, I guess, to win.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.030
NICK BUTCHER: I'm pretty sure
that during the lab, you said

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.650
they were all winners,
you big cheeseball.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.500
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, that's right.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.410
Well, they are all winners,
basically.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.600
It was really, really good.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.680
ADAM KOSH: It was good.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.840
ROMAN NURIK: I think this
is a good photo of it.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.180
We said we have time for 10 or
15 presentations, but at least

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.850
30 or 40 people came up to try
to present their work, which

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.560
was just kind of awesome.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.060
ADAM KOSH: Oh, and by the way,
these were hand-sketched

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.080
designs in the end.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.270
Some people did use their
computers, but for the most

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.490
part, they were hand-sketched,
which was really cool.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.160
NICK BUTCHER: The two things
I liked about the lab was

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.963
because it's a developer
conference-- and

00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:32.390
we polled the audience.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.370
It was primarily developers
there.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.910
And we said we want to introduce
you to the concepts,

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.717
how you think through your
application and sketch it all

00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:44.030
out, rather than just, which I
think a lot of people do, is

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.920
dive into the code too quickly
and invest a lot of time in

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.800
something which they then
might throw away.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.850
So it's really interesting to
get people thinking about

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.910
sketching and thinking through
the problem space a lot more,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.390
applying the design rigor a lot
more before jumping into

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.910
code, which is really
interesting.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.825
And also, I want to second, it
was great to meet a bunch of

00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:02.450
the people.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.020
So some of the really active
people in the Android design

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.750
community-- so you might have
seen them joining the ADiA

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.680
Hangouts we've had a couple of
times and posting on the G+

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.610
community on the hashtag #ADiA
and #AndroidDesign.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:16.567
It was really great to
meet those guys.

00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:17.521
They rock.

00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:18.703
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:25:18.703 --> 00:25:19.430
Totally.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.370
OK, so that was the lab.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.510
And again, if you're interested
in running through

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.486
it at home, just visit this link
here and it points you to

00:25:26.486 --> 00:25:28.570
a Google Drive folder containing
all the slides and

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.390
everything.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.840
All right.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.730
NICK BUTCHER: It's
j.mp/adialive.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.500
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
j.mp/adialive.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.790
So I think that was
it for I/O--

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.460
oh, wait.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.780
No, there was more.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.850
Did we miss-- oh, no.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.440
That's right.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:42.580
That's right.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.710
That's part of the news.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.700
So there was more, obviously,
with Google I/O 2013.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.940
We'll mention a couple
of things about

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.910
apps that were launched--

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.630
Google Apps that were updated.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.460
Actually, before we talk about
the awesome ADiA Android app,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.080
any parting thoughts for Google
I/O 2013, the in-person

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.650
experience?

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.210
ADAM KOSH: For me, it was just
great to see a heavier design

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.223
focus than previous years,
especially on the Android

00:26:09.223 --> 00:26:10.570
side, of course.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.510
There was just a really
great vibe there.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.020
I really enjoyed it.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.380
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.350
For those of you who didn't get
to attend, there's a bunch

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.490
of stuff that happens at I/O
that isn't recorded in the

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.300
sessions and so on.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.390
So we were involved with a bunch
of panels, for example,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.030
where we were meeting developers
who were talking

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.910
about how they found
success or their

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.390
experiences with Android.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.490
And one of the things that came
through for me was the

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.330
importance of Android design.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.090
A lot of businesses were saying
this has impacted

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.430
numbers we care about, like
install numbers and revenue

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.286
and so on because we've adopted
the Android design

00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:41.380
principles.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.310
So I think it really shows the
maturity of the Android user

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.300
base out there, and how they
really appreciate a

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.050
well-designed app.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.670
That was cool.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:47.830
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and actually
some of that is

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.920
captured in the Biz Dev Bites
video series that we published

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.660
around the same time as I/O.
So if you're interested in

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.510
hearing real-world product
managers, designers,

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.790
developers talk about their
experience not only with the

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.690
design guide and using things
like responsive design, but

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.910
also just with the impact of
those types of things and

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.420
those kind of technical
changes--

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.330
the impact on that on their key
numbers, the things that

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.760
they care about--

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.780
definitely check out the Biz
Dev Bites series on Android

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.814
Developers, the YouTube
channel.

00:27:19.814 --> 00:27:26.150
So my parting thought is it was
obviously awesome to meet

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.530
everybody again.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.230
It's always kind of stressful
for folks on the Android

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.140
team-- or I guess anybody
working at Google that's

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:33.980
staffing I/O--

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.970
to take care of.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.300
But I think this year more
than other years it was a

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.710
little more relaxed, and it was
definitely able to engage

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.620
more in kind of friendly
conversations with developers

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.190
rather than jumping around
between different places.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.280
So it was definitely an
awesome conference.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.980
If you didn't get to attend this
year, definitely try to

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.200
attend next year.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.230
And, yeah, here's to
Google I/O 2014.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.900
All right.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.280
So let's talk about the
ADiA Android App.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.290
So I'm going to butcher his
name, unfortunately--

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.620
Andreas Stutz.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.380
Is that right?

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.770
So sorry if we pronounced
it wrong, Andreas--

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.030
really sorry.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.270
But this app is awesome.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:11.770
ADAM KOSH: It's top notch.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.410
It's really good.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.340
ROMAN NURIK: We actually
have it here.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.740
Let's really quickly
switch over to it.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.050
So this is the app.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:22.140
It basically let's you look at
past episodes of ADiA it lets

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.830
look at all the slides, it lets
you watch the videos.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.567
ADAM KOSH: It notifies you
of upcoming shows.

00:28:26.567 --> 00:28:29.660
NICK BUTCHER: Can you play an
episode of ADiA in ADiA

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:29.760
ADAM KOSH: Yeah.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.430
Let's see if we can do
the "Inception."

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.660
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:30.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:31.860
ROMAN NURIK: Let's
see if we can do

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.100
the current one that's--

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.890
oh my god.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.610
ADAM KOSH: Oh yeah.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:35.960
ROMAN NURIK: It's working.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.780
ADAM KOSH: Oh, but it's a bit
delayed, so we don't see the

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.590
screen of the screen
and the screen.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.450
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.390
So you can basically watch
Android Design in Action.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:48.040
You can also participate
in some of the Google+

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.960
conversation and Google+
activity on

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.320
Android design and #ADiA.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.230
And it's just an overall
well-built app, too, so it's

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.450
just a good example of a
well-built, responsibly

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.620
designed Holo app.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.946
It's just an awesome
app all around.

00:29:04.946 --> 00:29:06.800
I definitely recommend
downloading it.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.400
NICK BUTCHER: So thank
you, Andreas.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.860
It's been really
useful for me.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.470
So a bunch of people, they come
up and ask me for design

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.380
feedback, and I can say,
hey, oh yeah, we talked

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.530
about this on ADiA.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.320
And I can put up my tablet
and put up the

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.180
redesign very easily.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.820
So it's been phenomenal to
be able to have that.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.200
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.760
For sure.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.530
So next, this new tool--

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.970
well, I guess this old existing
tool, Scala Preview.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.880
First of all, it now has an
Android version, so you can

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.370
actually mirror what's
on your computer to

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.490
your Android device--

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.660
very similar to Android Design
Preview, the tool that we

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.010
talked about I think
a few weeks ago.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.300
But this is now free, and it
also works over Wi-Fi.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.210
So basically it's almost the
same thing as Android Design

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.740
Preview, but it works over Wi-Fi
and probably has a few

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.630
other features.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:57.050
I haven't used it myself, but
it's definitely good if you're

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:02.050
a designer and interested in
seeing real-world scenarios of

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:07.040
how your designs look
on those devices.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.410
So, yeah.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.155
So that's now free.

00:30:08.155 --> 00:30:09.405
Go ahead and get it.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.130
ADAM KOSH: Maybe we should
jump to the apps first.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:17.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.550
Let's do this one first.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.450
So there are a couple of new app
updates that came around

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.320
the time of Google I/O. The
first and I guess the biggest

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.550
to me is the Google Play
Music redesign.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.010
So first of all, we launched
Google Play Music All Access.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.700
It's a monthly subscription,
you get whatever music.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.190
And as part of that launch, we
also updated this new UI.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.360
So I think one of the best
things about this is that,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.360
first of all, it uses new
patterns and things like that.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.590
It's obviously a very
responsive app.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.070
It has a very clean--

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.830
ADAM KOSH: It's got
the drawer.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.530
ROMAN NURIK: It's got
the drawer, yeah.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:00.330
But it's also just filled with
interesting design touches,

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:06.020
like fading semi-translucent
action bars and lots of

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.520
different swipeable panels.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.270
It's just really cool overall.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.990
NICK BUTCHER: I think it's
a phenomenal app.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.290
It has got, like you say, some
design flourishes in there

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.670
that they've really thought
through all the minute and

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.925
minor details that it's worth
spending a good 20 minutes,

00:31:18.925 --> 00:31:22.490
half an hour playing
with it, just--

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.280
ROMAN NURIK: Did we lose Nick?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.170
Nick seems to have frozen up.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:26.785
ADAM KOSH: All right.

00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:27.600
Well, keep going.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:27.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.090
So, what Nick said.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.410
And there's also Google
Hangouts, which is a new app,

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.910
obviously, and it's a
messaging-type app.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.810
It lets you communicate with
people via, obviously

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:45.500
pictures, text, and video
using Video Hangouts.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.915
But it's a new app, and it uses
that sliding pane layout

00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:49.230
that we talked about earlier.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.080
And there are a whole bunch
of other updates.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.190
There's obviously
the I/O 2013--

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.940
Nick is back.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.580
Thanks for coming, Nick.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.940
Sorry to have lost you
the first time.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.680
There's obviously, also, the
Google I/O application, which

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.110
will be open sourced
at some point.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.480
The Google+ app got updates--
a whole bunch of updates

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.840
across the board, the Play
apps especially.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.860
Play Music, Play Books, Play
Magazines, they've gotten this

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.260
new, consistent visual styling
across the board.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.365
ADAM KOSH: Which matches
the Google Play Store.

00:32:17.365 --> 00:32:18.000
Oh, we lost Nick again.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.970
ROMAN NURIK: And Nick's
lost again.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.640
But anyway, so the reason we
wanted to talk about this

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.020
really quickly is that one of
those design touches is this

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.090
kind of fading semi-translucent
action bar.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:34.320
And Cyril Mottier actually wrote
up a blog post on how to

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.170
do this in your own apps.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.340
So here's a quick couple of
screenshots of what it

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.960
actually looks like.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.850
ADAM KOSH: And I think he's got
a sample APK you can just

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.610
go and install if you want to
actually play with it, because

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.110
I think you have to see it in
motion to really sort of

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.000
understand it, but--

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.860
NICK BUTCHER: And then someone
else has also turned it into a

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.360
library on GitHub if you
want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.290
ADAM KOSH: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:53.720
Great stuff.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:53.900
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.350
I'm sure they'll link
up at some point.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.400
The idea is that you have this
kind of transparent action bar

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.930
that shows content at the top.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.340
But as soon as you start
scrolling, it becomes solid.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.960
So it's a very cool effect.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.280
It's definitely worth
considering

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.170
for one of your apps.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.490
So that was that.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.620
And then I think this
may be the last one.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.290
The last one is--

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.750
and this is, I think,
a few weeks old.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.770
But in case you're interested
in using some of the action

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.330
bar icon pack icons, so like
Refresh and Share and things

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.160
like that, in case you don't
want to necessarily use the

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.260
Illustrator version or the
Photoshop version-- there's

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.950
like a million different
versions available.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.720
There's now a font for this.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.380
So you basically just
install this font.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.210
It's kind of like Wingdings
or Webdings

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.480
or symbol or whatever.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.680
But you can just type in the
right character, and you

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.930
instantly get that icon.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.005
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] quite
handy if you're doing

00:33:47.005 --> 00:33:47.950
some wireframes or something
like that.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.090
If you want to do some
high-fidelity wireframes or do

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.096
an action bar, and action with
an icon in text, you can do it

00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:54.860
really easily.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.520
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.520
It's one way to speed up your
workflow and just really

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.700
streamline your process,
so it's very cool.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:01.960
OK.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.940
So I think that's it.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.830
That's all the time
we have today.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.389
That was kind of a whiz bang
tour of Google I/O 2013--

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.270
the different sessions that we
had, the different labs that

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.830
took place, and also some of the
news that came out of that

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.120
as well as some of the news
around that time.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.300
So thanks for joining, and
again, we're probably going to

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.719
try to get back into our regular
cadence of Android

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.409
Design in Action episodes.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:27.570
Sorry for the very long hiatus,
but we're now free.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.531
We have nothing else to
do-- just kidding.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.210
So we hope to see you
next week or the

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.219
week after, or whatever.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.280
So thanks.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.360
I'm Roman Nurik.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.900
ADAM KOSH: See you
later, guys.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.360
My name's Adam Kosh.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.380
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks very
much from Nick Butcher.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:42.810
ROMAN NURIK: Later, guys.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.989
ADAM KOSH: Bye.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:45.239
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.
