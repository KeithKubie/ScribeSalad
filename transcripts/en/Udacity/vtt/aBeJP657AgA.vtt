Let's talk about calendars.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.040
Many forms need the concept of a date.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.920
It shows up everywhere,
ordering plane tickets, movie tickets,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.600
setting a doctor appointment, and
probably a million other examples.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.090
You could turn dates into a three or
four parts process with time,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.350
day of month, months, and a year.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.670
Or you could use a calendar widget.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.560
I like calendar widgets because they are
much simpler, and more straightforward.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.810
You've got a few options for
displaying calendars.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.980
You could use the browser's
implementation by setting the attribute

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.380
type equal datetime-local
on an input element.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.990
But, you might find that it
doesn't match the visual theme

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.810
of your app, that's fine.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.580
You could always edit it styles or
simply roll on your own CSS,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.180
using web components or
a JavaScript widget.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.880
See the instructor notes, for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.040
some more info about styling or
building calendars.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.800
Other way, the most important thing,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.950
Is to show your users a full calendar
when they need to set a date.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.590
If not, users will never get away
from your form to look up dates

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.580
which only increase the odds that they
will abandon the form all together.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.760
Here is another example.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.720
When I wish to book a flight,
I can see clearly what are the dates

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.520
that this flight is going
to take off and land.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.820
Dates are common.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.570
Show your users calendars
when they need them.
