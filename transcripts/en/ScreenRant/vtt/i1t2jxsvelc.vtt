00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Disney has done a lot of great things for
popular culture, and touched countless lives

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
across the globe.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.370
Their movies are touted as being wholesome
and full of morality, in addition to being

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.900
fun for the whole family.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.640
Through the ages, their heroines, heroes,
and villains have been some of the most iconic

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310
in all of cinematic history.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.110
But there are some critical eyes out there
too, and some adults aren’t convinced that

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.070
the lessons on the big screen are always the
right ones.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.680

And hey, can you guess the movie based on
these emojis?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.290
Stay tuned for the answer, and play along
with our trivia questions as we go through

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.910
the entries.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000
And now, back to the task at hand.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.430
Here are 10 Times Disney Was A Bad Example
For Kids.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
Consent (Sleeping Beauty, Snow White)
Here at Screen Rant, we love a good nap.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.440
But when a quick snooze turns into an eternal
slumber, well that’s cause for concern.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.210
It’s even worse when the only antidote is
an intrusive smooch from a complete stranger.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.270
Some of the criticisms leveled at Snow White
and Sleeping Beauty revolve around the importance

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.570
of consent.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.490
Some weirdo strides out of the woods to make
out with an unconscious woman, without her

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.039
permission, only to become his property.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.060
This has led critical thinkers to the conclusion
that Disney should be doing more to empower

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.899
women, instead of just putting them to sleep.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.759
Judgment (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)
Have you ever heard the saying “it’s what’s

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.280
on the inside that counts”?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.039
There’s no better example of this than in
1996’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.060
As the title suggests, Quasimodo doesn’t
conform to social standards of handsomeness.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.200
But he’s a really great human.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.490
So when it comes time for Esmerelda to choose
between him and the hot guy, it seems like

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.240
she should follow her heart instead of her
eyes, right?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.240
WRONG.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.979
Esmerelda goes for the eye candy, which is
a very un-Disneylike thing to do.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.419
Especially since, when it comes to what’s
inside, he doesn’t hold a candle 

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:23.180
to Quasimodo.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.069
Self-Esteem (Cinderella)
Perhaps one of the most common pieces of advice

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.709
handed down through the generations is to
just “be yourself”.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.189
And anyone who doesn’t like you for you
probably isn’t worth your time anyway.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.980
Sure, if a Fairy Godmother showed up on our
doorstep, we might ask for a few nips here,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.989
a little tuck there, and maybe take a bit
off the top — nothing crazy.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.430
But when Cinderella is in the same position,
she gets extreme with it.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.590
So when Prince Charming falls in love with
her, it’s not exactly her he’s falling

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.590
for.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.239
Critics have argued that the movie sends the
message that “if you wanna land a prince

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.319
charming, you’re going to have to change
everything about yourself”.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.549
Avoidance (Frozen)
Ever had a problem that just seemed too big

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.549
to solve?

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.110
An overwhelming obstacle that makes you want
to say “screw this, I’m going to live

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.359
in the forest”?

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.359
Same.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.530
But life demands that we stand up straight,
hold our heads high, and deal with the issues

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.329
as they come.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.019
Unless you’re Elsa, in which case it’s
totally cool for you to run away from your

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.019
problems.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.600
Or, at least, that’s the message being sent
in the box office behemoth Frozen.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.940
Rather than getting help or relying on her
support system, Elsa retreats into solitude

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.069
instead.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.569
And while everyone needs a little down time,
there’s a fine line between what’s healthy

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:44.160
and what isn’t.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.379
Body Image (All)
Animation is cool because the artist can take

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.890
whatever they want and make it look however
they want.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.239
And while there are a ton of interesting landscapes,
monsters, and objects in the Disney universe,

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.499
all of the Princesses look the same.

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:01.439
And parents are concerned about the unrealistic
body image standards the characters are setting

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.489
for young kids.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.840
A very small proportion of the world’s population
look like the figures on screen, and might

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.120
be putting pressure on the rest of us to conform.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.079
Nice women are beautiful and slim, while good
men are buff and noble.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:23.370
Any anyone who doesn’t fit into that paradigm
better have access to a Fairy Godmother.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.820
Villainy (All)
Graduates of the Disney School of Villainy

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.480
go on to do great and terrible things.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.970
Thanks to an intense curriculum of manipulation
and assholery, students gain the confidence

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.590
they need to be successful scoundrels in a
rapidly-changing animated landscape.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.340
With special focus on intimidation, maniacal
cackling, and parental murder, graduates are

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.760
some of the most-feared individuals in cinematic
history; they take what they want and burn

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
the rest.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.550
If this is the life you want for your child,
simply turn on any Disney movie and tell them

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.710
to root for the bad guy.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.840
You’ll be amazed how quickly they learn
that the quickest way to the top is to literally

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:11.580
slay the competition.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.620
Criminal Activity (Robin Hood)
Theft with positive intent is still theft.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.240
And no parent wants their kid to end up in
the slammer, regardless of their intentions.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.100
While stealing from the rich to give to the
poor sounds great on paper, at the end of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.570
the day it’s still illegal.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.810
Unless you’re Robin Hood.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.081
Giving what you can to those less fortunate
is absolutely the right thing to do, so in

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:35.080
that way the story is spot on.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.860
But the character’s methodology is very,
very flawed.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.430
It’s wonderful to imagine a world in which
everyone is equal, but critical parents wonder

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.370
how many laws need to be broken to get there.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.240
Self-image (The Little Mermaid)
If everything was sunshine and rainbows all

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.960
the time, movies would be really, really boring.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.780
And even the strongest protagonist would be
nothing without their evil counterpart to

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.050
squish all their good vibes.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.550
Not all trades are fair, especially when one
party has more power than the other.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.430
And sadly, not even everyone’s favorite
little mermaid is immune to a bad contract.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.470
Ariel gives up everything in exchange for
a “normal” physical appearance by signing

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.630
away everything that made her special.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.740
And for what?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.680
That’s right: a guy.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.050
Yet again, all you have to do to land a prince
is make a shady deal and change everything

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.450
about yourself.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.680
Stranger Danger (Snow White, Alice in Wonderland)
There used to be an old commercial whose message

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.280
was “if you don't know what it is, don't
put it in your mouth”.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.560
And we can think of a lot of circumstances
where that advice applies.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.360
But in the interest of keeping things PG,
we’ll keep our examples family friendly.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.310
Snow White eats a poison apple given to her
by a stranger.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.620
And then falls into a coma.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.820
Alice ingests all sorts of funky stuff while
in Wonderland.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.880
And ends up on some psychedelic trip.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.710
Don’t take food from strangers, and don’t
drink from unmarked bottles.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:20.930
It’s really just that simple.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.300
Salmonella (The Princess and the Frog)
The majority of entries on this list have

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.800
to to with issues of trust and morality.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.980
But after the release of The Princess and
the Frog, parents had a physical, real-world

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.320
problem on their hands.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.320
It’s an old adage that “you’ve gotta
kiss a few frogs before you find a prince”

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.020
except you’re not supposed to ACTUALLY kiss
frogs.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.690
Aside from just being gross, there’s a serious
risk of illness when human lips touch the

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.570
bouncy creatures: salmonella.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.710
Kids were allegedly so inspired by the movie’s
touching tale that they headed out to smooch

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.680
their own swamp princes.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:03.930
Most of them got diarrhea, and none of them
found love.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.900
