00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.571
All right.
Let's get moving.

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.000
Good morning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.138
Today, if everything works out,
we have some fun for you guys.

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:28.000
I hope it works out.
We'll see.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I am going to do today is
a very major application of the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.311
frequency response and the
frequency domain analysis of

00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:42.950
circuits.
And this application area is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.475
called filters.
The area of filters often times

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:52.885
demands a full course or a
couple of full courses all by

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:56.131
itself.
And filters are incredibly

00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.435
useful.
They're used in virtually every

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.657
electronic device in some form
or another.

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:08.371
They're used in radio tuners.
We will show you a demo of that

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.200
today.
They're also used in your cell

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.028
phones.
Every single cell phone has a

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:16.464
set of filters.
So, for example,

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:20.942
how do you pick a conversation?
You pick a conversation by

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:25.342
picking a certain frequency and
grabbing data from there.

00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:31.000
They are also in wide area
network wireless transmitters.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.717
Do we have an access point
here?

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:37.837
I don't see one,
but you've seen wireless access

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:41.081
points.
Again, there they have filters

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:44.061
in them.
So, virtually every single

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:49.321
electronic device contains a
filter at some point or another.

00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:54.668
And so, today we will look at
this major, major application of

00:01:54.668 --> 00:02:01.733
frequency domain analysis.
Before we get into that,

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:09.977
I'd like to do a bit of review.
The readings for today

00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:18.688
correspond to Chapter 14.4.2,
14.5 and 15.2 in the course

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:21.177
notes.
All right.

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:30.199
Let's start with the review.
We looked at this circuit last

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.000
Friday --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.009
-- where I said that for our
analysis, we are going to focus

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.830
on this small,
small region of the playground.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.009
And what's special about this
region of our playground is that

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.000
I am going to focus on
sinusoidal inputs.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.796
And, second,
I am going to focus on the

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:05.697
steady state response.
How does the response look like

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:07.685
if I wait a long,
long time?

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:12.101
And then we said that the full
blown time domain analysis was

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:13.868
hard.
This was, remember,

00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:17.401
the agonizing approach?
And then I taught you the

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:21.743
impedance approach in the last
lecture, which was blindingly

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.878
simple.
And, in that impedance

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:28.000
approach, what we said we would
do is --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.386
I will apply the approach right
now and in seconds derive the

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.676
result for you.
But the basic idea was we said

00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:39.551
what we are going to do is
assume that we are going to

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.915
apply inputs of the form Vi e to
the j omega t.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:47.448
Wherever you see a capital and
a small, there is an implicate e

00:03:47.448 --> 00:03:51.323
to the j omega t next to it.
I'm not showing you that.

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:55.490
And what I showed last time,
and the class before that was

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.000
once you find out the amplitude
--

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.831
Once you find out the
multiplier that multiplies e to

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.484
the j omega t,
it's a complex number,

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:08.210
you have all the information
you need.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.747
And once you have this,
you can find out the time

00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:15.578
domain response by simply taking
the modulus of that,

00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:19.631
or the amplitude and the phase
of that to get the angle.

00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.800
And that gives you the time
domain response.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.000
So, our focus has been on these
quantities.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.217
The impedance method says what
I am going to do is replace each

00:04:31.217 --> 00:04:34.551
of these by impedances.
And then the corresponding

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.000
impedance model looks like this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.428
Instead of R,
I replace that with ZR.

00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:51.142
And instead of the capacitor,
I am going to replace that with

00:04:51.142 --> 00:04:53.142
ZC.
And this is my Vc.

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:59.047
ZR is simply R and ZC was going
to be one divided by sC where s

00:04:59.047 --> 00:05:04.000
was simply a shorthand notation
for j omega.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.675
Based on this,
once I converted all my

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:12.940
elements into impedances,
I can go ahead and apply all

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.814
the good-old linear analysis
techniques.

00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:20.390
I will discuss a bunch of them
today.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.662
As an example,
I could analyze this using my

00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:28.139
simple voltage divider
relationship.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.000
Vc is simply ZC divided by ZC
plus ZR times Vi.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.571
And that, in turn,
is, well, let's say I divide

00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:47.000
this by Vi so I can get the
response relation,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is ZC divided by ZC plus ZR.
And ZC I know to be one by j

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.714
omega C, plus R.
And multiplying throughout by j

00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:10.000
omega C, I get one divided by
one plus j omega CR.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.705
It's incredibly simple.
This is simply called the

00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:19.313
frequency response.
And it's a transfer function

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:24.705
representing the relationship
between the output complex

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:30.000
amplitude with the input.
We can also plot this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.723
Notice that in our entire
analysis we have not only

00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:37.819
assumed sinusoidal input,
but we're also saying that let

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.797
us look at this only in the
steady state.

00:06:40.797 --> 00:06:44.670
So, we will wait for time to be
really, really large,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.244
and then look at the response.
And so, therefore,

00:06:48.244 --> 00:06:52.042
we will plot the response not
as a function of time,

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:56.510
but rather we are going to plot
the response as a function of

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.790
omega.
What we are going to say is I

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.557
am going to input a sinusoid and
my output is going to be some

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:06.151
other sinusoid.
And since I'm waiting for a

00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:09.547
long time to look at the output,
time doesn't make sense

00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:11.709
anymore.
Rather, my free variable is

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:14.920
going to be my frequency,
so I am going to change the

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.081
frequency of the input that I
apply.

00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:20.416
And so, I am going to plot this
as a function of omega.

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:24.059
This represents a completely
complimentary view of circuits,

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.517
the time domain view and then
there is a frequency domain

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:31.990
view.
The frequency domain view says

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.971
how did this circuit behave as I
apply sinusoids of differing

00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:42.257
frequencies?
I can plot that relationship in

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:47.141
a graph like this,
and this relationship is simply

00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:51.826
given by a parameter edge the
transfer function,

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:56.610
it's a function of omega.
And I can also plot the

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.283
absolute value of that.
And let's take a look at what

00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:05.511
it looks like.
So, I can look at functions

00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:08.976
like this and very quickly plot
the response.

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:13.464
I am going to do a whole bunch
of plots just by staring at

00:08:13.464 --> 00:08:17.007
circuits and staring at
expressions like this.

00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:20.078
And you will see a number of
them today.

00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:23.464
First of all,
the way you plot these is look

00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:27.952
for the values where omega is
very small and when omega is

00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:31.564
very large.
When omega is very,

00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:36.505
very small this term goes away.
And so, for very small values

00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:39.223
of omega the output is simply
one.

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:42.764
Vc by Vi is simply one.
This part goes away.

00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:46.305
What happens when omega is
very, very large?

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:50.176
When omega is really large,
this part dominates,

00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:54.705
is much greater than one.
If I ignore one in relation to

00:08:54.705 --> 00:08:59.729
this guy and take the absolute
value of that then I simply get

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:05.000
one divided by omega CR when
omega is very large.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.430
So, when omega is very large,
I get a decay of the form one

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.176
over omega CR.
I know the value for small

00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:18.857
omega, and it looks like this
for very large omega.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:23.913
And, if you plot it out,
this is how it's going to look

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:27.191
like.
Let's stare at this form for a

00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:32.944
little while longer.
And let's plot some properties

00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:34.907
off it.
First of all,

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:40.404
you notice something else.
When omega CR equals one then,

00:09:40.404 --> 00:09:44.625
in other words,
when omega equals one by RC,

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:49.042
notice that the output is given
by one plus j.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:55.128
And the absolute value of that
is simply one divided the square

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:58.171
root of two.
So, in other words,

00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:04.554
when omega is one by RC --
When omega is one by CR then

00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:10.210
the output is one by square root
two times its value when omega

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.863
is very, very small.
So, that is one little piece of

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:18.329
information.
If you look at the form of

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:23.985
this, I would like you to stare
at it for a few minutes and try

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:28.000
to understand what this
represents.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.602
This says that for very low
frequencies the response is

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:36.352
virtually the same as the input
in amplitude.

00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:39.676
In other words,
if I apply some very low

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:44.022
frequency sinusoid of some
amplitude then the output

00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:48.028
amplitude is going to be same as
that amplitude.

00:10:48.028 --> 00:10:52.034
And that's a one.
Now, it also says when I apply

00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:56.210
a very high frequency,
at very high frequencies it

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.247
decays.
So, this graph which says I am

00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:06.985
going to pass low frequencies
without any attenuation,

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:12.507
without hammering it,
but I am going to clobber high

00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:18.786
frequencies and give you a very
low amplitude signal at the

00:11:18.786 --> 00:11:24.307
output but pass through,
almost without attenuation,

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:30.478
the input at low frequencies.
And so this is an example of

00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:36.000
what is called a low pass filter
or LPF.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.732
What this is saying is that
this little circuit here acts

00:11:41.732 --> 00:11:47.157
like a low pass filter.
It's a low pass filter because

00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:52.685
it passes low frequencies
without attenuation but kills

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:56.574
high frequencies.
If I take some music,

00:11:56.574 --> 00:12:02.000
and you will do experiments
with this in lab.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.762
When is lab three?
People are doing lab three

00:12:04.762 --> 00:12:07.775
right now, right?
Lab three is going on right now

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:10.663
and early next week as well.
And, in lab three,

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.991
you will play with looking at
the response to music of

00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:17.255
different types of filters.
If apply some music here,

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:20.834
you will see that the output
will pass low frequencies but

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:22.905
really attenuate high
frequencies.

00:12:22.905 --> 00:12:26.484
You will hear a lot of the low
sounding base and so on but

00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:30.000
attenuate a lot of the high
frequencies.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.112
All right.
The other thing that I

00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:38.851
encourage you to do is Websim
has built in pages for a large

00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:43.908
number of such circuits.
You can go in there and play

00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:48.091
with the values of RC,
or L for that matter,

00:12:48.091 --> 00:12:53.537
for a variety of circuits.
And, if you click on frequency

00:12:53.537 --> 00:12:59.471
response, you actually get both
the amplitude response and the

00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:04.180
phase as well.
You can play with various

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.239
values of RLC and see how the
frequency response looks like

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:12.728
for each of the circuits.
As a next step,

00:13:12.728 --> 00:13:17.439
what I would like to do is just
give you a sense of how

00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:21.626
impedances combine.
This won't be very surprising

00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:27.034
given that they behave just like
resistors, but it's good to go

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:32.780
through it nonetheless.
Suppose, just to build some

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.518
insight, suppose I had two
resistors in series.

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:39.578
All right.
R1 and R2.

00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:44.315
And this was my A and B
terminals respectively.

00:13:44.315 --> 00:13:50.186
And let's say the complex
amplitude of the voltage was Vab

00:13:50.186 --> 00:13:53.481
across this.
Then I could relate,

00:13:53.481 --> 00:14:01.000
let's say Iab was the current,
I can relate these resistances.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.716
Or, I could relate Vab and Iab
as follows.

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:10.663
Simply Vab divided by Iab
equals R1 plus R2.

00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:15.610
I know that.
And the same thing applies to R

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.902
viewed as an impedance.
It's still impedance R,

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:27.000
and so this one still goes
ahead and applies.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.539
The second thing I can try is
the circuit of this form.

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:40.683
A, B, and I have an R1 and an L
in this case.

00:14:40.683 --> 00:14:46.826
And what I can do is,
in the impedance model,

00:14:46.826 --> 00:14:53.807
I can view this as an impedance
of value j omega L.

00:14:53.807 --> 00:15:02.324
And I can also combine them to
get the impedance between A and

00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:06.864
B.
Much as I got a resistance

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:11.932
between A and B,
I can get an impedance between

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:18.432
A and B as Vab divided by Iab.
And that will be given by ZR1

00:15:18.432 --> 00:15:23.389
plus ZL, and that is simply R1
plus j omega L.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:30.000
Similarly, I can do an even
more complicated circuit.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.279
So, resistance.
And here I have a capacitor in

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:43.953
series with the resistance,
and then I apply inductor to

00:15:43.953 --> 00:15:46.186
it.
This is A, B,

00:15:46.186 --> 00:15:49.395
Iab and plus,
minus Vab.

00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:57.767
And let me call this R1 and let
me call this R2 and this is C

00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:02.769
and L.
I can go about combining these

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:08.215
in much the same manner that I
combine my resistances in the

00:16:08.215 --> 00:16:13.846
series parallel simplifications.
I can define an impedance Zab

00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:19.661
between the A and B terminals as
ZR1 plus Z of this combination,

00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:25.200
impedance of this combination,
which is simply impedance of C

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.000
and that of R2 in parallel with
each other.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.135
I get Zc in parallel with ZR2.
Notice that this notation

00:16:34.135 --> 00:16:38.421
simply says that look at the
impedance of the capacitor in

00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.654
parallel with a resistor.
And then, finally,

00:16:41.654 --> 00:16:45.639
I add to that the series
impedance of the inductor ZL.

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:49.097
Exactly as you would have done
for resistances,

00:16:49.097 --> 00:16:53.759
if all of these resistances you
would have said R of this piece

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:57.593
plus the R of the parallel
combination plus the R of

00:16:57.593 --> 00:17:03.383
whatever was here.
This time around we have

00:17:03.383 --> 00:17:08.740
impedances.
And replacing this with the

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:15.506
values, this is R1.
I know for ZL it's j omega L.

00:17:15.506 --> 00:17:21.427
And so, for ZL,
parallel ZR2 it is given by

00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:29.603
ZCZR2 divided by ZC plus ZR2,
which is simply R1 here and j

00:17:29.603 --> 00:17:35.471
omega L.
And let me just substitute the

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:40.214
values here.
I know that ZR2 is simply R2,

00:17:40.214 --> 00:17:46.347
ZC is one by j omega C,
and then one by j omega C plus

00:17:46.347 --> 00:17:50.280
R2.
And I can go ahead and simplify

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.561
that further and get my
impedance Zab.

00:17:54.561 --> 00:18:00.000
Notice how simple analysis has
become.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.623
Using this technique,
using the impedance method

00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:07.401
we've managed to convert our
analysis from solving

00:18:07.401 --> 00:18:11.024
differential equations to going
back to algebra.

00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:15.573
A large part of what we do in
circuits is see how we can get

00:18:15.573 --> 00:18:20.122
back to really simple algebra
and try to be clever about how

00:18:20.122 --> 00:18:23.437
we do things.
So, this is as far as analysis

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:26.367
is concerned.
In the next five minutes,

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:31.224
I want to give you some insight
into how you can build different

00:18:31.224 --> 00:18:34.000
kinds of impedances.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.708
And I won't go into too much
detail but give some insight

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:50.880
into how you can get a sense for
the kind of filters you want to

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.801
design.
Or, at the very least,

00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:55.649
given a filter,
how can you very quickly get

00:18:55.649 --> 00:18:58.496
some insight into what kind of
filter it is,

00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:01.543
how it performs,
what its frequency response is

00:19:01.543 --> 00:19:05.144
and so on.
And, this time around,

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:09.921
this piece of intuition will be
in honor of Umans.

00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:14.113
And back to our Bend it Like
Beckham series,

00:19:14.113 --> 00:19:17.525
I call this "Unleash it like
Umans".

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:23.179
What experts in the field do is
they don't go about sitting

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:28.833
around writing differential
equations, but rather use a lot

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:34.000
of insight into how to solve
these things.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.110
And so in honor of Umans,
I will label this unleash it

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.160
like Umans.
Let's get some insight into how

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.210
the response of various elements
look like.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.839
Let's take, for example,
I have some impedance Z.

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:56.564
Let's say this could be a
resistor, it could be an

00:19:56.564 --> 00:20:01.000
inductor or it could be a
capacitor.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.104
Let's take a look at what the
frequency response of just these

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:07.392
elements look like.
In other words,

00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:10.419
what are the frequency
dependents of Z itself?

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:14.457
Let me just plot the impedance
of each of these elements as a

00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:17.888
function of frequency.
Let me just take the absolute

00:20:17.888 --> 00:20:21.320
value of their impedance.
Notice that it's a complex

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.742
number.
For the inductor it's j omega

00:20:23.742 --> 00:20:25.761
L.
And let me take the absolute

00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:30.000
value omega L in that case and
plot it for you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.299
And use that to develop some
insight.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:38.797
Let's do a simple case first.
If Z is a resistance of value R

00:20:38.797 --> 00:20:43.654
then no matter what the
frequency my value is going to

00:20:43.654 --> 00:20:46.862
be R.
If I have an inductor of value

00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:51.628
L then the impedance is going to
look like j omega L,

00:20:51.628 --> 00:20:55.018
and so I am going to omega L
for that.

00:20:55.018 --> 00:21:00.150
And the dependence of that
simply says that for low omega

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:06.472
the impedance is very small.
For omega zero the impedance is

00:21:06.472 --> 00:21:09.742
zero and it increases linearly
with omega.

00:21:09.742 --> 00:21:12.374
So, it's omega L for the
inductor.

00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:16.920
Impedance increases linerally
as I increase the frequency.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.668
What about for the capacitor?
For the capacitor,

00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:23.938
the impedance is one divided by
j omega C.

00:21:23.938 --> 00:21:27.447
And so, therefore,
I get the dependence being

00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:33.234
related to omega C.
Which says that for very high

00:21:33.234 --> 00:21:38.811
frequencies impedance is very
low, but for very low

00:21:38.811 --> 00:21:45.280
frequencies the impedance is
very high and I get a behavior

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.519
pattern that looks something
like this.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:54.984
It goes as one by omega C.
As omega is very large,

00:21:54.984 --> 00:22:00.504
my impedance is very small.
If omega is very small,

00:22:00.504 --> 00:22:03.708
my impedance goes towards that
of an open circuit.

00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:06.848
This is not surprising.
You've known this before,

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:09.137
right?
That a capacitor behaves like

00:22:09.137 --> 00:22:12.341
an open circuit for DC.
An inductor behaves like a

00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:15.742
short circuit for DC.
Notice that zero frequency here

00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:18.685
corresponds to DC.
The capacitor looks like an

00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:21.301
open circuit for DC,
very high impedance.

00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:24.310
The inductor looks like a short
circuit for DC,

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.318
very low impedance.
And the opposite is true at

00:22:27.318 --> 00:22:31.640
very high frequencies.
While R is a constant

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.687
throughout.
Let's use this to build some

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:37.812
insight into how our circuits
might look.

00:22:37.812 --> 00:22:40.000
Let me do this example.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.724
Let's say I have a Vi and I
measure the response across the

00:22:51.724 --> 00:22:53.000
resistor.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.154
So, I measure Vr divided by Vi
and take the absolute value and

00:23:05.154 --> 00:23:08.704
take a look at how it's going to
look like.

00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:13.690
I want you to stare at this for
me and help me with what the

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.507
response is going to look like.
Let's take incredibly high

00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:21.633
frequencies.
At very high frequencies,

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:26.873
this has a very high frequency,
what do the capacitor look like

00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:32.303
to very high frequencies?
Is it an open or is it a short?

00:23:32.303 --> 00:23:35.572
A short circuit.
At very high frequencies the

00:23:35.572 --> 00:23:38.246
capacitor looks like a short
circuit.

00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:41.367
Then Vi simply appears across
the resistor,

00:23:41.367 --> 00:23:45.751
which means that at very high
frequencies the output is very

00:23:45.751 --> 00:23:49.242
close to the input.
At very low frequencies what

00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:51.843
happens?
At very low frequencies the

00:23:51.843 --> 00:23:54.518
capacitor looks like an open
circuit.

00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:58.827
If this looks like an open
circuit then very little voltage

00:23:58.827 --> 00:24:03.433
will drop across this resistor
here because most of it is going

00:24:03.433 --> 00:24:09.528
to drop across the capacitor.
What is going to happen is,

00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:13.930
for very low values,
I am going to be looking at

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.676
something out here.
And, because of that,

00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:23.202
my response looks like this.
And this is of a different form

00:24:23.202 --> 00:24:27.135
than the one you saw earlier.
In this case,

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:32.099
I pass high frequencies but
attenuate low frequencies.

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:36.126
Not surprisingly,
this is called a high pass

00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:38.000
filter.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.696
You need to begin to be able to
think about capacitors and

00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:51.651
inductors in terms of their high
and low frequency properties.

00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:55.218
And, if you develop that
intuition, once you develop the

00:24:55.218 --> 00:24:59.044
intuition about capacitors and
inductors and their frequency

00:24:59.044 --> 00:25:01.897
relationship,
that will be a big step forward

00:25:01.897 --> 00:25:04.381
in 002.
If you get that insight,

00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:07.546
you will go a long way in terms
of knowing how to tackle

00:25:07.546 --> 00:25:10.482
problems and being able to
quickly sketch responses.

00:25:10.482 --> 00:25:11.000
Yes.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.037
In the case of,
if we get something like j

00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:30.000
omega L, what you can do is take
the limit as omega goes to zero.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.941
If it is omega L then notice
that it is going to start

00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:36.171
linear.
And, on the other hand,

00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:39.889
if when you get very high
frequencies, for example,

00:25:39.889 --> 00:25:43.533
if you get one by something
omega C then this is a

00:25:43.533 --> 00:25:47.251
hyperbolic relationship,
so it is going to go ahead

00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:50.671
looking like this.
So, you can take a look at a

00:25:50.671 --> 00:25:55.356
lot of these functions at their
very low values and see how they

00:25:55.356 --> 00:25:59.000
look like at that point.
All right.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.052
The next one I would like to
draw for you is something that

00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:03.000
looks like this.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.162
Let's say, for example,
I have an inductor L and a

00:26:12.162 --> 00:26:16.324
resistor R and I want to see
what that looks like.

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:20.911
In this particular example,
I have H, take the absolute

00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:23.969
value.
So, what is this going to look

00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:27.027
like?
I am going to look at the value

00:26:27.027 --> 00:26:32.319
across the resistor here.
Here what I am going to find is

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:36.508
that at very low frequencies
this guy is a short circuit.

00:26:36.508 --> 00:26:40.623
Since this guy is a short
circuit, all the voltage drops

00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:44.438
across the resistor so it's
going to look like this.

00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:49.002
And, at very high frequencies,
what I am going to find is that

00:26:49.002 --> 00:26:52.892
the inductor is going to appear
like an open circuit.

00:26:52.892 --> 00:26:56.259
And so, therefore,
all the voltage is going to

00:26:56.259 --> 00:27:00.000
pretty much drop across the
inductor.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.774
It will be R divided by
something plus omega L.

00:27:03.774 --> 00:27:08.369
So, at high frequencies this
guy is going to taper off to

00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:11.241
zero and is going to look like
this.

00:27:11.241 --> 00:27:14.358
And this is back to my low pass
filter.

00:27:14.358 --> 00:27:17.887
Just to go back to a question
asked earlier,

00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:20.841
how do you know what this looks
like?

00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:25.846
I can very quickly write down
the expression for H of j omega.

00:27:25.846 --> 00:27:32.000
This is simply going to be R
divided by R plus if this is VR.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.051
VR is simply R divided by one
by j omega C.

00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:41.260
I multiply it out by j omega C
in the numerator and the

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.022
denominator.
I'm going to find j omega C

00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:49.652
here and I am going to get one
by j omega C here.

00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:55.344
And what is going to happen
with something like this is that

00:27:55.344 --> 00:28:02.000
as omega becomes very small then
I am going to ignore this.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.075
When omega becomes very small,
I can ignore this with respect

00:28:07.075 --> 00:28:12.151
to one, and I get R j omega C.
Given that, is what I've drawn

00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:16.549
here correct or wrong?
This goes away with respect to

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:19.172
one.
I am left with R j omega C,

00:28:19.172 --> 00:28:21.794
right?
For very low frequencies.

00:28:21.794 --> 00:28:26.447
Given what I have drawn here,
is that correct or is that

00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:30.000
wrong?
Well, it's hard to say.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.823
For very, very low frequencies
it starts out being linear

00:28:36.823 --> 00:28:40.966
because it's an omega
relationship,

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:47.424
and then it goes up like this
and then goes out there.

00:28:47.424 --> 00:28:54.857
Let me go onto another example.
Let me do another example here

00:28:54.857 --> 00:29:01.290
which is something like --
I need to make sure I don't

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:05.278
make a mistake here.
If I get R j omega C by R j

00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:09.436
omega C, you know what,
this ends up being a first

00:29:09.436 --> 00:29:12.915
order system,
and so is going to look like

00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:14.696
this.
I blew it there.

00:29:14.696 --> 00:29:19.278
Back to this system here.
If I have an L and an R and I

00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:23.860
look at this equation to look at
what happens across L,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:29.836
you can plot that again.
And for very low frequencies it

00:29:29.836 --> 00:29:34.503
is going to be zero amplitude
here and for very high

00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:38.803
frequencies this is going to be
an open circuit,

00:29:38.803 --> 00:29:43.928
and so the response is going to
look something like this.

00:29:43.928 --> 00:29:48.503
That's going to end up being
your high pass filter.

00:29:48.503 --> 00:29:53.078
As another example,
I would like to do a series RLC

00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:55.000
circuit --

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.856
-- and try to get you some
sense of what that output looks

00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:17.582
like.
Let's use our intuition and

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:22.695
first write down what this looks
like and then go and do some

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:26.699
math and see if the math
corresponds to what our

00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:31.642
intuition tells us.
I want to plot Vr with respect

00:30:31.642 --> 00:30:34.284
to Vi.
I want to plot it there.

00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:38.511
For something like this,
what happens at very low

00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:41.857
frequencies?
We are just looking to get

00:30:41.857 --> 00:30:46.789
very, very crudely what this
graph is going to look like.

00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:51.721
Very, very crudely what this
graph is going to look like.

00:30:51.721 --> 00:30:55.596
Given that I am taking the
voltage across VR,

00:30:55.596 --> 00:31:00.000
what happens at very low
frequencies?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.111
At incredibly low frequencies,
the inductor looks like a short

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:09.301
circuit, but the capacitor looks
like open circuit.

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:14.162
An open circuit in series with
a short circuit that ends up

00:31:14.162 --> 00:31:18.100
looking like an open circuit.
And so, therefore,

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.212
all my voltage falls across VR.
Now, what happens at very high

00:31:23.212 --> 00:31:26.564
frequencies?
At very high frequencies the

00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:32.296
capacitor looks like a short.
But the inductor looks like an

00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:36.200
open circuit now for very high
frequencies, correct?

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.339
Just remember,
capacitor is short for high

00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:42.861
frequencies inductor open for
high frequencies.

00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:46.306
So, this ends up having a very
high impedance.

00:31:46.306 --> 00:31:50.822
At very high frequencies this
guy has a very high impedance.

00:31:50.822 --> 00:31:54.727
And, because of that,
for a high value of frequency,

00:31:54.727 --> 00:31:59.397
I end up going in that manner.
This behavior has the effect of

00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:04.746
the capacitor here.
And for very high frequencies I

00:32:04.746 --> 00:32:10.063
get the effect of the inductor.
And so this means that I have

00:32:10.063 --> 00:32:14.936
very low values for low
frequencies, very low values for

00:32:14.936 --> 00:32:18.303
high frequencies.
And, as the frequency

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:21.405
increases, I do something like
this.

00:32:21.405 --> 00:32:25.481
I keep building up,
then the inductor begins to

00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:30.000
play a role, and then I taper
off again.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.604
This kind of a filter where I
kill low and high frequencies

00:32:36.604 --> 00:32:42.185
and pass intermediate
frequencies is called a band

00:32:42.185 --> 00:32:46.967
pass filter, BPF.
This means that it passes

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:53.231
frequencies in some band.
Let's get some more insight on

00:32:53.231 --> 00:32:57.103
this by writing down the
equations.

00:32:57.103 --> 00:33:02.000
So, Vr divided by Vi is simply
R.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.113
Using the impedance relation it
is R divided by j omega L plus

00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:18.492
one divided by j omega C plus R.
I am going to use this equation

00:33:18.492 --> 00:33:26.206
later, so let me stash it away
on my stack and put a little

00:33:26.206 --> 00:33:31.629
notation there.
I am going to multiply

00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:38.083
throughout by j omega C.
And what I end up getting is j

00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:44.776
omega RC divided by one plus R j
omega RC, and then here,

00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:51.709
I get j times j is minus one,
so I get minus omega squared.

00:33:51.709 --> 00:33:59.000
Let me rewrite it this way.
I get minus omega squared.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.241
So, j j is minus one,
omega times omega is omega

00:34:04.241 --> 00:34:10.821
squared, and then I get an LC.
That's what I end up getting.

00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:16.955
And if I take the absolute
value here, I end up getting,

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:23.312
back to your complex algebra,
the square root of this real

00:34:23.312 --> 00:34:29.000
value squared plus imaginary
value squared.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.170
So, one minus omega squared LC
plus omega RC squared.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.048
This is from,
you can look it up in your

00:34:38.048 --> 00:34:42.423
complex algebra appendix in the
course notes.

00:34:42.423 --> 00:34:47.892
It's simply omega RC here,
then square of the real value

00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:54.156
plus the square of the imaginary
value, and take the square root

00:34:54.156 --> 00:34:56.840
of that.
By staring at this,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:04.000
you can notice that you realize
a really important property.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.091
When omega equals LC.
I'm sorry.

00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:14.558
When omega equals one divided
by LC, what happens?

00:35:14.558 --> 00:35:21.553
Sorry, square root of LC.
When omega is one divided by

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:30.000
square root of LC then omega
squared times LC becomes one.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.858
When this is true then this
becomes one, and one and one

00:35:34.858 --> 00:35:37.507
cancel out.
And, not only that,

00:35:37.507 --> 00:35:41.924
when these cancel out,
these two cancel out at that

00:35:41.924 --> 00:35:47.223
point, so I end up getting a
one, which means that when omega

00:35:47.223 --> 00:35:52.523
equals omega nought equals one
by square root of LC and I end

00:35:52.523 --> 00:35:58.000
up getting a value that is one.
It's pretty amazing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.905
Which means that if I drive
this at omega nought,

00:36:01.905 --> 00:36:06.868
if my sinusoid has a frequency
omega nought where omega nought

00:36:06.868 --> 00:36:11.669
is one by square root of LC,
if I'm sitting here and this is

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:16.225
a black box on the right-hand
side, and I drive this at a

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:20.944
frequency omega nought equals
one divided by square root of

00:36:20.944 --> 00:36:24.931
LC, what does this entire
circuit look like to me?

00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:29.000
I'm sitting there,
the black box here.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.232
I'm driving it at omega nought
equals one by square root of LC

00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:36.354
at that frequency.
What does that circuit look

00:36:36.354 --> 00:36:36.978
like?
Yes.

00:36:36.978 --> 00:36:40.100
It looks like a resistor.
It's pretty amazing.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.569
It means that even though I
have an L and a C here,

00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:47.523
if I happen to drive this at
omega nought then the circuit

00:36:47.523 --> 00:36:51.686
looks purely resistive and it
seems to give me the same input

00:36:51.686 --> 00:36:54.392
appearing at the output.
In other words,

00:36:54.392 --> 00:36:58.000
the effect of these two cancels
out.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.327
And that aspect is called
driving the circuit at its

00:37:02.327 --> 00:37:05.721
resonance point.
Resonance is when you're

00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:10.557
driving the circuit at omega
nought equals one by a square

00:37:10.557 --> 00:37:12.000
root of LC.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.555
I will very quickly sketch for
you a couple of other ways of

00:37:27.555 --> 00:37:32.782
looking at circuits.
Supposing I looked at this

00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:37.490
value here, Vlc,
I looked at the value across

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:43.269
the inductor and the capacitor,
what will the frequency

00:37:43.269 --> 00:37:48.191
response look like?
I am looking at the voltage

00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:53.221
across the inductor and the
capacitor in series.

00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:57.073
Let's see.
Let's go back to our usual

00:37:57.073 --> 00:38:01.191
mantra.
Think about Steve Umans when

00:38:01.191 --> 00:38:03.462
you do this.
What would he do?

00:38:03.462 --> 00:38:07.063
He would say ah-ha,
at very low frequencies the

00:38:07.063 --> 00:38:10.742
capacitor is going to look like
an open circuit.

00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:14.500
In my voltage divider,
I am measuring the voltage

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.335
across an open circuit,
so the entire Vi must drop

00:38:18.335 --> 00:38:20.919
across the inductor and
capacitor.

00:38:20.919 --> 00:38:25.068
Similarly, at very high
frequencies the inductor looks

00:38:25.068 --> 00:38:30.000
like an open circuit now,
so it looks like this.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.640
At very high frequencies
inductor is an open circuit.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:42.257
And, again, I'm looking at the
voltage divider across the near

00:38:42.257 --> 00:38:47.247
infinite resistance,
impedance, so I get a high

00:38:47.247 --> 00:38:52.454
value here as well.
Well, in the middle the value

00:38:52.454 --> 00:38:56.142
dips and I get something like
this.

00:38:56.142 --> 00:39:02.000
So, this thing is called a band
stop filter.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.991
Here I can nail any specific
frequency, as long as the

00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.286
frequency falls in roughly that
regime.

00:39:12.286 --> 00:39:15.000
Yet another example.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.333
The reason I'm working on so
many examples is that to

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:27.243
experts, a large part of what
they do is look at a circuit and

00:39:27.243 --> 00:39:30.064
boom, give a rough form of how
it looks like.

00:39:30.064 --> 00:39:33.717
That can get you half the way
there in most of what you're

00:39:33.717 --> 00:39:37.555
going to do.
How did this look like?

00:39:37.555 --> 00:39:43.444
If I take the voltage Vo versus
Vi, let's take a look.

00:39:43.444 --> 00:39:49.555
At very low frequencies,
the inductor looks like a short

00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:54.888
circuit, correct?
I am talking the voltage across

00:39:54.888 --> 00:40:00.000
a short circuit,
so it looks like this.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.984
At very high frequencies,
I am taking a voltage across a

00:40:04.984 --> 00:40:09.244
parallel combination,
but the capacitor is now a

00:40:09.244 --> 00:40:12.416
short circuit.
So, that looks like a

00:40:12.416 --> 00:40:16.132
capacitor.
This looks like an inductor out

00:40:16.132 --> 00:40:20.302
here and this is a capacitor
holding sway here.

00:40:20.302 --> 00:40:25.830
And so, somewhere in the middle
it goes up and comes down like

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:30.000
that.
So, it's a band pass filter.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.189
What is amazing is that you can
take fairly complicated

00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:36.674
circuits, and just by doing a
quick analysis of what happens

00:40:36.674 --> 00:40:39.568
at very low frequencies,
what happens at very high

00:40:39.568 --> 00:40:42.403
frequencies, you can roughly
sketch the response.

00:40:42.403 --> 00:40:45.238
And then what you should do,
in addition to that,

00:40:45.238 --> 00:40:48.486
is if it's a second order
circuit, just assume that it's

00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:51.380
going to do something
interesting at its resonance

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.806
frequency, at omega nought
equals one by square root of LC.

00:40:54.806 --> 00:40:57.169
Something interesting is going
to happen.

00:40:57.169 --> 00:41:01.576
Check it out.
And for circuits that are first

00:41:01.576 --> 00:41:05.151
order, RC or RL,
the important number is the

00:41:05.151 --> 00:41:09.141
time constant RC.
Usually, when you're driving it

00:41:09.141 --> 00:41:12.465
at one by RC,
omega equals one by RC then

00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:17.287
what happens is that you often
times end up getting a value

00:41:17.287 --> 00:41:22.108
that is one by square root two
times the input value in the

00:41:22.108 --> 00:41:26.846
circuits we looked at here.
Next, what I am going to do is

00:41:26.846 --> 00:41:32.000
talk about a major,
major application of filters.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.818
And that is an AM receiver.
Let me do Radios 101 for 30

00:41:41.818 --> 00:41:48.181
seconds.
These guys have an antenna.

00:41:48.181 --> 00:41:57.454
You take a ground here.
You pick up a signal at your

00:41:57.454 --> 00:42:02.225
antenna.
There is an implied ground as

00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:03.836
well.
And what you do,

00:42:03.836 --> 00:42:07.135
as a first step,
is you begin processing the

00:42:07.135 --> 00:42:10.281
signal now.
What we place right there is a

00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:12.890
little filter that looks like
this.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.265
It is a inductor and a
capacitor in parallel.

00:42:16.265 --> 00:42:20.792
And this capacitor is really
your tuner that you can tune to

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:24.475
radio frequencies.
And then what you have here is

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:30.000
a bunch of other processing and
end up with your speaker.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.218
And the processing that happens
here is you have a demodulator,

00:42:36.218 --> 00:42:42.136
you have an amplifier and a
bunch of other things that let's

00:42:42.136 --> 00:42:48.054
not worry about them for now.
What we do here is the antenna

00:42:48.054 --> 00:42:51.665
picks up a signal.
So, in some sense,

00:42:51.665 --> 00:42:56.079
this part of the circuit here
is your source.

00:42:56.079 --> 00:43:03.000
I could replace it with its
Thevenin equivalent as follows.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.995
So, the front end of your radio
looks like a Vi,

00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:17.927
R, L and a C.
Where have you seen this

00:43:17.927 --> 00:43:19.946
before?
Right there.

00:43:19.946 --> 00:43:26.217
That's the front end of radios.
Let me tell you why I need a

00:43:26.217 --> 00:43:31.000
band pass filter in a radio out
here.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.157
The way life works is as
follows.

00:43:35.157 --> 00:43:41.523
I have my frequency.
Let me do this not in radians

00:43:41.523 --> 00:43:48.149
but in kilohertz for now,
and let me plot your radio

00:43:48.149 --> 00:43:52.696
signal strength.
In the Boston area,

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:59.842
the signals go between 540
kilohertz and they go all the

00:43:59.842 --> 00:44:06.351
way to 1600 kilohertz.
In some areas we have begun to

00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:10.504
use the 1700 extra band as well
for some new stations.

00:44:10.504 --> 00:44:13.561
This is the frequency range of
interest.

00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:17.322
If you look at your radio
tuner, you will see 540

00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:22.260
kilohertz all the way up to 1600
and you can tune your AM radio.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:27.040
The way it works is that each
station is given 10 kilohertz of

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.958
spectrum here.
And so, this is at 1000

00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:36.460
kilohertz, 1010 kilohertz and so
on.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:43.535
And each station transmits its
signal in plus or minus 5

00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:50.867
kilohertz around that point.
And this station transmits it

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:57.170
here and this station transmits
it here and so on.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:02.581
This is 1030.
This guy is WBZ News Radio

00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:06.453
1030, for those of you who
listen to it.

00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:12.113
What happens is that at 10
kilohertz, each station gets 10

00:45:12.113 --> 00:45:18.368
kilohertz, and so WBZ transmits
in the 10 kilohertz around 1030.

00:45:18.368 --> 00:45:23.631
Notice that each of these
signals transmitted by radio

00:45:23.631 --> 00:45:28.000
stations happen within small
bands.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.560
Now, you will learn a lot more
about modulation and how do you

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.654
get a signal to go in a small
band and all that stuff.

00:45:34.654 --> 00:45:36.639
You will learn about that in
6.003.

00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:39.441
For now, don't worry about how
I did all of this.

00:45:39.441 --> 00:45:41.368
How do you listen to that
station?

00:45:41.368 --> 00:45:44.578
The way you listen to that
station is you put a low pass

00:45:44.578 --> 00:45:47.030
filter here.
You put a low pass filter that

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.774
does the following.
Let's say I want to hear WBZ

00:45:49.774 --> 00:45:51.000
1030.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
If I pass this entire signal
through that filter.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.534
And if I arrange to have the
omega nought of my filter at

00:46:04.534 --> 00:46:07.206
1030.
If I can arrange to have the

00:46:07.206 --> 00:46:11.983
omega nought at 1030 then this
is the response of my filter.

00:46:11.983 --> 00:46:17.085
And I am going to pick out this
guy and cut out everything else.

00:46:17.085 --> 00:46:20.000
I am just going to get this.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Let's listen to the station for
some time.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.066
So, you can see I can tune to
the station WBUL.
