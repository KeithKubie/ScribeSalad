00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.500
y equals 1/8 x to the
third minus x squared.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.140
Over which interval does y
of x have an average rate

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.190
of change of 1/2?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.420
So let's go interval by
interval and calculate

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.660
the average rate of change.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
So first let's think about
this interval right over here.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.020
x is between negative 2 and 2.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.202
So negative 2 is less than
x, which is less than 2.

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.660
So let's just think about what
is the value of our function

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.030
when x is equal to negative 2?

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.880
So y of negative 2
is equal to 1/8 times

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.690
negative 2 to the third power
minus negative 2 squared, which

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.550
is equal to--
let's see, negative

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.040
2 the third power is negative 8.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.100
Negative 8 divided
by 8 is negative 1.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.300
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.690
but then you're going to have to
subtract that, so it's minus 4.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.370
So this is equal to negative 5.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.360
And y of 2 is equal
to 1/8 times 2

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.590
to the third power
minus 2 squared.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.840
And that's going to be equal
to 1/8 times 8 is 1 minus 4,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.266
which is equal to negative 3.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.390
So if you want to find your
average rate of change,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.200
you want to figure out how much
does the value of your function

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.950
change, and divide that by
how much your x has changed.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
So we could make a table here.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.950
x, y.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.800
When x is negative
2, y is negative 5.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.350
When x is positive
2, y is negative 3.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.290
So how much did your y change?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:55.030
Well, your y increased by 2,
and your x increased by 4.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
And you could get these
numbers-- you could just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.820
look at it that y increased
from that point to that point,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.830
x increased from that
point to that point.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.220
Or you could say hey, negative 3
minus negative 5 is positive 2.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.240
That's the difference between
negative 3 and negative 5.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.800
If you said 2 minus
negative 4, well

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.572
that gives you, once again, the
distance, or the difference.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:19.780
It would give you positive 4.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.405
But if you look at
it here, it's clear.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.320
When y increased
by 2-- Or we could

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.170
say when x increased
by 4, y increased by 2.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.070
So our average rate of
change over this interval

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.810
is going to be
average rate of change

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:48.560
of y with respect to x is going
to be equal to, well, when

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.980
x changed by 4, by positive
4, y changed by positive 2.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.042
So it's equal to 1/2.

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.000
So it does look like the
average rate of change

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.180
over this interval
right over here is 1/2.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.280
So we got lucky
in this situation,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.300
our first choice-- and
this is a multiple choice,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.890
so it's not a multiselect here.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.630
So our first one
met our criteria.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.240
So we know that
that's the answer.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.100
But let me do one more
of these other ones

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.500
to show you why that
is not the answer.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170
So let's find the
average rate of change

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.190
between that point
and that point.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.750
So let's do another-- let
me do it in another color.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.350
So I'll do this one in purple.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.190
So 0 is less than x,
which is less than 4.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.210
And I'll just do the
table right over here.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.750
x and y.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.600
So when x is 0, what is y?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.440
Well, it's going to be
1/8 times 0 minus 0,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.410
and y is just going to be 0.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.314
When x is 4, what is y?

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:46.730
Well y is going
to be-- let's see,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.030
it's going to be 1/8--
trying to do this in my head.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.020
1/8 times 4 to the third.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.400
4 to the third is 64.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.016
1/8 of 64 is 8.

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:59.500
It's going to be 8 minus
4 squared, which is 16.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.390
8 minus 16 is negative 8.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.223
So in this one, x
is increasing by 4,

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:12.426
x has increased by 4,
what happened to y?

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:15.600
y has decreased by 8.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.910
So the average rate of change
of y with respect to x here

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.570
is y changed-- so I could
write my change in y--

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.260
this Greek letter delta
just literally is shorthand

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.420
for change in.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:34.250
My change in y is negative
8 when my change in x is 4.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.350
So the average rate of
change here is negative 2.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.420
It's negative because as x
increased, your y decreased.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.750
And on average, for every 1 that
x increased, y decreased by 2.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.680
That's where you get
your negative 2 here.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.810
So this clearly, the average
rate of change is not 1/2.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.886
So that confirms that
that is not the answer.

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:56.510
And we know that
these other two, and I

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.551
encourage you to try them
out, will also give you

00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:00.230
an average rate of
change of something

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.589
other than positive 1/2.
