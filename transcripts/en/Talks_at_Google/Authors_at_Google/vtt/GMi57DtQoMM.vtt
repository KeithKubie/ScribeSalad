HANNU RAJANIEMI: Hello,
everybody.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.615
My name is Hannu Rajaniemi.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm very pleased to be here,
and very glad to

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.700
see so many of you.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm assuming you are here
because you know at least some

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.750
of my work.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.100
So I guess I'm mainly known as
the author of the novels "The

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.820
Quantum Thief," and the
"Freckled Prince," and the

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.715
forthcoming "Causal Angel."

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:32.380
If you don't know
that, I'm also a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.720
recovering string theorist.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.670
At the moment, I'm trying
to get over it, honest.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.020
I keep falling back.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.770
Also, at the moment, attending
one of your friendly

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.970
neighbors, the Singularity
University, doing some fun

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.320
things with my teammates
at the moment with DNA.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.980
Can't say too much about
that at the moment.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.620
But what I wanted to talk about
today with you is the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.150
future of books--

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.190
obviously, a subject that I
care about very deeply.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.000
And I'll try to talk about it
not necessarily from the point

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.460
of view of e-books and
e-publishing and things like

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.810
that, but how the form of the
book itself changed as the way

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.380
we create and read
books changes.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.750
And I think we have quite
a bit of time, so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.590
I'll start with that.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.310
And then I will also read a
short story, which is related

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.230
to the themes that I'm
going to talk about.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.430
And then also feel free
to interrupt any

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.980
time with any questions.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.970
And we should have plenty
of time for those

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.680
later on, as well.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.000
So I guess the first question
is, where does one glimpse the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.620
future of books and the obvious
answer is, in a book,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.000
and specifically speaking, a
book that begins like this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"It was the day my grandmother
exploded." If you're not

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.780
familiar with that book,
it's "The Crow

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.540
Road," by Iain Banks.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.990
So sadly, recently he
passed away after a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.490
short battle with cancer.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.440
But it's one of my
favorite books.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.070
And it's certainly one of the
great lines in all of

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.510
literature.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.870
And I read it for the first time
back in 1998, so almost

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.060
15 years ago, back when I was
still living in Finland, where

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.810
I'm originally from.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.480
And I picked it up because, like
probably many of you, I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.850
mainly knew Iain Banks as the
author of the Culture novels--

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.860
so these utopian space operas
set in this society called the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.970
Culture, which is ruled
over by Ray Kurzweil--

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.530
sorry--

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.540
super intelligent artificial
minds.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.770
So I was drawn to
this particular

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.670
the book by the author.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.860
But it actually turned out to be
a very different novel from

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.810
the Culture books.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.830
So if you haven't read it,
it's about a young man's

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.930
attempts to deal with his
complicated family history and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.870
this labyrinth of sex and death
and the disappearance of

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.520
his eccentric uncle Rory, who
leaves behind this mysterious

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.420
manuscript that then the main
character, Prentice, tries to

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.130
piece together to figure out
what happened to his uncle, as

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.550
well as all kinds of weird and
fun stuff related to his

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.520
family history.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.710
So if you haven't read it,
I highly recommend it.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.670
But the reason I mention it was
that it really spoke to me

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.290
when I read it.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.110
It had to do, obviously, with
the fact that the main

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.200
character was also in his 20s,
in this state of confusion,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.770
trying to find his
way in the world.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.450
And also, Banks is a wonderful,
wonderful stylist

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.430
and writer of prose.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.660
So it also described Scotland,
which for me, at the time, was

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.880
kind of this strange, almost
science fictional landscape

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.030
that enhanced all the strange
things happening in the story.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.460
And it is about death.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.510
"The crow road" is actually
a Glaswegian

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.090
expression for death.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.320
To take the crow road
means to die.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.910
And there is a lot of
death in the book.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.540
But at its heart, it's tells you
that things are going to

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.500
be OK, and these difficult
things can be dealt with.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.970
And then a few months ago, I
happened to pick it up again.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.020
Motivated by the news of Iain
Banks' illness, I wanted to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.810
revisit some of his work.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.650
And I read it again.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.130
And what really, really struck
me was that what I read the

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.150
second time felt like a totally
different book, like a

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.660
completely different book.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.290
First of all, the simple aspect
was that, at that

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.870
point, I'd been living in
Scotland for quite a while.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.390
So all the sort of evocative
imagery that Banks has about

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.730
ruined castles, and clouds over
Highland Islands, and

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.330
sunsets, and things like that, I
could really visualize them.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.230
I could smell the heather and
really be there much more

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.700
powerfully than I could
have been before.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.670
And I also finally got all the
sex jokes, because there's

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.880
quite a few of them in there.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.620
And also the philosophy and
attitude of growth felt

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.640
totally different.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.420
So it was a very powerful
experience to read it again.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.150
But what it made me really think
about was that, where

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.830
was the book?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.066
What was the book?

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:32.810
I've always thought of books
as these containers,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.880
permanent, eternal containers,
for the

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.140
thoughts of the author.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.630
And then I guess, as a writer,
there's a little bit of wish

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.440
fulfillment for some sort of
authorial immortality.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.090
At least, even if I'm mortal,
some of my ideas will survive.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.260
But actually, if my "Crow Road"
15 years ago was totally

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.530
different from my "Crow Road" of
today, where was the book?

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.210
It felt like some sort of
quantum mechanical,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.750
observer-dependent thing,
where depending on how I

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.240
measure my quantum object,
it collapses

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.270
into a different state.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.020
And then that really begged the

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.200
question of what are books?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.380
Where do they come from?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.970
And what is our relationship
with them?

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.630
And what is bookness?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.650
And I think it's a
very important

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.580
question to ask today.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.400
Because we are in this area
where books are becoming even

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.340
more ephemeral, quite literally
intangible, turning

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.520
into bits, something you
guys are extremely

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.090
well familiar with.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.470
So there is this process of
dematerialization happening

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.360
with books.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.110
So what can we do with
books in their

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.300
future intangible state?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.450
Are they going to disappear?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.490
Or are they going to become

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.090
something completely different?

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.640
So I started looking into what
people were saying about the

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.900
future of books.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.760
And obviously, a lot of people
have been thinking about this.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.470
And there's a lot of research
going on on

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.300
the future of books.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.450
And one of the more interesting
things I've found

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:25.000
was a scenario forecasting
exercise by the design company

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.550
IDEA, which we've had some
interactions with at

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.400
Singularity University.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.260
And I'm sure you're familiar
with them.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.960
And they came up with three
quite interesting scenarios

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.890
named after different literary
inspirations.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.169
So the first scenario they
came up with was called

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.680
Coupland, after Douglas
Coupland, author of

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.740
"Generation X" and "Microserfs."
And anyone who's

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.340
not familiar with "Microserfs--"
required

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.820
reading for anybody who wants to
get involved in a startup.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.550
And the Coupland scenario is
based on the idea that books

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.010
are going to become more social,
and publishing is

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.690
going to become more social.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.750
It's all going to be about who
reads what in our social

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.180
network, what sort of
recommendations are made based

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.090
on that, discussion around
books, and even things like,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.180
as part of the scenario, if a
sufficient number of people in

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.540
your social network buys a
certain book, you will

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.090
automatically get access
to it as well.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.060
So even the business models
around books in this scenario

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.530
are going to be very
socially driven.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.720
The second scenario, which they
call Nelson, after Ted

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.800
Nelson, the pioneer of
hypertext, is based on the

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.700
idea that it's all about
annotation and being able to

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.280
refer back to who is actually
talking about your book-- who

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.530
is quoting it?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.788
What are the sources
of the book?

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:56.900
Can you verify them?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.600
Can you generate more discussion
around them?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.240
So it's about annotation and
bi-directional links--

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.110
so turning books into very
different kinds of objects.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.050
And finally, which is maybe
the most obvious one, or

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.100
natural one, considering the
growth of computer games--

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.000
Alice.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.660
Turning books into more game
like-- so Choose Your Own

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.740
Adventure-style--

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.480
things, or with more media rich
content, and essentially

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.350
merging them with
computer games.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.070
Obviously, these are not
the only possibilities.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.090
There are others like Nick
Montfort and Neil Gaiman, who

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.950
recently created exercises where
book-like things are

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.130
authored collaboratively using
wiki-style systems.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.060
So you can see that people are
thinking about how the role of

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.200
the reader, the author, the
publishing industry, how that

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.850
is going to change
with technology.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.400
But the more I read about
these things, the more

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.700
unsatisfying I found them.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.760
There was something missing
about all these scenarios.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.330
And it took me quite a while
until I could really put my

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.360
finger on it.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.070
But what I started to feel was
that really the core thing

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.440
about my engagement with "The
Crow Road" and any other book

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.350
I read what was the deep
immersion, allowing yourself

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.230
to be led into this waking
dream where you spend a

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.150
certain period of time.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.630
And maybe that dream is
different at different times

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.380
when you read the book.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.810
But there is this real sense of
letting go of yourself and

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.470
sinking into the book into
a dreamlike state.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:50.630
And so of course, that's
something that neuroscientists

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.330
have studied.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:57.370
And in 2009, there was a very
interesting study by Nicole

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.520
Speer, at University of
Washington, where they

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.660
actually looked at a lot of
people reading in an FMRI

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.410
machine and tried to understand
what was going on

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.830
in their brains as they
were reading.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.690
And what they found was that
reading really is not a

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.285
passive thing at all.

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:18.740
It's not just consuming and
taking in information.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.940
It's actually virtually enacting
the situations that

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.820
you read about.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.910
So when you read about a certain
action, the same parts

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.320
of your brain that would
actually activate in real life

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.920
if you were to carry out that
action become engaged.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.400
There's this mental simulation
of virtual reality that we

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.030
construct after reading
a book.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.760
And obviously, those simulations
are shaped by our

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.960
own experience, as well.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.070
But it's a very, very
deep engagement.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.360
And it probably has to do with
the fact that in order to

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.770
read, we've re-purposed some
very fundamental pattern,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:00.990
symbol, recognition machinery
in our brains that really go

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.250
to very primal layers.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.200
So actually, what books are,
from that point of view,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.540
they're information brain
interface technologies.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.550
You could almost call
them brain computer

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.530
interfaces in some way.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.060
So then can we to look at books
from that point of view,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.895
and what can we learn?

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:33.560
To take a step back briefly,
books haven't

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.890
always been this powerful.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.030
And I'm trying to get to my next
slide, which would show

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.280
an example of that.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.370
There we go.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.760
So actually books, in their
current form are a relatively

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.960
recent thing.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.500
Reading silently is a relatively
new thing.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.125
Reading used to mean
reading aloud.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.020
This is an example of medieval
script called scriptura

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.490
continua, where there
are no word spaces.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.220
And so in order to distinguish
the different words and to

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.780
make sense of the text, you
would actually have to have to

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.000
read it aloud very slowly
and carefully.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.740
So it was very difficult to get
this immersion the state

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.810
happening that I was talking
about earlier.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.660
And it was only with technology,
with the printing

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.500
press and typography and also
more software-like technology

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.120
like grammar and spelling
conventions and things like

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.210
that that we actually managed
to refine books in to their

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.700
current form.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.260
And I don't think it's a
coincidence that the novel,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.150
which is the current highest
form of fiction, if you like,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.190
or regarded as such, came around
around the same time as

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.650
the printing press decided
to become popular.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.130
So from this point
of view, what

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.290
could we do to go further?

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.830
So what would be the next step
beyond what we have now if we

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.440
start using technologies which
are more powerful than just

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.760
typography.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.420
Well, I think one part of the
answer is something you guys

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.770
at Google know a lot about,
which is gathering information

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.920
about the reader.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:24.830
So in Soviet Russia,
the book reads you.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.750
[LAUGHING]

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.420
HANNU RAJANIEMI: And again, I
don't have to tell you about

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.110
all the technologies we now
have to gather information

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.390
about how we interact with
a piece of content.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:42.480
So I'm sure you know all about
my online reading behavior.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.370
But now we also have devices
like this one.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:51.470
So it's an Emotiv EEG headset,
a simple commercial device

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.180
that allows a user's brain
activity to be--

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.160
relatively low fidelity, but
still allows it to be recorded

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.990
wirelessly while they're doing
something, whatever that is.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.660
And in case you follow these
things, Emotiv just a few days

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.200
ago announced a next generation,
much shinier,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.140
cyberpunkish, stylish version
of this device.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.610
So that's possible.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.300
Samsung, I believe, is already
experimenting with a

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.060
thought-controlled tablet.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.810
Another thing which is
relatively easy to do today is

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.010
eye tracking, looking at where a
users eyes move on the page.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.010
That's also a technology that's
going to be probably

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.180
integrate into tablets and
mobile phones pretty soon.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.940
I'm sure you can neither confirm
nor deny anything

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.180
about future incarnations of
Google Glass, but it's not

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.760
beyond the boundaries of
imagination to assume that

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.720
some form of either eye tracking
or brain interfaces

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.740
or things like that could
feature there as well.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.425
And given that, now,
increasingly, the devices that

00:17:03.425 --> 00:17:06.140
have this power to gather this
information are the same

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.839
devices we use to read.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.190
Then future books will
literally have the

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.180
power to read us.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.900
So what would those
books be like?

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.119
What could we do with
this power?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.400
From the point of view of a
writer, the interesting

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.859
question is always, if you have
a new technology, what

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.960
stories can you tell with it?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.240
And it's maybe a bit too early
to say what's possible, but

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.960
there are few interesting
examples of

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.870
things in this direction.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.740
So the BBC has been
experimenting with something

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.410
called perceptive media.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.850
A friend of mine there, Ian
Forrester, at BBC R&amp;D,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.380
produced a radio play called
"Breaking Out," which adapts

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.480
the story a little bit based
on what information the app

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.740
can gather about the user.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.750
It's very simple things.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.450
There are a few locations and
pubs and places like that are

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.860
mentioned in the story.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:10.650
And those are customized for
each user given what

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.940
information can be gathered
about their

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.710
location and interests.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.410
So just in order to deliver a
more powerful emotional punch

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.630
and a closer connection
to the story.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.250
Now, of course, you could be
much more ambitious than that.

00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:34.750
If we stay on the subject of
actual books rather than other

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.100
types of content, could we
imagine a book that rewrites

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.700
itself for every reader, or
perhaps for every reading.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.590
And a good science fictional
example of that, of course, is

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:52.240
A Young Lady's Illustrated
Primer, this personalized

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.240
teaching device featured in Neal
Stephenson's "The Diamond

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.870
Age."

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.560
And in fact, there is a spin-out
project from the One

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.480
Laptop Per Child project called
Nell, named after the

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.430
protagonist of "The Diamond
Age," which is trying to do

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.740
exactly that.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.350
So they are trying to create a
system that can engage with a

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.090
learning child by generating
these personalized,

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.830
tailor-made fairy tales, where
the reader is the protagonist.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.190
So that's quite interesting.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.840
It's early days for that sort
of thing, but it's probably

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.020
going to happen sooner
or later.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:43.060
So on a personal note,
my friend Sam, Sam

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.860
[? Halliday ?], also a
recovering mathematician and a

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.020
data scientist.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.220
We wanted to do a little
prototype of what we could

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.900
imagine, or a very simple toy
model of what we could

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.440
imagine, a future
book to be like.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.370
So this year we create a project
called Neurofiction,

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.030
which you can have a look at
online, which is essentially a

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.230
story you read on a computer
screen while wearing one of

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.640
these devices.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.500
And the story changes
in response

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.590
to your brain activity.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.180
So the idea was to not really
make it a Choose Your Own

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.600
Adventure story, but to retain
this kind of linear, immersive

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.910
experience and just give the
user the same kind of

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.240
experience that they have with
traditional fiction, but

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.180
underneath have the software and
the interaction of their

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.690
brains with the text
drive the story.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.940
So the current story is called
"Snow White Is Dead." It's a

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.660
retelling of the fairytale
I'm sure you all know.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.910
And the way it works is that in
the beginning of the story,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.990
we expose the user to some
verbal imagery associated to

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.840
first, life, and then death.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.020
And then for each subsequent
scene, we measure their

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.250
response to those scenes.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.410
So are they closer
to life or death.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:14.640
And that takes them down, I
think, 48 possible different

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.600
parts, with two very
different endings.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.540
And we ran this recently at
the Edinburgh Science

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.050
Festival, and we got a lot of
very, very positive feedback.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.260
So obviously this was a very
primitive experiment.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.750
But it seems possible to create
narratives that really

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:38.930
do, on some level, directly
engage with the user's brain.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.540
And we've actually open-sourced
all the

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.520
code that we wrote.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.310
So if you have an Emotiv device,
or hopefully we'll

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.410
update it for the new Emotiv
device, you can download it

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.760
and play with it and try
to create your own

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.220
neurofiction as well.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.900
So just to conclude,
obviously it's hard

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.140
to predict the future.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.566
So none of these technological
innovations I've mentioned

00:22:08.566 --> 00:22:12.020
might survive for very long,
or might be replaced by

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.030
something we can't
yet imagine.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.390
But I do believe that a book
itself, and fiction, are quite

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.170
robust against change.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.700
And there's a lot of them that
we love that I think is worth

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.200
preserving.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.690
But I do very much like the
idea of a book that is not

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.100
just a receptacle for the
thoughts of the author, but

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.900
also preserves the experience of
the reader in some way, so

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.050
that through devices like
the Emotiv or its future

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.170
incarnations, we get some sort
of emotional marginalia

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.480
preserved between the
pages of the book.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.230
So sort of like this quote
from Argentinian writer

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.630
Alberto Manguel, which
is underlined here.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.470
"Implicit in the possession of
a book is the history of a

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.980
book's previous readings.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.670
Every new reader is affected by
what he or she imagines the

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.130
book to have been in
previous hands."

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.450
So with a little bit of
technology, we could make that

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.820
literally true.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.840
And so future books could retain
echoes of the people we

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.460
used to be when we
first read them.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.680
I mentioned that neuroscience
has shown that when we read,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.970
we actually become the book.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.390
But perhaps, given a bit
of time, future books

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.720
could become us.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.026
Thank you.

00:23:40.026 --> 00:23:48.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.420
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
this notion of yours about

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.820
becoming the thing that
you're reading.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.090
I understand I think
a little bit of the

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.050
neuroscience behind it.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.750
But what do I become when I'm
reading about matrix algebra?

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.880
HANNU RAJANIEMI: [CHUCKLES]

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.570
AUDIENCE: You see
what I'm saying?

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.710
There's a whole category
of books I don't

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.500
know what that means.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.610
HANNU RAJANIEMI: No.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.740
No, I completely agree.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.270
Of course, I am mainly talking
about fiction here.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:18.195
And I think fiction has
something of a unique ability

00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:22.290
to get us to identify with other
people and get us to

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.530
feel what it's like
to be them.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.200
No, there are obviously
categories of--

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.740
some non-fictional books with
a narrative structure can do

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.840
that as well.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.350
But you're right-- an
engagement, if it's something

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.320
like mathematics, is completely
different.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:46.530
I guess there, also, the
slowness and destruction-free

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.830
nature of the experience is
quite important though--

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.310
so to have something that helps
you engage with it.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:56.150
And I think even there, some
sort of technology that would

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.400
monitor your state of
concentration could actually

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.490
be quite helpful.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.920
AUDIENCE: My question is, with
this, isn't this going to be

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.630
putting a huger burden on the
author to be able to be

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.160
creating multiple paths
of his story?

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.920
And how much does it then start
becoming, maybe, author

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.490
by committee?

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.510
Because you've got to have
multiple people in there to do

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.610
all the different options.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.370
HANNU RAJANIEMI: No, that's an
extremely good questions.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.160
So for example, working on
this Snow White story I

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.750
mentioned, initially the idea
was to have it a lot more like

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.080
Choose Your Own Adventure
stories.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.250
But what I actually started to
feel was that I actually had a

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.270
slight problem with multiple
branching narratives.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:48.000
Because the thing about good
fiction is that the ending of

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.970
the story is very important.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.830
And that ending has to be
somehow both surprising and

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.610
inevitable.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:02.150
And that inevitability has to
arise from the character and

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.040
all the interactions with
the characters.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.030
So if you want to write
stories with radically

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.320
different, multiple endings, the
characters themselves have

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.260
to be quite different.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.380
And so you do get this huge
cognitive burden dealing with

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.620
that and some sort of
combinatorial explosion.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.100
So I'm not necessarily saying
that you always have to have

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.350
multiple branching narratives.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:31.140
And it's interesting what the
BBC guys, for example, have

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.370
set as their goal for perceptive
media, which is not

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.850
necessarily have multiple
conclusions or endings, but

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.640
just along the way put slightly
different emphasis on

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.070
different things, depending on
what the sort of measured

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.770
preferences or whatever
we know about the

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.100
viewer or reader is.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.960
So I think that approach might
actually be a bit more

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.310
scalable and still allow some
degree of authorial control,

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.620
which of course, writers
guard very jealously.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.340
So yeah, a very good question.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.280
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering how will
you be able to discuss a

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.390
book, like, say, come up
to somebody and say,

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.180
hey, I read this book.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.360
And they read a totally
different thing.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.220
Or if you want to write
a report on it.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.380
So I think any sort
of discussion

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.200
will be really confused.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.720
What's your opinion on that?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.290
HANNU RAJANIEMI: But that might
also make it a lot more

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.540
interesting.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.810
Even now with books, I think
people discover different

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.220
things than other readers.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.800
It really depends
on how radically

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.860
you allow it to change.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.420
If it's all generated by an
artificial intelligence based

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.870
on some measurements that it
makes in the reader's brain,

00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:59.360
then you right.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.450
It could be completely
different.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.080
But I don't know.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.340
That should lead to richer and
more interesting discussions.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.750
And of course, the two
individuals in question might

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.150
have the ability to compare
their respective versions and

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.280
see where they diverge.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.450
AUDIENCE: A lot of these issues
are being dealt with

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.780
right now in video games,
constructing these branching

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.040
narratives where you can maybe
even choose the gender of your

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.700
character from the beginning
of the story, and that has

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.480
ramifications throughout the
rest of the long arc of the

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.240
video game, or maybe even
over multiple games.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.140
Especially also when you talk
about things like MMOs, and

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.610
you have multiple different
people interacting, but you're

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.010
also trying to construct a
narrative in that space that's

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.400
shared amongst all
those people.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.950
So it's not really a question,
but just do you have any

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.030
insights into that space or how
this interacts with what

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.010
you were talking about?

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.500
HANNU RAJANIEMI: No, it's
very, very related.

00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:56.850
Mu third novel, "The Causal
Angel," actually deals quite a

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.210
bit with games.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:03.990
And so in order to do research
for it, I actually bought an

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.630
Xbox and played "Batman: Arkham
City" quite a bit.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.630
[LAUGHS]

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.970
But it's absolutely fascinating
what people are

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.590
doing in the context of computer
games and branching

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.690
storytelling and role
playing and so on.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.480
But I haven't yet quite
found a way--

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:28.180
or I don't know of a computer
game where the narrative

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.020
experience and identification
with a character is as deep as

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.920
it is in fiction.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.870
And I wonder, at least using
the current generation of

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.720
computer games, if
it can ever be.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.840
In the area of games, the domain
where I personally had

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.540
such experience in the gaming
context has been in tabletop

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.260
and live role playing
games with very

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.850
strong narrative elements.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.630
So I'm not saying the
convergence of these the two

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.560
things is impossible.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.410
But for the purposes of this
discussion, I was really

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.980
focusing on more how could we
enhance this experience of

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.480
sitting down and
reading a book.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.400
But again, very, very
good point.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.930
AUDIENCE: I was curious if you
tried using any of the Emotive

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.220
technology while you were trying
to write any of these

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.510
stories as well.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.330
So I wonder if eventually you'd
start having a profile

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.080
between the author and the
readers so that you can start

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.530
suggesting things based off
of someone with a similar

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.260
pattern, or if you had done
anything with that already.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.180
HANNU RAJANIEMI:
We did actually

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.970
think about that idea.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.530
Although, with the current
technology, the limitations

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.920
are pretty serious.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.610
But yeah, we did have this idea
actually with a robotics

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.810
researcher in Edinburgh
University that maybe we could

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.400
have an underlying-- a
generative model of text.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.150
You guys have huge, huge engrams
and things like that

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.760
that we could use to generate
text, and then measure the

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.850
brain response of the
author in this case.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.690
For example, there's a very
nice signal in the brain

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:12.340
called P300, which activates
when you see something that

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.270
really interests you or
you find surprising.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:19.330
So you could actually maybe
use this signal to train a

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.320
genetic algorithm to generate
text that you somehow like or

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.230
find interesting.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.890
But I think you'd have to put
quite a lot of thought into

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.980
how to constrain that to
make it interesting.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.930
There's a startup in Chile,
which is using a very similar

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.570
technique to allow
schoolchildren to create 3D

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.280
models of monsters.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.690
So they're evolving 3D models
of monsters and steering the

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.500
utility function of the
algorithm based on what they

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.340
measure in the brain.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.850
But the current generation,
we realize, is very noisy.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.330
So I think it's effectively
random.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.870
But yeah, very interesting
idea.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.400
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if you had
any ideas instead of maybe

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.960
a book being more pleasurable to
someone or finding out what

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.870
somebody prefers, maybe writing
a book that really

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.570
antagonizes someone, or
pushes them out of

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.665
their comfort zone.

00:32:10.665 --> 00:32:13.460
HANNU RAJANIEMI: Yeah, no, that
was actually what we were

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.030
aiming for with the
Snow White story.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.090
So it wasn't really necessarily
about their

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.690
comfort zone.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.990
We actually tried to take them
in directions that they

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.980
wouldn't expect.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.350
So I guess that then it really
becomes like fiction already

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.910
is to a large extent.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.260
Actually, a wonderful example of
that is Iain Banks's first

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.270
novel, "The Wasp Factory," which
is a fantastic fictional

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:40.290
experience, but very, very,
very unpleasant.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.560
So, yeah, absolutely, you could
equally well use these

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.390
kinds of techniques for
engineering a certain

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.500
emotional trajectory or path
that you want to take the

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.100
reader through.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.925
And there, it becomes almost
like a control problem.

00:32:55.925 --> 00:32:58.370
And there, there is an element
of authorial design.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:03.250
So if you feel that the user
is straying away from this

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.740
path that you've designed, you
try to the push them with new

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.590
content back on track
with that.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.040
AUDIENCE: Is there a way that
you've thought to engage the

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.580
reader in some analysis of
the book after the fact?

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.040
So in regular books, we have
discussion questions, perhaps,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.180
at the end.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.280
But is there some new thoughts
of engaging the reader in

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.780
literary analysis along the
way, or at the end?

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.700
HANNU RAJANIEMI: So I confess,
I'm quite ignorant of the

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.410
practice and techniques
of literary criticism.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.340
But one idea we had, which we
partially implemented, but

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.700
it's not really in the current
version, was to actually give

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:58.200
the user a heat map of the story
based on the regions

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.740
depending on which direction
their reaction had swung in

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.580
different parts.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.990
So to highlight to them
what parts had

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.050
been the most engaging.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:12.080
I actually did a little bit of
experimentation with Sam on

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.850
this just by reading a large
variety of fiction and looking

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.560
at things which engaged us.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.060
They were quite different for
me and Sam, and obviously

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.310
different types of engagement.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:30.030
A lot of very rich stylists
actually, we found, created an

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:35.909
awful lot of activity in the
back electrodes of the device,

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.360
which is associated with
the visual region.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.010
So clearly we were getting
a lot of visual images.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.940
But I'm sure there could be a
much richer engagement between

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.270
the neural experience--

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.320
and actually, for me as an
author, it would be really

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.409
interesting to see what sort
of sections of the text and

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.410
style provoke the actions
of the readers.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.610
Thank yoiu.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:06.282
