ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.150
Well, good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.691
Thank you all so
much for coming out.

00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:07.260
My name is Artur Oliveira.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.170
I'm on the Talks at Google team.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.820
And I'm very excited today to
welcome Nick Balla and Cortney

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.720
Burns to a Zagat
Guest Chef series.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.880
Nick and Cortney are
the co-executive chefs

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.370
of Bar Tartine in San
Francisco's Mission District.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.360
Now, Tartine is a very
celebrated restaurant

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.650
in the city, because
it uses a menu that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.980
is really hard to classify.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.460
But as these guys like to
say, it is easy to describe.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.300
So there's lots of very
interesting influences--

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.350
Eastern European, Japanese,
lots of other different parts

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.910
of the world.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.470
So if you could
all please help me

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.096
welcome Nick and Cortney for
our Guest Chef series today.

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:51.760
NICK BALLA: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.130
CORTNEY BURNS: Thank you.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.410
NICK BALLA: So we're here today.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.215
We just finished a cookbook, so
we're kind of celebrating that.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.150
There's a lot of
different stuff in there.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.420
Kind of the main
point of that and what

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.730
we do at the restaurant is
based on how we make things.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.740
So we process most
of the stuff in house

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
at the restaurant, all
the way from the dairy

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.590
program to cured meats, drying
of things like fruit or paprika

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.120
powder.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.805
Really, we try to make
whatever we can in

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:26.554
house for use for our recipes.

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.470
So the first, like, huge
chunk of the cookbook

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.494
is based on how to make
some of the things.

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:32.410
By all means, you don't
have to, but it's just

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.832
kind of a fun possibility.

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:37.790
We were thinking about
what to make here today,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.206
and we were thinking, do we
go, like, fancy and try to do,

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:41.814
like, tweezer food, or--

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.980
CORTNEY BURNS: Which we
don't really know how to do.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.920
NICK BALLA: Right.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.680
So that was a bad idea.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.680
Instead, we're doing a
couple of the things that

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.420
are our favorite things to
eat-- all-time favorite things

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.010
to eat.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.230
There's a salad that we're
making with sweet potato

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.990
and avocado, pickled
green walnuts,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.190
which we process in large
batches every spring when

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.780
the walnuts are under-ripe.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
We'll do 90, 120 liters
of those every spring.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.140
Hopefully, it'll
last the whole year.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.120
That salad's kind
of based on one

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.710
of Cortney's favorite
snacks, which

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.567
was-- what was it originally?

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:21.150
CORTNEY BURNS: It's like yogurt
and sweet potato with avocado,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.750
really kind of like a
refrigerator mishmash.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.170
A lot of times, our food
is inspired that way,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.701
where we're making
something that we really

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.950
are craving in the moment
and fulfilling that craving.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.590
We eat what we feel like eating.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.440
And then figure out if it
works and if it's delicious,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.360
which [INAUDIBLE] we're
gonna go 50-50 on that one.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.520
How we can transition it into
working in the restaurant.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.277
How can we serve it
to you guys so you

00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:47.360
feel like you're getting
a restaurant dish and not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.693
something that I pulled out
of the refrigerator at home.

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:52.722
So this dish was
actually the followup

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:53.680
of something like that.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140
And we were writing
the book, where

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.450
we spent more time at home
than we normally ever do,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.680
just because we could actually
focus on the book a little bit.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.290
We would kind of
split our days up

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.390
and write, which was a
very interesting process.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.450
So this came together one
day while writing the book,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.150
actually.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.080
And had lunch, told Nick, I
had this great lunch today.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.582
And then we kind of
turned into this salad.

00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:18.540
It definitely was not
this salad to begin with,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.460
but it was the kind of inspiring
moment to create the salad.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.500
And that's how a lot of our food
is created, either from flavor

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.750
memories or foods
that we've just

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.500
eaten that we want to
recreate or kind of evolve.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.082
So that's how that
one came about.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:36.707
NICK BALLA: We ended
up adding-- she'll

00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:37.730
go over the ingredients more.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.610
CORTNEY BURNS: Once we-- yeah.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.401
NICK BALLA: Yeah, as
we're getting into it.

00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:43.130
But homemade feta cheese
and then those green walnuts

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.070
and mung bean sprouts, which
we sprout at the restaurant.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.910
It's really fun.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.340
This mess here is kapustnica, is
what the Slovak word for it is.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.260
It's always been my
personal favorite thing

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.690
to eat at home for,
like, many years.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.910
My dad always made this
when I was growing up.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.090
He lived in central Europe
but learned it there.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.660
So in Slovakia, they
make it for Christmas.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.590
But they also make it
all year, and there

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.256
are thousands of
different possible ways

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:18.230
to do it, based on what's
available, where you live,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.899
what you like.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.300
So you can really kind of
evolve it to your taste.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.840
But the point of it
is kind of agrodolce.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.290
And it's always got
spice, sour, sweet,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.840
acidity-- so that kind of
notion of just a lot of flavor.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.060
And it's a really satisfying and
simple thing to make at home.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.560
Always has a base of sauerkraut.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.060
Usually has some
type of cured meat.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.010
Often, at Christmastime,
they don't actually

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.184
serve actual meat protein.

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:49.600
It'll just be,
like, a meat stock.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.040
But usually dried
fruit, which brings

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.870
out-- dried and fresh fruit,
which gives it sweetness.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.970
Mushrooms, earth.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.070
And then we like
peppers and tomatoes

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.289
and all different kinds
of things in here.

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.080
We're going to start
making this one first,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.600
because it takes a little
while to simmer everything.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.850
The recipe that we have in
the cookbook-- and it says,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.206
we encourage people to
use things that you like

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:15.080
and what's available.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.830
So there's a recipe
for it, but we also

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.240
encourage people to think
outside the box and just

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.780
kind of use things
that they like.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.380
You can also do things in
stages and kind of time

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.714
it out, so that the
potatoes cook just right.

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:31.380
Or you can dump it
all in the pot, which

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.070
is always the way
we do it at home.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.660
And it turns out just great.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.350
So let's get started.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.900
CORTNEY BURNS: This soup is
really-- first of all, again,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.380
back to our house refrigerator,
when Nick takes a day off,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.880
this is usually what I'll find
next day, which is usually

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.080
the day I take off in the
refrigerator afterwards.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.620
It's definitely the
comfort food of our house,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.080
as a result of it being
Nick's favorite food.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.620
He can eat this whole pot,
pretty much, of this soup.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.550
But we dump everything in here.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.590
But when we make it
at the restaurant,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.070
we'll often, like Nick was
saying, do it in stages.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.820
And what that does--
and a lot of the food

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.000
that we cook at the
restaurant is really

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.170
based on layering
lots of flavors.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.820
So sometimes we'll put
certain pork products in first

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.300
to pull out the fat and then
start adding and blooming

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.870
spices.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.630
But like he said, it's just
as delicious like this.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.630
One of the things in the
cookbook that we really

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.430
encourage people to do is play.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.210
And we want people to cook the
food that we have in the book.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.730
So if we were to give
you 15 steps on a soup,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.240
that can turn out
just as delicious

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.760
by tossing it all into one bowl.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.780
We encourage you to
just kind of go for it.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.030
NICK BALLA: So we put in bacon,
potatoes, and the dried sausage

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.250
first.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.110
So it's kind of like
a dried-- in Hungary,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.830
we made versions of this.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.930
Also, my dad lived there
and we're Hungarian.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.774
It's this goulash sauce.

00:06:53.774 --> 00:06:56.190
It's just like a cold, smoked,
really dry-- but like dried

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.779
Spanish chorizos is perfect.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.070
That's what this is, basically.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.214
It has a real distinct aroma,
that dried paprika sausage.

00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:09.130
CORTNEY BURNS: A lot of
cookbooks and recipes,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.390
if that's something that
you read and follow a lot,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.980
you'll see people rendering
bacon down to pull the fat out.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.337
That is one way to work with
bacon or cured pork products.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:19.920
Just by way of putting
it in this way,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.584
we're creating heat, which
will pull out some of that fat.

00:07:23.584 --> 00:07:25.000
But what we're
doing is we're kind

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.840
of making more of a luscious
pork belly out of it.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.475
So instead of kind of crispy
and extracting everything,

00:07:30.475 --> 00:07:31.850
we're going to
leave it in there.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.920
It will seize a little bit
just because of the heat,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.400
but it also allows us just to
kind of leave the bacon nice

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.340
and tender.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.980
Different mouth feel.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.280
We going for it on all this?

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.071
NICK BALLA: Get it.

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:43.220
CORTNEY BURNS: Great.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.522
We like to use sweet onions.

00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:45.980
You'll notice in
the grocery store,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.646
sometimes you can
just buy white onions,

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:49.640
or you can buy kind of
yellow, sweet onions.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.300
I'm making a mess over here.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.230
We encourage the sweet
onions, because they

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.000
don't have as sharp of an
aroma and they work really

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.920
well in soups and stews.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.930
And then raw as well.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.540
We eat a lot of raw
onion in our world.

00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:07.600
NICK BALLA: We're
making a lot of soup.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.391
CORTNEY BURNS: We are
making a lot of soup.

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:13.140
NICK BALLA: We always overcook.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.723
CORTNEY BURNS: It's
kind of a problem.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.380
So you guys have to stay
here until it's gone today,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.322
so hopefully there's no pressing
projects at the desk side.

00:08:27.322 --> 00:08:29.530
And while we're talking, if
anyone has any questions,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.346
feel free, like, to
ask, be interactive.

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.870
You don't have to
be shy with us.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.880
You can help us to
attempt to entertain you

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.600
by entertaining us.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.781
So all of that is encouraged.

00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:42.281
AUDIENCE: What did
you just dump in?

00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:43.697
CORTNEY BURNS:
There is sauerkraut

00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:46.280
that we just dumped in, with
some of the brine left on it.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.321
And the sauerkraut that
we make at the restaurant

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.440
is just cabbage,
salt, and that's it.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.840
So we shave the cabbage,
which opens up the cell walls,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.534
and that allows us
to just dry salt it.

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:57.950
So there's a couple
different ways

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.540
that you can brine
ferment vegetables.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.880
There's many different ways.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.620
Two of the ones
that we use a lot.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.240
These are apples, by the
way, that are going in.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.490
We dry salt, and we
also brine ferment.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.420
So by dry salting
it-- sorry, I don't

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.980
have a radar on
this thing-- --we

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.290
can extract the liquid
from the vegetables

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.370
by opening up all those
cell walls for really

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.250
juicy, watery vegetables.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.910
Things like whole
beets or other things

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.110
like that, which are
larger, that we ferment,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.100
we then make a salt
brine and pour over it.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.150
So this one has been dry-salted.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.300
So nothing except for
cabbage, salt on that one.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.260
And time, not with an H,
but just like actual time.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.940
This stock is just such
a blonde chicken stock.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.960
So unroasted bones.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.070
Just gently simmered
with whatever vegetables

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.920
we had left over
at the restaurant.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.820
I don't know if we're
going to fit in here.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.695
It's getting serious.

00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:56.810
NICK BALLA: We got it.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.894
We got it.

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:00.394
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
help but notice

00:10:00.394 --> 00:10:02.626
when you were
cutting up the bacon,

00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:06.110
you kind of scraped the knife a
little bit on the cutting board

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.470
as you moved it aside.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.020
So you know, prep
techniques, I've

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.430
heard some people say
that, like, it's really bad

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.450
to kind of do that
and it's bad practice.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.250
But that's kind of
what I'm used to doing.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.960
What do you guys think on that?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.460
CORTNEY BURNS: Well,
I don't usually

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.220
scrape it directly
against the wood.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.260
A lot of times, I'll
just move things with it,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.580
but, I mean, you can
always sharpen your knife.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.160
It's like, it's
there to be used.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.336
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't
make you a bad chef?

00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:35.460
CORTNEY BURNS: You tell me.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.950
I mean, I have no idea.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.861
If you think so, then we're
totally-- we're all good.

00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.360
No, no.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.330
I don't think it does.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.910
There's so many
schools of thought

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.830
on how to use your knives and
how to work with your tools.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.080
By all means, like, we should
treat them with respect,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.850
but they are tools
at the same time.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.880
I mean, hammers are
meant to be used.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.110
Knives are meant to be used.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.875
And so, if I have a knife that's
so delicate that I can't rub it

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:56.500
across the board,
it's probably not one

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.080
that I should be
using for that task.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.930
So we pick and
choose our knives,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.914
depending on what
we're doing with them.

00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:03.830
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Relieved
to hear you say that.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.439
NICK BALLA: There are no rules.

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:06.272
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:11:06.272 --> 00:11:07.840
And if someone kicks you
out of their kitchen,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.260
you just go back to your own.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.550
It's more fun there anyways.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.520
But I mean,
definitely, there are

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.100
kind of the right
tool for the job.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.570
And there are
certain knives that

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.910
are not to be used for
opening, like, plastic bags

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.570
and things like that,
really, any of them.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.560
Nick won't trust
you on that one.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.560
He likes to use my knives
for things like that.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.379
NICK BALLA: Yup.

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:30.920
CORTNEY BURNS: So we're going
to put a hefty amount of garlic

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.470
in here, because we
really like garlic

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.240
and we support the
use of lots of allium.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.462
So just prepare yourselves.

00:11:41.462 --> 00:11:43.420
I think that's probably good.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.710
Think I should just go for it?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.085
NICK BALLA: Anybody have any
important face-to-face stuff

00:11:47.085 --> 00:11:49.002
today?

00:11:49.002 --> 00:11:50.127
CORTNEY BURNS: What's that?

00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:51.462
AUDIENCE: Mine got cancelled.

00:11:51.462 --> 00:11:52.420
CORTNEY BURNS: Perfect.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.996
NICK BALLA: Lucky for them.

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:57.820
AUDIENCE: Will this end
up being more like a stew?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.600
CORTNEY BURNS: A stew
insomuch that we're

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.680
putting so much into it,
but all of these things

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.126
will also let off a lot
of their own juices.

00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:06.500
So even though
we're not starting

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.194
with a huge amount
of broth-- like,

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.860
the mushrooms are
going to release juice

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.070
and will create a stock
kind of all on their own.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.500
So once it's all together,
it will be a brothy dish,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.730
but it will have a fair amount
of vegetable in there as well.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.550
Do you want to go for the rest?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.630
NICK BALLA: So finally, we'll
put in some spice stuff.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.980
We usually process most
of our spices in house.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.270
These are bay leaf that
we dry at the restaurant.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.780
Toasted caraway.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.510
Finally, we're going to
put some paprika, one

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.050
of the most important
ingredients in our larder.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.307
We got this paprika
from-- it's really

00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:43.890
important in central
European cooking.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.164
We spent years looking for--
following the vein of, like,

00:12:48.164 --> 00:12:49.830
wanting to process
everything ourselves,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.490
we were looking for
a pepper that we

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.020
could grow in California that
would produce a paprika that

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.980
was of the quality of
the European paprikas.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.900
Because we hadn't tried
anything in the United States

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.260
or in this hemisphere that
had been of that quality.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:09.310
So one year, we planted, like,
40 different types of paprika

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.279
at one of our [? ascribed ?]
winery in Sonoma.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:13.070
CORTNEY BURNS: Originally
in our apartment.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.445
NICK BALLA: Yeah,
we started them

00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:16.770
in our apartment in the
Mission at the time, yeah.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.290
And then finally ended up
finding one seed from a paprika

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.190
plant from Hungary, which we
spent a couple months, like,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.280
picking-- it was a
chili flake packet.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.130
So we ended up picking these
flakes out and planting them.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.517
Over about a few years, we
had a couple different farmers

00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:34.350
growing them for us.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.920
So now we're doing a couple
thousand kilos a year

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.427
for powder, for paste, drying,
just for using-- for lots

00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:41.260
of different things.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.560
We do a lot of chili paste.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.420
But super important ingredient.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.587
And it's great in this soup.

00:13:47.587 --> 00:13:49.795
CORTNEY BURNS: Is this what
makes them sweet and hot,

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:50.620
that you grabbed today?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.070
NICK BALLA: Yeah, it's
a little bit of heat.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.560
But the Serranos that we
put in here are also spicy.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.656
So tomatoes, we jarred
those this last mid-fall,

00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:03.280
when the tomatoes
were kind of peaking.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.210
And the peppers,
these are actually

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.220
from some farmer friends in
Fresno that are still doing,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.422
still finishing up with
tomatoes and peppers.

00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:14.630
CORTNEY BURNS: They had
green beans a couple of weeks

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.910
ago, too, in their last--

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.300
NICK BALLA: And they're just
harvesting cucumbers now,

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.674
which is so strange
in California

00:14:18.674 --> 00:14:19.710
how the seasons work.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.600
So this guy's going to
simmer for a while now.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.350
And I think we're just
going to let it go.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.604
And maybe we get into
making some salad, yeah?

00:14:28.604 --> 00:14:30.520
CORTNEY BURNS: Does
anyone have any questions,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.420
comments about the soup?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.570
Did anyone grow up eating
a sauerkraut soup or kind

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.540
of a sweet and sour
soup of this nature?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.040
No?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.630
NICK BALLA: This
is peasant food.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.440
It's the stuff we crave and
really want to be eating a lot.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.210
And it gets better.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.020
You make a huge pot like this,
it gets better in the fridge.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.460
Or it gets better
after several days

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.695
of just kind of sitting it.

00:14:50.695 --> 00:14:52.540
Everything breaks down and--

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.860
CORTNEY BURNS: --melds.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.901
NICK BALLA: This is a meal
with a chunk of bread.

00:14:55.901 --> 00:14:57.130
You don't need anything else.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.848
Beer.

00:14:57.848 --> 00:15:00.600
CORTNEY BURNS: It's
a meal for 100.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.500
I'm going to cover it a
little bit to get it rolling,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:09.000
so that we have some
soup to eat in a bit.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.490
AUDIENCE: How did Bar
Tartine come about,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.478
and where-- do you guys
still interact a lot

00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:15.882
with Tartine itself [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:17.632
CORTNEY BURNS: Do you
want to talk on that

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:18.507
or do you want me to?

00:15:18.507 --> 00:15:22.050
NICK BALLA: Bar Tartine
started in 2006 or 2005.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.162
CORTNEY BURNS: In 2005.

00:15:24.162 --> 00:15:24.870
NICK BALLA: Yeah.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.840
Chad Robertson and Liz Pruitt,
they owned Tartine Bakery.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.010
Basically, nothing was really
happening yet in the Mission.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.430
There was a lot of
real estate available.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.610
I think Bar Tartine
was an empty business,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.440
and they were kind of almost
forced into opening it.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.000
They were like, somebody has
to put a restaurant here,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.333
and you guys are perfect for it.

00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:48.127
So they did and it started out.

00:15:48.127 --> 00:15:49.960
They called it The Wine
Bar, their wine bar.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.293
And that was kind of what
they had it in their heads as.

00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:54.512
It was half the size it is now.

00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:56.220
And it was just kind
of a creative space.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.680
Like, they had, like, chefs
in and out constantly.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.180
Like, I mean, there was--
often, that's a bad thing.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.680
But in this place,
it actually was--

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.304
because it was kind
of a creative space

00:16:05.304 --> 00:16:08.050
and people were just
having fun there.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.650
I was cooking Japanese food and
Cortney was doing everything.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.220
CORTNEY BURNS: I had gone
on restaurant hiatus.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.386
NICK BALLA: And Chad
Robertson would come in

00:16:16.386 --> 00:16:18.010
to the place I was
working at the time,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.232
and we got to know
each other pretty well.

00:16:20.232 --> 00:16:21.440
And started talking about it.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.981
And he wanted to
re-concept the place

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.556
and start making
whole grain breads.

00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:26.430
And I wanted to go my
central European roots.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.600
And so, it just kind of
made sense to try it out.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.351
Cortney and I met.

00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:32.766
We started cooking
there together.

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:34.210
And that was about
four years ago.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.760
CORTNEY BURNS: We didn't
start cooking there together.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.960
Nick started cooking there.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.290
I was doing other things.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.280
And then he asked me
one day, as the story

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.940
goes, to come and
butcher a goat.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.112
And I never left.

00:16:43.112 --> 00:16:43.820
NICK BALLA: Yeah.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.070
I had been there maybe a
month, and she came in one day

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:46.680
and just didn't leave.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.013
CORTNEY BURNS: To make cheese
or just to start projects.

00:16:49.013 --> 00:16:51.960
Like, we would always be talking
about all the dried spices

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.710
that we wanted to do
and all these things.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.840
And it just kind of
made sense to start

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.260
kind of a project kitchen there.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.610
And so that's what happened.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.151
And we've been there
almost four years now.

00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:05.105
Yeah.

00:17:05.105 --> 00:17:07.728
AUDIENCE: Are you guys involved
with the [INAUDIBLE] space

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.410
cooking restaurant
that's coming out?

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.219
CORTNEY BURNS: We're
not necessarily--

00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:12.760
NICK BALLA:
--operationally involved.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.770
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah, not
operationally involved.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.353
NICK BALLA: We're
going to sell some--

00:17:15.353 --> 00:17:18.054
we're going to have some
product, like the paprika we

00:17:18.054 --> 00:17:19.470
were talking about,
we'll probably

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.140
have some spice mixes
and preserved things

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.047
and fermented chili paste over
there, that kind of stuff.

00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:25.880
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.820
You know, it's really a constant
conversation with all of us--

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.525
the chef that he's
brought in, too.

00:17:30.525 --> 00:17:33.170
And kind of an idea
platform that we all

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.630
work within and together on.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.870
But yeah, we're going to keep
ourselves at the restaurant.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.256
AUDIENCE: What will be the
focus of the new place?

00:17:42.256 --> 00:17:44.880
CORTNEY BURNS: It's going to be
a larger bakery space, so a lot

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.010
more bread production.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.730
Also, larger pastry
production, lots of canning,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.580
preserving, things like
that that can't really

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.740
happen at the space
on 18th Street

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.170
because of the size limitations.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.750
And so it's just going to be
larger format, wood-fired oven,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.354
and then also more food.

00:18:01.354 --> 00:18:03.020
NICK BALLA: Breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.853
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:18:03.853 --> 00:18:05.958
And much larger
cafe space as well.

00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.202
NICK BALLA: It'll be fun.

00:18:07.202 --> 00:18:08.910
CORTNEY BURNS: Possibly
teaching kitchen.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.020
To be determined.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.203
See what fits.

00:18:13.203 --> 00:18:14.369
NICK BALLA: Toss some salad?

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:15.287
CORTNEY BURNS: Yup.

00:18:18.874 --> 00:18:20.540
NICK BALLA: Oh, I
didn't mean like that.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.870
CORTNEY BURNS: Oh, no.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.910
So I'm going to actually
watch that knife.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.189
You can grab that.

00:18:29.189 --> 00:18:30.730
So like Nick said,
at the restaurant,

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.090
we basically like
to make things.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.690
That's kind of where we--
our jumping-off point.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.710
So we create this
larder at the restaurant

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.220
that very much so dictates
what we cook at the restaurant.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.690
So a lot of times, instead
of thinking of a dish,

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.330
we think of what do we
have and how can we use it.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.430
So because of the
larder, we've been

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.210
able to create over the
last four years or so--

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.500
it really gives
us the opportunity

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.560
to play with
different ingredients.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.500
So like the green
walnuts that originally,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.260
when we first pickled
them, we didn't

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.968
know exactly what we
were going to end up

00:19:04.968 --> 00:19:06.454
using them for-- this salad.

00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:08.620
We were able to put them
on here, because we already

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.730
had them made.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.580
So it wasn't like, oh, we
should make this salad,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.150
and now we have to wait
a year in order to do it,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.724
because we didn't
have the walnuts.

00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:18.890
So just to run through the
ingredients a little bit,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.790
we have Japanese sweet potato,
also called satsuma-imo.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.222
The interior is a white
color, very sweet.

00:19:27.222 --> 00:19:30.020
It sounds really ridiculous,
but very sweet sweet potato.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.030
Different in aroma and texture,
really kind of lustrous

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.210
texture, compared to
some of the other ones.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.360
Avocado.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.870
This one is some of
our house-made feta.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.060
So this one's water buffalo.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.677
Don't tell anyone.

00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:45.140
But it's water buffalo
that we're getting.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:49.480
We pasteurize and then we
age it for about six months.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.040
Sunflower sprouts,
mung bean sprouts.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.620
We do a lot of sprouting at
the restaurant for a couple

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.340
reasons.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.420
One, because we like the texture
that it creates, but it also

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.260
allows us to not
cook certain legumes

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.120
and make all the nutrients
a little more bio-available.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.076
And we can go more
into detail of that

00:20:08.076 --> 00:20:09.450
if you guys want
in a little bit.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.887
Parsley, dill, and then
these pickled green walnuts.

00:20:11.887 --> 00:20:13.970
Nick will tell you all
about the process on those.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.170
We have a little bit of a lemon
vinaigrette and the fennel oil.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.840
So another thing
at the restaurant

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.610
is that we don't use a
lot of finishing oils.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.760
We make them.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.872
So we start with a base benign
oil, and then we infuse them.

00:20:26.872 --> 00:20:28.830
NICK BALLA: Instead of
extra virgin olive oil--

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.540
we love extra virgin
oil, but we'll often

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.034
make things like sunchoke
oil or fennel oil instead.

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:36.700
CORTNEY BURNS: Just
because it allows us

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.552
to layer in more flavors more
specific to what we're doing.

00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:42.010
And then just a
little bit of lemon

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.773
that we'll toss with this.

00:20:43.773 --> 00:20:47.386
Do you want to talk
about the walnuts?

00:20:47.386 --> 00:20:49.010
NICK BALLA: So yeah,
the green walnuts.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.820
They've kind of turned
into our-- almost

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.270
like an olive substitute
at the restaurant.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.190
We make olives, too.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.440
But for this salad, it's a
slightly different thing.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.100
It's really a fun
combination with this stuff.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.370
So like we were talking
about, usually March or April

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.134
every year, the
walnuts-- you guys

00:21:10.134 --> 00:21:11.550
have all seen
walnuts on the tree.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.174
They have, like, the
green husk around.

00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:15.360
So it's not actual just
the nut with the hard shell

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.110
that you see, but
there's this whole fruit

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.180
around the outside of it.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.190
So we're using the whole thing.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.523
It'd be like the shell of the
walnut and the outer part.

00:21:21.523 --> 00:21:22.740
So this is the entire thing.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.130
So it's before the shell
of the walnut gets hard.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.670
This is the time of year people
will take them off the tree.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.057
Start in Nocino, which
is a liqueur that--

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.515
CORTNEY BURNS: The Italians
were famous for for a Christmas

00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:34.790
liqueur.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:34.960
NICK BALLA: What's the date?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.090
There's one day
when you're supposed

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.990
to process it every year.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.760
It's like a tradition.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.030
CORTNEY BURNS: I
don't know the day.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.571
NICK BALLA: And then
you don't use it

00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:42.200
until, like, November,
'cause it sits and oxidizes.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.040
But the pickled
walnuts, we take them

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.290
and we basically brine ferment
them for about a month.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.060
So just salt brine, which
leaches out tannins,

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.709
starts to sour them and
ferment them a little bit.

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:55.750
But mainly, it's getting
rid of all those tannins

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.360
that are in the
skin of the walnut.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.300
It's really, really bitter,
acrid kind of flavor.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.410
So after that month or
so of brining and kind

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.930
of releasing their
tannins, we'll

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.780
put them in really
mild vinegar brine.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.390
We've been using rice vinegar
with no added aromatics,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.876
really.

00:22:17.876 --> 00:22:19.940
The first year we did
it, we had sugar in it,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.380
but I don't think we've
been doing any sweetening.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.213
CORTNEY BURNS: Nope.

00:22:23.213 --> 00:22:26.310
NICK BALLA: It
doesn't need it after.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.210
Even in vinegar,
even though it's not

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.710
a super active
fermentation, there's

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.260
still processes taking place.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.700
And the walnuts
continue to break down,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.980
and the flavor develops.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.521
So we don't usually
end up using them

00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:41.940
until the sweet potatoes
become available in the fall.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.600
So it's at least six months
from the time we process them

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.910
till we start using
them, usually.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.575
And then we'll do 120 liters.

00:22:49.575 --> 00:22:51.450
This is the longest
they've lasted this year.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.250
I think we did a bigger
batch than we did.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.550
CORTNEY BURNS: We did a
bigger batch this year, yeah.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.170
NICK BALLA: But they're usually
gone in a couple of months.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.840
So we're lucky to
still have them.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.260
CORTNEY BURNS: They all get
poked about 8 or 10 times

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.420
before we start brining
them, so that some

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.410
of the noxious flavors come
out and then the brine goes in.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.210
So it kind of works
from the inside out.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.216
But you can see
the shape there, is

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:11.465
that's where the nut would be.

00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:14.476
So like, that is the
walnut that you're

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.100
going to eat on your
carrot cake later.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.225
That would be where it lived.

00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:20.250
But when we get them,
it's just either hollow

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.017
or has just an inkling of,
like, a little almost like jelly

00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:23.600
on the inside.

00:23:27.936 --> 00:23:29.760
AUDIENCE: What's the
base of the salad?

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.090
CORTNEY BURNS: So
we're going to do--

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.390
so these are the sweet potatoes.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.431
And so I peeled this one.

00:23:33.431 --> 00:23:35.020
These have been gently roasted.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.340
They're roasted till
they're just about tender,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.430
but not so soft that
you could puree them.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.630
So we're going to slice this up,
which I'll do here in a second.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.140
We're going to layer a base
of sweet potato on the bottom.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.650
And then we're going to slice
up some avocado over the top.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.859
And then we have some
sunflower sprouts and the mung.

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:51.233
We're just going
to kind of layer

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:52.880
all of that in with the herbs.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.680
We're going to spread
the vinaigrette around

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.190
on top of that and a
little bit of the oil.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.940
And then some of
the fennel, which

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.481
Nick's going to marinate here
with just a little bit of lemon

00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:03.110
and salt.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.340
And then a little
bit of the walnuts,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.910
mainly for their brininess,
but also for their salinity.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.470
So they're a lot of the salt
that's actually in the salad.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.850
They're creating that sort
of layering of flavor.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.840
And then we grate
the feta, again,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.210
kind of the saltier component
all over the top of it

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.780
with some coarse black pepper.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:26.251
So it's just kind of a sandwich
salad, just kind of layers in.

00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:27.650
You getting some
heat over there?

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.214
NICK BALLA: It smells crazy.

00:24:29.214 --> 00:24:31.080
CORTNEY BURNS: Can
you guys smell that?

00:24:34.426 --> 00:24:38.645
AUDIENCE: Is the
house feta less salty

00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:42.740
than kind of traditional feta
because you use the water

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.360
buffalo?

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.110
CORTNEY BURNS: No.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.767
I mean, we do cow.

00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:46.600
We do water buffalo.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.230
We do sheep.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.150
It really just kind
of depends on what

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.790
we're working with
in the moment.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.340
But the salinity comes into
it when we're brining it.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.160
So the cheese itself isn't
salted kind of on the curd.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.890
It's the brine that
we put over it.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.310
So the first brining of it
is a supersaturated brine,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.650
which is like 28 ounces of
salt per gallon of water, which

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.310
is a fair bit of salt.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.400
So we do that for 24 hours.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.400
And then we pour a completely
unsalted brine over it

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.774
again to kind of dilute it.

00:25:18.774 --> 00:25:20.440
And then from there,
we just let it age.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.920
So the milk itself
isn't necessarily

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.677
imparting any salt
one way or the other.

00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:32.510
We're just going to cut
these nice and thin.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.040
NICK BALLA: If anybody wants to
smell where this is starting,

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.602
you're welcome to pass it.

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:39.560
It's a little bit
warm, not too bad.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.560
CORTNEY BURNS: So you can
see that you can still

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560
slice through these.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.214
If you were to cook them
all the way, it would smash.

00:25:45.214 --> 00:25:46.630
So we take them
until they're just

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.990
kind of tender on the
outside, but still, you

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.326
feel like they're a
little bit al dente.

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:52.950
I mean, you can pass
them around if you

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.158
want to see where they're at.

00:25:54.158 --> 00:25:55.812
They just start to
shrivel, but not

00:25:55.812 --> 00:25:57.770
so much that you can kind
of push through them.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.400
This allows us to layer
them in and also just

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.410
have a little bit of
tooth left on them still.

00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.811
AUDIENCE: What got you guys
started on preservation,

00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:10.280
putting so much emphasis
on preservation?

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.190
NICK BALLA: We grew up
with kind of central,

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:20.670
eastern-central European--
we're both from the Midwest,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.350
and so our families are kind
of-- her side was like chopped

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.020
liver, and a lot
of pickles, and--

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.310
CORTNEY BURNS: Russian,
Lithuanian, Polish.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.760
NICK BALLA: Russian, Lithuanian.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.890
I had the Hungarian,
German, Polish,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.932
that whole thing going on.

00:26:31.932 --> 00:26:33.640
Grandparents that made
sauerkraut and had

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.047
a lot of pickles
and made soups and--

00:26:37.047 --> 00:26:38.005
CORTNEY BURNS: Borscht.

00:26:38.005 --> 00:26:41.250
My grandma was making
lots of, like, whole beet

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.550
borscht and things like that.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.820
NICK BALLA: My mom was
a hippie, so she always

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.180
had a lot of fermented
stuff around.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.320
CORTNEY BURNS: Totally.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.260
NICK BALLA: Like a lot of, like,
lime pickle, like Indian lime

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.760
pickle.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.590
And she always made sauerkraut.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.580
She had a huge garden.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.390
So we just kind of grew up
loving those-- loving spice

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.850
and sour and all that stuff.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.776
So we couldn't cook
in a restaurant

00:26:57.776 --> 00:26:58.900
and not have those flavors.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.180
Because otherwise,
we'd get bored.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.305
CORTNEY BURNS: We both grew
up eating whole lemons,

00:27:02.305 --> 00:27:05.750
as well, which your dentist will
tell you is a really bad idea

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.428
and is a really bad idea.

00:27:07.428 --> 00:27:09.427
NICK BALLA: Might have
been the candy, actually.

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:10.361
I was thinking about
that the other day.

00:27:10.361 --> 00:27:12.300
CORTNEY BURNS: Might
have been the candy.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:12.930
Also true.

00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:17.120
AUDIENCE: Nick, you
mentioned that you

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
worked in a Japanese restaurant.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.911
NICK BALLA: Uh-huh.

00:27:18.911 --> 00:27:21.458
AUDIENCE: So do you
guys pickle or preserve

00:27:21.458 --> 00:27:24.920
with all of the various
techniques from other cultures?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.795
NICK BALLA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.490
Huge.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.510
Japan, we still have a lot of
Japanese influence in our food.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.870
We use kombu seaweed,
and dashi is, like,

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.320
one of our main ingredients.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.534
Almost every one of our
stocks, we'll use dashi in.

00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:41.700
We often make this soup
with dashi at the beginning,

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.546
with kombu at least.

00:27:42.546 --> 00:27:43.670
CORTNEY BURNS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.040
NICK BALLA: Because Kombu
seaweed, it's the base of dashi

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.456
and a lot of the
Japanese flavors,

00:27:47.456 --> 00:27:50.140
that you make goulash
at home or you

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.876
make cream of mushroom soup.

00:27:52.876 --> 00:27:55.000
Whatever you're making, if
you put a piece of kombu

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.899
in when you start,
it's releasing umami.

00:27:56.899 --> 00:27:57.565
It's releasing--

00:27:57.565 --> 00:27:58.648
CORTNEY BURNS: Glutamates.

00:27:58.648 --> 00:28:00.010
NICK BALLA: Glutamates.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.380
Building flavor.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.860
So there's a lot of
ways to add flavor,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.310
to borrow flavors
from other cuisines

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.190
without making them taste
too weird or fusion-y.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.370
A lot of these things
make sense together.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.530
At our restaurant, we use sake.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.590
We make koji, which is
kind of the base of miso.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.380
We make miso.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.922
I mean, we're playing
with soy sauce.

00:28:21.922 --> 00:28:23.505
CORTNEY BURNS: A
little paprika paste,

00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:25.860
but in different veins,
some that kind of nod

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.570
to the Middle East, some
that nod more to Hungary,

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.650
and then certain parts of Asia.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.640
We're inspired by pretty much
foods from around the world.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.016
And a lot of our cooks are
from different places as well.

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:40.140
So they'll be like, well,
my mom used to make this,

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.600
or my grandmother made this.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.610
And we're like, wow,
that sounds great,

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:43.730
and we have no
idea how to do it.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.771
But just from hearing what
they're talking about,

00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:49.230
we'll take what we have
locally and just play.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.038
NICK BALLA: Yup.

00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:55.220
CORTNEY BURNS: So I'm going
to-- did you marinate this guy?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.000
Is it ready to go?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.208
NICK BALLA: I put some lemon
and a little bit of salt

00:28:58.208 --> 00:28:59.180
on the fennel, yep.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.290
CORTNEY BURNS: Do you
want to build the salad,

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.110
or do you want me to?

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.520
NICK BALLA: Go for it.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.570
CORTNEY BURNS: I'm
gonna build a salad.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.236
NICK BALLA: I'm going
to play with this.

00:29:09.772 --> 00:29:11.730
AUDIENCE: When it comes
to building new recipes

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.344
for the restaurant, you
mentioned that you like play.

00:29:14.344 --> 00:29:17.830
You use whatever you have
access to locally and maybe

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.590
what you guys have
produced at the restaurant.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.890
But can you talk a little bit
about the process of-- you

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.410
have the ingredients.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.750
You probably have a
direction you want to go in.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.689
Can you talk about
the step after that.

00:29:29.689 --> 00:29:31.855
Like how do you actually
get started on that recipe?

00:29:34.392 --> 00:29:35.183
CORTNEY BURNS: Yes.

00:29:35.183 --> 00:29:40.090
I mean, it's a very
multi-layered kind of question.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.242
A lot of it comes down to what's
already on the menu, for one.

00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:44.700
So if we're working
with-- we don't

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.702
like to double up on
ingredients on a menu.

00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.410
So if we're really
excited about carrots,

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.368
we'll have to pull them
off from somewhere else

00:29:50.368 --> 00:29:53.560
and then find a way to
kind of reincorporate

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.395
another ingredient.

00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:58.240
So a lot of times, it's
kind of like playing Jenga.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.155
So you're moving things
around in this way,

00:30:00.155 --> 00:30:01.780
trying to get them
to all fit together,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.935
not having too many things that
necessarily completely overlap,

00:30:04.935 --> 00:30:06.310
but everything
that just overlaps

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.300
enough to make sense together.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.940
Our menu's very much set up
in a shared plate format.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.110
So you probably, at any
given time, have five or six,

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.740
hopefully, dishes on
the table that you

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.698
may be eating together.

00:30:17.698 --> 00:30:20.110
So we always try
and keep in mind

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.560
what people are kind of going
to be eating at the same time,

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.580
so there's not too much--
dissonance can be good,

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.389
but not, like, overt dissonance.

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:30.430
It's good when things kind
of play off each other

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.080
and you have really
sour, and then really

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.400
gently sweet over here,
something that's really creamy.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.646
But when creating new
dishes, a lot of the time,

00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:41.020
I mean, for us,
sometimes it just

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.790
starts with a conversation.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.099
Or like, hey, I happened to
cook carrots this way yesterday,

00:30:46.099 --> 00:30:47.390
and it turned out really great.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.348
And then it's like, oh.

00:30:48.348 --> 00:30:50.520
And it spawns this
whole conversation.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.760
Or we tasted something,
and that flavor

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.250
was something we
want to highlight.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.710
So it kind of-- I
don't know if I'm

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.168
answering your
question completely.

00:30:57.168 --> 00:30:58.810
But we draw from many
different places.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:04.230
And having two people kind
of working together on a menu

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.380
can be really challenging.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.370
So kind of we also ping-pong
back and forth ideas.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.120
And then at some
point, one person

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.889
has to kind of make a decision.

00:31:13.889 --> 00:31:16.430
It's sometimes really hard to
make it a collaborative effort.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.370
So we kind of divide and conquer
ourselves a lot of the time.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.440
But more often
than not, we start

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.090
with what do we want to eat.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.290
So like, what sounds delicious?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.170
And so we don't
go from, like, OK,

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.030
so I want to make this plate
that looks like a garden.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.840
Like, that is never--
there's nothing

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.650
wrong with that
sort of approach,

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.582
it's just not how we think.

00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:41.790
We'll be like, well, what
do we want to do with this?

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.900
And then it ends up on a plate.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.850
We don't go the
other way around.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.270
So we create from
flavor and then find out

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.180
how it's going to look here,
versus the other way around.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.600
And then we also just kind
of draw from our spices

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.070
and kind of pull from there.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.000
So does that-- do you
want to expand on that?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.530
NICK BALLA: The
ingredients really.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.946
It's kind of what
you were saying.

00:32:02.946 --> 00:32:04.590
The ingredients
really dictate what

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.881
we're going to put on the menu.

00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:09.260
So we hate the notion of,
we're going to the market,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.310
and we're going to
buy this, and we're

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.010
going to make this
with it, exactly

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.530
with a pre-planned
notion of what

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.260
the ingredients are
going to be like.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.620
Because you get to the market
or you get to the store,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.770
and the stuff's different.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.561
So you say you want to
make a tomato salad,

00:32:22.561 --> 00:32:24.480
you get to Whole
Foods or wherever

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.676
you go, and the
tomatoes are terrible.

00:32:26.676 --> 00:32:28.050
Don't make a tomato
salad anyway.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:28.883
Make something else.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.600
Always, always have options.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.929
So a lot of the times,
we'll go to the market,

00:32:35.929 --> 00:32:37.970
and we'll say we want to
get something to pickle,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.099
and we'll see somebody
with a deal on turnips,

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:42.140
because they've just pulled
up their whole field.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.630
They want to plow over the
rest of the turnips and plant

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.870
something else for the early
winter, their early spring

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:48.550
planting.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.240
So the fall turnips
need to come out.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.471
Our buddies will have huge bins
of turnips for $0.50 a pound.

00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:54.970
Great.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.928
We didn't know we were
going to get them today,

00:32:56.928 --> 00:32:59.470
but all of a sudden, we
have 300 pounds of turnips.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.330
CORTNEY BURNS: Or 500
pounds of winter melon.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.781
NICK BALLA: Where's
that picture?

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:04.780
These things are insane.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.030
CORTNEY BURNS: Nick went to
the market alone last week

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.934
and came back with, like,
1,000 pounds of vegetables.

00:33:09.934 --> 00:33:10.600
NICK BALLA: Yep.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.890
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.992
NICK BALLA: So the
turnips-- we'll get back

00:33:15.992 --> 00:33:16.950
and we'll open them up.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.285
And we're not
automatically going

00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:20.770
to make a turnip
salad with them.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.680
We don't know if they're
going to be sweet.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.170
CORTNEY BURNS: Sulphuric.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.800
NICK BALLA: We taste
them at the market,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.220
but we don't know
how they're going

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.553
to end up after they're pickled.

00:33:27.553 --> 00:33:31.760
So a lot of the times, we'll
finish processing something.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.010
So we'll pickle all the
turnips and brine ferment them

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.801
for a couple weeks.

00:33:34.801 --> 00:33:36.780
And by the time
they're done, what

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.270
they taste like will determine
what we use them for.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.020
So we'll often have a huge
project that's finished.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.680
It's been doing whatever
for a couple months.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.080
We'll taste it and then
develop a dish with that

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.850
after, not having a
predetermined plan for them.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.302
AUDIENCE: Where do you shop?

00:33:56.302 --> 00:33:57.510
Or is it some sort of secret?

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.468
CORTNEY BURNS: Safeway.

00:33:58.468 --> 00:34:00.130
NICK BALLA: Everywhere.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.450
Everywhere.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.050
I mean, we have a
lot of relationships

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.030
directly with farmers.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.930
We have two different
sets of folks

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:10.639
that are just growing
for us exclusively.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.360
And then there's-- one
example is these girls.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.889
And they actually
sell to a couple

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.734
of our friends'
restaurants too now.

00:34:18.734 --> 00:34:20.400
But they're just
farming in the Mission.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.679
They have this huge lot in
the Outer Mission, little city

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.179
gardens.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.300
And they're growing
incredible stuff

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.969
that's climate-appropriate,
organically,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.610
out there in Outer Mission.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.006
Kale and chard
and lots of herbs.

00:34:31.006 --> 00:34:32.214
And they do a lot of flowers.

00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:33.214
CORTNEY BURNS: Radishes.

00:34:33.214 --> 00:34:35.469
NICK BALLA: And really,
really awesome stuff.

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:38.870
And then the people that do most
of our paprika are up in Napa.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.050
Justin and Mindy,
Full Table Farms.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.162
And they're just
growing for us now.

00:34:43.162 --> 00:34:45.120
We're basically getting
into a system with them

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.360
now where we don't
even order anymore.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.289
We just say, just show up.

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:51.580
Or they kind of let us know
what they're going to have.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.120
But it's really--
our approach is

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.482
we change the menu so often that
it's fun to just kind of say,

00:34:57.482 --> 00:34:59.440
bring us what you need
to harvest, what's best,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.542
and then make stuff.

00:35:01.542 --> 00:35:03.000
CORTNEY BURNS: Most
days, it's fun.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.696
Except when everyone happens
to deliver on the same day.

00:35:05.696 --> 00:35:07.362
NICK BALLA: Oh, no,
it's not always fun.

00:35:07.362 --> 00:35:09.278
AUDIENCE: I guess the
followup is where do you

00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:10.500
put 1,000 pounds of melons?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.230
NICK BALLA: All
over the restaurant.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.535
CORTNEY BURNS: Everywhere.

00:35:12.535 --> 00:35:14.660
There are still-- [? Kaitlyn ?]
can attest to this.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.620
One of our sous chefs is in
the back helping us out today

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.580
with the food they we're
going to plate for you guys.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.110
But yeah, it ends up everywhere.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.980
Like, literally.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.050
It's a problem.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.710
We have a
vegetable-buying problem.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.200
Like, we do.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.520
We're known for-- with
a lot of our farmers,

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.020
they'll call us and
be like, we have

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.460
300 pounds of, like,
B grade, whatever.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.168
You guys want it?

00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:33.710
And we're like, yeah, sure.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.970
NICK BALLA: B grade is
like magic to our ears,

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.600
because it's ugly on the outside
and beautiful on the inside.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.766
CORTNEY BURNS: As long as
it's delicious, it's fine.

00:35:39.766 --> 00:35:40.641
We can work with it.

00:35:40.641 --> 00:35:41.890
And we really like to do that.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.640
Granted, part of the reason
is we get a great deal on it,

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.510
which makes it really easy
for us to buy things in 500-,

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.070
600-pound increments,
where it may not be--

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.130
you go to the
Ferry Plaza Market,

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.580
you're not necessarily going
to get 500 pounds of something

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.350
for cheap.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.557
You're going to spend
half your paycheck on it.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.890
But we do shop at those markets.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.904
To kind of finish
up on your topic,

00:36:02.904 --> 00:36:04.320
we have about six
or seven farmers

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.710
that, like Nick was saying,
that we work with weekly.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.209
Then there's the
Civic Center Market

00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:10.800
that we like to go to
Wednesdays and Sundays.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.460
And then there's
the Ferry Building,

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.585
Ferry Plaza Market
on the weekends.

00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:16.335
Saturday's kind of the
best, but they also

00:36:16.335 --> 00:36:17.293
have Tuesday, Thursday.

00:36:17.293 --> 00:36:18.722
Just depends on what we need.

00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:20.680
And then there's weeks
where we don't have time

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.950
to go to the market at all.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.075
And we're lucky enough to
have a lot of our farmers

00:36:24.075 --> 00:36:26.360
that deliver directly to us.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.390
I'm going to keep building
this while we talk.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.973
So this is a little
bit of fennel oil.

00:36:29.973 --> 00:36:34.510
So we're just going to wet
these guys a little bit.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.970
And this vinaigrette
is lemon juice, dill.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.340
It has a touch of honey in it
and just a little bit of oil.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.830
So it's pretty bright.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.800
And then we add in the other oil
to kind of balance it as we go.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:51.469
But it's not like an
oil vinegar vinaigrette.

00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:52.760
It's more just kind of like a--

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.620
NICK BALLA: Can you guys see
what's going on over here?

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.453
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:36:55.453 --> 00:36:57.809
I'm just layering.

00:36:57.809 --> 00:36:59.100
So the sweet potatoes are down.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.390
I've got a little
bit of oil on them,

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.340
a little bit of vinaigrette.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.090
Now we're going to
layer in some avocados.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.205
We like lots of avocados.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.380
AUDIENCE: To what degree
do business matters play

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.704
a role in when you guys are
talking about ingredients

00:37:20.704 --> 00:37:23.396
or dishes or anything like
that at the restaurant?

00:37:23.396 --> 00:37:25.020
CORTNEY BURNS: You
mean like food cost?

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.920
You mean like business
matters in that way?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.919
AUDIENCE: Marketability.

00:37:27.919 --> 00:37:31.410
Like, making sure that
people will actually

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.510
enjoy the dish and
things like that.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.060
Because maybe there's
dishes you guys love, but--

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.476
NICK BALLA: We sit right on
the border of people's comfort

00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:39.924
zone.

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.090
CORTNEY BURNS: In many ways.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:41.990
Sorry.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.260
NICK BALLA: Luckily-- right.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.800
That is accurate.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.996
Luckily, it's a very
receptive customer base,

00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:54.120
not just in San Francisco,
but even in The Mission,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.060
even more specifically,
where we live.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.220
So we're really
fortunate to have that.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.860
And just in general,
people's attitudes

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.280
about dining and expectations
have changed so much recently

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.410
in the last just several years.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.100
I don't think this could
have worked 10 years ago.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.200
Or it would have
been challenging.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.880
But we have a
mainstream audience.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.860
And for the most part,
people will get it

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.350
and are open to what we're
doing, even if we can't even

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.737
explain what it is we're doing.

00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:22.570
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.028
I mean, a lot of time it is
managing people's expectations.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.820
Either if we're talking to a
table or our front of the house

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.930
is talking to a table, if we can
have them create something that

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.030
is based in something
they're familiar with

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.240
or comfortable with,
then a lot of the times,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.720
we can kind of win
back the skepticism

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.140
that we sometimes get.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.950
So if we explain to people
where these ideas of the dishes

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:45.910
are coming from.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.550
And food is very
nostalgia-based,

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.845
so hopefully we are
creating flavors

00:38:49.845 --> 00:38:51.970
that may be new as far as
how they're put together,

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.410
but everyone's
had a sweet potato

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.825
and an avocado and an olive.

00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:56.200
It may be a pickled
green walnut,

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.600
but it really tastes
like an olive.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.766
So if we can kind of explain
to people in this way--

00:38:59.766 --> 00:39:01.900
and not to dumb it down,
but just to create, like,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.677
a sense of comfort for people.

00:39:03.677 --> 00:39:05.010
We're not reinventing the wheel.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.517
We're not really doing anything
super cerebral or crazy.

00:39:09.517 --> 00:39:11.475
We're making a sauerkraut
stew, and we serve it

00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:12.225
at the restaurant.

00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:15.620
It'll just have a big blood
sausage on it, too, probably.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.860
And so it really is managing
people's expectations

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.005
and figuring out how to
create comfort for people

00:39:20.005 --> 00:39:22.130
and what dishes are going
to make them comfortable.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.810
And then from there,
once they kind of

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.000
trust you a little bit
more, you can bring them in

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.120
and have them taste things.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.060
I mean, some of our food might
be seen as weird or different,

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.670
but hopefully, it doesn't
taste like something that's

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:39.170
like so out there that has
no basis in either reality

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.150
or some sort of flavor that
maybe you've tasted before.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.980
Like, we find our
biggest successes

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.630
are when someone's like,
this tastes like something I

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.140
had when I was blah, blah, blah.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.150
And we're like,
oh, food nostalgia.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.290
There's nothing more
successful than that.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.600
So if we are creating
food from that standpoint,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.260
we find that oftentimes,
it has a better

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.042
chance of being successful.

00:40:02.042 --> 00:40:04.562
Does that make sense?

00:40:04.562 --> 00:40:06.270
So just to bring you
guys back over here,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.120
we have the fennel, which
Nick kind of marinated

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.930
with a little bit
of lemon and salt.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.040
And it just kind
of tenderizes it.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.050
We've layered that over the
sweet potatoes and the avocado.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.070
We've got a little bit
of vinaigrette on there.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.290
And then we're going to layer
some of these walnuts on there.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.270
I'm going to pull them
apart a little bit.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.478
It can be really intense if
you eat too many at once.

00:40:24.478 --> 00:40:26.340
And what we're doing
is, we're creating

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.340
that kind of salt base.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.000
We're creating that
layer of flavor in there

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.180
and some of the acidity.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.570
So break them up so
that you kind of get one

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.430
with every bite.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.320
And then these
mung bean sprouts.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.690
Dos anyone sprout at home
or familiar with sprouting?

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.430
Yeah?

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.942
What do you sprout at home?

00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:47.150
AUDIENCE: Usually mung beans.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.480
NICK BALLA: Nice.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:48.930
CORTNEY BURNS: Oh, yeah.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:49.763
NICK BALLA: Awesome.

00:40:49.763 --> 00:40:51.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.590
CORTNEY BURNS:
That sounds great.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.760
Anyone else?

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.870
It's super easy, which is great,
and really, really healthy,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.610
and a nice kind of
textural element

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.086
that you can layer into things.

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:04.460
You can also cook
with them, too.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.200
So any seeds and
different legumes

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.232
like that, they're
dormant when they're dry.

00:41:11.232 --> 00:41:12.940
And so what we're
doing is waking them up

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.731
and asking them to give
us their nutrients.

00:41:14.731 --> 00:41:18.320
And it sounds super hippie,
but that is what's happening.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.921
So when we start to feed them
water, we're mimicking nature

00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:22.545
and we're asking them
to start growing.

00:41:22.545 --> 00:41:25.130
And what that does is
they release the nutrients

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.090
that they would need in
order to start to grow.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.476
And then we get to eat them.

00:41:29.476 --> 00:41:32.314
AUDIENCE: So how
would you sprout them?

00:41:32.314 --> 00:41:34.602
Like, would you wet
a paper towel down?

00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:36.060
NICK BALLA: For
the most part, most

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:40.110
of the things we do get a soak,
get soaked at least overnight.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.272
And then depending
on, first of all,

00:41:42.272 --> 00:41:44.730
how much we want to sprout it--
so these guys are sprouted.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:49.110
These sunflower sprouts are
sprouted into long shoots.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.700
Depending on what
we're looking for,

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.658
like these mung sprouts
just barely have tails.

00:41:52.658 --> 00:41:54.425
So these will get
soaked overnight,

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:56.550
and then we'll just rinse
them a couple times a day

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.520
for two to three days.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.770
And then they're ready to eat.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.400
They're just starting
to form tails.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.820
So there's a number of different
ways you can approach it.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.990
But usually, I'll
start with a soak

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.427
and then rinsing
until they're done.

00:42:07.427 --> 00:42:09.260
CORTNEY BURNS: So you'll
see that we're just

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.809
tearing the herbs up here,
which, again, we were

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:14.350
talking about before, running
your knife over, tearing herbs.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.800
Some kitchens, you would
totally be kicked out of.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.670
But we're just
opening up the flavor.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.990
And we don't really
need them to be

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.120
finely diced or
anything like that.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.750
Just tear them.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.015
It works great.

00:42:27.015 --> 00:42:28.640
But yeah, someone
else would definitely

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.765
tell you that it's illegal.

00:42:31.889 --> 00:42:32.680
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.430
Do you guys have any issues
with the Health Department

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.350
or any of that kind of stuff
with fermenting and sprouting

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.820
or any of those things?

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.710
It's all good to go?

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.350
NICK BALLA: We hope so.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.700
CORTNEY BURNS: So far so good.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.830
NICK BALLA: We're lucky to
have a really cool guy that's

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:50.650
doing it.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.530
Our particular
inspector has really

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.770
been open-minded
to-- like, I think

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.490
that we would probably
get shut down in New York.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:03.160
They're pretty
tyrannical over there.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.900
For the most part,
like fermented stuff,

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.440
like sauerkraut, there are
no documented instances

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.360
of food-borne illness
from a lactic ferment.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.950
You don't get sick
from sauerkraut.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.212
That just does not happen.

00:43:17.212 --> 00:43:18.670
We have an interesting
relationship

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.600
with this stuff,
where people-- even

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.680
when we started doing
it-- like kimchi.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.513
I remember making kimchi
and being terrified

00:43:23.513 --> 00:43:26.200
I was going to poison
somebody 10 years ago,

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.450
or whatever it was.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.700
It's just not going to happen.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.390
People get sick
usually-- I mean,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.670
I'm not saying it's
completely impossible.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.365
But as far from
pathogens, it doesn't

00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:37.490
happen from brine ferments.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.460
CORTNEY BURNS: You're
more likely to get sick

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.793
from the raw cabbage than you
are the fermented cabbage.

00:43:40.793 --> 00:43:42.790
So if there is something
on the raw vegetable,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.040
you'll hear people getting
sick from lettuce at times.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.665
NICK BALLA: You're going to more
than likely get food poisoning

00:43:47.665 --> 00:43:51.510
from improper handwashing
of somebody's Romaine salad.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.540
Or you hear about
these different scares

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.620
from different large,
huge farms that

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.500
get E. coli contamination
and things into their greens

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.060
or broccoli.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.310
There's been spinach--
that's the most common stuff,

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.020
handwashing.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.270
CORTNEY BURNS: But if you
brine ferment those things--

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.950
NICK BALLA: It kills everything.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:07.720
CORTNEY BURNS:
You're good to go.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.120
NICK BALLA: Except for
the lactic acid bacteria,

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.110
which we like.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.140
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.199
So we're going to grate
some feta over this.

00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:14.740
And we're just going
to use a grater.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.630
This is a really
hard form of feta.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.920
Sometimes you can find softer.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.460
Anything.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.090
You could buy crumbled in
the store and recreate this.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.710
You, by all means, don't
have to sprout anything.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.960
You could use any lettuce
that you like on here.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.927
So again, it's a template.

00:44:27.927 --> 00:44:30.010
We're saying, we like sweet
potatoes and avocados.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:31.070
Beyond that, go for it.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.360
You want blue cheese on
it, put blue cheese on it.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.090
All of our recipes
are really templates.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.890
It was really
challenging for us--

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.710
one the most challenging
things about writing the book

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.543
was actually writing
the recipes, because we

00:44:40.543 --> 00:44:43.030
don't necessarily cook that way.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.300
And it's always changing.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.290
And there was times where we had
to just kind of stop ourselves

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.735
at some point and be like,
well, yes, we found a better way

00:44:48.735 --> 00:44:49.984
and we like it more like this.

00:44:49.984 --> 00:44:51.560
But our publisher
will kill us if we

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.220
keep changing the recipes.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.130
So we really encourage
people to use them

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.670
as templates, learn
the techniques,

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.120
and then from there, really
to play with the recipes

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.790
as they are.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.900
So like this, say
we run out of feta,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.695
we'll turn it into
something else.

00:45:07.511 --> 00:45:09.510
But this is how it is on
the menu at the moment.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.700
And this is also
what is in the book.

00:45:17.819 --> 00:45:19.610
So that's kind of how
we finish that salad.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:21.400
So again, really kind of rustic.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.233
Like, you don't really
know what's in there.

00:45:23.233 --> 00:45:24.736
But that's kind
of the fun of it.

00:45:24.736 --> 00:45:26.360
So you can do this
at your dinner party

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.380
and be like, see, I made
you this beautiful salad.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.504
You're not sure what's on
it, and I didn't screw up

00:45:30.504 --> 00:45:33.180
the plating of it, because I
just covered it completely.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.140
If you take nothing
else from this today,

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.880
grate cheese over the
top of everything,

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.921
and it'll look beautiful.

00:45:40.539 --> 00:45:42.330
You want to take the
cheese, [? Kaitlyn? ?]

00:45:47.442 --> 00:45:48.900
NICK BALLA: These
guys look hungry.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.733
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:51.100
You guys can start plating?

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.415
NICK BALLA: Does anybody
have any more questions?

00:45:55.415 --> 00:45:57.040
AUDIENCE: Going back
to the ingredients

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.407
that you said that you
just pick up in huge bulk,

00:45:59.407 --> 00:46:01.240
is there ever a situation
where you brine it

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.040
and then you just
realize it doesn't work,

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.040
or the flavor's just
wrong, or it's too similar,

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.527
and you have to just
throw a huge amount away?

00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:10.110
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:10.540
CORTNEY BURNS: Sure.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.248
We're being asked if
we've ever picked up

00:46:12.248 --> 00:46:14.090
a huge batch of
vegetables, taken the time

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.657
to peel them, brine
ferment them, sit on them,

00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:18.490
and then realize that
they're not delicious.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.198
NICK BALLA: All the
time, and it's always

00:46:20.198 --> 00:46:21.700
our fault when it happens.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.595
The reason is if
we buy something

00:46:23.595 --> 00:46:25.220
that looks beautiful--
and this happens

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.470
at the farmer's markets a lot.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.022
It looks awesome, and you
didn't really taste it enough,

00:46:29.022 --> 00:46:30.480
and you didn't
really pay attention

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.599
that the center is
woody or bitter.

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:35.140
And then you wait
two months, and you

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.440
have this awesome
pickle, and then

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.565
it all goes in the garbage.

00:46:37.565 --> 00:46:42.460
And that happens more
than it should have.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.590
Not frequently.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.337
CORTNEY BURNS: We often find
something to do with it.

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.920
NICK BALLA: But there
have been, like,

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.020
60 liters at a time
of things that we've

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.040
bought in quantity that
have been not usable.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.960
CORTNEY BURNS: We
just figure we're

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.890
feeding the compost bin
every now and again.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.130
We have to find a
way to think it's OK.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.480
And we're like, it's
really good for the earth

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.690
or wherever it's going.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.732
NICK BALLA: You say that?

00:47:03.732 --> 00:47:04.606
CORTNEY BURNS: I did.

00:47:04.606 --> 00:47:05.560
That just happened.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.371
I say that.

00:47:07.371 --> 00:47:09.870
But something that we've seen
is if the texture's not great,

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.286
we'll also be like, OK, let's
see if we can save it first.

00:47:12.286 --> 00:47:14.930
There's times where it's
absolutely unsalvageable.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.780
And you're just like,
this is not delicious.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.420
I'm not spending
my time on this.

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.550
It's not worth it.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.140
It'll be fine in the compost.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:20.410
C'est la vie.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.201
NICK BALLA: We'll catch
ourselves sometimes

00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:24.790
with something that's maybe
not perfect or a little bit

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:25.290
mediocre.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.759
We'll be like, maybe we could
roast it and put some sauce

00:47:27.759 --> 00:47:28.550
on it or something.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.467
And then it might be--
and then it's like, no.

00:47:30.467 --> 00:47:32.258
There's no point in
starting with something

00:47:32.258 --> 00:47:33.917
unless it's really
good to begin with.

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.250
CORTNEY BURNS: That's the thing.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.987
In the world of fermentation
or something like that,

00:47:37.987 --> 00:47:39.820
if you don't start with
something delicious,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.220
you're not going to end up
with something delicious.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.886
So like Nick said,
we make the mistake--

00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:45.520
if we are trying to make
something delicious that's

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.050
ultimately not starting that
way, it becomes a challenge,

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:49.800
and we sometimes just
have to kind of pull

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.950
the cord on that one.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.380
But we have had instances
where, like, squash may not

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.950
have the best texture,
and so we pureed it

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.594
into this fermented paste that
we've actually then recreated.

00:47:59.594 --> 00:48:01.760
NICK BALLA: Turned it into,
like, a signature thing.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.150
Yeah.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.285
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:48:02.285 --> 00:48:03.360
And we use it as a bread dip.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.890
NICK BALLA: We did a
whole butternut squash

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.348
that-- it would keep its texture
if you don't leave it out,

00:48:07.348 --> 00:48:09.830
but it fermented a little
bit warm in the fall

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:10.870
that week or whatever.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.750
So the texture of the
squash got really soft.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.070
And we ended up pureeing it.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.077
And now it's like this
awesome bread dip.

00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:19.285
CORTNEY BURNS: Now we actually
ferment things for it.

00:48:19.285 --> 00:48:19.550
NICK BALLA: To puree.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.610
CORTNEY BURNS: So
sometimes-- I mean,

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.450
we learn a lot out
of mistakes or things

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:28.490
that not intended for, that
something wasn't intended for.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.340
I would say we probably learn
the most from that sometimes.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.030
And then from there, we
create all these new things

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.930
based on it.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:38.320
And it's laughable
at some point,

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:38.915
because you're
like, oh, remember

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:40.290
when we tried to
throw that away?

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.560
But two years later,
we're then still creating

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.890
that same exact thing.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.290
So we should marinate all that.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.276
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:48:48.276 --> 00:48:49.190
CORTNEY BURNS: Yeah.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.355
So it does happen, but we
try to find the good in it

00:48:52.355 --> 00:48:54.380
and not waste too much.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.221
It's really something that
we stand tried and true

00:48:58.221 --> 00:48:59.970
behind at the restaurant,
is finding a way

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.122
to use more or less everything.

00:49:02.122 --> 00:49:04.580
Because it kind of breaks our
heart to throw away something

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.240
that could be used
to feed people.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:13.430
So we do our best to make use
of as much of an ingredient

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.490
as we can.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.242
NICK BALLA: Anybody else?

00:49:18.242 --> 00:49:19.825
AUDIENCE: There's
such a thriving chef

00:49:19.825 --> 00:49:21.509
community in San Francisco.

00:49:21.509 --> 00:49:25.357
Is there a lot of
learning back and forth

00:49:25.357 --> 00:49:27.261
between different
restaurants or chefs coming

00:49:27.261 --> 00:49:28.136
into your restaurant?

00:49:28.136 --> 00:49:28.719
Are you guys--

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:31.011
NICK BALLA: We steal whatever
we can from other people.

00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:32.885
CORTNEY BURNS: We're
really lucky these days.

00:49:32.885 --> 00:49:34.740
Like you said, we
have a great community

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.530
of friends and colleagues.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.644
And 10 years ago, there
was a lot more secrets

00:49:41.644 --> 00:49:42.560
in the culinary world.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:49.045
20, 30 years ago, people guarded
their signature dishes really

00:49:49.045 --> 00:49:49.920
close to their heart.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.280
NICK BALLA: That era is over.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.510
CORTNEY BURNS: That
era is very over.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.718
And a lot of it-- I mean,
you guys can all definitely

00:49:53.718 --> 00:49:56.600
understand this, is like,
technology and the web

00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.064
and all of these things, it's
like every recipe is out there.

00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:02.230
You want to know how this
person made their custard?

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.604
Well, most likely,
you can Google

00:50:03.604 --> 00:50:08.200
it, which is now like
a verb, which is great.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.860
And you can find
out most things.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.580
And so I think with that
sort of kind of condensing

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.290
of the world in general,
has allowed a lot of people

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.430
to just kind of break down
their walls in that way.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.013
And there's so many new things
going on and so many chefs that

00:50:23.013 --> 00:50:25.300
are playing, that
we are lucky enough

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.084
to have friends kind of
who we bounce ideas off

00:50:28.084 --> 00:50:28.750
of all the time.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.400
We were lucky to go to a
friend's restaurant opening

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:30.960
last night.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.210
And we were sitting at a table
with some of our chef friends.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.170
And we spent half
the time-- well,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.253
what did you do with that?

00:50:35.253 --> 00:50:36.740
I mean, totally nerding out.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.620
Like, it's full-on
food nerd central.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.200
And we get really
excited about it.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.440
They're like, I ground the
chicken, and then I steamed it,

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.620
and then I shoved
it in the ricer.

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.780
It was like katsuobushi.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.020
And it's like, well,
what if you did it with--

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.370
and there was a few
other people who

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.880
were sitting at our
table that are not chefs,

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.740
and they're just like-- you can
see the birds just chirping.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.448
I mean, they're
interested, but, could we

00:50:52.448 --> 00:50:54.410
talk about something else?

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.820
And so, when we get
together with those people,

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.124
that's kind of
what we talk about.

00:50:59.124 --> 00:51:01.040
We had a phone call on
the way here-- a friend

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.170
who's going to
start making kefir.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.712
NICK BALLA: In Chicago.

00:51:04.712 --> 00:51:05.920
CORTNEY BURNS: A chef friend.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:05.936
Yeah.

00:51:05.936 --> 00:51:07.450
He's like, hey, can you tell me
what you guys have been doing,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.850
because I know you've been
doing kefir for a while.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.070
And it's like, of course.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:10.870
I mean, yeah, sure.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:12.411
And I'm going to
call you and ask you

00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:15.530
how do you make your paprika
salami taste so good,

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.220
and how long are
you paddling it for?

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.350
And so, yeah, we're really
lucky to have that relationship

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:20.880
these days.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.380
We feel really
fortunate to have it.

00:51:25.894 --> 00:51:26.810
AUDIENCE: About bread.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:29.107
Since bread is such
a big part of food

00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:30.690
in general, and
especially at Tartine,

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.190
with the association
with the bakery,

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:40.030
with the surge in
gluten-free menus

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.890
and dishes and things like
that, how do you guys see that?

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.127
What's your take on
people who choose

00:51:45.127 --> 00:51:47.612
to be gluten-free, not
because of dietary reasons,

00:51:47.612 --> 00:51:50.100
but because they just choose to?

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:54.460
CORTNEY BURNS: I think everyone
has a choice on what they eat.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.810
Like, I, for instance, have
to taste a lot of gluten.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.477
But for full disclosure,
like, I do not

00:51:58.477 --> 00:51:59.810
eat the bread at the restaurant.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.587
I will taste it if
they've made a new loaf

00:52:02.587 --> 00:52:04.170
or there are really
cool grains in it.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.244
But it doesn't make me
actually feel great.

00:52:06.244 --> 00:52:08.660
This took years of not feeling
great to kind of figure out

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.520
what was going on.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.330
And so I just don't
do that to my body.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:16.550
But when I go out to eat, if
something's hidden in there,

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:18.470
I know enough about food
to be like, I bet you

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:19.590
that's got that in that.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:20.600
Or also just to ask.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.840
And I'll order something else.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.440
My only issue is
when people always

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.370
want what they can't have.

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.828
So you're like,
well, this dish you

00:52:26.828 --> 00:52:29.820
can't have, because it has--
of the nine components in it,

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.697
five of them do
have gluten in it.

00:52:31.697 --> 00:52:33.030
But they want that dish anyways.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.050
And it's like, let
me give you something

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:38.680
that you can have as
we intend it to be.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.750
We'll pull stuff out.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:40.930
Whatever, that's fine.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:42.790
People have dietary
restrictions,

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:44.590
we deal with it all the time.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.760
No big deal.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.739
But let us try to curate for
you, so that we can guide you

00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:51.280
in the best way, so
that you actually

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.700
have an experience that might
be as much as we intended it

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.740
to be, or at least as much
as we intended it to be,

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.822
instead of having to
recreate something

00:53:00.822 --> 00:53:03.280
on the spot that has nothing
to do with anything that we're

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.150
doing.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:06.270
But some of our
most fun moments are

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.021
when someone's like,
well, I'm this, that,

00:53:08.021 --> 00:53:08.853
and the other thing.

00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:10.510
And they have a
serious health issue,

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:11.990
and they can't
have this or that.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.990
And on the spot, we have
to come up with a dish,

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.810
and sometimes it ends
up being-- not always--

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.720
but sometimes it ends up being
the best dish of the night.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.200
Because you just have to
really be on your toes,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.800
and you get to just kind of make
something totally different.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.990
So it kind of has
both ends to it.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.520
But there are nights where
it's like 90% of the people

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.900
have some sort of
allergy or aversion,

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.570
and it does start to wear
on you at some point,

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.410
because you're
just like, really?

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:38.690
Are you allergic to onions or
you just don't like onions?

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:39.300
You know?

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.990
Or you get the gluten-free
people who then eat the bread.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.661
And you're just like, I don't
totally understand this one.

00:53:44.661 --> 00:53:45.410
But you know what?

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.290
It's like, we all
get our choices.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.470
We all get to be who we are.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.680
And so it's just--
as much as we can,

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.270
we just try and let
people do their thing.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.060
There's only so much
you can do about it.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.960
And there's only
so much energy you

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.366
can spend being
frustrated by it.

00:53:59.366 --> 00:54:01.240
It's really a waste of
time most of the time.

00:54:03.379 --> 00:54:04.670
NICK BALLA: You're doing great.

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:06.086
CORTNEY BURNS:
You're doing great.

00:54:06.086 --> 00:54:08.230
You look great.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:09.520
Yup.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.590
Anyone else?

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.022
Does anyone avidly cook at home?

00:54:15.022 --> 00:54:16.440
AUDIENCE: Anyone what?

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.070
CORTNEY BURNS:
Avidly cook at home?

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.210
Yeah?

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:20.620
Hence why most of you are here.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.210
But that's great.

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:24.770
That's something that we feel
is missing a lot from kind

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.270
of our modern
landscape, and we hope

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:27.310
that people are getting back to.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.518
And that's a huge reason
why I put that big technique

00:54:29.518 --> 00:54:30.620
section in the front.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.850
It's just to give people
even more of an opportunity

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.666
to play at home.

00:54:35.666 --> 00:54:37.790
It's like, if you want to
make the yogurt, you can.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.110
You can also buy it,
because there's really

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.520
good yogurt in the marketplace.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.010
But if you want to know how,
it's all kind of in the-- not

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.800
all-- but a lot of
it's in the book.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.890
And it's definitely
not all-encompassing,

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:51.840
but it's kind of the
starting guide to utilizing

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.240
the techniques that
are in the recipes

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.240
in the back of the book.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.279
But yeah.

00:54:57.279 --> 00:54:58.654
AUDIENCE: Do you
have substitutes

00:54:58.654 --> 00:54:59.862
for some of your ingredients?

00:54:59.862 --> 00:55:02.630
Like it would be really hard
to get the pickled walnut.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:03.660
CORTNEY BURNS: No, you
can order them on Amazon.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.420
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.190
CORTNEY BURNS: So
what's interesting

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.690
about the pickled walnuts
is it's not something

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:07.600
we created at all.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.016
And most of the
things in the book

00:55:09.016 --> 00:55:13.050
are not things that we just had
some sort of amazing epiphany.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:14.160
That's just not how it is.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.680
It's like, oh, all
over parts of Britain,

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.720
people are eating this with
boiled meat as we speak.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.850
Do you need these?

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:23.550
Do you need this?

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.368
Do you need everything?

00:55:25.368 --> 00:55:28.790
Do you want this?

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:30.158
Do you want this?

00:55:30.158 --> 00:55:32.283
This is [? Kaitlyn. ?]
She's one of our sous chefs.

00:55:32.283 --> 00:55:33.170
[? KAITLYN: ?] Hi.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:36.370
CORTNEY BURNS: Life would
not be the same without her.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:39.127
So you can order them,
and they come in a jar.

00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:40.460
AUDIENCE: What was the question?

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.205
NICK BALLA: Amazon Prime.

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:44.080
She's asking, do we have
a lot of substitutes

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.010
in the book for
hard-to-find ingredients.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:47.860
And we do.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.220
And some of them-- it won't
always be stated exactly,

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:56.010
but we try to get kind
of a general idea of what

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.120
it might be like.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.610
We didn't actually put a
sourcing section in our book,

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.480
mainly because most people are
so internet-savvy these days

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:10.380
that they'll just go on
their Google home page

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.170
and check it out.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:15.030
So most things can
either be bought,

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.780
or some sort of substitute
can be made, yes.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.717
It's few and far between on
the things that can't at all.

00:56:21.717 --> 00:56:23.425
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Well,
everyone, thank you

00:56:23.425 --> 00:56:24.750
all so much for coming.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.030
If we could please
thank Cortney and Nick

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.310
for this wonderful demo.

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.560
CORTNEY BURNS: Thank you guys.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.560
[APPLAUSE]
