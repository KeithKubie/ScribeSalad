00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:04.302
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.440
-Good morning, everyone.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.420
It's great to see such a good
crowd at 9:00 in the morning.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.820
It's going to be a great day.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.380
Welcome to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.120
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.560
I'm dean here at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.720
And I am so pleased to welcome
you to today's conference,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.130
Ways With Words-- Exploring
Language and Gender.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.870
As an Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.900
the Radcliffe
Institute is dedicated

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.090
to inquiry that transcends
disciplinary boundaries

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.310
and to sharing the
fruits of that inquiry

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.940
with a broad public
audience through events

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.840
like this one and many others.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.500
For example, this
year, we are partnering

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.690
with the Harvard
University Native American

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.290
Program on Native and Indigenous
Peoples Initiative, which

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.840
will culminate with
a conference entitled

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.720
Native Peoples, Native
Politics on Friday, April 29.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.810
And I hope you'll
join us for that.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.040
We also bring a wide
array of leading thinkers

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.070
and public intellectuals
to Radcliffe Yard,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.340
such as our current Radcliffe
fellow, Michael Pollan,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.460
the renown journalist best known
for his investigative reporting

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.150
on the food industry.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.240
Pollan will be speaking
on Wednesday, April 6,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.690
and I can promise you
a fascinating lecture.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.790
We will conclude our programming
for the academic year

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.080
on Radcliffe Day,
Friday, May 27,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.340
when we will award
the annual Radcliffe

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.850
medal to Janet Yellen, the
chair of the Federal Reserve.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.490
That day will feature
an exceptional panel

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.750
on a topic that is very close
to Yellen's head and heart,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.520
Building an Economy for
Prosperity and Equality.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.450
The afternoon will
include remarks

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.920
from Ben Bernake,
Yellen's predecessor

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.470
as chair of the Fed,
followed by a conversation

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.600
between Yellen and
Harvard professor

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.750
of economics, Greg Mankiw.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.100
And you can find
information on ticketing

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
through our Radcliffe website.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.820
Video of all of the
events I've mentioned

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.010
will also be available
on our website.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.070
Today we are gathered for
this year's major conference

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.930
on an important
aspect of gender.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.260
We do so because a
multidisciplinary approach

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.300
is exactly the way to
study gender, an issue that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.660
is both enormously
complex and also

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.460
at the heart of
human experience.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.830
We have a wonderfully diverse
array of human experience

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.180
here with us today, not
just on the program,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.450
but also in the audience.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.640
As you sit here in
the Knafel Center,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.330
you are surrounded by inventors,
journalists, social workers,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.130
investment bankers, speech
therapists, physicists,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.900
and many activists.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.140
You include the
students and faculty

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.180
from across the Harvard campus,
from all around the Boston

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.450
region, and from universities
further afield like Yale,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.110
the University of Santa
Clara, and the University

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.590
of Oslo in Norway.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.400
Viewers worldwide are also
watching today's conference

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.030
through live streaming
on our website.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.990
And in the months ahead,
viewers around the globe

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.220
will be able to watch
the video online.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.740
Whether you are here in person
or whether you are joining us

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.270
virtually, you are in
for an exciting program.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.420
I want to take a moment to thank
John Huth, today's conference

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.830
organizer and faculty
co-director of the science

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.840
program here at Radcliffe.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.580
He has worked incredibly
hard putting this conference

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.880
together and he did so with
the help of Radcliffe staff,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.750
especially Rebecca
Wassarman and her team,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.180
as well as many Harvard faculty,
departments, and centers

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.160
across the university.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.990
I am grateful to all of them and
to our speakers and panelists

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.590
for the expertise they bring to
today's exploration of gender

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.110
and language.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.610
The theme of gender
and language makes

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.220
something of a departure
from many of the topics

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.000
that our gender conferences
have tackled in the past.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.079
In recent years, we've explored
gender and the public's health,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.649
gender and migration,
gender and violence,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.060
and women and democracy,
and perhaps some of you

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.600
have been here for those events.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.020
These are all topics with
obvious public policy

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.240
relevance.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.350
In contrast, today's conference,
which focuses on language

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.990
as a fluid reflection
of cultural practices,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.700
might at first seem
to be more abstract.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.220
But the truth is that
we are surrounded

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.500
by questions of gender
and language all the time.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.930
Right now, for example, a
writer in our fellowship program

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.980
is working on a novel
with a transgender person

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.450
as one of the
central characters.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.620
And as we look
ahead to next year,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.230
Jennifer Finney Boylan,
author and advocate

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.680
for transgender rights,
will be delivering

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.620
a lecture in February.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.490
And this is not just
happening at Radcliffe.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.140
Everywhere we look
lately, we see

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.120
the language of gender
identity, the implications

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.850
of gendered language
for data analysis,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.270
and the role of gendered
language in public discourse.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.560
Let me share just a few
recent examples with you.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.270
When David Bowie, a popular
music superstar over five

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.540
decades, died in January,
Salon.com ran a eulogy

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.650
with a headline that read "A
bold, knowing, charismatic

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.640
creature neither
male nor female."

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.050
In the same month, Alicia
Garza, co-founder of Black Lives

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.130
Matter movement criticized
President Barack Obama's State

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.720
of the Union for its
failure to address,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.440
and these are
Garza's words, and I

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.960
quote, "the needs of black
cisgender and transgender women

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.750
and black immigrant women."

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.750
Just yesterday, a headline
in the Harvard Crimson

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.700
that I noticed read "Gender
Neutral Bathroom Defaced."

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.250
Meanwhile, women's colleges
across the United States

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.910
are reassessing their
admissions policies

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.060
to take into account
transgender applicants.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.210
Facebook, the popular
social media network,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.820
now offers its users 50 gender
self-identification categories.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.970
And both the New York
Times and the Boston Globe

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.240
recently ran feature
articles on the search

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.760
for gender neutral pronouns
in the English language,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.560
a search that turns out
to have been going on

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.580
for a very long time.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.110
Geoffrey Chaucer and Jane
Austen, just to mention two,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.180
both racked their
literary brains

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.170
for gender neutral
alternatives to "he" and "she."

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.210
In fact, the American
Dialect Society

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.320
has just named the
word "they," when

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.070
used as a gender neutral
singular pronoun,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.910
as its Word of
the Year for 2015.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.010
And I could go on, but I
think you get the point.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.690
The relationship between
gender and language

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.660
is so ubiquitous that
it can become a bit

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.140
like the air, something that is
so constantly present that we

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.720
never really stop to notice it
because we rarely think about

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.020
it in any sustained
or purposeful way.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.340
So today, we will stop to focus
on the interplay between gender

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.240
and language at this
precise moment in time.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.320
Our aim today is more
descriptive than prescriptive.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.540
We strive to question
and to understand.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.040
And to help us, we have
an impressive group

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.850
of panelists and
speakers, and John Huth

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.970
will provide us with a fuller
overview to all of them

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.830
in just a moment.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.370
As I mentioned earlier,
John is faculty co-director

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.900
of our science program.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.110
He is a walking definition
of interdisciplinarity.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.810
Besides being a
physicist, he has

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.170
expertise in planetary
science, cognitive psychology,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.660
neuroscience, anthropology,
history, languages,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.970
and track and field.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.490
He is also the
author, most recently,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.380
of a book about navigation
called The Lost Art of Finding

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.570
Our Way.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.260
And I'm sure that under
John's expert direction,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.770
we will all find our way
today to a stimulating day.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.052
Thank you, John.

00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:31.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.159
-Thanks, Liz.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.840
Oh, boy.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.780
After that, hope I
can make it work.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.090
Well, welcome to the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.950
And I'm glad to see
such a great turnout

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.490
and hope to get some great
questions and panelists.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.190
We have a really
good lineup today.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.280
So let me begin by
answering the question

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.780
that I've gotten
a number of times

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.113
with respect to this conference.

00:08:55.113 --> 00:08:59.040
How can an experimental
particle physicist

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.720
in the physics department
at Harvard University

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.710
host a conference
or how did I come

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.550
to host a conference
on language and gender?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.230
Because it seems like
a bit of a stretch.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.280
So let me explain.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.310
First of all, the
partial answer is

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.540
Radcliffe really pushes
me a lot and it's

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.900
been a learning experience.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:22.830
But there are two stories that
created this, in some sense.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.530
So the first was I was a
minority male in a majority

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.810
female meeting at Radcliffe and
I noticed the discourse, which

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.700
I couldn't really get into
because I couldn't figure out

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.344
the rules.

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:36.510
And so somebody would speak.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.270
Somebody else, the
next person, would

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.290
reflect what the
other person said

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.660
and then go into their thoughts.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.360
After that meeting, I went to
a physics department meeting,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.920
which was majority male.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.390
And the men would just
interrupt each other constantly

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.560
and the few women
in the audience

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.365
couldn't get a word in edgewise.

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:56.990
And there was no
reflection whatsoever.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.220
So that was very striking.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.140
In fact, it was something
that I had learned

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.697
about as an abstract
concept in the 1970s,

00:10:04.697 --> 00:10:06.280
but I'd never really
thought about it.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.940
And here I was presented
with a living realization

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.530
in two meetings of this
dynamic that I'd heard about.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.870
The other was a few months later
at my church, the United Parish

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.826
of Auburndale, we had a
transgender minister come

00:10:20.826 --> 00:10:22.200
and give a sermon,
but the sermon

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.460
was really about the
challenges that he

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.980
faced basically transitioning,
coming out, discrimination,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.620
poverty, all sorts of issues.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.540
And then we had a panel
of transgender people

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.040
who would talk about
their experiences

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.430
and just amplified
what the minister said.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.040
But what emerged
in that discussion

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.970
was the importance of
language to these people.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.040
I mean, for example,
just the pronouns

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.120
that are used for you
can either be helpful

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.480
or they can be almost an
attack on your person.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.220
And these two things
coupled together

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.480
made me, for the next year,
hyper-alert to the language

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.090
of gender, and I was constantly
seeking out more information

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.040
and noticing that
things were in flux.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.450
In a lot of cases, I make
the mistaken assumption

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.890
that when I enter a
culture or an institution,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.920
that things are dynamic.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.790
But really, over time, I find
that things are changing.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.810
And so what I was
really seeing was

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.560
that there was some
segment of language

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.630
and the language of
gender that was changing.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.040
Now, the study of language
and gender is not new.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.750
In fact, at least as far back
as 1665, it was written about.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.730
There was a writer,
Charles de Rochefort,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.770
who wrote about a language
in the Lesser Antilles

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.680
where the people, if you
as an outsider just entered

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.350
and listened to what was
going on, it seemed like women

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.350
and men were speaking
entirely different languages.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.560
This was 1665.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.490
More recently, the studies
of gender and language

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.010
emerged in the 1960s
where, for example, it

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.240
was observed that women tend to
lead linguistic change rather

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.740
than men.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.030
So if you really want to find
what's the rules of language,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.390
you go to an elder
male in that society

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.920
because they're the last
ones to change their language

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.520
habits, which it's true.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.880
Feminists such as
linguist Robin Lakoff

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.970
studied this in the 70s, Penny
Eckert into the 80s, and so on.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.200
So the question is, what's new?

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.950
What can we learn now?

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.310
Because languages are in flux.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.520
In fact, the flux, the
changes, the mutation rate,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.620
is so predictable that if
you take a proto-language

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.180
and then you take and
separate two groups of people

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.550
geographically, you can study
the languages after some length

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.440
of time and by knowing
the mutation rate,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.420
you can identify how long
ago the languages separated

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.620
from the proto-language just by
understanding the change rate.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.800
Not only that,
but a language may

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.580
come in contact with
another language

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.140
and absorb some of the terms
from the other language

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.590
until it becomes commonplace.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.360
And so sometimes
there are arcs where

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:20.220
a word may be the neutral
word of the borrowed language,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.056
may have a pejorative
connotation

00:13:22.056 --> 00:13:23.430
as it gets absorbed,
and then may

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.900
get grasped by the people
who it's describing.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.300
So rather than to
examine language

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.674
as a purely academic
concept, what

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:35.090
I wanted to do for
this conference

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.040
was to turn the tables
and use language

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.390
as a kind of lens or mirror with
which we can look at culture

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.400
and use the changes in
language as a way of examining

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.510
the changes in culture.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.540
So it's basically
turning the table

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.830
on what you might call a
language or a linguistic study.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.395
So to do that, we're
bringing together

00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:55.770
people who, I
would say, would be

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.690
on the front lines
of linguistic change,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.350
the practitioners,
the people who

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.040
are employing words themselves
in an everyday sense,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.420
studying the changes
in an everyday sense.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.330
So using that theme, we arrived
at the panels and the speakers

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.140
that we have before you today.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.170
And I'll work backwards.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.090
So the last part of the
day is public discourse,

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.150
where we have people who
are active in politics,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.400
advertising, and in
screenwriting and directing.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.880
And the idea there is
that ostensibly, at least

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.690
at a first blush,
you might imagine

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.270
that the target audience
would be 50% men, 50% women.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:43.845
Yet the content that's being
generated is by 95% men.

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:45.720
So you might ask the
question, to what extent

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.640
does that reinforce
all sorts of norms that

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.260
may not be obvious to people?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.610
And how do advertising
executives, screenwriters,

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.210
for example, tackle
this when they're women?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.510
Before that, we have
a session on big data.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.760
The emergence of social
networking, social media

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.550
can provide both
a tool for people

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.490
to use to understand
language usage--

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.440
what does that tell us, what
is the experience of people

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.290
online based on their gender,
and what kind of new language

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.460
might emerge?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.670
Last night, Robin Young
actually recapitulated a problem

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.550
that I had with the
term "LOL" in texting.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.150
Like me, she thought
it meant Lots of Love.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.220
And so it led to odd
texts like, "Boy, you're

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.480
going up against a big
challenge this morning.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.430
I wish the best for you.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.040
Good luck.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.810
LOL."

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.340
And so I actually
committed that mistake

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.710
myself, which is a good
example that you'd better

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.620
know the usage of a term
before you start throwing it

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.052
out trying to be hip.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.720
And our morning session
is entitled Beyond Binary.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.180
And we have Janet
Mock, who will be

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.540
speaking as a keynote
interviewed by Moya Bailey.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.420
So what we're trying
to explore here

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.510
is how the emergence, to a
greater public awareness,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.660
of trans issues has created,
in some sense, a language

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.080
challenge-- for example,
the usage of pronouns.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.660
But even more than that, it's
a question that a lot of people

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.550
are not wanting to be
identified by a specific binary.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.760
So what we'll hear, I
think, about the concept

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.370
of passing and whether
or not that's even

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.980
a good concept at all.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.540
I'll notice that
dictionaries, for example,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.980
capture what you might call
the old male sense of what

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.420
words are viable in a language.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.700
So I'll note that the Oxford
English Dictionary in 2003

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.400
entered "transgender" as a
word and "cisgender" in 2013

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.050
as a word.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.970
So already, there is some
sense of change as captured

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.240
by the OED.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.829
In terms of "they"
as a singular,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.849
it's also a generational marker.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:14.790
I note that my daughters
use it all the time.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.250
When I talk with friends
of my generation,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.290
they will immediately
correct me.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.460
On the other hand,
I've slipped into this.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.780
When I've been writing
in books and papers,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.859
I sometimes use
"they" unconsciously.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.670
I didn't even realize
that I was doing it.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.050
But in fact, I did use
"they" and I got corrected.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.860
So we'll be exploring the
issue of gender binary

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.750
and the question of how people
would like to be identified

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.310
and how language can be
used in a positive fashion.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.100
One woman last night was
talking about the desire

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.650
to raise her child in
a gender neutral home

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.040
and, more recently, in a
pangender home, so the sense

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.910
that the child can pick and
choose gender attributes

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.760
in this different way.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.090
So what I'd like to do
is invite the panel up.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:13.700
So we have Rebecca
Bigler, Wesley Thomas,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.250
and Bear Bergman.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.730
And to moderate the panel,
we have Stephanie Burt.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.684
So can you come up?

00:18:19.684 --> 00:18:21.100
And while you're
taking the stage,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:27.200
I'll just close with
one, I guess, anecdote.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.280
Last night, thinking
about this panel,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.640
I went into my Facebook page and
went to the little identifiers.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.960
And I chose my gender
to be "cismale"

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.600
and I also chose my
pronoun to be "they."

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.060
So when my birthday
comes up in two weeks,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.400
people are going to see, "John
Huth's birthday is today.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.320
Wish them a happy birthday."

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.771
So-- [LAUGHTER]

00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:53.270
No.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.380
You can go up and check.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.980
OK.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.620
So you can see that
I'm in dynamic change.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.250
OK.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.440
So the moderator
for today's panel

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.501
is Stephanie Burt, who is
a professor of English.

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:07.000
-Hi.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.499
Yeah.

00:19:07.499 --> 00:19:09.220
-And a poet--

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:09.910
-Yep.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.660
---writes poetry, but
also writes about poetry.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.130
And I just wanted to share
the title of one book that

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.960
stood out to me, which was Close
Calls with Nonsense-- Reading

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.100
New Poetry.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.150
So I have to pick that up.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.260
So Stephanie?

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.460
-It's waiting for you.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.294
Thank you.

00:19:28.294 --> 00:19:31.752
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:36.530
OK.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.890
Thank you all for coming.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.370
I believe it's my job
to introduce and, what

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.140
do we say, contextualize
our panelists who

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.120
we're so lucky to have
had travel to be here.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.180
And we will have
about 15 minutes

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.270
of each of our panelists
speaking, Rebecca Bigler

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.472
and Wesley Thomas
and Bear Bergman.

00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:00.222
And are we going to
go in that order, or--

00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:00.722
-Yeah.

00:20:00.722 --> 00:20:01.360
-OK.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.430
Great.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.370
We'll then have
20 minutes of talk

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.540
among ourselves, as it were, and
then 20 minutes or so of time

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.430
for your questions.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.180
Is that right?

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.010
Yeah.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.700
I have been asked to
introduce and contextualize.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.770
What's your pronoun?

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.270
That question was
unusual, except maybe

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.790
in an introductory language
class, 10 or 12 years ago.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.070
And now it's something
that a lot of us

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.210
hear frequently or
regularly, especially

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:38.430
if we identify as trans
or are under a certain age

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.940
or are teachers.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.030
Notice "or" not "and."

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.667
Some of us even have two names.

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:46.750
And thank you, by the way.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.160
I'm Stephanie today.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.230
Both names and all
the pronouns you

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.150
can think of that are
for people are correct.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.610
I'm going to continue to be
both, but I am Stephanie today.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.150
And that, again,
is something that I

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.440
can say to this crowd of lots of
people-- thank you for coming--

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.840
and it will sort of make sense.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.756
And you've probably heard
it from other people

00:21:07.756 --> 00:21:08.580
in other places.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.210
These are indications
that language is changing

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.490
and society is changing,
and each kind of change

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.660
helps drive the other.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.060
And things are changing
not just for people

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.800
with unusual
relationships to gender,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.280
but for everyone, as
a result. And things

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.270
are changing audibly and
legibly as well as visibly.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.160
Things are changing
not only around

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.670
conversational and
informal language,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.940
but around legal
language, the language

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.570
that government
institutions use to regulate

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.700
or attempt not to regulate us.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.700
Things are changing
for works of art.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.380
Things are changing in
terms of what is possible

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.040
and what has to be
explained and what

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.280
the baseline of assumptions
possible for a set of readers

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.820
is for essayists and memoirists
like Bear Bergman, who

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.820
I'm so happy to have here.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.840
Hi.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.370
Things are changing for
memoirists of many other kinds.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.730
Things are changing for poets.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.800
In 2013, Troubling the Line,
which is a terrific book

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.080
that you should check out
if you read modern poetry,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.410
appeared from Nightboat Books.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.280
It is the first, and it's
a very big, anthology

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.560
of trans and gender queer
poets and writings on poetry.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.150
And I'm sure there will be more.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.030
Things are changing
for comic books.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.960
One of my favorite current comic
books is Jem and the Holograms.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.770
If you saw the movie, I'm sorry.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.504
If you watched the TV show
growing up, good for you.

00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:44.420
Whether or not you did
either of those things,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.530
you might want to check
out this comic, which

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.270
is very interested in visual as
well as legible representations

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.030
of different ways, in
particular, of being a woman

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.580
and of being a girl.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.590
One of the artists,
the artist who

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.580
has the most to do with a look
of the comic, Sophie Campbell,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.390
who is out as a translady.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.520
And in the current issue, number
12, of the current plot-line,

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.730
one of the supporting
characters comes out as trans.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.230
They're also doing
amazing things

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.310
with other kind of
inclusive language

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.410
and with girls' and
women's body shapes.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.540
And we should do something
about comics here,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.490
gender in the visual.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:23.030
Maybe that's for 2018, but
one more partly verbal medium

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.870
in which you can really
see language change just

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.500
over the past few years.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.650
And it's changing in
terms of the language

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.860
that we use with children
and about children

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.360
as well as the language we use
with our college age students,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.940
or if we are college age--
traditional college age,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.120
I should say-- or 30
or 40 or 50 or 85.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.040
I have two awesome children.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.240
And when I meet people
and they discover

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.480
that I have two awesome
children, I'm often asked,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.270
is each one a girl or a boy?

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.320
And they're 5 and 10
and we're pretty sure.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.060
But when they were infants,
I was always tempted first

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.920
to say, why is that the first
question you're asking me;

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.460
I wish it were not,
and then to say,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.300
well, we think
that we have a boy,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.410
but of course we won't know for
sure until they're two or three

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.270
and can tell us.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:21.950
I think that's actually the
right answer, of course.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.580
We'll know when they're or two
or three and they'll tell us.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.250
Probability suggests
that they're boys.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.130
And in fact, I have two boys.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.922
And why would that not
be the right answer?

00:24:33.922 --> 00:24:36.130
Why would you not say that
every time you were asked?

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.630
Why would that answer
make cisgender parents

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.920
and non-parents
uncomfortable, if it does?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.890
Why is that still the first
question that parents get

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.390
asked?

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.364
Why?

00:24:48.364 --> 00:24:49.340
Why?

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.220
I hope we'll get to answer
some of those questions today.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.820
And I hope you see how
the answers are changing,

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.270
but how far we still have to go
and how many questions we still

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.290
don't know the answers to.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.990
And I also hope today
that we are going to see,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.840
and this is some place where
audience participation can

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.230
really help, how not just what
social [INAUDIBLE] you use

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.120
and what year it is,
who your friends are,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.600
and how old you
are affects the way

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.320
that language and gender
shape your sense of yourself

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.330
and of others, but also
how other actual languages

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.970
can make the answers to
all those questions super

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.090
different.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.690
I don't read Persian,
although I do

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.830
read some poetry in
translation from Persian,

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.480
and I know people
who read Persian.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.920
And it's my understanding
that pronouns in Persian

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.670
do not have genders at all.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.260
Any Persian speakers?

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.260
Yeah?

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:46.960
Is that right?

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.745
-Yeah.

00:25:47.745 --> 00:25:48.370
-That is right?

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:48.870
Thank you.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.030
OK.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.110
When I am speaking
English, I have

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.874
to tell people whether I prefer
"he" or "she" on a given day,

00:25:55.874 --> 00:25:57.540
and the answer is
usually both are fine.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.206
I'm "she" today.

00:25:58.206 --> 00:25:59.290
Hi.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.100
But if we were all
speaking Persian,

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.500
this just wouldn't arise and we
could use that energy worrying

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.880
about something else.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.510
I think that would
be really cool.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.110
I want to learn Persian.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:14.210
-Yeah, but then a lot of us
would be out of jobs, so--

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:20.180
-Well, I feel like
you'd be fine.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:26.560
Your range as a writer
extends far beyond that.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.460
But that's just one example.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.960
My understanding
is that we're going

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.880
to be hearing from
Wesley Thomas about some

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.690
of the ways in which different
kinds of gendered language

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.470
happen in Navajo or Dine.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.950
Did I pronounce that correctly?

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:42.450
-Yes.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:42.950
-Dine.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.240
Yeah.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.040
We will be hearing more
about gender and expectations

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.020
and how children use
language from Rebecca Bigler.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.390
And we will be hearing-- I'm not
sure what we're going to hear,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.270
but it's going to be great,
from one of the many topics

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:06.120
having to do with gender and
embodiment and sociability

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.600
and prose style-- Bear Bergman's
prose style is so amazing.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.560
Please go read Bear's
essays-- and parenthood.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.260
The new book is called
blood-- I'm going to get one

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.900
of the nouns wrong--
blood, glitter, wine--

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.510
-Blood, Marriage,
Wine, and Glitter.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.370
-Marriage, wine, and glitter.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.310
Marriage is the only
abstract noun in there

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.950
so my memory was creating a
cluster of concrete nouns--

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.430
and the relation
between the book

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:36.100
before that, which has the
most focused essays on gender

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.986
and language and trans stuff
that's not about parenthood,

00:27:38.986 --> 00:27:40.860
is called The Nearest
Exit May Be Behind You,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.310
from Arsenal Pulp Press.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.990
I recommend both of those books.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.573
And we're going to be hearing a
lot more about what's abstract

00:27:46.573 --> 00:27:49.380
and what's concrete and how
language works from our three

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.240
panelists.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.582
And I invite you to
listen to them all

00:27:54.582 --> 00:27:57.928
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.720
-I'm Rebecca Bigler.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.530
I'm delighted to be here
and open our session.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.860
The title of my talk is Gendered
Language and Sexist Thought.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.490
I want to just start by
briefly acknowledging

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.590
two important collaborators
in my life academics,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.280
Campbell Leaper at
UC-Santa Cruz and Lynn

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.690
Liben at the Pennsylvania
State University.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.770
I take full responsibility
for my remarks today,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.910
but I want to acknowledge their
contributions to my thought

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.880
and work.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.160
So hypotheses about the relation
between language on one hand

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.080
and thought on the other
date back centuries.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.770
Although many mysteries
remain, psychological science

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.870
has discovered much about
how the two are connected.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.050
The relation between
language and thought

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.390
is reciprocally causal.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.700
Each shapes the
other in ways that

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.370
are consequential
for human behavior.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.880
My primary interest
today is in the principle

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.100
of linguistic
relativity often known

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.080
as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,
which states that language

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.470
shapes the ways that
people perceive and think

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.030
about the world.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.060
Words refer to concepts and
having a word for something

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.820
affects how one thinks
about the world.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.950
In my talk, I will summarize
new and striking evidence

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:23.050
that the mere use of words
to denote or mark gender,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.950
referred to as
gendered language,

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.420
facilitates gender bias.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.500
In other words, my thesis
will be that gendered language

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.320
causes sexist thought.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.050
Languages across the
world vary in the extent

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.230
to which they mark gender and
the ways in which they do so.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.090
For the purposes of my talk, I
am going to focus on English.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.780
The English language includes
many means of marking gender,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:57.491
including honorific titles,
occupational titles, pronouns.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.690
Two points about gendered
language are important.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.790
First, words that denote gender
in English use a binary system.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.210
There are two
dichotomist markings

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.510
for gender, male and female.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.700
There is no
linguistic convention

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.720
in English for
marking individuals

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.650
who fall outside of or between
the categories male and female.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.840
Second, it is typically,
but not always, possible

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.130
to use gender neutral
nouns to label people

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.090
and thus, speakers
and writers can

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.680
opt or not to specify someone's
gender in a statement.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.440
There are obviously
some contexts

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.830
in which it's pertinent
to mark individuals'

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.560
gender, for example,
when discussing

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.100
some medical conditions
that are sex linked

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.010
or discussing gender
discrimination.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.130
In the vast majority
of instances,

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.550
however, individuals' gender
is marked unnecessarily,

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.080
as when teachers
greet their students,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.950
"Good morning, boys
and girls" instead

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.320
of "Good morning, students"
or a parent informs a spouse,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.380
"I'll pick up the
girls from school"

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.260
rather than, "I'll pick
up the kids from school."

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.160
Unlike nouns, however, English
singular third person pronouns

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.020
require the marking of gender.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.320
As a consequence, it is
nearly impossible in English

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.850
to write or talk about
other individuals

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.230
without indicating their
gender and simultaneously

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.770
forcing them into the
category male or female.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.660
So what, one might ask?

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.690
One possible response is
that gendered language

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.900
reifies a gender
binary view and thus

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.400
does not allow for
individuals who

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.100
have identities that fall
between or outside of male

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.030
or female.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.480
Indeed, some individuals have
identities outside the gender

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.120
binary and this,
I would argue, is

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.320
sufficient grounds for
calling for language reform.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.090
It is not, however,
the only basis

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.930
to call for language reform.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.830
Although the routine use of
gender labeling via nouns

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.070
and pronouns has been a long
accepted practice in English

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.840
in the United States,
there is mounting evidence

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.270
of harmful consequences
associated with the practice,

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.490
especially among children.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.340
Empirical evidence suggests that
rather than being innocuous,

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.610
gendered language profoundly
affects children's gender

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.130
stereotyping and prejudice.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.820
It does so via the
processes of categorization

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.410
and conceptualization.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.960
It is now well established
that language affects

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.010
children's categorization
of both inanimate objects

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.430
and animate beings.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.450
In the words of
Roger Brown, "Words

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:50.320
serve as invitations to
form categories" and infants

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.830
and young children readily
accept such invitations.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.900
The clearest
demonstration of the power

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.290
of labels to induce
categorization

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.640
comes, perhaps, from
the systematic research

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.080
of Sandra Waxman.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.900
Waxman and her
colleagues have shown

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.560
that infants between
three months of age

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.610
and two years of age
respond differently

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.440
to the identical
stimuli as a function of

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.280
whether or not they
are given a noun label.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.840
For example, Booth and Waxman
presented 14-month-old infants

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.260
with small models of familiar
stimuli such as cars or horses.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.870
Some infants heard the objects
labeled with the same noun,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.290
whereas others were presented
with the same objects

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.530
with no labels.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.100
On test trials,
infants were more

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.350
likely to select a familiar
than a novel category object

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.030
if they had been
exposed to labels only.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:45.060
In later work, the authors
extended the paradigm

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.490
to novel stimuli,
eliminating the possibility

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.070
that the words were
merely calling to mind

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.300
already formed categories.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.230
For example, infants who
heard novel objects labeled

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.550
with the same noun were
more likely to respond

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.600
to the perceptual
commonalities among the objects

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.420
than infants who
did not hear labels.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:11.550
Categorization, in turn, affects
conceptualization of stimuli.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.850
Categorization leads
children to make inferences

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.520
about category members.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.870
For example, categorization
induces essentialist reasoning.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.219
Essentialist reasoning is
defined as the tendency

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:30.219
to believe that category members
share natures or essences that

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.360
make them what they are.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.060
Susan Gelman and
her colleagues have

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.190
generated an impressive
array of evidence

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.510
that category
labels lead children

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.699
to infer that the
members of a category

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:47.420
share inherent, deep,
meaningful commonalities, even

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.690
in the absence of perceptual
or conceptual similarities.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.080
Consistent with this
notion, preschool children

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.050
readily make gender
stereotypic inferences

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.420
about unfamiliar children on
the basis of their gender noun

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.590
labels and gendered first names.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.110
Thus, children raised in the
presence of pervasive gender

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.250
noun labels are
likely to categorize

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.180
others they encounter by gender
and assume that same gender

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.520
individuals are
similar to each other

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.280
in many and important ways.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.430
Given that essentialist thought
characterizes children's views

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.770
of social categories, the
learning of gender categories

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.030
is likely to promote
stereotyping.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.390
Indeed, categorization has long
been considered a key process

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.510
in the development of all
social stereotypes and biases.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:45.090
In 2006, Lynn Liben and I
published a theoretical account

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.310
of the formation of social
stereotypes and prejudices

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.210
in children titled
"Developmental Intergroup

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.220
Theory."

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.660
We noted that humans vary
along myriad dimensions which

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.550
offer children bases for
classification including

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:05.270
height, hair color, handedness,
whether your earlobes are

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:09.180
attached or not,
gender, race, etc.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.460
We argued that
children look to cues

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.140
from adults about which
attributes should serve

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.320
as a basis for classification.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.010
Gendered language
is a powerful cue.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.590
It leads children to
categorize themselves

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.650
and others on that basis.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.020
As a consequence of
such categorisation,

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.050
children, as I noted, endorsed
gender essentialist views

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.310
and attend to and
learn the attributes

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.250
that are linked with gender
in their environment.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.790
As a result, children
as young as age three

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:46.740
rigidly endorse stereotypes
about occupations, activities,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.650
traits, and other attributes.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.390
In addition to
affecting children's

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.080
gender-related cognitions,
gendered language

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.030
appears to affect children's
affect, their interests,

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.640
and their behavior.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.170
As noted earlier, the
psychological salience

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.570
of gender induced
by labels leads

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.730
children to categorize
themselves into gender in-group

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.660
and gender out-groups,
triggering strong preferences

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.850
for same gender peers.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.370
For example, children who
have acquired an understanding

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.650
of the words "boy" and "girl"
spend more time playing

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.270
with same gender
peers than do children

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.480
without such knowledge.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.450
Furthermore, experimental
manipulations

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.480
of the degree to which gender
is labeled, for example,

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.470
by preschool teachers
in a classroom

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.840
shows causal effects on those
preschoolers' peer relations,

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.280
with children showing
declines in play

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.620
with cross-gender peers when
their preschool teachers label

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.680
gender, as in, "Good
morning, boys and girls."

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.080
Many additional studies
show that gendered labeling

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.230
affects children and
adults' personal preferences

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.900
and behavior.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.610
Finally, additional
evidence for the role

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.890
of category labeling in
producing stereotypes

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.960
and prejudice comes from
studies of novel categories.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.030
In my own long line of
25 years of research,

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.300
I place children in novel
social groups, often

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.960
red and blue groups, and
manipulate the characteristics

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.230
of the environment over as
many as two months of school.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:25.190
What I find in our line
of work is that when

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.349
teachers label the novel groups
saying, "Good morning, reds

00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:30.390
and blues" and, "Blues,
line up" and, "Let's have

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.210
a blue bulletin board and
a red bulletin board,"

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.930
children become biased on the
basis of group membership.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.020
When, on the other
hand, teachers

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.050
ignore those group differences,
even though they're

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.570
highly perceptually
salient, children

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.250
do not develop biases at all.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.610
To sum up, consistent
with the principle

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.320
of linguistic relativity,
gendered language

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.520
has been shown to
influence individuals'

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.030
gender-related cognitions,
affect, and behavior.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.590
Specifically, the use
of gendered language

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.930
appears to cause children
to attend to gender,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.770
categorize themselves
and others by gender,

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.120
and believe that the
members of gender

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.600
share deep, meaningful,
important similarities.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.940
In addition, the
use of gender labels

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.360
leads children to construct and
learn stereotypes about gender

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.080
and show in-group favoritism.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.030
OK.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.960
Because the use
of gendered labels

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:33.690
appears to precipitate a
cascading sequence of gender

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.870
salience, categorization,
stereotyping, and prejudice,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.040
some individuals have
called for the elimination

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.890
of the routine and
non-purposeful use of gender

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.720
labels.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.950
Teachers, for
example, could refrain

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.750
from using gender
to label children

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.760
and organize their classrooms.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.780
Imagine, for example, that a
teacher greeted his students

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.550
with the phrase, "Good
morning, blacks and Latinos.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.010
Let's have the white
children get their pencils.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:03.190
Could we sit white, Latino,
white, Latino today?"

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:09.910
That, in fact, violates federal
law, and for good reason.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.420
I would like to see similar
laws prohibit the use of gender

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.050
to routinely label
and organize children

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.720
in educational settings.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.434
I'm looking for a lawyer
who wants to do that.

00:40:21.434 --> 00:40:22.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.780
Consistent with this
idea, US colleges

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.260
have instituted policies, some
that minimize gender labeling

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.510
and classification,
including the creation

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.860
of all-gender dorms and
all-gender bathrooms.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.090
Oberlin College, for example,
my alma mater, uses an E system.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.980
Bathrooms are marked with
a default E for Everyone,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.660
but that E can be
rotated to temporarily

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:49.350
make it W for Women and
M for Men. [LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:54.520
This solution, like
others, including this one,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:59.360
are insufficient in my view,
however, because they continue

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.060
to make gender
salient to children

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.700
and use gender as a
basis for classification.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.418
My ideal marking of bathrooms
would be something like this.

00:41:09.418 --> 00:41:10.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.520
Although it is
possible for speakers

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.880
to avoid gendered
nouns, this is not

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.830
possible with English pronouns.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.930
The absence of gender
neutral pronouns

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.550
is problematic for many reasons,
but among them is the work

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.070
that I just described.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.760
Empirical evidence suggests that
gendered language causes sexist

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.470
thought.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.860
To address this problem,
an increasing number

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.520
of speakers and
writers are using

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.230
new gender neutral pronouns
such as "ze" and "hir,"

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.300
just one of several
possible conventions.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.920
Indeed, in the last year, I
have come to refer to myself

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.550
and request that
others refer to me

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.190
using gender neutral pronouns.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.110
The request derives
from my conviction

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.200
that altering linguistic
input to youth, including

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.660
the elimination of
routine gender labeling

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.260
and the introduction of
gender neutral pronouns,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.200
is an essential
component of efforts

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.250
to prevent gender stereotyping
and prejudice in children.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.030
Indeed, I would argue
that it is a necessary,

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:14.670
albeit not sufficient, component
of preventing and reducing

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.730
stereotyping in children.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.240
It is my hope and belief
that freeing children

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.720
from proscriptive and
prescriptive labels and beliefs

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.290
about gender will lead them to
lead happier, more fulfilling,

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.872
and more productive lives.

00:42:30.872 --> 00:42:31.372
Thank you.

00:42:31.372 --> 00:42:35.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:42.790
-Thank you so much.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.510
We're going to hear from
everybody individually

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.320
before we have an exchange.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.070
Wesley Thomas?

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.060
-[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.480
Good morning.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:11.770
When we greet and
address an audience,

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:19.140
we generally go beyond who
is visually in our visions.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.370
We greet to the
middle of the universe

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:29.390
and to the middle of the
earth, to all points.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.450
We sing greetings to all
living things in between when

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.630
we use our language.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.420
And our language is
considered powerful.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.190
We construct our
reality with our words.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.860
So it's really shunned
on if you insult somebody

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.950
because you're
literally telling them

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:56.330
where to go, for an example, and
there's repercussion to that.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:01.140
And so language and
words are very important.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.240
What you're saying
is what you really

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.520
mean because you took the time
to conjure up that thought.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.920
So thought and enacting it,
you present it in speech.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.780
And there, you
construct the reality

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.400
of what's going to happen,
what's going to take place,

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.740
and how you greet
people outside of you.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.750
One of the works that I've
been doing for quite a while,

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:35.670
probably similar to
Rebecca, about 25, 30 years,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.220
one point when I got
into graduate school,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.490
I had to go back
to, I guess, called

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:47.060
ground zero to look at the
evolution of our creation

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.930
stories.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:56.260
We have creation stories that
provide us the guidance of how

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.070
to live your life.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.700
So it all goes back
to the creation story.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.190
If there's a question, we always
go back to the creation story

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.830
because that's the
ones that establish

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.290
all the rules of how to live.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:19.020
In that, also, is
gender identity.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.860
How did gender evolve?

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.190
And I had to go back
to the creation story.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.570
And in that, I was
not a medicine person.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.455
Within the many tribes
through the United States,

00:45:33.455 --> 00:45:36.960
there are very few
and selected people

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.440
who serve as medicine people
with their particular tribes.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.880
By the way, there's
about 557 tribes

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.730
in the United States recognized
by the federal government.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.490
An additional 300-plus
is not recognized

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.240
by the federal government
because they either

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.290
had a very low number or
they lost their language.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:00.290
So language becoming
a very critical part

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.530
in Native communities,
that you actually

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:07.220
have to speak it to
not be eliminated

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.880
as a federal government
in the United States.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.180
So there's about 150 that
are in that gray area.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:20.060
Out of that 557, I would
estimate probably 120 of them

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.662
still have access
to the language.

00:46:23.662 --> 00:46:27.300
Of those, that particular
group, about 25% of them

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.300
have direct connection
to the language,

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.850
but not necessarily
speak it fluently.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.020
I'd say probably less
than 10 of the tribes

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.690
in the United States are
fluent in the language

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.880
and you still hear
that in their homes.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.720
So it's a very, very
small percentage.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:49.650
So language plays a huge role
in maintaining their status

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.150
under the US government.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.040
So in my work, I was
very curious about gender

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.210
because when I was
about five years old,

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.160
my father-- we'd go to one
of the winter ceremonies.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.290
And these men and women are
dancing outside in the winter

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:05.489
and it's snowing.

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:07.780
And he said, you need to
watch that because, as I said,

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.420
when you grow up, you have to
dance in that particular dance

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.810
that they're doing.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.900
And I was very
curious as to, why me?

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.140
What about my cousins?

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.360
What about my neighbors?

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.620
How come they can't do that?

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.180
And he basically told me
'cause you're born into it.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.750
That is part of your individual
heritage, that you do that.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:36.000
And in those dances,
there's obviously,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.693
men dancing, males dancing.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.560
There's a representation
of female.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.150
And these were not females.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:50.930
These were men dressed
in women's clothing,

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:53.100
and very feminine.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.624
And I just had a
passing and seeing that

00:47:56.624 --> 00:47:58.040
and then I've never
really thought

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.290
about it until later
on why is they're

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.060
representing the women in it?

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:12.100
And in my own studies, I was
looking at religion worldwide

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.829
and I've noticed that most
of them are male dominated.

00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:17.870
Just look at the Vatican.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.290
In our own tribe, women cannot
be part of the ceremonies

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:33.440
because women have natural
power which supersedes man-made

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.930
ceremonies, man-made religion.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.902
Women have natural powers
through their menstruation.

00:48:39.902 --> 00:48:41.360
So in a lot of
writings, they would

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.640
say that women are isolated
or that it's considered bad

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.620
or-- women were isolated
in tribal communities

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.410
because of the natural
power they possess.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.010
They would undo ceremonies.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.160
So there was a big
separation there.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:02.600
And in that are what are
called now the third gender,

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:10.220
are people who are born as
male, but switched or clearly

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:16.600
define their feminine
side and evolve and live

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.220
the life of girls and
emerge into womanhood

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.810
and live their lives as women.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.650
So these are the ones
I call third gender.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:29.970
And we also have female
children, female babies,

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.010
who function in the
role of boys and men.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.695
Those are the fourth gender.

00:49:34.695 --> 00:49:37.630
I had to create distinctly
those four to make

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.990
sense of what was going on.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:45.270
And this is all from a
traditional Navajo perspective.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.820
This is something that
is obviously there

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.440
through their eyes.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.970
And we're not even entertaining
a Western construct.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:59.210
And that's coming
later in my work.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:04.830
In this, I was looking at,
why do traditional people view

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:07.650
this as a third gender?

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.130
And my work also began looking
at some of the works being done

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.636
by anthropologists,
sociologists,

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:17.940
about the continuum of culture.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.140
My grandmother, my
great-grandmother,

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.150
all of those
people, are-- today,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.600
I would consider them
traditional people.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.240
My mother, she has access
to all of modern technology.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.000
She understands English,
but doesn't speak it.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.660
And so I'd classify her
as being a transitional.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.440
She is in the transition
in having access

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.020
to a lot of things from
the Western culture.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.310
And I can't fit into
those two categories.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:53.480
Because traditionals don't
leave the reservation.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.130
They're monolingual.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.750
They're completely rooted into
the traditional ceremonies.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.740
And the transitionals are
a little bit flexible,

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.980
meaning they can
leave the reservation

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.480
and feel comfortable
outside for a while,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.090
but they're quite
insistent in the afternoon,

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:10.730
they need to return
to the reservation.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.000
They need to go home.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.830
They're really reluctant to
spend a night away from home

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.516
because home is essential.

00:51:18.516 --> 00:51:19.140
It's important.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.950
Everything there is important.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.310
I'm in a contemporary category.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:25.490
That's the third one.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.700
My Western education yanked
me into that category.

00:51:30.798 --> 00:51:34.010
And being bilingual
in the language

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.830
and bicultural, live in
both of them, one at a time,

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:40.270
not at the same time,
I think that creates

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:43.190
a lot of confusion where you
try to live both of them.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.820
And then the fourth
category I've come up with

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.157
is-- I call them acculturated.

00:51:47.157 --> 00:51:48.990
They're in the process
of being acculturated

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.260
into mainstream America.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.160
And then the last one, the
fifth one, assimilated.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.930
They've completely assimilated.

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.395
This is just one particular
tribe, that's my tribe.

00:51:57.395 --> 00:52:03.230
The Navajo name is a name
given to us by the Spaniards.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.730
We don't mostly call ourselves--
if you really ask somebody

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.660
on the reservation what tribe
are you, they would say Dine.

00:52:12.606 --> 00:52:16.280
I'm Dine-- I'm of the people.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.500
"Navajo" is a colonial term.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.880
Then we generally don't go and
say oh, I'm American Indian

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.070
or I'm Native American
or Indigenous.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.170
Those are just lumping
people together.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.041
In this identity issue,
some of my students--

00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:38.790
when I was teaching
at Indiana University,

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.890
it was a really a good
example of my students.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.390
They would say, are
you American Indian?

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:49.270
I would say yes because that
means there's less to explain.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:52.058
If I say I'm Dine, they
have no concept with it.

00:52:52.058 --> 00:52:56.900
Then I have to go into this long
spiel of explaining to them.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.290
So you have to pick and choose.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:03.670
So in a way, I think that's
called a situational identity.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.050
We have that one
[? quite ?] there.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.000
In that continuum, one
gender I focused on

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.950
was the third gender.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.590
In Navajo, that's called
Natlee, N-A-T-L-E-E.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:23.810
If you look at that up there,
besides, you see "self."

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.100
To the left of it,
it says "Natlee."

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.920
There's a high tone marker
over the A. That's Natlee.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.560
It basically means, in
Navajo language or Dine

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:38.630
language, that one who's in
a constant state of change.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.489
You don't know when
the change began.

00:53:40.489 --> 00:53:42.030
You don't know when
it's going to end

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.505
or is it ever going to end.

00:53:43.505 --> 00:53:45.930
It's in that constant
state of change.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.010
That's the third gender.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:57.725
And this particular talk is from
one of the more recent writings

00:53:57.725 --> 00:53:58.350
that I'm doing.

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:01.610
It's called "Development
and Evolution of Dine Third

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:05.670
Gender," information from that.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:12.990
I was looking at we now have the
more modernized third gender.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:18.090
The Natlee was the
traditional third gender,

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:25.530
but the TGs, transgenders, are
reinventing themselves, are

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.140
rehashing some of
the terminologies

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.970
that we had in the language
and beginning to use that.

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.590
That's one of the
same reasons why

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:39.400
on a broader scale in North
America and South America,

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.400
we're going to need to use to
utilize the term two-spirit.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:49.310
Two-spirit is-- how
did that get created?

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:55.290
In the '50s,
there's a major push

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:59.690
to put Native
childrens in school.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.660
So they were taken to
boarding schools, some of them

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.010
literally kidnapped from
whatever they were doing

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.730
and put in boarding schools.

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.710
Then there are those
who are voluntarily

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:15.280
leaving the reservation in the
1960s because of the mandate

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.540
that all children need to be
in schools and some of them

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.050
didn't want to or some of them
prefer not to be in school.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:28.130
So people who would have
lived a life of Natlee

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:31.220
within my reservation--
and each of the tribes

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.140
in the United States
have their own term

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.700
for third and fourth gender.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.440
There's some more work that
was done by Will Roscoe

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.337
in collecting terminology.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.710
Like, for example,
the tribe south of us

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:52.331
is the Zuni Pueblo, the third
gender there is called Lhamana.

00:55:52.331 --> 00:55:58.150
There's some major writings done
by Will Roscoe which is called

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:04.824
We'wha came to Washington,
DC and went to the ball there

00:56:04.824 --> 00:56:10.020
and assumed she was a real woman
until later on, they found out.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.280
And she did some
exhibition there.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.450
And she fell into the
third gender category.

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:26.120
Because gender supersedes
your sexual identity.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.060
What you do as a
man or a woman is

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:33.840
more important than
your biological makeup.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.890
Because your mind
and your spirit,

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:40.350
the mental aspect
of you, is more

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:45.290
important than biologically
of what you're made of

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:48.610
and traditional
categories, that they

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:53.450
see-- if you are
comfortable as a girl,

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.850
there was permission
within tribes, especially

00:56:56.850 --> 00:57:02.290
tribes that were matrilineal,
that the women were

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:05.970
the heads of household, that
the whole tribe was operating

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:09.620
under the women's
rules, then patrilineal.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.860
Patrilineal, there was
a lot of confrontation.

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.720
So there's very few
third and fourth gender

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.580
in the patrilineal
tribal societies.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.520
These were warring
tribes of the past.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:28.430
I was just in San
Francisco two weeks ago.

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.490
They had a big gathering of--
it's called the International

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.060
Two-Spirit Powwow.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.790
So it's a lot of
dancing, powwow dancing,

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:41.720
cross dressing powwows.

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.070
There was Miss
International Two-Spirit,

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:47.903
who was from
Shoshone-Bannock of Idaho.

00:57:47.903 --> 00:57:52.350
And I think the ceremony
takes place in Canada.

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:54.316
I'm not sure where.

00:57:54.316 --> 00:57:55.630
But people like that.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.560
That was really fascinating to
see people in transition who

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:05.420
are just having their bodies
changed, breast removals, that

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:13.260
were seen as men with
what do you call those?

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.880
[NON-ENGLISH] It'll come to me.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.510
The English word
will come pretty soon

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.651
so we'll wait for it.

00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.593
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:23.984 --> 00:58:26.400
That's one of the other things
that's really a huge issue,

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.660
is this whole
translation thing, trying

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:32.070
to explain things while
thinking in Navajo

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:35.420
and speaking in English.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.080
And a lot of things
that we do now,

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.670
we really depend on writing.

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.370
Because I was looking at
our language to see why

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:49.630
are this present generation
not speaking the language?

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.310
Why are Native people
living on the reservation,

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:56.790
hearing the language and having
direct access to the language,

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:58.870
but not speak it?

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.460
So I took a handful of students
and made them my Guinea pigs

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:05.020
for a whole semester and just
talked to them, one on one

00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:09.400
and as a group, with
no text, no writing.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:14.250
The major problem was
they could not remember.

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:18.190
Their memorization skills
have completely escaped.

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:22.400
And I think that's really been
harmed by that with writing,

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.720
because every time
we hear something,

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.620
we don't let it go up.

00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:29.690
We let it come through
our hands and take a note.

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:32.840
And we become
dependent on writing.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.470
It's a crutch for us.

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:38.690
That's why we don't
remember things.

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:42.002
If you have a conversation
with your grandmother

00:59:42.002 --> 00:59:43.460
or great-grandmother,
they remember

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.130
things and dates and
times when things

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:49.440
happen because they had
their memory skills,

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.960
and not necessarily
today's people.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:59.460
So there's really a lot
more to look into and talk

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.090
about Navajo third gender.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:07.500
And this is not even dabbling
with current terminology

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.020
of gay/lesbian.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.700
Those are Western identity.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.830
Those are not traditional
Native identities.

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:16.560
We don't necessarily
identify with that.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.740
So for an example, when
I'm on the reservation

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.550
and dancing the wintertime
in women's clothing,

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.320
I'm considered Natlee.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.890
And then when I'm in
Native communities,

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.710
I'm considered two-spirit.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.690
I don't identify myself as that.

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.000
People have labeled
me with that.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.270
And then when I'm off the
reservation, flying here,

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:42.010
being in Boston, I'd
probably label as being gay.

01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:48.180
So that's your perception of
who I am, and it's not who I am.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.470
So it just depends.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:59.294
I have to react to
my location and make

01:00:59.294 --> 01:01:00.710
it a little
comfortable for people

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.090
around me and for myself.

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.770
And then when I change
audience, like when

01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:06.480
I go back to the
reservation, then it's

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.940
a totally different one.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.900
-Thank you.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.650
I hope we'll get--

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:10.220
-[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.180
-There's so much more I
hope we can get back to

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.450
during the question period.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.830
I want to be sure that all three
of our speakers have the time

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.090
that we need.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:18.590
Bear?

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:20.458
-I was at that powwow, too.

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:21.392
That's so funny.

01:01:21.392 --> 01:01:22.793
I was just there two weeks ago.

01:01:22.793 --> 01:01:24.670
-Mm-hmm.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:25.490
-Good morning.

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:26.430
-Good morning.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.190
-Oh, I love that.

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.510
Thank you very much.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.750
Really, I'm a storyteller
and not an academic.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.170
And when I say "good morning"
at academic conferences

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:36.480
and everyone looks
at me like, I always

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.646
feel a little uncomfortable.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.200
I'm so excited about
everything that I've already

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.950
heard that I just really want to
spend my time talking about all

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:49.310
of it, but I'm going to do the
other thing instead and get

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.210
to that later.

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:55.800
In the fall of 1993, I
got into my first argument

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.680
with a university professor
about the validity

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.640
of gender nonspecific pronouns.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.280
It was the first
of what would prove

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.810
to be many such arguments
in the fullness of time.

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:14.280
Freshly emboldened by the smarty
pantses with whom I spent hour

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.170
upon hour chatting on
the proto internet,

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:22.070
I explained to my professor
that, in actual fact,

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.890
there was nothing
grammatically incorrect at all

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:28.890
about the use of
these tiny words.

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:32.820
I smugly recited
stanzas of Chaucer

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.840
to prove the pedigree
of the word "hir"

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.040
and then I held my head up and
praised the activists of Usenet

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.510
who had invented the
word "ze" to go with it.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.720
Finally, I offered up
my cloth-bound Rutledge

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.235
imprinted copy of Gender
Outlaw by Kate Bornstein,

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:56.670
[APPLAUSE] sprinkled with
gender nonspecific pronouns

01:02:56.670 --> 01:03:00.140
that I hoped to validate
by their obviously

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:06.400
serious serif type, and my
identity right along with them.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.270
My professor, a second
wave lesbian feminist

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:14.410
in linen separates,
shook her head slowly.

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.034
You know who I mean, right?

01:03:16.034 --> 01:03:20.350
[LAUGHTER] Those
are not words, she

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:25.500
said and, wrinkling her
nose in evident distaste,

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.390
followed her pronouncement
with another one,

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.840
and that is not a woman.

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:36.180
Two things struck
me in the exchange

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.620
and they continued to
reverberate for decades.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.590
One, that this professor
arrogated to herself the right

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.450
to decide whether a
word was real or not.

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:49.540
And two, that she
obviously felt this power

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:54.330
extended to my gender identity
and that of many other people.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.840
The rejection of the word
stood in for the rejection

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.400
of the concept, and
me in particular.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.770
Now, while I enjoy a little bit
of dictionary fetishism as much

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:10.670
as the next writer, her
pronouncement and the judgment

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:15.650
it contained were obviously
not about the words themselves,

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.530
but about her disapproval
of the idea and, indeed,

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.540
the people they described,
underlined by her choice

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:27.820
to disdain both the words with
which Bornstein made it clear

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:32.500
that "ze" did not consider
herself a woman and also hir

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.370
[? gendered ?]
[? presentation-- ?] grandly

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:39.880
Goth-infused, high femme
situation we've all come

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.770
to love.

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:46.770
People who experience themselves
as neither men nor women

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:51.500
or some combination thereof?

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.670
Absolutely not, she said.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.680
And she put her sensible
Dansko clog down

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.020
firmly on the subject.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.530
22 years later, the
Oxford English Dictionary

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.860
announced that it had included
gender nonspecific pronouns

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.660
and honorifics, including
the singular "they"

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.900
to their volumes.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.770
And when I finished happy
dancing around the kitchen,

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:16.110
I indulged at
length in a fantasy

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.110
in which I could buy,
carefully highlight, and then

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:23.540
mail several hundred volumes
to university professors

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.540
around the world, marking the
page with an engraved card

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:32.050
reading only "neener,
neener, neener." [LAUGHTER]

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:36.350
For two decades, I campaigned
on behalf of the words "ze"

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:40.400
and "hir" with varying
degrees of success.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.580
I used them as my
personal pronouns

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.070
and I insisted that
people use them

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:49.290
for me in professional contexts,
which meant negotiating that

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:55.020
whoever introduced my talk had
to read them out loud in front

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.820
of other people and then I
had to listen to the speaker

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.730
make a tremendous performance
about how uncomfortable

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.600
those words were
in their mouths.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.850
I pressed newspaper and
periodical writers and editors

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:14.140
to use them in articles about
me with even less success.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.640
I wrote entire books using
gender nonspecific pronouns.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.370
And after going ten
rounds with my publisher

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:24.250
that yes, they really
were real words

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.430
and I really did have
the right to use them,

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.450
fully half the reviews
my books received

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.550
acknowledged that I
preferred "invented" pronouns

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:37.360
or "neologisms"
and then proceeded

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.520
to ignore them and use either
a masculine or feminine pronoun

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.560
set for me.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.130
I was never able to determine
how they chose which.

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:50.910
I think someone in a back
office was just flipping a coin.

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.470
Their choice was recently
unpleasantly echoed

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:57.150
in a stunningly
dismissive New York Times

01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:01.430
article about Sasha Fleischman
of Oakland, California,

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:03.560
a genderqueer
identified teenager

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.900
who was set on fire
while riding a city bus.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.080
Evidently not content to
let the physical violence

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.940
stand on its own, the
Gray Lady perpetrated

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:20.800
its own linguistic violence with
the following parenthetical.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.900
"Telling Sasha's story also
poses a linguistic challenge

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.340
because English doesn't
offer a ready-made way

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.290
to talk about
people who identify

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.290
as neither male or female.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:36.890
Sasha prefers 'they,' 'it,'
or the invented gender neutral

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:41.190
pronouns 'ze.' The New York
Times does not use these terms

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.990
to refer to individuals."

01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.560
-Yet.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.170
-Let that sink in.

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:47.070
-Yeah.

01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:47.570
Yeah.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.840
-In her book
Epistemic Injustice,

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.500
British philosopher
Miranda Fricker

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.630
describes two particular
kinds of oppression related

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.960
to knowledge and language.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:02.970
One, she terms "testimonial
injustice," which she describes

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:05.850
as the occasion
upon which prejudice

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:08.770
causes a person to
be perceived as less

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:13.480
credible or non-credible in
their capacity as an informant.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.250
The other is
"hermeneutical injustice,"

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.710
where a person has no way
to describe their experience

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:23.000
because the conceptual
frame doesn't yet

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.300
exist due to their stigmatized
or disempowered identity.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.830
And when I read her
book, I actually

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:32.960
yelped in recognition
of the experience

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.120
so robustly described.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.410
And making matters
worse, by the way,

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:42.300
it's not just the suspender
professors and copyeditors

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.189
of the world who have fought
me on every instance of gender

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.060
nonspecific pronouns.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.930
There are plenty of
transgender identified

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.910
people who rail
against the non-binary

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:56.200
with just as much vigor.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.200
Their conviction, frequently
offered at some volume,

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.490
is that the idea of
non-binary gender

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:07.540
cheapens and distracts
from their experience,

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.180
that it's all right to move
from the known and identified

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.450
category of man to the known
and identified category of woman

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:20.740
or vice versa, but not to say
that the categories are flawed,

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.779
optional, or even discussable.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:26.290
Though these people may
have trans identities

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:30.370
or trans medical histories,
their relationship to gender

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.020
is heteronormative and binary.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.790
There are two choices,
world without end, amen.

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:40.720
And this too, I would argue,
is a matter of language

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.880
as much as it is
of anything else.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.580
In Fricker's
parlance, trans people

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.550
suffer a hermeneutical
injustice and non-binary people

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.310
suffer it doubly.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.180
The cultural
imagination about anyone

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.470
who is not normatively gendered,
trans bodies, identities,

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:04.050
relationships, sex, geography,
conflict, priorities,

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:08.620
is substantially influenced
by what we can write and talk

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:10.580
about intelligibly.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.760
Since the modern conversation
about gender identity

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.060
is so heavily medicalized, with
brief and chilling digressions

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.830
into legal
terminology, so too are

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:25.190
most of the words that
we have for ourselves

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:28.650
and each other,
medical or legal legacy

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:32.770
words designed to
reinforce the normal

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.670
and shine the cold light
of inquiry on the other.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:42.060
We have no playful language,
no admiring language,

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.740
no nuanced language, and
no affirming language.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.700
Instead, we're stuck with
obviously false dichotomies

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.650
like "pre-op" and "post-op,"
which have led the entirety

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.900
of cisgender humanity
into the beliefs that A,

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:02.230
all transgender experience
is defined in relationship

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:06.300
to surgical procedures that
have existed for about 75 years,

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.340
even though trans people have
existed for millennia and I can

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:14.660
prove that, and B, that there's
some sort of single opportunity

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:19.340
trans medical intervention
somewhat akin to the television

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:25.050
show Pimp My Ride where we
enter looking one way and emerge

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:28.900
entirely different and perhaps
with some things chromed.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:35.230
What's more, the
process of moving away

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.300
from medicalized
language, which is

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.670
full of terrible
assumptions and worse ideas,

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.860
but has the virtue of being
somewhat familiar even

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.860
to people who are
distant from the topic,

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.330
is messy and contested.

01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:54.110
There is no trans equivalent
of the Academie francaise

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.480
where a group of
people meet, discuss,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.440
and decide which new
words are actually words

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.280
and what they might mean.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.830
This leads to internal
conflict and heated debate

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:08.540
among trans and
non-binary people

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.540
about what words
are best to use.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.450
And because those debates
are entirely decentralized,

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:19.390
unless you count
Tumblr, you could well

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:22.460
find yourself using a word
that you learned in Chicago

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.490
as respectful only to be
told in Atlanta that you're

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:28.620
using oppressive
language and get out.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:33.480
As an educator, I spend a
lot of time explaining this,

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.610
that trans communities
have just now come

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:41.640
to a place where we have the
cultural agency, finally,

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.270
to explain and describe
our own experience using

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:48.790
our own language,
and that while this

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:52.170
is a messy and
inconsistent process,

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:56.630
it's also a pivotal,
and frankly thrilling,

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:59.910
moment in identity development.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:03.580
I have some sympathy for
well-meaning non-trans people

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.940
who desperately want
to get the lingo

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.090
right as an act of ally-ship,
but it's too important

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:13.430
and too exciting to rush.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:16.560
If we're going to eventually
be able to describe

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.080
the specific, delicious,
nuanced particulars

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.860
of our non-normative bodies
and experiences and identities,

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.520
it's going to take some time.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:36.760
This is true even though the
larger cultural imagination,

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:42.940
with its limited and limiting
understanding of trans

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.770
and non-binary
experiences, can't

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:49.110
fathom what we might be
taking our time about

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.040
or why it could be so important.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.580
Most people, especially
the able-bodied,

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.160
have rarely or never
had the experience

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.720
of having a bodily
experience for which they

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.090
have no word or no word
that they can stand to use.

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:10.270
The frequent
exception to this rule

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:13.170
turns out to be masturbation.

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:16.380
The mental blank spot first
gets filled with a placeholder,

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.830
like "this" or "that,"
and then maybe it

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:25.390
evolves to a shorthand
codeword akin to a private joke

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:30.840
with oneself or like the kind
of idiolects that married people

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.880
inevitably develop over time.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.010
But eventually,
sometimes the moment

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:41.340
arrives in which we hear
a word for the very thing

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.990
and we see ourselves
reflected in it.

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:47.190
As a non-binary
identified person,

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:51.290
this was also my experience of
gender nonspecific pronouns.

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:55.970
The jolt of understanding,
the dawning clarity

01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:00.180
of why I had shifted with
discomfort when people

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:05.160
used feminine pronouns about
me, but had no special desire

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.230
to run into the warm embrace
of masculine language,

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:14.490
all but reset my
skeleton in my skin.

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:17.830
Certainly, it shuffled
the deck of my locution

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:21.120
and dealt me a hand I had
never previously understood

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.880
to be a winner.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.040
Where non-binary
identities are concerned,

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.180
the hermeneutical
injustice that applied

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:32.010
to transpeople 20-odd
years ago still

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.260
rages even though
trans identities

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.070
have seen some progress.

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:40.450
For non-binary identified or,
to use my current favorite term,

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.710
NB people, this is
magnified by the fact

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:46.420
that while most of
everyone, except Germaine

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.860
Greer and Donald Trump,
are prepared to recognize

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:53.640
that transpeople do
indeed exist these days,

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.130
the NB population is
still struggling up

01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:58.240
the hill with our
glitter in one hand

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.240
and our neckties in the other.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.530
These days, I deploy
the word "NB,"

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:09.350
which is just a pronunciation of
the initials NB for non-binary,

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:11.530
with casual authority.

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:15.420
I neither explain nor
describe it unless asked.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.840
My part in the evolution of
language around NB topics

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.170
and identities is
that I no longer

01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:24.480
engage in the kind of debates I
used to about whether something

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.400
is or is not a word.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.040
I know better now.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.940
Of course it's a
word, I tell them,

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.910
just like "laser" and
"radar" are words,

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:36.710
just like we used to fax
things and now we Google them.

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.596
I try not to even
mansplain about it.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.090
But I'm wise to the
tactic now, this thing

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:48.540
of pretending to have some
kind of high-minded linguistic

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:52.640
objection to a new concept or
idea being expressed in order

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.580
to conceal a prejudice.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:57.800
I've experienced enough
epistemic injustice

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.250
to name it and
stand up for myself

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.240
and people like me as
a legitimate expert

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.160
in my own identity.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.630
With the cultural power
I have concentrated

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:10.510
as a public intellectual,
a cultural worker,

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:14.390
and let us not forget,
now, a white guy, I

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.380
have become stalwart
in my assertions

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.420
that people are and
can be trusted to be,

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.290
in the words of educator
J. Wallace Skelton,

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.740
experts on themselves.

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.670
The smokescreen of being
challenged about words

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:30.140
has given way.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.680
And it develops that people
are much more hesitant

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.580
about saying, I think your
identity is invalid because it

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:39.390
challenges my beliefs
about the world

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:44.840
than they ever were about
saying, that's not a real word.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.162
Go figure.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.370
I just need two more minutes.

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:48.870
-Yeah.

01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:52.080
-This becomes especially
clear when an NB person uses

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.270
the singular "they"
pronoun and suddenly, there

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.880
emerge strenuous
objections to it

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.910
from people who consistently
misuse "lie" for "lay"

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.350
and whose entire previous
commitment to grammar

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:06.730
expired sometime around
the end of sentence

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:09.750
diagramming in grade 10.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.580
It would be funnier
if it weren't

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.590
so exhausting and demoralizing.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:19.880
In the 22 years between when
I started agitating on behalf

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.350
of gender nonspecific pronouns
and when the OED joined

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:26.540
the English language already
in progress about gender

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:30.430
nonspecific pronouns, anointing
them, along with the gender

01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:33.820
nonspecific honorific
"Mx" and the word

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.980
"cisgender," there has certainly
been some progress in language.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.230
The cisgender imagination,
especially that of gatekeepers

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:46.470
of law, medicine, and language
whose imprimatur so many

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:50.070
things have previously
required, is expanding,

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:52.610
and with it must
go the language.

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:56.660
Even the word "cisgender,"
a word created and deployed

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.440
by trans and NB
people, now takes

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.890
a fairly unchallenged place in
academia, at least, though it

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:06.510
apparently upsets a
certain subset of people

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:09.940
whose gender privilege is
so entrenched that they fuss

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.330
and kick at being
named with a word

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.620
that they didn't coin or
choose, to whom I say, welcome.

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.000
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.840
-Yeah.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.700
-I begin to wonder, at this
point, what will happen next.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.920
Will the reality
of our lives become

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.530
so present and incontrovertible
on the landscape of gender

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:34.470
that refusal to use
our words will become

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:37.190
the last refuge of the bigot?

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:40.460
Will there be a backlash
against identity politics

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:43.150
that causes cis people
to insist that they don't

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:46.280
see gender and
therefore have no need

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.700
to grapple with it anymore?

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:54.410
How will we form systems, forms,
data, and codexes of language

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:57.460
to capture the nuances
of gender identity,

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.860
and what new points
of linguistic friction

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.900
will each of those solutions
inevitably produce?

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:08.750
Even for cisgender folks,
this is an exciting time.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:10.930
My friend Scott
Turner Schofield who

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:14.490
used to be a performance artist
and is now a soap opera actor,

01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:19.380
which he claims is a lateral
move if ever there was one,

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.840
tells a story I
have long enjoyed--

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.470
I got it-- tells
a story I've long

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:27.680
enjoyed about needing a
particular tool while traveling

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.970
in Costa Rica.

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:31.500
He had no idea what it
was called in Spanish

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.650
and so he went to the
hardware store intending

01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:37.710
to browse the available items
and choose the thing he needed.

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.260
But when he arrived,
he discovered

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.280
that the store was more or
less a kiosk and all the tools

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.170
were kept in the back
so a shopper was forced

01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:47.560
to ask for the thing
they wanted and wait

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.350
for it to be fetched back.

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:51.950
Scott, stumped by
this turn of events,

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:54.654
produced in his limited
Spanish the following request

01:20:54.654 --> 01:20:55.445
[SPEAKING SPANISH].

01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:05.470
"I need the tool with the head
that's shaped like a church."

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:08.240
After some puzzlement,
the clerk laughed

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.930
and nodded and came back
with what he needed,

01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:13.890
a Phillips head screwdriver.

01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:16.650
This is exactly,
in so many ways,

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.510
where we find the
language of trans

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.760
and non-binary identities.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.730
Without knowing a word for
what we need, we approximate

01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:27.640
based on what we think
a conversation partner,

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.910
reader, lover, doctor,
or government official

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:34.150
might be familiar
with while we stand

01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:37.330
and wait wearing our most
cheerful and polite smiles

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:40.440
and hope that the person will
find themselves willing to do

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.500
the extra work to understand.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.400
In the hopeful future,
maybe the words

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.910
of nuanced
descriptive and tender

01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:53.060
gendered language will be real
in our mouths and on our pages.

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:57.080
But for now, we have to rely
on good will and creativity

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.030
to get the job done.

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:02.580
The good news is many of
us have a lot of both.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.410
Thank you.

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.875
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.230
-Thank you so much.

01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:14.230
Thank you for listening.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.780
Thank you to all three
of our panelists.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:20.490
And I think we're going
to go to maybe 12 or 13,

01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:23.550
instead of 15,
minutes for our talk

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:26.455
because I know a lot of you
have a lot of questions.

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.260
There we go.

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.830
For my first question, I
wanted to hear Rebecca talk

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:35.790
about this.

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:36.820
And I had two questions.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.710
You can answer one
or both, I guess.

01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:46.000
So the first is obviously, this
audience and other audiences

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.800
within linguistics
and social linguistics

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.700
seems to have been hospitable
to your discoveries and those

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.460
that you cite, but how do
preschool teachers react?

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.920
Have you gone to the
National Association

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.970
for Early Childhood
Education, also known

01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:02.510
as NAECTE-- if you have
preschool age children,

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:06.080
you may have heard of
it-- or other groups that

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.060
actually train teachers of
young children and said,

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.200
here's what you do, here's
what you've got to stop doing?

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.990
And how has that been?

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:17.040
And the other question
is, what's the endgame?

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.270
In a just world, in the
world that you want to see,

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:23.890
would you expect, based on
your own and others' research,

01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:29.070
groups of 5-year-olds,
8-year-olds, 12-year-olds who

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:35.080
simply ignore the history
of self-identification that

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.640
has some relation to
biological difference?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.050
Or would you expect gender
to be present in their play

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:43.150
and their language,
but differently?

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:45.400
What's the end game?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.050
-Yeah.

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:47.110
Wonderful questions.

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:52.410
And I do, indeed, do outreach
to teachers, the lay public.

01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:55.220
It's a huge part of
my identity and what

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.610
I think academics have
an obligation to do.

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:01.830
What I usually find
is that teachers

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:06.400
are very surprised that their
language affects children.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.184
So they mostly say, for
example, well, yes, I say,

01:24:10.184 --> 01:24:12.350
"Good morning, boys or
girls" and "What a cute girl"

01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:14.160
or "Let's sit boy,
girl, boy girl."

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.550
But I don't do it
to be sexist and I'm

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:20.280
pretty sure I'm not making
children endorse gender

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.970
stereotypes when I do that.

01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:24.550
They're just not aware of the
link between their language

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.720
and children's responses.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.090
And I will just briefly say my
worst moment was with an older

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:33.080
teacher, many years
of experience,

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.280
who every morning, she had the
children count how many girls

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.080
were present and put
up girl paper dolls

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.500
and count how many boys were
present and put up a boy.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.450
And I said that that
would contribute

01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:47.020
to stereotyping in the
classroom and boys saying,

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.260
we're better than
girls and girls--

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.800
and she said well, God
made them boys and girls

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.900
and I'm going to
label them that way

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.150
if I want to, to
which I said, yeah,

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.700
well, God made them
black and white

01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.610
and you don't label that label
in that way, do you, which

01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:06.070
led to me being just ostracized
and it was a terrible moment

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:08.140
with the school.

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.680
But I do find them
receptive to education.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.190
And particularly, pointing
out the parallels to race

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:16.520
has been affective
about routine labeling.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.020
Now, I want to get
to the end game

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.660
because I don't
think the answer is

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.910
to become what we have
done often with race,

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:25.750
to be race blind or
to be gender blind.

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.080
That is, I'm not arguing
that we should never

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.850
talk about gender or race
or other social categories.

01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:32.460
In fact, the opposite.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.920
I believe we have to
start having conversations

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.950
with even young children
about social categories,

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.970
what they mean, and
what they don't mean.

01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:40.650
-Yeah.

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:42.730
-The problem is children
have some real cognitive

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.330
limitations.

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:45.690
They are rigid classifiers.

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:48.740
They make things very black and
white-- good, bad; boy, girl;

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.150
mommies and daddies.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:53.110
And so once you
create the category

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:55.400
and they build and construct
their own stereotypes,

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.520
you're up against a big
wall, a lot of work.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.410
And I think this just means
that we have to, in schools,

01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:04.310
start having conversations
with children about gender,

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.820
why it's a category, why
it's sometimes relevant,

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.310
when it's not relevant, and
what gender stereotyping

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:13.580
and prejudice mean as
early as kindergarten.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.630
-Yeah.

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:15.130
Yeah.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.630
OK.

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:21.340
I have to follow up in one
way because it's something

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.543
I've seen as a parent.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.700
It seems to me, and
this is something

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.820
that I see as a parent with
my kids and other kids,

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:39.880
it is obviously OK and
we want to encourage it

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.560
if a child feels
like it for someone

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.680
who thinks he's a
boy to do girl things

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.760
and dress up like a girl,
and of course vice versa.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.560
And of course, some kids
feel like neither or both.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.220
And even if you
think you're a boy,

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:57.380
you can wear dresses and do
girl things and that's great.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.960
And we've had a lot of
support from the teachers

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.800
who we've been lucky
enough to experience.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.320
But why is it not OK, in
a lot of circumstances,

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.840
for white kids to pretend
to be Chinese or Apache?

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.100
Why is that not cool?

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:20.170
Do you get that with the very
salient comparison to race?

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:25.490
And how do you answer that to
a six-year-old or to a teacher?

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.990
-Yeah.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:28.370
Again, great
complicated questions,

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:30.850
which require
conversations with children

01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:34.270
about social categories and
what they mean and don't mean.

01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.350
I will say that in
the lessons we do,

01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:39.350
I develop lessons
about sexism that we

01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:42.480
do with kids from kindergarten
through fifth grade.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.950
And one of the
lessons is there's

01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:46.490
no such thing as a boy's blank.

01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:48.840
There's no such thing
as a girl's backpack,

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.520
shoes, hat, haircut, anything.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.220
And so part of the
lesson is saying

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.510
you don't say it's OK for
boys to do girls things.

01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:58.593
It's saying there's no
such thing as a girl thing.

01:27:58.593 --> 01:28:01.390
There are just things and
anybody can do anything.

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:04.990
But then you explain the idea
that some people do believe

01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:07.420
the "silly" idea that
there are girls' things,

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.800
and here's what to say.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.580
We teach children to
chant, "I disagree.

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:13.010
Sexism is silly to me."

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.510
-Aww.

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:16.890
-And they chant
that to each other.

01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:20.030
But then again, the
social categories

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:22.180
vary in their history
and their treatment.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:24.510
And what requires is
constant education,

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:27.670
then, about what is
offensive about white people

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:30.240
doing things that are
traditionally associated

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.530
with African American culture
or, as is common on campuses,

01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:37.970
seeing students pretending
to be blind for the day

01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:42.310
while they try to learn about
the experience of people

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:44.440
who are visually impaired.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.330
-Yeah.

01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:47.600
Thank you.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.350
So I was hoping, Wesley,
if you wanted to--

01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:55.240
and I understand that this
may be one of the things

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.250
where the right answer
would take too long,

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.210
but if the right
answer can be given,

01:29:01.210 --> 01:29:04.420
if you could talk
more either about

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:09.260
the differences among Native
American language groups

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.890
and cultures in terms of third
genders and fourth genders--

01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:14.820
you mentioned that
patrilineal language groups

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.810
and societies had much
less robust third gender

01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:20.740
and fourth gender
than matrilineal--

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:28.810
or, if you prefer, the concept
of sexuality, of categorizing

01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:33.060
yourself by who you're into
rather than who you are,

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.520
whether that has any
kind of parallels

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:46.480
in any of the First Peoples
language groups that you /

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.530
-In doing my research work using
my own language and my own home

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:56.380
community, one
aspect of it, I was

01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:00.950
looking at the third gender
in a traditional setting.

01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:04.760
By the way, the
traditional way of life

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.110
probably ended around 1930.

01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:15.940
Because by 1937, the
last living person

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:20.770
who I would have
identified as third gender,

01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:24.750
she died in February of 1937.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:30.080
And since then, there's been
sheltering and shielding

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.350
children within the
families because they've

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:37.310
begun being ostracized
through the various Christian

01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:41.990
organizations that were saving
the Indians on reservations

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:46.410
and of receiving a Western
education saying that doesn't

01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:48.870
meet the Western standards.

01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:52.110
So those people, some of them
were actually literally killed

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:54.940
because of that.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.330
In my work in looking
at the relationship

01:30:57.330 --> 01:31:01.060
of the third gender,
for an example,

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:06.730
it's a hetero gender,
meaning that the gender was

01:31:06.730 --> 01:31:09.550
a priority over their
sexual identity,

01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:12.550
and that between
the four genders

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:19.270
back then-- the first gender is
a woman because she reproduces.

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:23.570
The second gender is a
man who is a husband.

01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:26.040
Then the third
gender is basically

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.470
biologically male
function as a woman,

01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:30.540
so that's a third gender.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.570
So Gender identity
there was feminine.

01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:36.670
And the fourth one is
a masculine gender.

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:41.950
The relationship is between,
for an example, a first gender,

01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:44.900
is a woman, with
a fourth gender.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:49.360
First gender is feminine;
fourth gender is masculine.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.980
And the same thing with the men.

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.770
The second gender would
have a relationship

01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.560
with the third gender.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.820
So it's opposite genders there,
even though biologically,

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.170
they're the same.

01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:04.260
So that's one thing that
came out of this one.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.310
That was very normal,
I think, in a majority

01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:10.780
of the tribes in the
United States and Canada

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:17.260
because you hear stories
of where in larger warring

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:21.740
nations, they would
have a wife and they

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.540
would acquire a second wife.

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.890
And by that time, they
have a few children

01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:31.020
and they need somebody
who can provide

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.550
some economic stability.

01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:37.030
So they would marry a third
wife who was a third gender.

01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:39.580
Third gender is
attributed with wealth,

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.680
that they're the only
ones in most of the tribes

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.160
where they could
accumulate wealth.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.840
If you were not in the third
gender category or fourth

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.740
gender category, so if you
were the first or second one,

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:52.010
you cannot accumulate wealth.

01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:54.420
That's equivalent to greed.

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.920
When you acquire that,
you had to distribute that

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.790
to your siblings and to
their offsprings and even

01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:02.030
your own children.

01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:03.406
You do not acquire that.

01:33:03.406 --> 01:33:04.780
So third gender
and fourth gender

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.930
were the ones who could
be able to do that.

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:14.530
And so they became second,
third, fourth spouses

01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:16.421
to provide an
economic stability.

01:33:22.410 --> 01:33:28.140
In one case, I know of
a man who was married,

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.290
had a second wife who
was a third gender,

01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:33.560
and the first wife died.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.870
The third gender there
in that relationship

01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:40.620
picked up the responsibility
of raising the children.

01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.480
And that's one of the
things that we generally

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.780
don't have in our language
is a word for "he" or "she."

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:55.000
We just use gender terms,
a gender-based term

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.820
in relationships,
like with children.

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:04.925
[NAVAJO] is generally a
boy or [NAVAJO] is a girl.

01:34:04.925 --> 01:34:09.450
[NAVAJO] is a group of girls.

01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:14.040
[NAVAJO] is-- no. [NAVAJO]
is a group of girls.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.960
[NAVAJO] is a group of boys.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:25.870
And terms like [NAVAJO] "There's
an old man coming toward us."

01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:29.830
So it's a very gender based
language that we have.

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:35.190
So there's really no
term describing his,

01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:39.430
hers, she, he, those
kind of terminologies.

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:43.850
And I've always been
curious about that.

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:46.510
But linguistic is
something that I mostly

01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:52.830
stumbled into after parading
through cultural anthropology

01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.250
for 30 years.

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:54.750
-OK.

01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:58.630
-And now I'm heading up
the Navajo language program

01:34:58.630 --> 01:35:05.420
and just got an NSF grant and I
have to tackle that to look at.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:10.730
Generating verbs-- it's a
verb-based, like [NAVAJO] is

01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:14.460
more important, like [NAVAJO].

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.890
It always ends with verb,
with a verb at the end.

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:22.490
It's not the same as English
where there's a subject,

01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:24.610
then there's a
verb and an object.

01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:27.760
In our language, it's
subject, object, and verb.

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:28.260
-OK.

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.560
-So the verb is at the end.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:29.800
-Yeah.

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.299
I'm sorry.

01:35:30.299 --> 01:35:31.880
I want to be sure
that we do have

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.690
enough time for your questions.

01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:37.970
And if you can maybe just
introduce yourself really fast

01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:38.650
and ask?

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:38.782
-Yeah.

01:35:38.782 --> 01:35:39.281
OK.

01:35:39.281 --> 01:35:40.010
Is this on?

01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.200
Yeah?

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:40.700
-Yeah.

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.690
-I'm Lucy Ferriss.

01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:43.910
I teach at Trinity College
in Hartford, Connecticut

01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:46.109
and I also write for
the Lingua Franca blog

01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:47.650
at the Chronicle of
Higher Education.

01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:48.150
-Oh, good.

01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:50.040
-And as a sort of
default, I seem

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.690
to be the person who writes
about gender and language

01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:54.750
on that blog.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.589
And if you want to see
something about the readership

01:35:57.589 --> 01:35:59.130
of the Chronicle of
Higher Education,

01:35:59.130 --> 01:36:01.680
you can go to the
comments that any

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.460
of my-- it's basically
descriptive blog posts

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:09.610
about language seem to invoke.

01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:12.050
So please come visit me
there and help me out

01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:14.230
with some better comments.

01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:14.730
[LAUGHTER]

01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:16.870
But my question--
I was listening

01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:20.790
to the poet Alejandro
Zambra the other day,

01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:22.090
who's a Chilean poet.

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:26.810
And in his remarks, he
mentioned how important

01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:31.470
it was for him that in
Spanish, objects are gendered.

01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:33.270
And as I'm sure
everybody here knows,

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:36.320
in romance languages,
that's quite common,

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.880
that everything is gendered.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.940
And of course it's
a binary gender.

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.840
I mean, things are either
masculine or feminine.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.660
And he loves that as a poet.

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:52.960
He loves thinking about a table
as being a masculine object

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.920
and about a window as
being a feminine object

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.550
and using that in his poetry.

01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:02.920
And I have no idea if there
are discussions of the kind

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.480
that we're having
here among people

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.800
who speak other languages
where gender is not

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:14.600
so much about the person
as it is about the world

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.451
that the person encounters.

01:37:16.451 --> 01:37:18.700
And I wondered if any of you
had any comments on that.

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.180
-In my language, we have that.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.250
Hills are feminine.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.820
Rocky Mountains is masculine.

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:40.080
The rain that comes with
thunder is masculine.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.040
The drizzle is feminine.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.660
Smooth the running
water is feminine.

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.930
Rushing water, like through
the Grand Canyon, is masculine.

01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:54.370
We have plants
that are masculine.

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:57.300
Ideas and thoughts
are genderized.

01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:00.610
Ceremonies are genderized.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:04.780
Behaviors are genderized,
despite being a woman

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.290
and you're aggressive and you
go through that masculine stage

01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:12.500
and react from that.

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:15.950
Your body, your left side
is masculine your right side

01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:18.590
is feminine.

01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:22.150
Your biological body
is-- if you're a man,

01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:25.200
it's supposedly
supposed to be male.

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.700
But the inner side
of you is feminine.

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:35.670
So there's that contrast
throughout the Navajo world.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.120
Smooth river rocks are feminine.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.910
Other rocks, hard ones with
sharp edges, are masculine.

01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:47.300
Flowers are like that.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.941
Even dirt is genderized.

01:38:49.941 --> 01:38:50.440
-Wow.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:56.520
If you're not a linguist and you
want to see someone explaining

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.950
the research on gendered
nouns in romance languages

01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:04.700
and European languages, there's
a book by Guy Deutscher,

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:10.860
D-E-U-T-S-C-H-E-R, which I was
hoping somebody would bring up,

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:13.440
but I think I have to do it,
called Through the Language

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:19.370
Glass, about what forms of the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis are true

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.420
and which ones are false.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.376
And that book, the last
chapter talks about the John

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:26.750
[INAUDIBLE] stuff
about location.

01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:27.640
You probably know it.

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.140
Yeah.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:31.270
The second to last chapter
talks about a very, very large

01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:34.120
psych department-y
study of gendered nouns

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.000
in German and gendered
nouns in French.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.280
And it turns out that if you do
a very good academic psychology

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.410
study with people
clicking buttons

01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:43.300
to see what their
reaction times are,

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.580
that if you speak a
language where a bridge is

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:50.570
a feminine noun, you will
have a slight propensity

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:52.660
to think that
bridges are welcoming

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:54.640
and forgiving and soft.

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.990
And if in your language
bridge is a masculine noun,

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:58.900
you'll think of them
as hard and tough.

01:39:58.900 --> 01:39:59.947
Not much, but a little.

01:39:59.947 --> 01:40:02.030
So there is research on
that in romance languages.

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.529
-OK.

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.240
Thank you.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.090
-Can I just-- sorry.

01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:06.480
I just want to respond
briefly to that,

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.880
partly because I really
feel the conflict that

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.010
comes in that question.

01:40:12.010 --> 01:40:18.420
As a writer and artist, I always
am so interested in the ways

01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.660
that we use language
very specifically, very

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:26.080
strategically, in order to
make certain kinds of points.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.710
And on the other
hand, whenever anybody

01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:30.850
starts talking about gendered
nouns in romance languages,

01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:33.620
I can't help but think
about things like in French,

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.490
"mustache" is a feminine
noun and "vagina"

01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:41.840
is a masculine,
which it possibly

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.570
contains a tiny amount of
sexism in addition to the ways

01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:47.770
in which it's complicated.

01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.060
Because when you ask French
linguists about this,

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.940
they will say, well, things are
assigned masculine or feminine

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:57.530
not based on their attributes,
but based on how important they

01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:59.350
are, they say very proudly.

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:01.720
And so since the
vagina is so important,

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.910
we obviously made it masculine.

01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:05.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:07.280
-Like like the big
mountains in Dine.

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.720
-Like the mountains.

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.990
And I just sort
of think, listen,

01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:15.320
the cookie you're waiting
for is not coming.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.545
And so there's
always that tension.

01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:26.310
Lyricism and
euphonia sort of bang

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:31.820
up against the desire to
not reify certain kinds

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.200
of oppression.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.660
I think it's a very
interesting question.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:38.160
-Hi.

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.540
My name's Rachel
[? Hannibutt ?] and I'm

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.110
a master's student at
the Harvard Graduate

01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:43.119
School of Education right
across the way here.

01:41:43.119 --> 01:41:44.660
And I'd like to make
a shameless plug

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.320
for a really great at exhibit
about India's third gender,

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.430
if anybody wants to check
it out during a break.

01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:54.780
But my question, Bear, you
spoke of the gatekeepers

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.280
involved in this
work and Rebecca,

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.550
about children and
identification.

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:01.320
And in my own work of the
conflation of just the terms

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.380
"sex" and "gender"
in academic research

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:07.820
brings out what advice do you
have for young researchers

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.050
or really anyone hoping
to change the conversation

01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:12.890
in the field of research?

01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:17.220
-Read broadly, find a
passion, and follow it.

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:22.350
[LAUGHTER] I will
say in my journey,

01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:25.860
I've been surprised
where I ended up.

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.510
For example, I didn't start
out studying language.

01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:30.900
I was actually,
frankly, very surprised

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:34.940
at the incredibly powerful
role that labeling

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.530
played in gender stereotyping.

01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:38.780
That was not what I thought.

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:43.060
I thought that teachers had to
say sexist things like, "Boys,

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.620
please move the heavy tables
in the classroom; girls,

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:47.040
clean the blackboards."

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.770
I thought, when I started,
those kinds of statements

01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:53.059
would produce stereotyping
instead of just saying,

01:42:53.059 --> 01:42:54.350
"Good morning, boys and girls."

01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:57.410
That was as much a surprise
to me as to the teachers.

01:42:57.410 --> 01:43:01.680
So my advice is have a
passion, read very broadly

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.990
across disciplines, across
areas within disciplines,

01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:08.770
and then design the
best studies you

01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:12.990
can to address your questions.

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:13.830
-Thank you.

01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:19.150
-I would also say be shamelessly
flexible with your language.

01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:21.240
One of the things
that happens, I think,

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:26.420
is that we learn a word, we like
it, and then we keep using it.

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.760
And sometimes when
language develops,

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.700
we're reluctant to join
in the new language

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:37.280
because we feel like, oh, but
I invested so-- for example,

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:41.160
I invested a ton in the idea
of gender neutral, right?

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.310
And then eventually, it
really became clear to me

01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:46.960
that gender neutrality
was not remotely something

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.540
that I was interested
in being involved in,

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:52.180
that gender nonspecific
was actually the word

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.200
that I wanted.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.680
And so I had published who knows
how many pages worth of gender

01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.660
neutral.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.680
And there comes a
certain point at which

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:03.200
I found that I had to
say, all right, I've

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:08.260
learned better, to constantly
be evolving in terms of best

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:12.630
practices in language and
then modeling them and really

01:44:12.630 --> 01:44:17.100
standing up for the
language that you feel best

01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:20.000
about regardless,
to whatever degree

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.970
you can, of other
people's variously

01:44:23.970 --> 01:44:25.281
cloaked concerns about it.

01:44:25.281 --> 01:44:26.780
-There are all these
people waiting.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.190
I want to get as many questions
as we can in the time we have.

01:44:29.190 --> 01:44:29.840
-Hi.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.420
My name's Jen [? Detterick ?]
and I run the Equal Rights

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.580
Amendment page on Facebook.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.750
And there's this, I
don't know if you've

01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:40.440
heard about it, an election
going on right now.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.600
I don't know if it's been a
big topic of conversation.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.660
One of the candidates is
of a different cisgender

01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:49.880
than the other candidates.

01:44:53.569 --> 01:44:55.360
Again, I don't know if
you know about this,

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.070
but on the Equal
Rights Amendment page,

01:44:58.070 --> 01:45:02.700
I posted some pro articles
about this candidate

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.980
and was immediately greeted
with, gender doesn't matter.

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.140
Why are we talking about
gender on this page?

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:11.460
This is the quality page.

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.200
Gender means nothing.

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.080
And I would vote
for Elizabeth Warren

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.862
so clearly, I'm not a sexist.

01:45:16.862 --> 01:45:18.570
And so beyond me having
to say you're not

01:45:18.570 --> 01:45:20.903
allowed to mention Elizabeth
Warren until the election's

01:45:20.903 --> 01:45:25.260
over on the page, I'm wondering
about how I talk about that.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.690
Because the Equal
Rights Amendment

01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:29.650
is there's no
discrimination based

01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:31.390
on sex, which is
based on the fact

01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:35.240
that historically,
there has been one

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.930
presented gender that has
been discriminated against.

01:45:37.930 --> 01:45:40.200
So you wonderfully
touched on this,

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.850
and you also did, about
we have to, at some point,

01:45:42.850 --> 01:45:45.730
discuss gender and we can't say,
I don't see gender and that.

01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:49.480
How do we talk about
it in a productive way,

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.180
about why it would be important
to bring forth women publicly,

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:59.290
why that matters even when we're
talking about gender not being

01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:02.770
an actual real thing
or being a fluid thing?

01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:06.230
-Can you just say
because misogyny?

01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:07.650
-I could.

01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:08.370
I wish.

01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:10.750
I wish I could.
#BecauseMisogyny.

01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:14.535
-I mean, that's kind of
the answer in my mind.

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:16.370
-Yeah.

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.680
-I will jump in and say
I did a study in 2006

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.720
of children's understanding
of race and gender

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.670
in the presidency.

01:46:22.670 --> 01:46:25.740
So we asked whether the
presidents of the United States

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.990
have been only men, only
women, or both men and women,

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:29.900
just to see if kids knew.

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.050
There hadn't been any
work that even established

01:46:32.050 --> 01:46:33.531
whether kids paid attention.

01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:34.030
They do.

01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:35.960
By kindergarten,
the vast majority

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.210
of children in the United
States know that only men

01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:39.380
have been president.

01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:40.830
And then we asked them why.

01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:42.600
Why is that true?

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.190
And we discovered that there
were a couple big clumps

01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:46.920
of categories.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.150
One third of kids said
it's because girls

01:46:49.150 --> 01:46:52.390
are too stupid, too dumb,
too weak, too ignorant

01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:54.210
to be president of
the United States.

01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:57.220
But about one third said
the boys hate girls.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.100
Boys will never vote for girls.

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.550
Boys won't listen to girls.

01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:02.770
And therefore,
girls had never been

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:04.200
president of the United States.

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:07.530
This indicates to me that we
need to have conversations

01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:10.910
beginning in elementary school
about the links to gender,

01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:13.150
to actual roles
like the presidency,

01:47:13.150 --> 01:47:15.420
like computer
science and physics,

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:20.960
like men and preschool teaching,
and try to have conversations

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.860
with children about why those
links arose in the first place

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:28.020
and why they are maintained
and how they are maintained.

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.720
So in other words, the
answer is to have discussions

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.010
about sexism with kids beginning
really early in their lives.

01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:35.536
-Yeah.

01:47:35.536 --> 01:47:36.230
Nice.

01:47:36.230 --> 01:47:36.860
-Yeah.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:39.340
You're not on Twitter, but I am.

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:41.714
And it sounds like--
your name is Jen?

01:47:41.714 --> 01:47:42.490
-Jen, yeah.

01:47:42.490 --> 01:47:44.310
-Yeah, Jen might
want to post links

01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:45.790
to those studies on her page.

01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:46.290
-Yes.

01:47:46.290 --> 01:47:48.952
-If you send me those
studies, I will Tweet them.

01:47:48.952 --> 01:47:49.910
-That would be helpful.

01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:50.409
Thank you.

01:47:50.409 --> 01:47:51.430
-Thank you.

01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:52.551
Next questioner.

01:47:52.551 --> 01:47:53.050
-OK.

01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:53.550
Hi.

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:56.290
My name is Jessica Mink
and I'm an astronomer,

01:47:56.290 --> 01:47:58.400
but I'm also really
interested in gender issues.

01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.880
As a scientist, we
classify things a lot

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.710
and categorize things
a lot, and I also

01:48:06.710 --> 01:48:09.472
find that just about
everybody does that.

01:48:09.472 --> 01:48:10.930
And one of the
things we're talking

01:48:10.930 --> 01:48:14.380
about when we talk about
gender now, which is different

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:18.090
and a lot of people don't
understand this yet,

01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:21.150
is that we're
decategorizing gender,

01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:24.690
that that's a really important
thing to individuals.

01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.730
And gender's not just
becoming-- I mean,

01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:31.750
non-binary means more
than just a third thing.

01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:34.320
It means a lot more things.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.280
And that's really
hard to explain

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:40.440
and it's really hard
for me to totally grasp

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.950
the totality of that myself.

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:45.970
And I'm trying to explain
a little bit of non-binary

01:48:45.970 --> 01:48:48.660
to people who-- non-binary
is a term that's come up

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.690
in the last two or three years.

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:53.290
So where do we go?

01:48:53.290 --> 01:48:58.450
How do we decategorize gender?

01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:01.250
What kind of activities,
actions can we do?

01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:03.180
Where do we have to do it?

01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:08.450
I mean, we've got to do it to
adults, and that's not easy.

01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:13.520
-So the question is, how do
we undo inherited categories

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.020
for gender?

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.420
The largest question
that's been asked so far.

01:49:23.370 --> 01:49:25.620
Wesley, do you want to
start with that based

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:29.580
on analogies to other
languages where the categories

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.420
are different?

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:34.100
Can we undo what
goes on in English

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:37.470
by using those contrasts?

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:38.660
-Yes.

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:42.430
The one I just presented earlier
between first, second, third,

01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:44.670
and fourth gender
is just in Navajo

01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:47.840
language, which I translated
into English for you.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.870
That's just four categories.

01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:52.170
There's additional
categories beyond that,

01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:54.200
like for an example,
two-spirit is

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:59.240
a category that comes
both in male bodied

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.150
or female bodied two-spirit.

01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:06.400
And then we introduced
numerous terminology

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.830
we have in English
that comes in-- TGs,

01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:17.100
TSes, gay, lesbian,
non-identifier, that adds more

01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.970
into our community.

01:50:18.970 --> 01:50:22.990
So in our community, we can't
label everybody saying, oh,

01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.990
he's gay or lesbian.

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:28.110
We have to ask them, how
do you identify yourself?

01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:31.100
And we hear all these different
types of terminologies.

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:36.770
So we're now beginning to look
at multi-gender terminology

01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:38.590
in our language.

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:42.750
And what we did is we moved the
Navajo language and use that

01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:45.680
to translate the English
identity, that those

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.486
are being used.

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:52.960
-Rebecca, Bear, do you
want to answer directly

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:58.020
or should we hear the
other questioners first?

01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.880
-I'll just jump in
and say, not only are

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:03.890
physicists categorizers,
scientists, but as I presented,

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:05.300
infants are.

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.130
Humans are brilliant
categorizers.

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:09.830
They have a predisposition
to categorize.

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:12.940
But they are also incredibly
flexible about which

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.100
bases they use.

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:18.460
We are capable of completely
ignoring some potential bases

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:19.240
of categorizing.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.990
As I said, we could
categorize each other

01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:23.406
by whether our earlobes are
attached or not, whether we're

01:51:23.406 --> 01:51:25.900
right or left handed,
which is biologically based

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.780
and has something to do with
our brain organizations.

01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.850
But most the time, we
totally ignore that,

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.800
and children totally ignore it.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.480
So the helpful side is
I do think humans are

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.710
born with an incredible
capacity for flexibility

01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:42.250
in how they operate, perceive,
and see people in the world.

01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:46.750
And so it's our job as adults
to be very thoughtful about how

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:49.690
we construct and give
messages to children

01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:52.942
about which bases are important.

01:51:52.942 --> 01:51:53.650
-So good morning.

01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:54.360
I'm Licia Verde.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.560
I'm an astrophysicist
so I work in

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.280
a male dominated environment.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:03.240
And despite that,
I've never asked

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:06.250
myself question about
language and gender

01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:08.740
so this is all new for me.

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:12.290
I sympathize with the
host of this conference,

01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:15.190
having found myself at
physics faculty meetings,

01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:17.040
and enough said there.

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:21.630
So maybe I'm stating
the obvious here,

01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:23.950
or maybe I'm seeing the
elephant in the room.

01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:27.030
There are two completely
different issues.

01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:34.060
One is find, beyond
male and female gender,

01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.780
something to define
somebody because somebody

01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.830
feels that doesn't fit into
any of these two categories.

01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:44.050
But that is another
issue, which is

01:52:44.050 --> 01:52:47.600
there may be situation
in which gender

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:50.460
should not be an issue at all.

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:54.370
And this should be
two different words

01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:57.520
because these are two
completely different ballgames.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.010
So for example, we
say Mr. President

01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:04.820
and we say Mr. President
to Mr. President Bush

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:09.676
and to Mr. President Obama.

01:53:09.676 --> 01:53:14.140
If Hillary get elected,
would we say Mr. President?

01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:16.420
Being president is not
related to the fact

01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:19.700
we are male or female, it's
you're good enough for the job.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.630
So there should not
be a gender associated

01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:25.390
to that, and with this,
along with being professor,

01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:26.860
being CEO, or whatever.

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:32.560
While on the other hand, find a
gender neutral word and putting

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.990
everything in there, it's
putting apples and oranges

01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.490
together.

01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:40.970
It's two completely different.

01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:44.080
-I'm going to try to
make that into a question

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.050
because it seems
really important.

01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:50.540
And tell me if I got this wrong.

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:54.690
On the one hand, we ought
to remove gendered language

01:53:54.690 --> 01:53:56.630
where it is not salient.

01:53:56.630 --> 01:54:03.450
On the other hand, we ought to
accept and develop a language

01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:05.960
for talking about
gender where it

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.570
is salient that fits the
diversity of lived experience.

01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:13.020
How can we do both of those
things simultaneously?

01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:16.445
Aren't they mutually
interfering tasks?

01:54:16.445 --> 01:54:17.320
Is that the question?

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:17.520
-Thank you.

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:17.720
Great.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.470
Thank you.

01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:19.560
-OK.

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:23.400
-I don't think they're mutually
interfering tasks at all.

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:28.690
I think that one of the things
that is really present in both

01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:31.790
of those is broadening
the vocabulary that we

01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:35.290
have to talk about gender.

01:54:35.290 --> 01:54:39.516
Why is it not possible
to-- all right.

01:54:39.516 --> 01:54:42.290
Let me back up a step.

01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.080
I think that it
should be possible,

01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.340
and it seems like it is, to
have gender nonspecific language

01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:53.870
that can be used both when
gender is not a factor

01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:57.350
or we are signaling that we
don't want it to be a factor

01:54:57.350 --> 01:55:08.800
and for situations when a person
does not identify themselves

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.480
with any of the most
common gender categories.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:17.050
I think that the
interesting piece for me

01:55:17.050 --> 01:55:20.950
starts to crop up because as
soon as you make a list of all

01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:24.580
the possibilities-- I
was a little bit involved

01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:27.760
with the folks who made 51
genders on Facebook or 52

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.760
genders on Facebook
or whatever it is.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.070
And as soon as they released
the list and your Facebook

01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:36.190
had a dropdown
box of 52 options,

01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:38.300
people immediately
started to complain

01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:43.500
that their particular
preferred gender wasn't listed.

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.260
And that is the thing that
crops up over and over again.

01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:49.850
At a certain moment in identity
politics people start to say,

01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:54.490
but I prefer to identify myself
as this complicated, 11-word

01:55:54.490 --> 01:55:58.160
adjectival phrase, and I
don't see that recognized

01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.580
in the literature.

01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:03.110
And at the same time,
we all, I think,

01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:08.470
recognize that there is value
to having some ability to label

01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:12.540
ourselves because it gives
us a banner to group under,

01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:15.678
for certain topics.

01:56:15.678 --> 01:56:17.470
-[INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:20.790
-I'll just acknowledge there's
a fundamental value question

01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:23.270
at the base of the debate.

01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:27.480
I tend to be on the side
of a more gender neutral,

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.240
minimize the salience
of gender as a category,

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.980
but I totally
recognize there are

01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:35.490
people who argue that gender
is incredibly valuable.

01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:37.870
I want to say I'm a woman
and I identify as a woman

01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:40.380
and I want to have spaces
where there's women.

01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:42.490
And then you might
argue well, and we

01:56:42.490 --> 01:56:44.280
need 12 different
genders, but we

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.080
want to maintain
all these genders

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.340
and the focus and the salience.

01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:52.360
And I think that's a
fundamental mental debate

01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:55.210
that science isn't
necessarily going to solve.

01:56:55.210 --> 01:56:56.210
-OK.

01:56:56.210 --> 01:56:58.530
Last word?

01:56:58.530 --> 01:57:02.100
-I'm not in that
conversation yet.

01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.400
I'm still in my own
tribal [? mind ?]

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.990
of how I'm constructing gender,
but I will be coming to Bear

01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:12.240
and get some information
from him about everything

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.950
else in the Western culture.

01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:16.810
So that's something that's
still not there yet.

01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:17.458
-Thank you.

01:57:17.458 --> 01:57:20.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:57:21.715 --> 01:57:22.820
-Thank you very much.

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.170
