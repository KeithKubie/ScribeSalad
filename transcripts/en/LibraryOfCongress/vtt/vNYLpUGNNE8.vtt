&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.030
&gt;&gt; Mike Ashenfelder: So
Kiersten White is the giver

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.050
of the world's most awkward hugs.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.880 position:56%
She's a New York Times
best-selling author of books such as

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.580
And I Darken, the Paranormalcy
series with Paranormalcy,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.980
Supernaturally and Endlessly, Mind
Games, Perfect Lies, Annie and Fia,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.710
The Chaos of Stars,
Illusions of Fate.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.960
She writes thrillers from
a young adult point of view

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.860
about princesses, extraordinary
girls with extraordinary powers,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.170 position:56%
girls that find their strength in
bravery to confront weird challenges

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.430
such as fairies and
werewolves and vampires

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.320
and other bits of supernatural
stuff.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.310 position:56%
I just finished reading Paranormalcy
and I have two teenage daughters

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.510
and I can really see Evie in them.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.560
Kiersten really gets the
tone of -she get their tone.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.310
So I imagine my daughters
having Evie's flipping attitude

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.180
around really scary
characters and pulling

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.680
out [inaudible] and doing damage.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.510
So please welcome Kiersten White.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.080
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.580
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Well thank
you for reading Paranormalcy.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.010
You are actually my
exact target audience.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.310
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.230
I've been surprised at how
many teen girls read the books,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.530
but that's all right.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.420
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.530
I am aware that Raina Telgemeier
is speaking at the same time

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.210
so I appreciate you being here.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.010
I would probably go watch her too.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.550
[ Laughter ]

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.040
So thank you.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.200
So I'm Kiersten White.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140 position:56%
It's always interesting hearing
yourself introduced by someone else.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.920 position:56%
How do I get the PowerPoint started?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.550 position:56%
It's really bright up here you guys.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.680
Just -which one?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.450
I'm so excited to be
here with you today.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.350
This is my first National
Book Festival and so I feel

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.560
like it's a really big honor
and privilege to be here.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.830 position:56%
My most recent book is And I
Darken; it's epic historical fiction

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.760
about a gender-swapped
Vlad the Impaler.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.600
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about why I decided to write

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.060
about historical fiction and
more specifically why I decided

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.590
to write an antiheroine.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.680
But as I was planning this
-usually when you do events

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.390
or festivals you're on a panel
with several other authors

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.510
and people ask you questions
and you answer, so when I found

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.030
out that I just had thirty minutes
on a stage by myself here...

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.050
[ Laughter ]

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.280
This was my original topic
and my publicist was like,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.730
"Oh I need your PowerPoint
right now."

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.420
And I'm like, "I don't know."

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.020 position:56%
So once I got past deciding to write
a PowerPoint about PowerPoints,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.910 position:56%
I thought about trying to guess what
audiences will find interesting;

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.500
it depends, it varies
from audience to audience.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.280
I thought about writing
about historical fiction.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.970
If any of you are aspiring writers,
I have a huge writing tip for you;

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.880
don't write historical fiction.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.390
You guys, it's so hard.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.110
One time I did five
hours of research

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.770
on traditional Arabic erotic poetry
conventions -did I lose the mic

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.070
or is it just less [inaudible]?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.150
OK, good. And those five hours

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.230
of research informed
two lines in the book.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.700
And I guarantee you people aren't
going to read those and be like,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.110
"she's a really bad poet."

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.200
[ Laughter ]

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.220
The existential crisis
of writing period.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.950
Writing is super fun and I'm
really privileged to be able

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.880
to do it professionally, but
sometimes we feel like Leo

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.940
over there, although
he has better hair.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.280
But I finally settled on talking
about the peculiar morality

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.220
of villains; is my actual topic.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.220
And it's something that
I struggled with deciding

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.050
to write an antiheroine who
is essentially a villain.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.320
And it became a little bit more
of a struggle as I saw in the U.K.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.870
when they we're promoting
the book kept talking

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.160
about Lada is a new feminist
icon, and I was like,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.550
"You do realize she's
an antiheroine?"

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.140
But that's all right, girls
are allowed to be bad too.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.270
[ Laughter ]

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.840
So I'm going to tell you a little
bit about Vlad the Impaler.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.940
Generally in an audience I can pick
out exactly who is going to know

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.800
who Vlad the Impaler was.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.380
You guys are really obvious, yes.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.400
I once had a guy at [inaudible]
come up and I'll say like,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.700
"Do you know who Vlad
the Impaler is?"

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.000
And most people will be like, "No."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600
And this guy had a
handmade chain mail bracelet

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.070
and like dragon cross earrings
and I looked at him and I said,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.430
"I'm not even going to ask if you
know who Vlad the Impaler was."

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.010
And he's like, "Oh yeah I do."

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.020
So Vlad the Impaler was obscure
Romanian price in the 1400s,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.390
and his last name was actually
Dracul which if that's familiar is

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.750
because Bram Stoker used him
as the inspiration for Dracula.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.160
He was that notoriously not nice.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.640
So Vlad grew up as a political
prisoner in the Ottoman courts

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.480 position:56%
as the same time as Mehmed the
conqueror who was the Ottoman Sultan

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.160
who at the age of twenty-one would
go on to overthrow Constantinople

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.850
which was something that people
had been trying to do for centuries

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.260
and had never been able to, but
he was so brilliant and driven

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.770
that he was the one who did it.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.630
And Vlad and his brother Radu,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.580
who had the much kinder
historical nomenclature

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.580
of Radu the Handsome, right?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.630
Sometimes I wonder what
I want to be known as

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.010
and I think it'll be
Kiersten the Napper.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.700
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.540
So Vlad and Radu grew up and it
was not an easy way to grow up;

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.650
they were educated, they
were expected to become part

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.500
of the Ottoman Empire, but they
experienced a lot of cruelty.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.450
It's history, people weren't nice.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.310
And when they grew up the Ottomans
actually put Vlad on the throne

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.510
of Romania as their prince, but it
was sort of a puppet prince thing,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.130
it was the understanding of you
are going to serve our interests.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.850
Whereas, Radu stayed with the
Ottomans and he stayed loyal

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.600
and he converted to Islam and
he never went back on that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.630
for the rest of his life.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.190
But Vlad was not a
fan of the Ottomans,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.910
and he was deeply,
deeply nationalistic.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.230
So he went on to antagonize
them in every way that he could.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.280
There's one letter from him -so
the other European allies asked

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.380
[inaudible] don't make
the Ottomans mad.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.980
Let's just keep things
at a base level.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.580
Let's keep things friendly
because you didn't want

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.670 position:56%
to make Mehmed the Conqueror mad
because he was Mehmed the Conqueror.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.630
And Vlad once wrote a letter
saying, "I went into Bulgaria

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.600
and I slaughtered tens of thousands
of people and we killed them

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.580
in their homes and we killed them
in their street, and so, yes,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.350
I think I might have
broken the treaty."

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.030
Like a little bit, just
a little bit he broke it.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.040
And so what he did was he was so
determined to have his own country

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.310
that he was going to do
whatever it took to keep it.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.770
And the thing you got
to remember though is

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.070
at the time the Ottomans were
kind of the guys you wanted to be

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.360
because they had religious
tolerance,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.730
they didn't are whether
or not you were Muslim.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.280
Actually they preferred you didn't
convert because they could tax you

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.260
at a higher rate if
you were Christian.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.570
But they didn't kill
you for not converting.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.270
They didn't believe in feudalism

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.110
so everyone had opportunities
for advancement.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.320
When Mehmed overthrew
Constantinople,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.390
he opened the city up, he
invited Jewish refugees

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.190
from Spain from the Inquisition.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.990
And he really wanted to have
this sort of European jewel.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.560
He wanted the brightest minds,
he wanted the best people

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.920
and he didn't care
where they came from.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.350
So they were actually really good
people to have over your country;

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.460
I mean, yes, they asked for
taxes and they asked for boys

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.760
for their army, but
that was about it

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.720
and Vlad refused, he
refused to do that.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.540
And so what he did was when he knew
the Ottomans were coming he engaged

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.970
in all out scorched earth warfare.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.160
He diverted rivers to make
his own land into marshes.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.460
He burned his crops.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.760
He poisoned his wells.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.310
He found anybody that was sick
in his people and he sent them

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.720
into the Ottoman camps
to circulate and try

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.040
to get them sick, so
he had germ warfare.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.130
And he did all of these things.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.400
He even used his own intimate
knowledge of their practices

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.690
to dress in their uniforms
and sneak into their camp

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.140
and launch a night attack

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.630
which actually might have worked
had his own people supported him,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.930
but they didn't.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.380
So finally Mehmed and his army
get through this just nightmare

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.770
that Vlad has created for them
and they get to the capital city,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:14.100
and lining the road to the capital
that has its gates open are ten

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.110
or twenty thousand
impaled Turkish soldiers.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.110
So it was quite the greeting.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.280
And at this point the
Turkish army said,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.260
"We don't know what
to do with this."

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.990 position:56%
So they turned around and they left.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:30.920 position:56%
He actually won, except he had made
so many people angry and had damaged

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.770
so much of his own land that his
own people no longer supported him.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.380
So you're probably thinking here's
a nice German woodcut of him eating

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.580
in the middle of a
forest of impaled bodies.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.430
This is a portrait of him.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.570
So I know that you guys are
looking at him, you're knowing all

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.640
that history and you're
saying, "teenage girl" right?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.130
Maybe not.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.900
But I knew all this history and I
thought it was really interesting.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.250
I had actually travelled to
Romania in 2010 and my husband

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.970
and I visited almost all of
his historical sites just kind

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.640
of on the side because we
were going to Romania anyway.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.480
And as my husband was
telling my mom about all

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.570
of this history I was thinking
about it and thinking about it

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.490
and thinking how does
somebody to that point?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.260
How does someone get to the point

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.770
where they can justify
committing atrocities

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.070
in the name of their own goal?

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.370
Like how does that happen?

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.640
Because it has to be gradual.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.560
And then I thought, "But
what if he had been a girl?"

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.530
And you know for most authors
that's how books start,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.830
it's that whole what if.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.440
And for me him being a girl
just made so much more sense

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.080
because as a girl you have to work
harder, you have to be smarter,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.250
you have to be better at everything
to attain just the same base level

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.220
as other people get for being boys.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.570
And so once I turned Vlad into
Lada suddenly that ruthlessness

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.370
and that willingness to do anything
to meet her goals made a lot

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.200
of sense to me as a story teller.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.570
So some of the things that I
wanted to explore -guys I was

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.880
so unambitious with this book.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.990
I wanted to explore gender,
I wanted to explore politics,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.290
queer [phonetic] identity, faith.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.600
All of those things that
I loved writing in history

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.810
because you can kind of detach
them from our modern sensibilities,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.040
you don't have to address
them in context of our culture

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.930
and what's going on today and
you can really explore them

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.100
as the concepts that they are
rather than our particular culture.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.100
One thing that I really tried hard
in this book was to capture faith.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.810
One of the characters converts
to Islam and it's a very healing

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.270
and very powerful thing in his life
and that was really important to me

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.680
as a person of faith to try
and capture that in a YA book.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.890
But mostly I wanted to
ask that central question

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.120
and that central question is how,
how do people, normal people,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.150
get to the point where they
can allow and commit atrocities

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.450
and do these terrible things.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.750
You guys, this is such
a cheerful topic.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.050
[ Laughter ]

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.110
You can imagine how pleasant I
am when I'm writing these books.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.410
I'm sitting there in
Starbucks and everybody

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.280
around me -yeah you guys,
its historical fiction.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.250
And I really don't think that
these anti-heroine stories are

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.550
about the shock factor.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.310
For me it's not about the darkness
or the violence or anything,

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.980
it's really looking at how -because
we experience history as a story,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.990
it's already been packaged
for us and most

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.970
of the time it's been packaged
for us by the people who wrote it.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.980
So for example, when I was
researching Mehmed the Conqueror,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.610
all of the European
accounts of him were like,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.450
"He was drunk all the time and
he was this terrible person

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.900
and he committed all
these atrocities."

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.780
And I'm going, "If that guy was
drunk all the time I don't think he

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.130
would of been able to
overthrow an entire city

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.430
by the age of twenty-one.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.980
He was actually brilliant,
but when you read about him

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.080 position:56%
from his enemies you get a very
different picture than when you read

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.940
about him from the people who
loved him and who knew him.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.780
And so what I tried to do is
I tried to read both extremes

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.690
and then find a middle path.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.240
It's a little bit like
Fox News versus -you got

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.100
to find that middle path.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.780
And so trying to find
that and trying

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.750
to find the real people among
the history was the challenge

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.900
because so often we
look at these things

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.220
and we say, "Yes, that was bad."

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.910
We can agree that is was bad.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.410
The end result was bad,
but when we only focus

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.610
on the end result we fail
to see how it happened.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.290
And you look at Vlad the
Impaler and he was so deeply,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.700
deeply nationalistic, it
was his country or nothing,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.650
and he actually ended up
destroying his own land,

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.280
killing a lot of his own people,
and in the end losing the throne

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.020
to a foreign power anyway.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.250
And so that to me is the
value of the antihero story

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.220
of tracing these paths; it's
not to look at the darkness,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.930
but to look at how you get
there and to really explore

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.560
that so we don't forget that
these things happen in cycles

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.410 position:56%
and they happen over and over again.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.870
And so that value and that strength

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.950
of knowing those stories can
help us realize in our own lives,

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.430
as a nation, as a world
like where are we getting

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.220
to the point where
we've tipped over.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.620
So really light, fun,
happy writing you guys.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.330
So I do. I feel like there's value
in the telling beyond entertainment

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.920
because the stories that
we tell and the stories

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.220
that we love become part of us.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.370 position:56%
And if we tell the important stories
whether they're happening now

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.670
or whether they're happening in
the 1400s in the Ottoman Empire,

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.450
reliving to stories and
revisiting them will help us

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.380
to create our own lives in
the ways we want them to be.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.830
So no pressure just like no
pressure when you're speaking

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.130
at the National Book
Festival, right?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.490
[ Laughter ]

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.370
So I talk really fast.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.690
That is the end of my presentation.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.030
I am open to questions.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.720
You can ask me about writing.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.020
You can ask me about history.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.570
You can ask me about math,
but I guarantee you you're

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.550
in the wrong audience for that one.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:38.480
So does anybody have any questions
that they would like to ask?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.780
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.080
I'll go first.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.380
I was curious if you could talk
about your writing process?

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.730
Because I find that one of the
success with all of your books is

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.030
that you do everything right.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.330
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Well thank you.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.630
[ Laughter ]

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.930
&gt;&gt; The [inaudible] is magical.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.230
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Thank you.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.680
&gt;&gt; The plot, the characterization,
and the details

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.070
like thread throughout it.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.040
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: I'm not
actually related to her you guys.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.070
[ Laughter ]

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.340
&gt;&gt; Your first draft
[inaudible] into the end result.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.110
What comes easy to you in all
those elements of writing?

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.100
And then what do you add later
further on in your later drafts?

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.710
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: I think
everybody has their strengths

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.010
and weaknesses in writing.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.390
I'm a fairly strong drafter
so by the time I actually sit

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.930
down to draft I write very
complete very clean drafts.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.870
But one of my strengths
is writing dialogue,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.980
I love writing dialogue,
I think it's really fun.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.960
I would write entire books
of dialogue if I could,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.330
but then my editors are like.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.630
"Where are they?"

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.620
And I'm like, "I don't
know, they're in a room."

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.920 position:56%
"Like what does the room look like?"

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.670
I'm like, "I don't know,
they're just talking."

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.660
And so for me a lot of that detail
work is when I have to go back in

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.020
and really fill in and work
on what are they wearing?

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.320
Where are they?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.620
What do they look like?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.140
Another hint; if you
don't like description,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.220
if you don't like describing
landscapes or rooms or food,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.200
don't write historical fiction
you guys, it's so much work.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.200
So this one was definitely
a challenge to me

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.640
in that I did not play to my
strengths and so I really had

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.090
to buckle down and figure out like
how do I incorporate that sense

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.250
of place because it's
historical fiction and so you need

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.450
to feel grounded because I can't
just say they were in a small town

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.550
in Virginia, and we all
have a general sense of what

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.900
that feels like, but I can't
say they were in the small town

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.180
of [inaudible], you guys
don't know where that is

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.550
and what that feels like.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.520
And so I really had to
kind of dig in deeper

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.630
and do the detail work on this one.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.740
So really every book has different
challenges; some of them are harder

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.010
to piece together the
timeline, some of them I have

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.310
to work more on detail work.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.260
So my process generally
I start with a question.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.540
I was actually talking last
night with some authors

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.750
about what you start with and some
of them start with a character

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.050 position:56%
and some of them start with an idea.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.060
And for me generally I start
with a question, it's what I want

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.470
to explore with the book.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.700
For me the plot comes in
relation to that question.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.890
So Paranormalcy I wanted to see can
I write a funny paranormal romance?

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.090
Because that was back in the day
of Twilight when no one noticed

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.460
that if your vampire
boyfriend sparkles

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.970
in the sun that's hilarious.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.890
Like you guys, that's really funny.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.190
I would hang him on
my rear-view mirror.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.490
[ Laughter ]

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:07.250 position:56%
And the questions vary; And I
Darken it was how do good people get

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.680
to the point where they
can justify atrocities?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.980
That was super fun.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.280
I have a middle grade
book coming out next year

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.340
where my question was can I
write a ten page long pee joke?

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.640
And the answer is yes.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.520
So yeah, I have to have that
drive because if I don't have

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.020
that question that
I'm trying to answer

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.580
as the writer then I lose
interest in the book.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.850
And I have a lot of fifty,
sixty, seventy page starts

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.270
that I never go anywhere
with because

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.340
that central question
wasn't there for me.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.120 position:56%
So writing process is a hard thing
to talk about because it's different

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.950
for everyone, but for me I
just have to have that soul,

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.850
that core of the book that I'm
engaged in and I'm exploring

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.310
and I think everything
else comes after that.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.010
Does anyone else have a question
that I can vaguely not answer?

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.880
[ Laughter ]

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.300
Yes? Oh hi.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.760 position:56%
This is Jon Skovron, young adult
and adult writer, most recently Hope

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.000
and Red which is a
fantastic fantasy.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.300
&gt;&gt; Jon Skovron: Thanks Kiersten.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.600
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: You're welcome.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Skovron: I actually have a
historical fiction question for you;

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.880
how do you balance
the needs of the story

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.460
with the actual historical
events and details?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.760
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:
That's a good question.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.500
And it's even more difficult in YA

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.980
because YA the emphasis
is on movement.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.900
I feel like adult writing
you can get a little bit more

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.080
self-indulgent, really sink
down into the description,

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.680
but YA we're known for the stories
move quickly and there's a lot

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.890
of action and engagement.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.640
So that was a really big
problem with book two

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.720
because I did all this research
you guys, so much research,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.320
thousands of pages of research, so
much on the fall of Constantinople.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.370
And so I knew all of these
details and these amazing anecdotes

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.060
and these actual historical figures
and I wanted to include all of them

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.200
because I put in the time
to learn about all of them

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.170
and gosh darn it I
wanted them on the page.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.660
But my editor, who is very wise,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.540
pointed out like these two men
served the exact same function.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.690
And I'm like, "But they were
actual historical figures,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.990
they were both there."

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.510
But as far as the narrative
was concerned,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.470 position:56%
they really only filled one role so
there only needed to be one of them.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.640
I actually had notes that
said get rid of Lucas,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.640
and I have a nephew named
Lucas and my mom saw that paper

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.580
and she was like, "What
are you talking about?"

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.250
I'm like, "Not him.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.440
Not him. He's cute,
we can keep him."

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.080
So I feel like you have to give
them just enough to have a sense

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.950
of the history and a sense
of the place and to feel

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.310
like they're learning
things, but not so much

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.860
that it reads like a history text.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.940
But the greatest thing that I hear
after people read the book is,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.430
"then I went on like a Wikipedia
rabbit hole researching what

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.640
actually happened with
all of these characters."

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.370
Because you do want to have as much
truth to the history as you can,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.700
but in the end you're telling
a story and history is messy

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.980
and it doesn't have those nice
through lines with the story.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.850
So like in book two I also
have the Hungarian court

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.820
and I actually have a note in the
back where I apologize to Hungary

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.900
as a country entirely because
of what I did to their history.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.200
I'm so sorry Hungary.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.360
But I couldn't get into it because
it was too big and too complicated.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.810
So for historical fiction, I
think trying to get a feel for it

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.870 position:56%
and a sense for it without getting
so bogged down on the actual history

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.970
that it reads like a
textbook, it's hard.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.290
Again, don't make historical
fiction you guys, it's so hard.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.210
Do you have any other questions?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.310
Yes?

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.870
&gt;&gt; Since you found it so hard
to write a historical fiction

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.610
about Vlad the Impaler, did
you ever think of changing it

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.130
to strictly fiction and keep him
gender bent and do Vlad the Impaler

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.820
as a vampire because
it would be easier?

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.140
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: It
would have been easier.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.290
No because the interest for me with
this project was the actual history

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.860
because I think you
can't get better stories

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.720
that history already
offers you; more dynamic

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.620
or incredible people
doing astonishing things.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.070
So I really did definitely want
to include the actual history

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.600
and it was important to
me not to -my only problem

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.050
with this book is are no vampires.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.200
And because that's all
people know of the history

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.990 position:56%
and Romania has a special place in
my heart and I really wanted to kind

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.970 position:56%
of introduce that to a lot of people
who wouldn't have any idea about it,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.720
although I do get Romanians that
are super excited and Romanians

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.020
who are like, "This
is not our history.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.320
He was a boy."

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.620
I'm like, "I know, I'm sorry.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.840
I just really wanted
him to be a girl."

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.380
I don't know that I would do
straight historical fiction again.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.180
I probably would do historical
influenced fantasy so that instead

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.940
of doing five hours of research
to find our whether a house

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.790
in the Moldovan countryside
would have windows

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.020
that opened -no one has
written about that you guys.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.080
No graduate students have ever
written a research paper on windows

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.030
in the fifteenth century in
the countryside of Moldova,

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.330
although you'd be amazed

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.630
at what graduate students
have done papers on.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.010
Thank you graduate students of the
world who post your paper online.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.180
Instead of having to do five
hours of research and then end

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.220
up just writing the
window out of the scene,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.080
you could say it opens
because of magic.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.150
[ Laughter ]

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:58.010
Right? You can't do that
in historical fiction.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.380 position:56%
One of the reasons why I gender
swapped Vlad the Impaler was so that

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.070
if people were like, "That's
not how things happened."

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.190
I'm like, "Well he wasn't a girl
so we already changed history

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.510
so that's how it happens now."

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.380
[ Laughter ]

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.070
Yes?

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.740
&gt;&gt; I was wondering since you
mentioned some of the hardships

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.430
and difficulties you encounter
when writing, what were some

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.010
of the things that you did

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.050
to keep you motivated
during your writing process?

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.140
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: I sold a
book before it was finished.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.270
[ Laughter ]

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.300
So I was contractually obligated.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.990
No, but I understand
writing is hard.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.620
And you have an idea that you
love and you get started on it

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.920
and you get so fired up about it
and then you get to the middle

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.990
and you're like, "Oh, I
actually have to fix all

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.290
of the problems that I set up."

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.760
And it's a lot easier to
just jump to something new.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.500
One thing that I try
to do is a try to set

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.840
up a really regular
drafting schedule for myself

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.840
like right now I have a calendar
for the next three months

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.580
and I have listed the amount that
I have to write every single day

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.990
and I find that motivation
really helps me.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.510
Another thing that I do is at
the end of the day when I'm done

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.640
with my writing, I
take just a few minutes

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.520
and I write just a few
sentences on the next page

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.760
about what happens next
so the next time I sit

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.220
down to write I'm not staring at a
blank page, that infinite whiteness

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.090
that I have to fill up, it already
has words there telling me Kiersten

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.550
this is what you're doing today.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.290
So that for me really helped.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.710
And also it was a story that was
important to me and it was one

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.010
that I really wanted to tell.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:32.230
So even though it was hard -guys
I just started writing book three.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.530
Oh my gosh.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.980
Even though it was hard,
it was important to me

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.900
and it was important
to tell it well.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.850
So I really wanted that challenge
and wanted to stretch as a writer

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:45.160
so that I could create the best
version of this story that I could.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.760
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Thank you.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.060
Yes?

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.360
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: That's all right.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.960
You are in good company.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.260
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.560
My first question is
from the variety

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.280
of languages taught toward
Lada, Radu, [inaudible]

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.100
and Mehmed are you
possibly fluent in one

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.690
of the languages spoken
within the book?

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.990
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Oh I wish.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.010
I actually only speak English
and a little bit of Spanish,

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.730
but my husband, you
guys I married so well,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:15.500
besides being good looking he
is fluent in Romanian and Arabic

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.800
and he's currently learning Greek

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.670
because being trilingual
is boring, right?

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.260
The only thing he doesn't
speak is Turkish

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.560
and I was really annoyed
with him for that.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.760
He should have learned
Turkish to benefit me.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I actually know a little Turkish.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.530
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Yeah?

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah I do.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.130
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Well
I could have used you.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.430
[ Laughter ]

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.080
And one thing that I chose to do
in this book is a lot of times

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.740
in books you'll see words in
foreign languages italicized,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.630
but because this is taking place
in an area of the world and a time

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.030
in the world where they had to
know several languages in order

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.980
to survive and everything
would have been familiar.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.810
I choose not to italicize
anything because I didn't want

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.620
to make any other languages look
like another language, so yeah.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.160
&gt;&gt; My second question was

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.600
which character would you say you
could have most related to and why?

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.460
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:
That's a good question.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.210
So people have asked if I'm
a not like Lada and I'm like,

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.040
"Are you afraid of me
if you think that I am?"

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.850
She's not really nice you
guys, she's quite violent.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.910
But actually the character
that I personally relate

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:18.250
to the most is Radu; he's more
sensitive, he's very emotional,

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.790
he is deeply committed to
the people that he loves

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.180
and he's a little bit sly
and sneaky and cunning.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.840
And somebody was like, "Oh
Radu is such a Hufflepuff."

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.360
I'm like, "Oh sweetheart,
Radu is a Slytherin."

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.570
[ Laughter ]

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.080
One hundred percent.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.960
So yeah, I think he's the character
that I actually relate to the most

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.900 position:56%
and the things that he goes
through, particularly his conversion

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:44.090
and his relationship to faith was
very personal for me to write.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.970
&gt;&gt; Hi. What happened in Hungary
that you needed to apologize for?

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.270
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.570
[ Laughter ]

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.710
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: So every country
has their own amazing intricate

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.590
history and there was a Hungarian
leader named John Hunyadi

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.430 position:56%
who was this amazing military leader
who was also contemporary of Mehmed

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.350
and Vlad the Impaler, and he
actually at one point took Vlad in

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.040
and trained him and was
sort of an ally to him.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.500
And there's all sort of drama
that went on in that time period;

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.840
Hunyadi's son Matthias who actually
had no claim to the throne ended

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.380
up working his way in to be King
of Hungary and then he had to wait

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.910
and get money to try and buy
back his crown from Poland

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.710
because Poland likes to
take other people's crowns

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.010
and not give them back.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.010 position:56%
And so it was all these things that
happened over the course of a couple

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.790
of decades, but for the purpose
of my narrative I just needed John

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.860
and Matthias to get their
act together and to get

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.220
that throne a lot faster
and to need Lada to do it.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.060
So I basically just
skimmed through decades

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.790
of history and ignored most of it.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.550
So I'm sorry Hungary, you really
do have fantastic history.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.690
All right.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.220
We have five minutes left.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.640
Do you know how many questions
I can answer in five minutes?

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.940
So many.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.240
[ Laughter ]

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.680
Just kidding.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.820
Yes? We're all so short in here.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.120
I love it.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.600
&gt;&gt; Yes. You've talked a little
bit about having to take things

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.200
out of the narrative that
you'd really like to include.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.270
Is there something in this
book that you really wished

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.010
that you could have left
in or is there something

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.090
in your previous books that you
wished you could have left it?

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.520
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:
That's a good question.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.770
I think I end up feeling like
if I have to take something

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.240 position:56%
out there's a reason to take it out.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.320
So people will ask, "are
there deleted scene?"

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.840
Yeah, but if they're deleted
there's a reason for that.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.970
My best example of that
was actually Paranormalcy,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.360
which is my first book,
and I ended up cutting

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.130
about forty pages before
I sent it out to editors.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.750
And one of the scenes was this
day when Evie goes to high school

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.810
and it was adorable and she got
to go to high school and she got

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.920
to make all of these jokes
relating it to teen dramas on TV

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.590
and it just kind of
went on and on and on

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.360
because I was having fun writing it
and I was having fun giving her all

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.670
of those experiences, but what
it did was it dragged the plot

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.290
to a standstill and it sucked all

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.390
of the narrative tension
out of the book.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.750
And so my friend and critique
partner Stephanie Perkins,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.730
who is brilliant, said, "This
doesn't need to be here."

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.720
And at first I was like,
"No, but I love it so much."

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.430
And then I realized OK it
doesn't need to be here.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.860
And those things that I
loved so much about it

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.890
like that really good joke or this
fun scene I could actually pull

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.900
out and put in other places.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.930
So out of the fifteen pages, there
were really only a few paragraphs

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.100
that I loved so much and I
used them somewhere else.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.450
So for me the editorial process is
just as important as the drafting

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.200
because the drafting gets
the story on the paper.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.520
I would say stories are
made in the first draft,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.870
books are made in editing.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.790
So I never get too attached and
often times I forget what I cut

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.390
because it's not essential
to the story.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.690
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.960
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:
And editors are great.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.880
Editors are so smart you guys.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.550
Editors are the best because
they can look at what you made

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.430
and say, "This is so good.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.730
I love this so much.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.030
Here's ten pages on
what you need to fix."

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.330
[ Laughter ]

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.520
And you're like, "OK."

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.050
But then they're right
on everything, so yeah.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.720
I've had people ask if I
would ever self-publish

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.010
because I have several manuscripts
that I've written completely

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.120
and that didn't for whatever
reason get published and I say no

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.740 position:56%
because I don't want to put out
anything that's not my absolute best

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.940
and I feel that editors make my
stuff [phonetic] my absolute best,

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.150
so it's important to
me to go through that.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.280
Do you have any other questions?

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.290
Yes?

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:33.470
&gt;&gt; How did you get like Radu
and Lada -the book starts

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.790
when they're smaller and they grow
up, how did you make that so real?

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.660
Because for me it was
very well written.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.960
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White:
Aw, thank you so much.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.990
I really wanted to start from
-it starts when they're born

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.290
and I wanted to start that way so
you could really see everything

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.570
that went into informing
who they are.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.120
I really like writing
sibling dynamics.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.530
I actually have four siblings,
three sisters and a brother,

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.600 position:56%
and then I always end up writing
really antagonistic really unhealthy

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.410
sibling relationships and they all
still like me so I guess I'm OK,

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.980
although when they were
reading one of my books all

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.780 position:56%
of my sisters not knowing the other
ones had done it texted me and said,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.210
"I'm kind of scared of you now."

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.160
And I was like, "You
knew me in high school,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.120
you should have been scared
of me a long time ago."

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.460
But yeah, I really, really
love writing sibling dynamics

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.890
because I think that these are
people that we don't choose,

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.320
but that we're connected to
our entire lives and that's

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.680
such an interesting and fraught
and rewarding relationship,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.440
so I really like writing those.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.740
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.040
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Hi.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.340
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.640
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: OK.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.960
&gt;&gt; My first is, and you
must get this a lot,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.590
not every aspiring writer is
going to get their first book

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.890
and it's going to be really good.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.340
What would you suggest,
like any tips,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.650
if you wanted to become a
writer, but you're not sure?

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.500
&gt;&gt; Kiersten White: Yeah,
well my first book that came

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.810
out was not my first book,
it was my fourth book,

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.770
so that right there, you know?

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.070
It takes a while.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.600
So my advice if you want
to be a writer is to read.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.600
Read very widely, read what's
popular, read classics,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.520
and look at it while you're
reading it, really pay attention.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.770
If you can't put it down,
what is the author doing

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.930
that is engaging your
interest so much?

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.650
And if you get bored and
you're losing interest,

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.760
what has the author done
that has let you say, "Meh.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.080
I don't really want to keep
reading this anymore."?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.030
Because reading is
really the best education

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.380
in writing that you can get.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.690
And then as far as
trying to get published,

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.080
it really is just a
matter of doing the work,

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.550 position:56%
of sitting down finishing the draft,
editing it, getting it as best

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.370
as you can, and then sending it out
there and starting the next thing.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.050
I actually started writing
Paranormalcy when another book

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.480
of mine was on submission to
editors, and nobody bought that.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.200
It's not a really fun way to do it.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.070
By the way, I really recommend
selling a book instead

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.450
of not selling a book,
its way more fun.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.470
But in the meantime I had
been writing Paranormalcy,

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.160
so when it was very clear that
first book wasn't going to sell,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.130
I had something else
and I had something else

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.760 position:56%
to give my agent and to go out with.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.780
And I didn't get an agent
right off the bat either,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.100
it took fifty letters, inquiry
letters you write to an agent

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.890
and you say, "Hey, I wrote this
book, do you want to read it?"

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.000
And they write back and say no
or they don't write back at all.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.810
So it took me fifty of
those to get an agent.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.830 position:56%
And then it took me my fourth book
to get published, so I say just keep

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.830
at it, that's really the best thing
you can do is just keep writing.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.070
And we're actually out of
time, but keep writing, OK?

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.370
It's worth it.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.670
And everything you
write you learn from,

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.130
there's no writing that's wasted.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.460
Thank you so much for coming.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.510
Thank you for choosing
me over Raina.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.200
[Applause]

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.450
Thank you.
