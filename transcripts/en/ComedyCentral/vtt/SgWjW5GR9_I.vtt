00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.174
I forgot they turn the A/C off
over the weekend.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.476
Why did we even wear
suits today? Nobody's here.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.645
I guess I was sort of
on autopilot this morning.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.847
Most of the time, I'm barely
paying attention

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.015
to what I'm doing.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:29.949
Sometimes I don't even
realize I'm at work

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.017
until I'm leaving
for the day.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.119
[ Slurps ] Oh!
That coffee's from Friday.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.388
If we're gonna be trapped
here on a holiday,

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.723
let's at least
be comfortable.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.692
Okay, we know basically
what they need to say.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.460
Let's just throw some stuff
out there.

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:42.628
All right.
How about this?

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.398
"Hi. I'm Kate,
and this is John,

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.200
and we're responsible
for a string of murders

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.335
across Central Florida
in 2003."

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.505
"Hi. I'm Kate, and this is John,
and for the next few minutes,

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.074
try not to imagine us
having terrifying sex."

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.809
Hi. I'm Kate,
and this is John,

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.212
and we flew here today
on a private fucking jet

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.881
to tell you about how the
environment is in trouble.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:05.218
Are you giving a speech or
guiding a plane on the tarmac?

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.686
I'm using my hands
to speak.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.688
Any good public speaker
will tell you

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.490
that the hands are
the mouth of the torso.

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.292
No one will
tell you that.

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.329
But if they did,
they would use...their hands.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.497
Okay. How about this
for a second sentence?

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.033
"Hampton DeVille
is going green."

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.736
Ohh!
Powerful. Sorkin-esque.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.039
This is really starting
to come together.
