that way again power consumption is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
that way again power consumption is
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.950

just add the permission to your app and

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739
just add the permission to your app and
 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.530
just add the permission to your app and
within the description of the app

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540
within the description of the app
 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.180
within the description of the app
explain what you're using the permission

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190
explain what you're using the permission
 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.900

for that said you should only really
 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.569
for that said you should only really
have to explain it if it

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579
have to explain it if it
 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.819
have to explain it if it

apparent from the description of your
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.589
apparent from the description of your
app like if your app is something that

you don't need to explain the permission

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849
you don't need to explain the permission

people understand I interact with SMS

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620
people understand I interact with SMS
 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.100
people understand I interact with SMS
therefore I need the SMS permission if

believe it's currently possible to

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890
believe it's currently possible to
 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.560
believe it's currently possible to
measure the power consumption in

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570
measure the power consumption in
 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.750
measure the power consumption in

app specifically also measure your app

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850
app specifically also measure your app
 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.600
app specifically also measure your app
but the butter but if the consumption is

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610
but the butter but if the consumption is
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.430
but the butter but if the consumption is
going through the location manager yeah

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440
going through the location manager yeah
 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.870
going through the location manager yeah
location manager is not going to be

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880
location manager is not going to be
 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.400
location manager is not going to be
bundled together with your apps right

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410
bundled together with your apps right
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.960
bundled together with your apps right
yeah you know you're not going to get

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970
yeah you know you're not going to get
 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.450
yeah you know you're not going to get
the stats you want there I can explain

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460
the stats you want there I can explain
 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.240
the stats you want there I can explain
how we do it on the Android ench team

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250
how we do it on the Android ench team
 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.400
how we do it on the Android ench team
and it's a little bit cumbersome but we

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410
and it's a little bit cumbersome but we
 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.780
and it's a little bit cumbersome but we
actually we have a box that actually

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:58.790
actually we have a box that actually
 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.490
actually we have a box that actually
measures current draw from the phone and

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500
measures current draw from the phone and
 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.680
measures current draw from the phone and
so we'll plug a phone into that instead

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690
so we'll plug a phone into that instead
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.600
so we'll plug a phone into that instead
of to a battery you know it goes where

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610
of to a battery you know it goes where
 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.950
of to a battery you know it goes where
the battery contacts normally would be

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960
the battery contacts normally would be
 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.170
the battery contacts normally would be
and then we'll measure the actual power

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180
and then we'll measure the actual power
 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.910
and then we'll measure the actual power
consumption coming out of the device and

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920
consumption coming out of the device and
 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.830
consumption coming out of the device and
so this is a hardware solution and it is

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840
so this is a hardware solution and it is
 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.170
so this is a hardware solution and it is
a bit specialized but destiny gets you

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180
a bit specialized but destiny gets you
 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.360
a bit specialized but destiny gets you
the most accurate numbers hopefully for

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370
the most accurate numbers hopefully for
 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.490
the most accurate numbers hopefully for
some future release of Android will go

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500
some future release of Android will go
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.810
some future release of Android will go
and improve the reporting we're always

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820
and improve the reporting we're always
 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.400
and improve the reporting we're always
trying to go and give developers more

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410
trying to go and give developers more
 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.230
trying to go and give developers more
metrics especially for something as

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240
metrics especially for something as
 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.180
metrics especially for something as
critical as battery life but

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190
critical as battery life but
 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.460
critical as battery life but
unfortunately the feature you're looking

unfortunately the feature you're looking
 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.800
unfortunately the feature you're looking
for just isn't part of Android so sorry

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810
for just isn't part of Android so sorry
 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.360
for just isn't part of Android so sorry

you could go and use something like a

I actually did a code lab at Google i/o

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559
I actually did a code lab at Google i/o
 

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:08.330
I actually did a code lab at Google i/o
on exactly this topic so if you go to I

possibly that sounds about right search

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.090
possibly that sounds about right search
 

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.470
possibly that sounds about right search
for google i/o go to code labs and

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480
for google i/o go to code labs and
 

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.409
for google i/o go to code labs and
you'll see a code lab from me Trevor

code that'll do exactly what you'd like
to do so

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480
to do so
 

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.980
to do so
hopefully that helps yeah okay um did

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:57.990
hopefully that helps yeah okay um did
 

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.230
hopefully that helps yeah okay um did
you use thread pools and cashing in that

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240
you use thread pools and cashing in that
 

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.150
you use thread pools and cashing in that
example I didn't those were the other

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.160
example I didn't those were the other
 

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.710
example I didn't those were the other
things I was that I was trying to

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720
things I was that I was trying to
 

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.680
things I was that I was trying to
remember so yeah actually did I use

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:06.690
remember so yeah actually did I use
 

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.600
remember so yeah actually did I use
caching I did some in-memory caching so

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:08.610
caching I did some in-memory caching so
 

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.830
caching I did some in-memory caching so
yeah that does nothing you have to watch

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840
yeah that does nothing you have to watch
 

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.169
yeah that does nothing you have to watch
out for if you're fetching images from

00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179
out for if you're fetching images from
 

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:13.789
out for if you're fetching images from
the network or you're resizing images

00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799
the network or you're resizing images
 

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.890
the network or you're resizing images
things like that caching is definitely

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900
things like that caching is definitely
 

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.820
things like that caching is definitely
something you'll want to keep in mind to

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:16.830
something you'll want to keep in mind to
 

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.610
something you'll want to keep in mind to
keep CPU consumption low thread pools

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620
keep CPU consumption low thread pools
 

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.720
keep CPU consumption low thread pools
are certainly a good way to go and

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:22.730
are certainly a good way to go and
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.440
are certainly a good way to go and
improve the performance of all this so

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.450
improve the performance of all this so
 

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.600
improve the performance of all this so
again lots of different ways you can do

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:29.610
again lots of different ways you can do
 

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.370
again lots of different ways you can do
it it's beat but the key thing you need

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380
it it's beat but the key thing you need
 

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.350
it it's beat but the key thing you need
to know is you need to move your image

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360
to know is you need to move your image
 

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.960
to know is you need to move your image
loading out of the UI thread absolutely

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:35.970
loading out of the UI thread absolutely
 

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.000
loading out of the UI thread absolutely
it is you can use to do that movie the

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.010
it is you can use to do that movie the
 

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.169
it is you can use to do that movie the
image loading out of the UI thread and

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179
image loading out of the UI thread and
 

00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:40.220
image loading out of the UI thread and
you'll get the nice buttery smooth

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:40.230
you'll get the nice buttery smooth
 

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.020
you'll get the nice buttery smooth
scrolling and that's just to simply

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.030
scrolling and that's just to simply
 

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.549
scrolling and that's just to simply
simply a matter of how do you want to go

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559
simply a matter of how do you want to go
 

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:45.169
simply a matter of how do you want to go
and display this data when it comes in

00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179
and display this data when it comes in
 

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:46.640
and display this data when it comes in
you want to do a fade you want have a

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:46.650
you want to do a fade you want have a
 

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.620
you want to do a fade you want have a
spinner we have watched your placeholder

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:48.630
spinner we have watched your placeholder
 

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.840
spinner we have watched your placeholder
image be you know that's all decisions

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:50.850
image be you know that's all decisions
 

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.950
image be you know that's all decisions
that's up to you as an application

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960
that's up to you as an application
 

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.090
that's up to you as an application
developer uh one other thing i noticed i

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100
developer uh one other thing i noticed i
 

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.590
developer uh one other thing i noticed i
don't know if this is true but he

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600
don't know if this is true but he
 

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.560
don't know if this is true but he
mentioned that it uh it Scrolls like

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:00.570
mentioned that it uh it Scrolls like
 

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.510
mentioned that it uh it Scrolls like
while it's scrolling quickly none of the

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520
while it's scrolling quickly none of the
 

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.620
while it's scrolling quickly none of the
images were getting loaded and waits

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:03.630
images were getting loaded and waits
 

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.169
images were getting loaded and waits
until it slows down before loading

00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179
until it slows down before loading
 

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:08.659
until it slows down before loading
images i was just poking around on the

00:26:08.659 --> 00:26:08.669
images i was just poking around on the
 

00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:10.400
images i was just poking around on the
internet to figure out how this is done

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.410
internet to figure out how this is done
 

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.799
internet to figure out how this is done
and basically if you want to set that up

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:12.809
and basically if you want to set that up
 

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:15.650
and basically if you want to set that up
so that it doesn't bother loading images

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:15.660
so that it doesn't bother loading images
 

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.530
so that it doesn't bother loading images
until the scrolling slows down what you

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:18.540
until the scrolling slows down what you
 

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.480
until the scrolling slows down what you
want to do is override the on scroll

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.490
want to do is override the on scroll
 

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.330
want to do is override the on scroll
method in the or created on scroll

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340
method in the or created on scroll
 

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.909
method in the or created on scroll
listener override the on scroll method

00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919
listener override the on scroll method
 

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:28.520
listener override the on scroll method
and that's going to pass you a first

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.530
and that's going to pass you a first
 

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.650
and that's going to pass you a first
visible item variable what we're going

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:30.660
visible item variable what we're going
 

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.200
visible item variable what we're going
to do is check for the last time the

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.210

in mind you could just always take your

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:41.140
in mind you could just always take your
 

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.290
in mind you could just always take your
data and you again run it through some

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:43.300
data and you again run it through some
 

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.480
data and you again run it through some
sort of symmetric cipher like AES and

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.490
sort of symmetric cipher like AES and
 

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.010
sort of symmetric cipher like AES and
write it out and then when you read it

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:47.020
write it out and then when you read it
 

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.480
write it out and then when you read it
back in you'll you can decrypt it the

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:48.490
back in you'll you can decrypt it the
 

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.580
back in you'll you can decrypt it the
same way the thing you have to keep in

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:50.590
same way the thing you have to keep in
 

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.080
same way the thing you have to keep in
mind though is just you're gonna have to

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.090
mind though is just you're gonna have to
 

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.380
mind though is just you're gonna have to
have as much space in memory you know

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:55.390

content provider model does have this

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:10.470
content provider model does have this
 

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.670
content provider model does have this
notion of columns and all right you do

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680
notion of columns and all right you do
 

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.530
notion of columns and all right you do
have a fixed list of columns and if you

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540
have a fixed list of columns and if you
 

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.740
have a fixed list of columns and if you
don't have that content provider you you

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:18.750
don't have that content provider you you
 

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.030
don't have that content provider you you
have this impedance mismatch that's

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040
have this impedance mismatch that's
 

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.809
have this impedance mismatch that's
going to make it a little bit difficult

00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819
going to make it a little bit difficult
 

00:43:20.819 --> 00:43:23.960
going to make it a little bit difficult
to use now I think one way you could do

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:23.970
to use now I think one way you could do
 

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.880
to use now I think one way you could do
this is actually just take your data and

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:27.890
this is actually just take your data and
 

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.290
this is actually just take your data and
rotate it and make it into key value

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300
rotate it and make it into key value
 

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.940
rotate it and make it into key value
pairs so you know each key would be a

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:31.950
pairs so you know each key would be a
 

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.400
pairs so you know each key would be a
column and each value would be the

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:34.410
column and each value would be the
 

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.579
column and each value would be the
contents of that column you and they

00:43:37.579 --> 00:43:37.589
contents of that column you and they
 

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:39.620
contents of that column you and they
basically you just have to two columns

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:39.630
basically you just have to two columns
 

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.790
basically you just have to two columns
right you'd have your key column you'd

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800
right you'd have your key column you'd
 

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.530
right you'd have your key column you'd
have your value column and then you'd

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540
have your value column and then you'd
 

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.450
have your value column and then you'd
iterate through that for each record so

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460
iterate through that for each record so
 

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.980
iterate through that for each record so
you would then have to go you know two

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:45.990
you would then have to go you know two
 

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.510
you would then have to go you know two
levels deep right you'd have your first

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520
levels deep right you'd have your first
 

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.000
levels deep right you'd have your first
record which would be a pointer to your

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.010
record which would be a pointer to your
 

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.130
record which would be a pointer to your
key value collection and then you would

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140
key value collection and then you would
 

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.020
key value collection and then you would
have a second set a second collection of

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.030
have a second set a second collection of
 

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.670
have a second set a second collection of
Records which is each key value pair

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680
Records which is each key value pair
 

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.150
Records which is each key value pair
from your table now i'll also give a

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160
from your table now i'll also give a
 

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.829
from your table now i'll also give a

00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839
plug the 22 you know there's things like
 

00:44:02.839 --> 00:44:05.540

personally but would be interesting to

00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619
personally but would be interesting to
 

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:09.020
personally but would be interesting to
see how they go and approach this North

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.030
see how they go and approach this North
 

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.220
see how they go and approach this North
enough they provide any functionality

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:10.230
enough they provide any functionality
 

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.950
enough they provide any functionality
for you out of the box but I think

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960
for you out of the box but I think
 

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.150
for you out of the box but I think
that's probably gonna be the only way

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160
that's probably gonna be the only way
 

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.349
that's probably gonna be the only way
you can actually solve this well

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359
you can actually solve this well
 

00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:18.740
you can actually solve this well
actually using a content provider is is

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:18.750
actually using a content provider is is
 

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.470
actually using a content provider is is
that is that solution going to be

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480
that is that solution going to be
 

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.089
that is that solution going to be
generally workable across all no sequel

00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099
generally workable across all no sequel
 

00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:25.339
generally workable across all no sequel
I mean are all no sequel database is

00:44:25.339 --> 00:44:25.349
I mean are all no sequel database is
 

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:27.470
I mean are all no sequel database is
structured roughly the same way most of

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480
structured roughly the same way most of
 

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.110
structured roughly the same way most of
them do

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:28.120
them do
 

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.660
them do
you have the appearance of so yes you

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:30.670
you have the appearance of so yes you
 

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.930
you have the appearance of so yes you
have a record which contains a number of

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:33.940
have a record which contains a number of
 

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.200
have a record which contains a number of
you know fields you know which is

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.210
you know fields you know which is
 

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.580
you know fields you know which is
equivalent to a column in a sequel

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:38.590
equivalent to a column in a sequel
 

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:42.080
equivalent to a column in a sequel
database but typically those fields are

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.090
database but typically those fields are
 

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.610
database but typically those fields are
mutable right you don't have a fixed

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:44.620
mutable right you don't have a fixed
 

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.980
mutable right you don't have a fixed
schema for each record and so that

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:46.990
schema for each record and so that
 

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.360
schema for each record and so that
that's where the problem comes from so

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:48.370
that's where the problem comes from so
 

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.830
that's where the problem comes from so
much them still do have something

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:49.840
much them still do have something
 

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.270
much them still do have something
similar to a column it's just that four

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280
similar to a column it's just that four
 

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.030
similar to a column it's just that four
columns can change so that's that's

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040
columns can change so that's that's
 

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.680
columns can change so that's that's
where the problems gonna come from most

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:55.690
where the problems gonna come from most
 

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.720
where the problems gonna come from most
of them do follow that general model

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:57.730
of them do follow that general model
 

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:00.270
of them do follow that general model
well but did the number of just off the

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280
well but did the number of just off the
 

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.950
well but did the number of just off the
top of my head to the number of columns

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960
top of my head to the number of columns
 

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.950
top of my head to the number of columns
in a record change yeah they do again

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960
in a record change yeah they do again
 

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.620
in a record change yeah they do again
now you could go and just have you know

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:07.630
now you could go and just have you know
 

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.300
now you could go and just have you know
say I'm going to support up to 20

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:09.310
say I'm going to support up to 20
 

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.850
say I'm going to support up to 20
columns or up to 200 columns and just

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:11.860
columns or up to 200 columns and just
 

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.650
columns or up to 200 columns and just
name them your data one data to data

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:13.660
name them your data one data to data
 

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.740
name them your data one data to data
three and you need some sort of you

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:16.750
three and you need some sort of you
 

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.420
three and you need some sort of you
still need some way to go and map you

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:18.430
still need some way to go and map you
 

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.400
still need some way to go and map you
know those columns to the actual field

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:20.410
know those columns to the actual field
 

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.850
know those columns to the actual field
names right but well if it works for

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:23.860
names right but well if it works for
 

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.950
names right but well if it works for
your app that might be work around I was

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960
your app that might be work around I was
 

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.470
your app that might be work around I was
going to say that um if that's the sort

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480
going to say that um if that's the sort
 

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.740
going to say that um if that's the sort
of thing that you're talking about we

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:30.750

content provider and it has the concept

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520
content provider and it has the concept
 

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.040
content provider and it has the concept
in its data table of I'm not sure how I

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.050
in its data table of I'm not sure how I
 

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.290
in its data table of I'm not sure how I
would put it you have to look at table

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:52.300
would put it you have to look at table
 

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.050
would put it you have to look at table
that match it maps column names too it's

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:55.060
that match it maps column names too it's
 

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.180
that match it maps column names too it's
not really a lookup table what it is is

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:57.190
not really a lookup table what it is is
 

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:01.680
not really a lookup table what it is is
that data has records all have a fixed

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:01.690
that data has records all have a fixed
 

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.110
that data has records all have a fixed
number of columns but then the semantics

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:04.120
number of columns but then the semantics
 

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.780
number of columns but then the semantics
of the column changes depending on what

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:06.790
of the column changes depending on what
 

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.480
of the column changes depending on what
the mind type of the record is so that

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:09.490
the mind type of the record is so that
 

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.490
the mind type of the record is so that
if you read read a record and you know

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:11.500
if you read read a record and you know
 

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.500
if you read read a record and you know
that its mind type is a phone mind type

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:13.510
that its mind type is a phone mind type
 

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:16.730
that its mind type is a phone mind type
then the data one column maps to UM

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740
then the data one column maps to UM
 

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.960
then the data one column maps to UM
something that's really a phone number

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:18.970
something that's really a phone number

something that's really a phone number
right there are these databases even

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040
right there are these databases even
 

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.520
right there are these databases even
with the similar record type the fields

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:23.530
with the similar record type the fields
 

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.620
with the similar record type the fields
can change that be difficult right yeah

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:25.630
can change that be difficult right yeah
 

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.020
can change that be difficult right yeah
if you do have at least some stability

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:28.030
if you do have at least some stability
 

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.870
if you do have at least some stability
there that might be work around one

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880
there that might be work around one

something like that it's it's an

there was still a lot of stuff in there
 

00:47:35.079 --> 00:47:36.839
there was still a lot of stuff in there
well seems you have these columns and

00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:36.849
well seems you have these columns and
 

00:47:36.849 --> 00:47:38.249
well seems you have these columns and
the columns don't have to map to a

00:47:38.249 --> 00:47:38.259
the columns don't have to map to a
 

00:47:38.259 --> 00:47:40.410
the columns don't have to map to a

I would I would say that the idea of the

I would I would say that the idea of the

I would I would say that the idea of the
content provider is that it has

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:45.630
content provider is that it has
 

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:50.120
content provider is that it has
semantics for specifying queries and

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.130
semantics for specifying queries and
 

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.279
semantics for specifying queries and
modifications and also has semantics for

00:47:53.279 --> 00:47:53.289
modifications and also has semantics for
 

00:47:53.289 --> 00:47:56.789
modifications and also has semantics for
what the return that what what should be

00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:56.799
what the return that what what should be
 

00:47:56.799 --> 00:47:58.920
what the return that what what should be
returned and other than that it doesn't

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:58.930
returned and other than that it doesn't
 

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.269
returned and other than that it doesn't
specify anything about the

00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:00.279
specify anything about the
 

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:02.759
specify anything about the
implementation this means that if you

00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:02.769
implementation this means that if you
 

00:48:02.769 --> 00:48:04.859
implementation this means that if you
have something which doesn't fit into

00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:04.869
have something which doesn't fit into
 

00:48:04.869 --> 00:48:08.759

database then you're going to have to do

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:10.809
database then you're going to have to do
 

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:13.079
database then you're going to have to do
more work inside the content provider on

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:13.089
more work inside the content provider on
 

00:48:13.089 --> 00:48:15.990
more work inside the content provider on
and it's really difficult for us to give

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000
and it's really difficult for us to give
 

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.269
and it's really difficult for us to give
a definitive answer about what that work

00:48:18.269 --> 00:48:18.279
a definitive answer about what that work
 

00:48:18.279 --> 00:48:21.660
a definitive answer about what that work
would be if other than being able to

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:21.670
would be if other than being able to
 

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.999
would be if other than being able to
look in detail at your problem but what

00:48:23.999 --> 00:48:24.009
look in detail at your problem but what
 

00:48:24.009 --> 00:48:27.420
look in detail at your problem but what
we've covered is there's way to mimic no

you know using generic columns this is
 

00:48:34.569 --> 00:48:36.839
you know using generic columns this is
what I would use there's ways of doing

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:36.849
what I would use there's ways of doing
 

00:48:36.849 --> 00:48:39.480
what I would use there's ways of doing
it with storing the information about a

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:39.490
it with storing the information about a
 

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.550
it with storing the information about a
column you

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560
column you
 

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.640
column you
the column and then there's ways of

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:43.650
the column and then there's ways of
 

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:47.540
the column and then there's ways of
doing it by just having a no SQL

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:47.550
doing it by just having a no SQL
 

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.760
doing it by just having a no SQL
database within the content provider and

then doing transformations and I'm going

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:52.860
then doing transformations and I'm going
 

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.950
then doing transformations and I'm going
to recommend one other possible or crowd

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960
to recommend one other possible or crowd
 

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.830
to recommend one other possible or crowd
here and I feel guilty recommending this

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:57.840
here and I feel guilty recommending this
 

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.920
here and I feel guilty recommending this
because it's not the Android way but you

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:00.930
because it's not the Android way but you
 

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.440
because it's not the Android way but you
could actually create a service and add

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:03.450
could actually create a service and add
 

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.350
could actually create a service and add
a binder interface that'll let you you

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:06.360
a binder interface that'll let you you
 

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.810
a binder interface that'll let you you
know actually you know transfer the data

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:08.820
know actually you know transfer the data
 

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.850
know actually you know transfer the data
in whatever format you like and avoid

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:10.860
in whatever format you like and avoid
 

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.340
in whatever format you like and avoid
the content provider interface if you're

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:13.350
the content provider interface if you're
 

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.360
the content provider interface if you're
exporting your data to other

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:14.370
exporting your data to other
 

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.190
exporting your data to other
applications this is probably not the

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200
applications this is probably not the
 

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.350
applications this is probably not the
right way to go but if this data is only

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:18.360
right way to go but if this data is only
 

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.140
right way to go but if this data is only
being consumed within your applications

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:20.150
being consumed within your applications
 

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:22.910
being consumed within your applications
then you know that suddenly becomes a

then you know that suddenly becomes a
 

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.580
then you know that suddenly becomes a
lot more workable or even if it is there

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:25.590
lot more workable or even if it is there
 

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.230

other applications you could even ship a

other applications you could even ship a
 

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.550
other applications you could even ship a
client library something like that but

there's some some fields in there to go
and add additional metadata and that'll

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:13.290
and add additional metadata and that'll
 

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:15.680
and add additional metadata and that'll
get you you know something a lot similar
