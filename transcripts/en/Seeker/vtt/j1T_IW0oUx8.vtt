00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.840
Sooooo like....how do you fairly and justly
execute someone?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.820
...I'm asking for a friend.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.370
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.140
Did yall hear about what happened in Oklahoma?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.680
Ah man....really disturbing.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.500
I'll spare you the details, but basically
there was an execution and the state botched

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.400
it; so botched that some are calling what
happened unconstitutional, a form of cruel

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.980
and unusual punishment.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.189
In the wake of the chilling incident, one
of the most comprehensive reviews of the death

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.219
penalty in the USA has been released by a
bipartisan research group and panel of criminal

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.899
justice experts called The Constitution Project.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.820
The report doesn't take a STANCE on the death
penalty, what it does is look over the 32

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.190
states where the death penalty is legal and
offers some *humble suggestions* for those

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
states.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.499
The experts agree that what happened in Oklahoma
should never have gone down -- it was the

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.409
result of an untested drug cocktail that wasn't
administered by trained medical staff.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.440
As it turns out, qualified professionals who
are willing to administer the death penalty

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.959
are kinda hard to come by.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.649
Historically, during an execution, states
are pretty secretive about all these details.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.380
The report states that there needs to be more
transparency about where the drugs come from,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.899
who's administering what, and that these drug
cocktails?

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.280
They've gotta go.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.520
Instead, they advise that states adopt a single
drug method.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.500
This is actually already in place in 8 states.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.640
Another centerpiece of the 216 page report
is a discussion about executing the innocent.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.560
You know, just casual dinner chatter.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.340
They advise that only evidence obtained by
INDEPENDENT, ACCREDITED forensic labs be allowed

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.810
in capital punishment cases.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.600
Currently, there are no strict federal standards
and some labs have been accused of working

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.159
with law enforcement -- leaving room for bias.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.310
The Innocence Project, a DNA testing organization,
found that of 225 wrongful convictions, half

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.640
of them involved improper tests done at labs
without accreditation.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.590
Folks, that's....a lot of bad science...which
is kind of a problem when we're talking about

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.929
killing someone....

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.229
Along the same lines, the report addressed
serious concerns about executing the mentally

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.229
ill.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.799
Because that's a thing that happens, even
though it's illegal.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.080
This is because in some states, what the government
defines as "intellectually disabled" is different

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.120
than how clinicians and scientists define
it.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.360
So the report also suggests scientific standards
and procedures for testing intellectual disabilities.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.790
One of the members of the project, Mark Earley,
who himself was the Republican attorney general

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.770
of Virginia while 36 executions took place,
said quote "We hope these recommendations

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.680
will be embraced by officials from both parties
in Washington and around the country.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.050
There's nothing conservative about executing
an innocent person, and leaders who support

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.280
the death penalty bear the greatest responsibility
in ensuring it is administered more fairly."

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.630
Welp, that's a whole lot to chew on -- and
that's only a few of the 39 policy recommendations!

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.260
Let me know what you folks think about the
report down below and I'll catch you next

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.580
time with more DNews updates!
