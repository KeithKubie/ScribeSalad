1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.670
Okay.
So today we're going to study our asymmetric information.

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.320
It's our last week and we're going to focus on signaling today.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.130
And I'll spell it with one hour here as a concessions to the Americans.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.910
All right,
so we're going to look,
we're going to dry this class,
the two parts.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.090
And for the first part we're going to focus on the case where there is some very

6
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:26.270
flyable verifiable

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.300
<v 1>information in the problem.</v>

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.120
<v 0>All right,
so we'll see what this means in a while.</v>

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.200
But let me just set up an example and we'll see where that takes us.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.010
So whatever turn to a game,
we know well by this stage,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.660
which is the Corno game.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.030
So there's two firms and they're competing in corners,

13
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.870
they're competing in quantities,
and we'll call the firms a and B.

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.870
And suppose that from B has costs,

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.360
so you'd be more formal.

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.370
These are constant marginal costs are equal to see m where m means middle or

17
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.750
medium or something,
and Fermi,

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.350
Fermi also has costs.

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.550
But those costs could come in one of three types.

20
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.490
It could be that from a has high costs and high costs are equal to middle costs

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.350
plus a little bit and it could be that from a also has medium costs and it could

22
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:40.151
be that from B from a has low costs and the low cost I just the medium costs

23
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.540
minus a little bit.
All right.

24
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.020
Now before this competition is going to take place before the actually going to

25
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:56.021
play the Cornell game from a has an opportunity for me is opportunity is to

26
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:01.700
reveal its costs to from sorry.
Yeah,

27
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:06.701
from a an opportunity to reveal its cost to firm B just to make them make this

28
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:11.540
more explicit initially from be obviously knows his own cost and sit there is

29
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:16.250
any one type from a obviously knows those cost as well as a firm a and firm B,

30
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.370
know what from bees costs are,
but initially,

31
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:24.371
although from a knows her own costs from B does not know from aes costs.

32
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.330
All right,
let's write that up.

33
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.610
<v 1>So from B
knows only</v>

34
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.270
it's costs
and from a

35
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.260
knows both costs.
Right.

36
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.830
<v 0>The key decision we're going to focus on is that from a has an opportunity to</v>

37
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:56.340
reveal its true costs to firm B.

38
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.360
Now I can do so in a verifiable way.
For example,
it could hire an accountant.

39
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.680
That accountant from a reputable outside firm could come in and,

40
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.280
and do the accounts for from a and then publish them in the Wall Street Journal

41
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.680
or something.
All right,
so for me,
I can do that.

42
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.430
And let's assume it's costless for it to do that.
All right,
so for me,

43
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.870
can costlessly

44
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.850
and verifiably

45
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.180
very fine verifiably reveal

46
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.640
<v 1>it's costs
to be.</v>

47
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.500
<v 0>And the question is this gonna happen before they play core?
No.
The question is,</v>

48
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.940
should from a reveal those costs or not,

49
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.310
right?
Should from a publicizing giveaway,
it's informational advantage.

50
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:58.200
If you'd like to firm B by telling from B what it's cost look like.
Alright,

51
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.640
so what do people think?
Let me just grab the mic and ask people a little bit.

52
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.550
Imagine you're the manager of from a,
from a,

53
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.700
are you gonna gonna tell B what your costs are or not wave a hand on their

54
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.950
shoulders.
Cold call here.
Let me cold call.
So,
so what's your name,
sir?
You,

55
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.180
you,
and,
and,
and,
and uh,
so I suppose you're the manager of firms.

56
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.540
Would you reveal the information or not?
Uh,

57
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:28.800
I would tell them only if my costs are lower.
All right.
So,
so you says I would,

58
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.790
I would reveal the information only if my costs were lower.
Now why,

59
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:36.870
why do you want to reveal the cost if you have lower costs?
Because they're,

60
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:41.700
my firms will produce out of lower costs,
so from B will,
um,

61
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.260
produce less because they know that we'll get most of the market.
Good.
Good.

62
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.730
So the point that it's used.
All right,

63
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.380
so the point that you is making is there may be some advantage in having the

64
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:56.280
other side?
No,
my costs,
if my costs are low,

65
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.760
since that may induce the other side to produce less,

66
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:03.900
let's just fill out that argument by putting in the corner diagrams or here's

67
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:07.410
the corner diagram.
Here's the quantity for from a,

68
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.390
here's the quantity for firm B.
Yeah.

69
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.960
And here is the best response or reaction curve for firm B.

70
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.280
All right.
And in this picture,

71
00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:23.270
there's going to be three different possible reaction curves for from a,

72
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.230
each one corresponding to different costs.
So for example,

73
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.340
this could be the reaction curve or the best response for from a in the case in

74
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:37.610
which is medium.
All right?
But if it had lower costs,

75
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.240
what would happen to that reaction code?
But it's shift in,
would it tell,

76
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.920
tells what,
what happened to it.
So much I did out,

77
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.560
which shift out or I've had lower costs,

78
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.710
then it would shift out.

79
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:52.580
So this would be the best response for from a in the low case.

80
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.700
And conversely,
this would be the best response

81
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.270
for fun.
A in the high case.
All right,
so the point that,
uh,

82
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.920
that you as a is making on,

83
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:06.440
he should correct me if this is unfairly paraphrasing him,

84
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.060
is if I have low costs them,

85
00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.190
I want the other side to know I have low costs because that puts us into,
uh,

86
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.030
into the,
into the equilibrium in which this is my best response curve.

87
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.250
And this is the other side's best response curve.

88
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.410
And from B ends up producing less.
And I end up lowering,

89
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.320
lowering its production.
Is that right?
Is that right?

90
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.250
So the key idea here is that this is a game and we've had often,

91
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.660
this is a game of strategic substitutes.

92
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.360
So if I have low costs,

93
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.010
I want the other side to know that I have low costs because it will cut back its

94
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.070
production,
which helps me.
All right?
On the other hand,

95
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.730
if I have high costs,
if I have high costs,

96
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.560
then I kind of liked to remain hidden.
I don't,

97
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:57.800
I really don't want the other side to know that I have high costs.
All right?

98
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:00.800
Because I have a high costs than the other phone is actually going to increase

99
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:04.790
their production.
And that's gonna hurt me.
All right.

100
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.790
But notice I've twisted the question a little bit.

101
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.590
The question I actually asked you was would you reveal the information about

102
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:17.450
your costs?
And I flipped that around to a slightly easier question,
which is,

103
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.080
what would I like the other side to know?
All right.

104
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.730
Now what would it like the other side to know?

105
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.980
I'd like the other side to know if I have low costs,

106
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.560
I'd like the other side note to know if I have high cost,

107
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.210
but that's not quite the question we asked.

108
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.860
The question we asked was would you given whatever your cost star reveal that

109
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:35.060
information to the other side.

110
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.490
And I think what you is told us is to take that what he said.

111
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.990
If you said if I had low costs,
I'm going to reveal it to the other side.

112
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.330
Is that right now?
All right,
so so far,
what do we know so far?
We know

113
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.630
that if I have low costs

114
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.150
<v 1>then I will reveal it.</v>

115
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.423
All right,

116
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.340
<v 0>so you probably know that.
But what if I don't have low costs?</v>

117
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.570
What if I have middling costs or high costs?

118
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.390
Wow.
Let's take these in turn.
What about height?

119
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.860
What about middling costs?
What should I do if I have middle,

120
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.160
middle level costs?
All right,
so somebody sort of hand that was,

121
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:30.470
let me go and take advantage of that and hang on,
I'll come back.

122
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.490
What's your name?
Shout out

123
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.840
<v 2>Alec.
Um,
shout it out to people.
The hair.
Alec,
go ahead.</v>

124
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:42.090
I think he should still review because they know if you had low costs you would

125
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:47.170
reveal and so if you had a middle costs and you didn't reveal,

126
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:52.120
then they could think that you either had middle costs or high costs and it's

127
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:55.980
better for you to just reveal that you had middle costs.
Good.
So good.

128
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.170
<v 0>Never had to people here that,
let me just repeat that.
All right,</v>

129
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.490
so you might think you might think if I have middle costs,

130
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.750
you might think that I could reveal or not reveal depending on what the other

131
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.400
side thought.
However,

132
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:13.401
what onyx arguing correctly is if I don't reveal that I have middle costs,

133
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240
the other side from B knows that my costs are not low.

134
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.990
The only way they could mistake me if they could think I'm a high cost farm,

135
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.041
they know him.

136
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:30.060
No low cost from how do they know I'm going to low cost phone because the low

137
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.450
cost firm would have revealed that was used arguments.
All right,
so let's see.

138
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.560
This low cost firms are revealing.
If I'm a middle cost from,

139
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.040
if I don't reveal no one's really any doubt,
I'm not a low cost form,

140
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.550
so all I could be is a middle cost from or a high cost from all I can have is

141
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.940
this reaction curve,

142
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.600
which is the one I actually have or this reaction curve.

143
00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.390
So if I don't reveal,
then the other side might think that I have high,

144
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.070
I have high costs,

145
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.550
in which case they're actually going to increase their production and hurting
me.

146
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.930
Hang on a second.
All right,

147
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.850
so since since the low cost from is going to reveal the medium cost wants to

148
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:15.810
reveal to ensure that no one thinks it's high cost.
All right,

149
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:19.230
so that's a low cost reveals and therefore

150
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.060
therefore see and reveals as well

151
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.570
<v 1>to prevent,
prevent being</v>

152
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.080
mistaken

153
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.530
<v 0>for a high cost from now.
There was a question,</v>

154
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:42.110
let me come down and collect the question.

155
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.650
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.390
<v 3>you're just going to ask,</v>

157
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.970
but if you have ever reveal cir both for the lower and middle cost,

158
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:51.190
then they're obviously going to know and he's a high cost,

159
00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:53.570
which means that the concealing doesn't do any good.

160
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.460
<v 0>Exactly,
exactly.
And your name is Bethany.</v>

161
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.320
So Bertha is pointing out that once we know the low cost types gonna reveal,

162
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.720
we know that the middle cost type is also going to reveal so as not to get

163
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:08.310
mistaken for being high cost,

164
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.790
which means if you're running a high cost from,

165
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.450
it really doesn't matter whether you reveal or not because you're going to be

166
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:19.710
revealed by the fact that you didn't really feel that,
right?
Right?

167
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.980
How'd you been low cost?
You would have revealed had you been middle cost,

168
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.800
you would have revealed and therefore whether you choose to reveal or not,

169
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:28.710
everyone knows that you are high cost.
So therefore,

170
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.483
<v 1>okay,</v>

171
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.540
<v 0>therefore</v>

172
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.930
<v 1>c h is revealed is revealed.</v>

173
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.560
<v 0>Everyone see that?
All right.
Okay.</v>

174
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.040
Now notice that this argument we've just constructed,

175
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.180
there were three types of fun,
high,
middle,
low.

176
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.690
But I constructed exactly the same argument,

177
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.620
albeit somewhat more tediously with a hundred for a hundred types of firms,

178
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.330
right?
Firms that had absolutely the lowest cost firms that had the 99th,
uh,

179
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:08.440
you know,
the 19th highest cost,
98 foot,
highest costs,
97 past cost.
And so on.

180
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.770
And this argument would have been exactly the same at each stage.

181
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.210
The from that left in the analysis who has the lowest cost,

182
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.310
we'll want to reveal to distinguish itself from those who haven't revealed quote

183
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.400
yet unquote.
Right.
And therefore we'll get unraveling and we'll,
we'll,

184
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.790
we'll get information to be revealed and notice,
interestingly,

185
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.020
we'll get information to be revealed beyond the median,
right?

186
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.090
So the 50 the 51st highest costs from or reveal,

187
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.140
therefore the 50th highest cost farmer of yield there for the 49th and so on.

188
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.780
In fact,
the only firm who owed explicitly,

189
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.610
actively reveal themselves is the firm who has absolutely the highest cost.

190
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.350
And as Bethany points out there going to be revealed anyway.
All right.
All right,

191
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.090
so this is an idea.
This idea is called informational

192
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.323
<v 1>unraveling</v>

193
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.250
<v 0>and again,
and keeping for my American audience,</v>

194
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:07.120
I'm going to put one hour in unraveling.
Is that right?

195
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:08.260
There's one Ellen in America,
right?

196
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.710
So much of just check that on Google or something.
I think that's correct.

197
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.640
All right.
All right.
What's the lesson here?

198
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.990
So one lesson is that this happens.
We'll come back to that,
but another lesson,

199
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:24.370
perhaps the more important lesson is often the lack of information,

200
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.800
the lack of somebody signaling to you,

201
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.910
the lack of somebody trying to tell you something,
conveys information by,

202
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.310
this was the point that Bethany was making.

203
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.500
The fact that the high cost from doesn't in fact go out from reveal information

204
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.740
to you reveal something about what it knows.
All right,

205
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.740
so use initial comment was correct.
If I was the high cost from,

206
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.300
I'd like to remain hidden,

207
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.380
but I can't remain hidden from your point of view as the receiver of the

208
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:51.214
information.

209
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.150
There's information in the lack of the attempt to convey information,

210
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.983
<v 1>lessen</v>

211
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.160
the lack of a signal,

212
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.450
the lack of it,

213
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.260
<v 0>Tim,
to affirmed a signal you some information.
The lack of a signal</v>

214
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.550
<v 1>can be informative.</v>

215
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.780
<v 0>So this is an often forgotten lesson.
It's a very simple idea,</v>

216
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.040
but there's a natural tendency when you're dealing with information to focus on

217
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:29.870
the evidence that is that rather than the evidence.
That's not that.

218
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.000
All right.
There's an expression that goes with this.
Ah,

219
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.080
the expression is silence speaks volumes,
right?
Who heard that expression?

220
00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:43.100
Silence speaks volumes.
All right,
let me give you one other example.
All right,

221
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:45.230
so there's a,
there's a Sherlock Holmes story,
by the way,

222
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.960
do you all know who Sherlock Holmes is?
Yeah.
Good.
Okay.

223
00:14:47.961 --> 00:14:52.100
So there's a Sherlock Holmes story in which Sherlock Holmes solves the murder.

224
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:56.120
He figures out who did the murder and Dr. Watson,
who's his sidekick,

225
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.110
is trying to figure out how homes that possibly have solved the murder.

226
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.430
And he says,
how did you solve the murder?
And Holmes says it's because of the,

227
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.300
it's because of the barking dog.
All right?
And,
and Watson says,

228
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.600
what do you mean it's cause the barking dog,
the dog didn't bark.

229
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.760
Ryan Holmes says,
that's exactly the point.

230
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:17.630
The fact that the dog didn't bark didn't make any sound tells us who must have

231
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:19.110
committed the murder.
Right?

232
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.090
It's very easy to fall into the trap of being Watson and to ignore the thing

233
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:26.540
that didn't happen and focus on the things that did happen.
So here,

234
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.280
it's easy to forget that actually the high cost from is revealed by doing

235
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:35.140
nothing.
All right,
so this is the idea.
Okay.

236
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.560
The silence can speak volumes.

237
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.930
Every year I go back and try and figure out what that quotation is from and I

238
00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:48.850
can never find it.
Anybody who finds it,
I will,

239
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.130
I will give them a prize of some sort.
I originally,

240
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:55.150
I thought it must be Shakespeare,
but it doesn't appear to be.
All right.

241
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.750
So this is a little,
little example involving core.
No,

242
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.670
but I want to try and convince you,
I'm gonna say no.

243
00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:03.100
I'm trying to convince you that this example is more generalists,

244
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.050
but let's pick up the question.
Yeah,
sorry.
Go ahead.

245
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.310
Isn't it possible that there's an equilibrium where it's,
uh,
the,

246
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.090
the cost of remaining hidden as a middle cost,
uh,

247
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:19.140
from outweighs the benefit,
I mean,
outweighs not,
not,
not,
not,

248
00:16:19.141 --> 00:16:21.570
not,
not if we take the model,
literally not.
Do we take the model and corner?

249
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:23.500
Literally.
Because if you,
if,
uh,

250
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.120
suppose supposedly from B doesn't know whether you're high or middle,

251
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.600
then he's gonna he's with your cost is somewhere in between,
right?
And that,

252
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:33.630
and relative to your cost being middle,
he's going to produce more.

253
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.553
That's the point here.

254
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.620
Now it's true in a richer model than maybe some other advantage and having

255
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:40.270
information hidden,
but that would have already applied to the local.

256
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.080
Let me give you some other examples and we'll see.

257
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.890
We'll see this in other contexts and see that it might actually ring true.

258
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.080
All right?
So one other example,
uh,
involves uh,
a resumes.

259
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.800
All right?
So this example requires some explanation for the Non Americans.

260
00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.530
How many of you are non Americans here?
All right?

261
00:16:58.531 --> 00:17:02.490
So one thing you need to know as non Americans is the way in which people write

262
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:06.330
resumes in America and don't want to resume is write a CV or resume,
right?

263
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.000
So when you look at a typical resume from an American student,

264
00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:11.700
if you are not American,
for those of you who aren't American,
um,

265
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.950
how should I put this politely?
Um,
it has a tendency to make you want to vomit.

266
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.080
Is that that does that.
Yeah.
Okay.

267
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.710
So that's basically the polite version of what I was going to say about that.
Uh,

268
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.740
all right,
so,
so why does it have a tendency to make you want to vomit?

269
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.240
Because Americans have a tendency to put down everything on their resumes.

270
00:17:30.241 --> 00:17:31.080
So if they were,

271
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.230
if they were a captain of the chess team in third grade and they are now they're

272
00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:37.920
40 and applying for a job,

273
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.010
it still says I was captain of the chess team in third grade.

274
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.310
And this is particularly true when it comes to public service when it comes to

275
00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:45.930
sort of moral acts.
All right?

276
00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:49.200
So most people in Europe will be a bit embarrassed about writing their good

277
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:52.770
deeds on their resumes.
But Americans,
there's a little spot on their resume,

278
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.340
which is about their good deeds are their public service and they put everything

279
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.820
into one.
I was eight,
I helped a little lady,

280
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.140
little old lady across the road with her shopping basket.

281
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.140
And there it is on their resume,
right?
Right.
Now.
So why?

282
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.340
Why is it that Americans reveal so much information on their resume?

283
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.030
All right,
well,
think about informational unraveling,
right?
So my resumes,

284
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.640
a verifiable information is a,
it's a,

285
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.290
it's hugely costly to be caught cheating about what would your resume.

286
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:19.020
So basically you're not going to lie on her resume.
All right?

287
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.160
And imagine if I'm a admitting students that say to law school,

288
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:24.090
to Yale Law School,

289
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.290
and I'm reading the student's resume out in the spot where I'm expecting to see

290
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.470
public service.
There's nothing written there,
all right?

291
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.360
What do I assume about that student?

292
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.660
What do I say about that student?

293
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.040
I assume that the person didn't nothing,
right?

294
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:44.520
This person has been a self serving evil,
get their entire life right?

295
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:47.670
It has never even helped a little old lady across the road.
All right?

296
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.260
So people put down everything,
even these minimal things,
even these pretty,
um,

297
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.090
shockingly tiny acts of charity to reveal themselves from those people who did

298
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:00.750
absolutely nothing that are basically the devil incarnate.
All right?
All right.

299
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.660
All right,
so this is about resumes.
Let's just take this a bit further.

300
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:07.650
How many of you from Los Angeles?
All right.
So in Los Angeles,
I'm,
I'm led to,

301
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:09.390
but I'm told,
you know,
you can confirm this or not.

302
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.020
There are lots and lots of restaurants and this is true,
right?

303
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.450
Lots of restaurants and some of these restaurants are good and some of them are

304
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:18.540
bad.
And more to the point for today's Today's example,

305
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.860
some of these restaurants are clean and some of them are not so clean.

306
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.130
Right?
This is true.
This is true.
Yeah.
Okay.

307
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:31.140
So it turns out that until that late nineties,
the Los Angeles,
uh,

308
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.940
municipality rules,

309
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.080
local law said that every restaurant in Los Angeles County,
I think it was,

310
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.710
had to get visited by the health inspector and the health inspector would come

311
00:19:41.711 --> 00:19:45.900
round,
I think it was annually and go to these restaurants and they would issue a

312
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:46.734
certificate.

313
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.400
And this was a health as advocates and originally on it in large letters,

314
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:55.401
let's I think of a red letters was either a or B or c,

315
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.410
right?
Maybe may even have been a minuses as well.

316
00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:01.620
But for the purpose of the story,
let's just call it a,
B,
and C.
All right?

317
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.990
Now that was all the law said.

318
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.240
The law did not say that you had to display your health certificate anyway.

319
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.903
All right,

320
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.870
so what does this model tell us to expect about Los Angeles in the mid nineties

321
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.670
wow.
If you have,

322
00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:22.010
if you're running a little restaurant in Los Angeles and you get an a health as

323
00:20:22.011 --> 00:20:25.020
advocates from your restaurant,
from it,
from the health inspector,

324
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.760
what are you going to do with a certificate?

325
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.290
You're going to display it prominently in the window,
right?
A health certificate.

326
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.190
All right,
so if you're running a slightly less healthy restaurant,

327
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:38.040
maybe this is allies pizza chain again.
All right,

328
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.630
and you and you still get a B certificate from the Los Angeles Health Inspector.

329
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.710
Are you going to display it or not?
You're going to display it,
right?
Because?

330
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.690
Because why not?
We know the A's are going to display,
right?

331
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:51.760
The specific as we can get being given to everybody.

332
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.040
So you're going to display even obesity ticket.

333
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.030
Now I'm told from people who lived in Los Angeles at the time that you could go

334
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.080
round to the greasy spoon in Los Angeles and look through these grease smeared

335
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:04.630
windows with the cockroaches running up and down them.

336
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.240
And if you look carefully behind the cockroaches and the grease,

337
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.390
you'd see a certificate displayed that said,
see on it.
Right?
Right.

338
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.590
There was a d grade as well,
even the seas were displaying.
All right,

339
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.080
so that's pretty dramatic information unraveling.

340
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.730
Now I'm exaggerating slightly for to make it to make a separate point,

341
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.120
it turns out that it is in certain areas of Los Angeles,

342
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:29.200
you'd expect to see these health,
it gets displayed,
even the C's.
Right?

343
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.590
And in other areas you wouldn't expect to see the sea is displayed.

344
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.410
Which areas would you expect not to see people bothering?

345
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.870
Displaying best see your B minus certificates.

346
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:40.743
<v 1>Any guesses?</v>

347
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.930
<v 0>The tourist areas,
right?
The tourist areas.
Because for this,</v>

348
00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.450
for this story about information on rallying to work,

349
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.320
the people who are the receivers of the information need to know that you got

350
00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:54.690
the certificates.
Right.
So if you're a tourist was sanitize your,
no,

351
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.720
this is the systems in place and therefore,
you know,
if you're,

352
00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.800
if you're a season ticket,
you're right next to Disneyland or something,

353
00:22:00.801 --> 00:22:02.510
whatever it is,
right?
You can still pay,

354
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.600
you can still make some tourists sale without having tell guy you're about to
do.

355
00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:09.200
So.
All right.
All right.
So that's a second example.

356
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.020
Let me give you a third example,
a little bit closer to home.

357
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.080
At the last curriculum reform at Yale,

358
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.610
there was a big debate about what to do with Credit d fail.
All right?

359
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:24.710
And one of the proposals for Credit d fail was to allow students to take
courses,

360
00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:28.610
credit d fail.
But if they ended up getting an a or a B,

361
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.470
they could display the a or the B on the,
on their resume,
right?
So you can take,

362
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.060
they take your credit d fail,
but if they got a grade,

363
00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:37.260
like an a or B or an a minus,
whatever,
then they have,

364
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.680
they can opt in and have it put it on their resume.
What's wrong with that?

365
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.510
This is a serious proposal that was made and I was on this committee right there

366
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:45.910
necessarily seriously made it right.
So I didn't make the proposal,

367
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.620
but this was made right.
What's wrong with this proposal?

368
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.680
Well,
what's wrong with a proposal?
What would,
what would,

369
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.100
what would displaying credit on your transcript come to mean?

370
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.170
It would come to me and see,
right?

371
00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:03.740
It'll come to me and see because all the A's and the B's would an around ravel

372
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.430
information.
Alright,
so information can,

373
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.270
if information is verifiable and can be freely transmitted,

374
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.140
it has a way of coming out.
It has a way of coming out.

375
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.430
Let me give you one slightly more serious example.
As you will know,

376
00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.800
if you're arrested in the US,
you should do this.

377
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.110
You have the right to remain silent and not saying you're all about to get

378
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.610
arrested,
but we'll usually be arrested.

379
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.990
You have the remote right terrain of silence,
right?

380
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.060
That Wright was true in Britain as well until recently when the government,

381
00:23:32.061 --> 00:23:35.000
which isn't so big on civil liberties,
change the rules slightly.

382
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.680
So now you have the right to remain silence in Britain.
Signs in Britain barks,

383
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.540
the court has the right to take into account as evidence if you remain silent.

384
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.060
All right?
So what's that done to the right to remains?

385
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.000
I'll leave it to you to figure out where that's done to the right to remain

386
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.250
silent.
All right?
So this is,
this is an,
uh,
uh,
an area that does this,
this,

387
00:23:54.251 --> 00:23:58.190
this idea that information unravels dependent on certain key parts.

388
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.720
And the most important part was that the information was verifiable.

389
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.113
<v 1>Okay?</v>

390
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.081
<v 0>Like Monster,</v>

391
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:12.340
that the information was verifiable and to get full unraveling all the way down,

392
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.390
in this case to the highest cost from you needed the people on the receiving

393
00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:19.960
side of the information to actually know that that information was there.

394
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.820
So to get the full unraveling,

395
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.400
you really need something like common knowledge of the presidents of the

396
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.190
information.
All right?
All right?

397
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.630
But often the information that you have,
you have inflammation,

398
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.700
you want to reveal that information,

399
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.720
but unfortunately it's not so easily verifiable.

400
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:43.230
So we're going to focus on for the rest of the today is information that is not

401
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.403
verifiable,

402
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.403
<v 1>right?</v>

403
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.240
<v 0>I,
let's start with an example that's pretty close to home.</v>

404
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.120
A lot of you have been doing job interviews recently.

405
00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:04.180
How many of you been going out either in interviews for internships or jobs in

406
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.760
the it?
And I know a lot of you missing class,
I'm assuming charitably,

407
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.750
that's what you were doing.
All right.
All right.
So,
uh,

408
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.790
when you go to these job interviews,

409
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.600
you could imagine that you're turning up for some job into unit.
Say it's boring.

410
00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:19.730
Bank of Boston.
All right?
And you talking about this,
uh,

411
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.640
interview for Boring Bank of Boston.

412
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.300
And one of the things that Boring Bank of Boston wants to know is,

413
00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:30.010
are you interested in working for Boring Bank of Boston?
All right,

414
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.020
that's a plus for that.
All right?
So what they tend to do is they ask you,

415
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.560
they ask you a,
more or less,
they say,

416
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.600
are you interested in working for Boring Bank?
All right.
Now,

417
00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:46.430
by the way,
if you are asked the question,
Oh,

418
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:49.660
and you're interviewing for boring bank,
and you're asked the question by them,

419
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.140
are you interested in working for Boring Bank?
What answers should you give?

420
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.930
Here's the own said yes.
All right.

421
00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.700
How much information is that in the fact you out?
So yes,
no at all.
Right?

422
00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:02.390
Because clearly you want the option of,

423
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:05.110
of working for this bank is they're going to answer yes.
Anyway.

424
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.320
Now you may think this is just a fictional example.
It's not,

425
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.510
I talked to some recruiters from a bank in Boston that will refer to as Boring

426
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.790
Bank in Boston,
uh,
uh,
not so long ago.

427
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.830
And I asked them about hiring Yale undergraduate.

428
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:21.070
So what Yellen got to do to impress them.

429
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.340
And the recruiter who was a Yale graduate himself said to me that frankly,

430
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.660
Yale undergraduates do less well in these interviews then holiday it

431
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:34.660
undergraduates.
And I said,
no shattered and disappointed.
I said,
why?

432
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.370
And he said,
well,

433
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.900
when we asked them if they're interested in working for Boring Bank of Boston,

434
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.670
the Yale guys say things like,
well,
I know it sounds kind of boring.

435
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.513
<v 1>All right.</v>

436
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.950
<v 0>Um,
the Harvard guys,
what do they do?</v>

437
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.930
They show up with the Wall Street Journal folded over conveniently on the page

438
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:57.580
about Boring Bank of Boston.
And sometimes they're wearing,
you know,

439
00:26:57.581 --> 00:27:02.000
a silly hat with,
I'm boring on it.
All right?
So I,

440
00:27:02.001 --> 00:27:05.730
I tried to persuade this guy that despite this facts,
there's no,

441
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:08.070
there's really no information and the fact that the Harvard guys are telling

442
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:08.310
this,

443
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.610
and in fact you should hire the Yale people cause at least they were honest and

444
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:13.950
hey,
that might make the bank less boring in the future,
right?

445
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.200
This didn't work right?
So I need to persuade you guys to actually,
uh,

446
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.470
cough up and be dishonest here.
All right.
All right.
There's a lesson.

447
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.180
Here's a one lesson is if you are asked by an interviewer at one of these for a

448
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:30.930
summer internship or for a job later,
if you want to work for them,

449
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.800
the answer is yes.
All right?
It's one of the few questions with the answers.

450
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:36.320
Not backward induction.
It's just yes,

451
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.553
<v 1>right?</v>

452
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.100
<v 0>The,
there's a secondary lesson here,
which is even interview,</v>

453
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.240
if an Ngb off your for a bank is asking you in the interview if you'd like to

454
00:27:48.341 --> 00:27:50.800
work for them,
you probably don't want to say yes,

455
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.350
but you probably want to work somewhere else,
right?

456
00:27:53.351 --> 00:27:55.000
They're dumb enough to ask you that question.

457
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.440
You probably want to work for someone else.
All right?
But this isn't real.

458
00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.540
This isn't a real problem.
The problem is here you are,

459
00:28:01.541 --> 00:28:04.810
you have some information you'd like to convey.
Maybe you really are boring,

460
00:28:04.811 --> 00:28:08.290
maybe really do want to work for this bank.
You want to convey this information,

461
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560
but it's hard for you to persuade the employer I that is true because anybody

462
00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:16.260
can say they want to work for the bank.
All right?

463
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.560
And more generally in life isn't the only about whether you want to work for a

464
00:28:20.561 --> 00:28:22.720
particular bank or whatever happens to be.

465
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.030
It's also about whether you are a good worker.
Dot.

466
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.280
All alright,
so let's try and,
uh,

467
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.910
try and think about this in the context of not of workers being boring or not,

468
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.160
but at work as being good on us.
All right,

469
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.970
so we're going to look at a costly signaling marvel.
It's going to turn out,

470
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.490
this model is going to be about costly st signaling.

471
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.040
Add just for the purpose of the model,

472
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.540
we're going to assume that there are two kinds of workers in America that are

473
00:28:52.541 --> 00:28:55.030
good workers will call him g

474
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.980
and that are bad workers,
and we'll call them B.

475
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:08.860
All right,
and what assume that the productivity of a good worker,

476
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.320
if you work for this further,

477
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.490
is going to be 50 or we gonna assume this is $50,000 whatever,

478
00:29:15.491 --> 00:29:20.140
but that does forget units for now and just call it 50 and a bad worker.

479
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.520
Their productivity is only 30 all right?

480
00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:26.980
So clearly all other things being equal,

481
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.650
the employer would rather employ a good worker or a bad worker and all other

482
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:31.841
things.

483
00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:34.140
Being equal is important because then we have to pay the good work at more.

484
00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.540
All right,
let's assume this is the u s economy.

485
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.750
So roughly 10% of the economy are good and 90% are bad.

486
00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:48.040
Workers are like that.
All right?
These are the proportions in the U s all right?

487
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.660
And let's also assume that firms are competitive,
right?

488
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.600
So firms are flooding into the Yale careers office or the Yale careers fair,

489
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.970
and they'd just desperately trying to hire these workers.

490
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:01.540
There's competitive hiring going on.
All right?
So firms,

491
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.360
firms compete
for workers,

492
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.640
<v 1>so</v>

493
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.140
<v 0>they're going to pay 50 to a worker.</v>

494
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:20.890
They identify as good,
the pay 52 a worker.

495
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.021
They,

496
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:28.021
the firms identify as good,

497
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.310
am I going to pay 32 workers?

498
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.840
They identify as bad.
I want to hear you feel bothered by this being exact.

499
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.610
Think of it as 50 minus a penny and 13 minus a penny.

500
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.810
It's not gonna make any difference to the analysis.
All right?

501
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.490
So if they can't identify a worker,
then they can't identify a worker.

502
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.860
They think their work is just the average worker.
How much,

503
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.420
how much will the competitive wage,

504
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.380
what would the competitive wage of the average worker in this economy?

505
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.070
All right?
She's not,
it's not hard math question.

506
00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:04.470
Everyone's scratching their head down here.
All right,
so this is,
this is,
uh,

507
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:04.811
what does it,

508
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:09.811
it's 50 times 10% and 30 times 90% which averages out as 32% all right?

509
00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:13.760
So they'll pay,
they'll pay the average,

510
00:31:13.761 --> 00:31:17.270
which is 32 to a worker.

511
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.300
They cannot identify.

512
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.820
<v 1>All right?</v>

513
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.820
<v 0>Clearly in this model,
much like in the high cost firms we did,</v>

514
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.640
we started with the good workers would like to be identified.

515
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.540
Is that right?

516
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.310
Because they get paid more and the bad workers do not want to be identified.

517
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.990
Is that right?
Right.
They'd roll.
They'd rather remain hidden.
All right.

518
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:48.240
The problem here,
however,

519
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.640
is the typically isn't a verifiable piece of information.

520
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.170
It's hard to verifiably communicate to the other side that you're a good worker.

521
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.680
So you guys are all good workers,
right?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
We hope.

522
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.860
All right,
so you,
you show up to this firm,

523
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.490
this firm is looking for good workers and you could tell the firm,

524
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.680
I'm a good worker.
In fact,
I'm getting,

525
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:12.190
I'm betting most of you have tried doing that and your job interviews,
right?

526
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:16.870
I'm a good worker.
You could even do this in a costly manner,
right?
You could,

527
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.080
you could humiliate yourself by jumping up on the table and dancing on one leg

528
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:25.720
while singing some song about how you're a good worker.
All right?

529
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.130
Which will be human ea saying,

530
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.900
but it wouldn't in fact communicate to the firm that you're a good worker.

531
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.640
Why is it that your don't sing this beautiful Jig on the table of the interview

532
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:39.650
room singing this beautiful song about how you're a good worker?

533
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.890
Why doesn't that convince the firm that you're a good worker,

534
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.380
who's been in job interviews,
reason that anyone tried this?
How,

535
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.660
why is that not a can?
Why is that not a successful strategy?

536
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.053
<v 1>Okay?</v>

537
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.080
<v 0>Yes sir.
Uh,
it's Steven is all right to shout out.</v>

538
00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.220
A bad worker could do that to my bag work.
You could do that too.
All right.
Check.

539
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:05.420
It's true that it's costly and humiliating to dance up on the table on one leg

540
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.260
and senior,
a good worker,
but it's noon.

541
00:33:07.261 --> 00:33:10.790
More costly and humiliating for you than it is for a bad worker.

542
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:13.910
So if that worked,
a bad worker would do it too.

543
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.800
All right so many a song and dance isn't going to work.
All right.

544
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.840
Midea song and dance isn't gonna work.

545
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:25.841
It's gonna be hard to signal to the outside world that your a good workout.

546
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.580
All right?
That's going to be our starting point.

547
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.310
<v 1>All right?</v>

548
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.140
<v 0>So we need a way for good workers to distinguish themselves from bad workers.</v>

549
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.540
We need a way for them to signal.

550
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:53.050
And what's key about that sale is it has to be a signal that they can make and a

551
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:58.841
bad worker cannot make or alternatively a signal that they will want to make but

552
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:05.630
a bad worker will not want to make.
All right?
So don't sit on the table.

553
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:09.740
Doesn't do it.
And the reason it doesn't do it is bad workers and good workers.

554
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:13.720
It's a metric with respect to the dishonor of daunting on the table.
All right?

555
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.910
All right.
So we need a way for good workers,

556
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:21.690
you guys to distinguish yourself from bad workers.
Our skies.
All right?

557
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.680
All right.
How in the American economy,

558
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.870
what's the main way in the American economy in which good workers signal the

559
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:31.880
fact that they go,
that they managed to distinguish themselves?

560
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.090
What's the main signal used in the U s economy?

561
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:37.803
<v 1>Somebody?</v>

562
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.560
<v 0>Yeah,
some education.
All right,
so the main signal,</v>

563
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.990
the main signal in the u s not the only one by any means,

564
00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:48.130
but the main signal,

565
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.420
<v 1>he said education.</v>

566
00:34:55.450 --> 00:35:00.130
<v 0>What's going to distinguish the good workers from the bad workers is the good</v>

567
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.700
workers are going to have degrees,
more degrees,

568
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.000
better degrees,
more degrees,
whatever.
All right,

569
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.850
so what we're going to look at today is a model some of you have seen before,

570
00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:12.520
but we'll do it in a bit more detail.
Perhaps a,
it's a mortal,

571
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:16.930
it's usual guy called Spence.
Mike Spence,

572
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:22.090
who actually won the Nobel Prize,
uh,
in large part for this model.

573
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.140
The reason we know he won the Nobel prize in large part for this model is he

574
00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:28.230
didn't write practically anything else.
So it must've been for this moment.

575
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.850
All right?
So what we're gonna do is we're going to imagine that the degree,

576
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.010
the education that these people are going to get,

577
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.330
that's going to distinguish and show that they're good workers to the employers.

578
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.450
It's an,
it's assumed that the employees,
once again,
a banks,
whatever,

579
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.510
we're going to assume that the extra piece of education they're going to get is

580
00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:50.010
an MBA.
Some of you out there are getting an MBA.
It was my Mbas areas.

581
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.260
That's my MBA student up that.
All right?
All right.

582
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:54.420
So the good workers are going to get

583
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.363
<v 1>an Mba.</v>

584
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.890
<v 0>All right?
And the way this is gonna work,
the way it's gonna work,</v>

585
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.500
it's gonna work on the cost of getting an Mba.

586
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.580
So it's got to get this to be a successful signal.

587
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.800
This signal difference from merely don't sit on the table.

588
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.550
It's either got to be the case that bad workers cannot get an Mba.

589
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.570
Orange got to be the case that it's so costly for bad workers to get an Mba that

590
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:25.020
they won't bother.
All right,
so we're going to make the difference in costs.

591
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.220
All right,

592
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.220
so we're going to suppose we're going to suppose that the cost,

593
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.650
the cost
per year.

594
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.190
Oh,
getting an MBA.
You're going of of a,
of being in business school.

595
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.110
So Mba education.

596
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.580
<v 0>Mba Education is</v>

598
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.100
five five units.

599
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.010
If you're a good worker,

600
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.700
I am going to assume that the cost per year of going to som and getting an MBA

601
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.770
is a little bit over 10 so 10 and a penny.

602
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:13.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.390
<v 0>If you're a bad worker,
so nauseous.</v>

604
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.480
I've assumed in this marvel that it's more costly per year to get an Mba at

605
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.650
Yale.
Say if you're a bad worker than a good worker.

606
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.380
Now what are those costs?
What are the costs of getting an Mba?
What's,

607
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:39.030
what's causing that cost difference?
Alright,
well let's be clear,

608
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:41.640
but it isn't,
it can't be the fees.

609
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.380
The fees are a large part of the cost of the feed.

610
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:47.060
And what are the fees are getting an Mba at Yale this yet way too much.
Right?

611
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.460
Right.
So the cost per year in terms of fees are enormous,

612
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.400
but the fees themselves are not going a good,

613
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:56.940
do a good job of distinguishing between good and bad workers.
Why?

614
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.550
Because they're the same for both parties,
right?
We want the,
we want them to,

615
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.370
which is differently costly.
So this is not,
this is not,

616
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:10.260
the fees can be the fees.
They're the same for both parties.

617
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.490
What other costs?
Other,
what are the costs?
Dollars to get to getting an education

618
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.960
is opportunity.
Cost,
right?

619
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:21.750
All of you are economists or half of you are going to economics majors.

620
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.620
So the first thing you should spring to mind is opportunity costs.
All right?

621
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.340
But actually opportunity costs.
Don't help me here,
munch,
because if anything,

622
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:34.110
you'd think that the opportunity costs of going and getting an Mba at Yale are

623
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:37.510
higher.
If you're a good worker,
then if you're a bad worker,
after all,

624
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:42.220
if you're a good worker,
you could stay home and not get an Mba form your farm,

625
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:45.210
your parent's garden.
Right?
And since you're such a good worker,

626
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.000
you'd have a high yield in carrots and whatever.
All right.
All right.
All right.

627
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:52.030
So wait,
where's the bad workers?
Not Gun,
but it is a thing,
right?

628
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.360
So this is not really about opportunity costs.
In fact,

629
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.660
we'll assume that there zero,

630
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.540
well assume there are no opportunity costs.

631
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.410
So what is it that's driving this cost difference between the good,

632
00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.480
the good worker at SOM and the bad worker at Soi?

633
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.820
It's that somebody had that did,
was that an a a potential hostile there yet?

634
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.880
<v 0>Is it that the present value of future wages for a good worker?
Ah,
okay.</v>

636
00:39:20.881 --> 00:39:23.280
So that,
so they were thinking about the future.
No,

637
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.400
let's just focus on the cost side.
Let's focus on the cost side.
You're right,

638
00:39:26.401 --> 00:39:27.750
there's many different things going on in the future.

639
00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:31.440
But I spoke on the cost side.
Uh,
had you before forced to have this guy,
um,

640
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.960
mental effort or mental effort,
right?

641
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:38.130
Mental efforts started was my MBA student up the areas.
Where is that up there?

642
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.460
All right.
It's pain and suffering.
Right?
Right.
Hey,

643
00:39:41.461 --> 00:39:45.360
call Sam yet areas it's pain and suffering.
That right.
He's nodding good.
Right,

644
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.950
right.
It's having,
it's having that when you go to the NBA cost of thinking,

645
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.560
my God,

646
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.550
thank goodness I escaped being on the graduates and you go back to the NBA cost

647
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.170
and I'm there again.
Right.

648
00:39:55.171 --> 00:39:58.410
I'm sitting the same horrible problem sets and you still can't read my

649
00:39:58.411 --> 00:40:00.810
handwriting and you still have to deal with my accent.
Right.

650
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.810
Good workers find it easier to read my handwriting and deal my accidents.
Right.

651
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.970
All right.
All right.
So what it is,
it's,
it's,
it's the mental effort.

652
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.500
It's the pain and suffering.
It's the pain of the work.

653
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.120
It's the pain of the work.

654
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.130
<v 1>Alright.
Alright.</v>

655
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.180
<v 0>The only thing that distinguishes the costs of good workers from bad workers in</v>

656
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:25.300
education is it so painful to do the work.

657
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.650
If we went to a party school,
right.
This wouldn't work.
Right?
It can wait.

658
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:31.180
That's where we can't just have potty schools.

659
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.630
We actually have to put you through some,
some pain in the classroom.

660
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.160
I'm looking for go get some confirmation from up there.
All right.
All right.

661
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:43.570
So the pain of the work is what distinguishes these things.
Okay.

662
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:49.950
Now I claim I claim that we could have an equilibrium in the society in which

663
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.760
there are good and bad workers in which good workers cost per year is less than

664
00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.671
bad workers.

665
00:40:57.671 --> 00:41:02.380
Cost per year of getting it in this case and Mba would do the same for Undergrad

666
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:04.120
education.
Let's focus on the MBA for now.

667
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.060
I claimed as an equilibrium in this society,

668
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:09.780
the could be an equilibrium in which,
uh,

669
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.560
getting an MBA takes three years prior.
So I claim

670
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.720
<v 1>my claim</v>

671
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.550
<v 0>there is an equilibrium here,</v>

672
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.500
<v 1>an equilibrium</v>

673
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.370
<v 0>in which what happens in which there are three year degrees degree is</v>

674
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.140
<v 1>take</v>

675
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.520
<v 0>three years,
three year MBA sounds frightening.
Never mind.
All right.</v>

676
00:41:41.521 --> 00:41:44.370
In which the good workers

677
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.380
<v 1>all get Mbas</v>

678
00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.500
<v 0>and the bad workers</v>

679
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.750
<v 1>do not.
All right,</v>

680
00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.110
<v 0>but to tell you this isn't equal number,
I'm going to do a little bit more.</v>

681
00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.280
So let me tell you one other thing.

682
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.550
So I cleaned as an equilibrium in which the degrees take three years.

683
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.560
All the good work has got Mbas.
All the bad workers do not get Mbas.

684
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.870
And what Andy Employees,

685
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.370
the employers identify Mbas as good workers.

686
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.870
Might just make this work.

687
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.140
It has to convince the employers to make it work I need and

688
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.800
<v 1>the employers</v>

689
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.920
identify and be a equals good and not MBA equals

690
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.200
<v 0>all right,
so let's write.</v>

691
00:42:49.201 --> 00:42:54.201
Claim isn't equilibrium here and we don't want to do is I want us to show that

692
00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:56.410
this actually isn't equilibrium.

693
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.553
All right?

694
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:11.760
Now that this is a slightly different kind of equilibrium to anything we've seen

695
00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:12.990
in the class so far,

696
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:17.910
so I'm going to be a little bit slow and nerdy about what we need to check to

697
00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:21.820
check that this indeed is an equilibrium.
All right,
Tony,

698
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.520
I'm going to leave some space on the board and you should leave some space to,

699
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:25.800
all right,

700
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.000
so my claim is this is an equilibrium and what we're doing guess and check.

701
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.470
I did the guests for you and we'll do the checks together to check.

702
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.340
I claim I need to check two things,
two things.

703
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.950
All right?
One,

704
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.140
I need to check

705
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.150
<v 1>that.
No type.</v>

706
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.940
We'll deviate

707
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.210
<v 0>for me,
my type,
I mean types of worker.</v>

708
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.690
Neither the good types of workers will want to deviate,

709
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.180
nor the bad types of worker who wants to deviate.
So this isn't new.
We've all,

710
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:09.470
when we've checked equilibrium,

711
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.080
we've always checked that people don't want to deviate.

712
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:16.460
The only slight difference here is instead of checking that people won't want to

713
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.700
deviate.
I'm checking that types of people won't want to deviate,

714
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.820
but basically the idea is the same that right now it is the same.

715
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:25.220
So this is not really new.
The new thing,

716
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.970
the new thing is I also need to check,

717
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.200
actually I give myself more on here.

718
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.400
I also need to check,

719
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.610
<v 1>I need to check that</v>

720
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.810
the employer's beliefs,

721
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.550
the employers beliefs,

722
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.330
ah,
consistent,

723
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.620
consistent with the equilibrium

724
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.743
behavior.

725
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.010
<v 0>All right,
so let's just stop and pause at that a second.</v>

726
00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:15.350
We'd never written down a condition like this for equilibrium,

727
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:20.590
but here I have to here there was asymmetric information in the model and in

728
00:45:21.321 --> 00:45:25.220
this equilibrium,
one important party to the equilibrium,

729
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.670
namely the guys who are going to employ you and that's pretty important,
right?

730
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.230
All they really have to do in this model of any importance is form an inference

731
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.300
based on your actions,
right?

732
00:45:35.301 --> 00:45:40.301
They observe whether you get an educational laws and they can include whether or

733
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.920
not you're a good or bad worker,
right?

734
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.460
So we're going to write down as a condition of this being an equilibrium.

735
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.350
Those inferences,

736
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.920
quote makes sense on quote and buy makes sense.

737
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:55.550
I mean that they're consistent with what actually is happening in equilibrium.

738
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.740
So before we get too nerdy about that,

739
00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:02.200
that's I think why that's a sensible thing to get to,
to require suppose in fact,

740
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.500
suppose the world was like this.
All good workers got Mbas,

741
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:12.250
all bad workers did not get Mbas and employers thought that the people who got

742
00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:18.570
Mbas were half good and half bad.
All right,

743
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.990
and now that doesn't sound right.
Right?

744
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:25.160
And see if in fact it's the case that it's the good workers were getting Mbas

745
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.840
and the bad workers who are not,

746
00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:31.820
then the only belief that employers can have that's consistent is the Mbas are

747
00:46:31.821 --> 00:46:35.900
in fact the good workers and the non Mbas are the bad workers.
Is that right?

748
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.240
So I'm not making any deep point here.

749
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.930
I'm just pointing out that we need to make sure that the beliefs that people

750
00:46:41.931 --> 00:46:45.250
hold in this equilibrium are consistent with what's actually going on in the

751
00:46:45.251 --> 00:46:48.500
equilibrium.
Now having said that,
there's no mystery here.

752
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.710
Everything's fine in this particular claim of an equilibrium.

753
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.130
Good workers are the ones who got the Mbas,
bad workers,

754
00:46:55.131 --> 00:46:56.840
the ones who didn't get the Mbas,

755
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:02.060
and the employers when they see an Mba,
indeed think that good,

756
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.300
and when they see a non Mba,
they indeed think they're bad.

757
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.900
So these beliefs are in fact consistent with behavior.

758
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.070
So we're okay.
Okay,
so I've had to check that.

759
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.220
But it wasn't a big deal I ever care about why I'm checking.

760
00:47:16.221 --> 00:47:18.920
I didn't want people to hold silly beliefs that equilibrium.

761
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.410
That's basically what I'm saying.
All right,

762
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.580
now let's go back and check the check.
The sort of bread and butter thing,

763
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.331
the button.

764
00:47:26.331 --> 00:47:31.331
Final thing is we need to check that no of worker is going to want to deviate in

765
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:34.750
this equilibrium.
So there's two types of worker.

766
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.770
There's good workers and good workers.

767
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.830
What are they doing in equilibrium?
What are the good workers doing?

768
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.600
An equilibrium.
They're getting an MBA,
right?

769
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:48.910
For the good workers,
they become Mbas.

770
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.970
And what are the good workers identified as once they've got an Mba,

771
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:59.320
what does the employer identify them as?
Good workers,
right?

772
00:47:59.321 --> 00:48:00.730
They're identified as good.

773
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.720
They get Mbas that identified as good and that payoff,

774
00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.130
the payoff is what?
What's the payoff of the good workers here?

775
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.820
So they get paid,
they get paid 50 which is that productivity,

776
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.770
but it cost them three years of putting up with my homeworks.

777
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.390
So cost them three times five,
right?
Five,

778
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:35.290
five Phrygia.
So 50 minus three times five is what?

779
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:40.400
51 street and five is 35 okay,
so this,

780
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:44.670
they got a total payoff of 35 all right,

781
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.510
let me just pause a second.
I made an assumption here without telling you it's,

782
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.750
I'm going to say it's just to make that,
just to make the math simple,

783
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.600
we'll assume that once you get employed,

784
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:57.000
you work for a year and then you dropped dead.
All right.
All right.

785
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.200
That's a slightly morbid and unpassionate assumption,
but otherwise,

786
00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.740
otherwise we have to do kind of present discounted value of your whole future

787
00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:05.780
income and then it turns into an accounting class.
Okay,

788
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.540
so what does assume everybody lives for one year.
Okay.

789
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.400
If you want to do more complicated model,
then that's fine.

790
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.140
The idea will be the site.
All right,

791
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.910
so they get paid 50 it's cost them three times five and they get the total

792
00:49:16.911 --> 00:49:20.510
payoff of 35 all right.
How about if they deviate?

793
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.910
If they deviate,
that means they don't get Mbas,

794
00:49:25.911 --> 00:49:30.020
so they're not Mbas.
They're identified.

795
00:49:30.021 --> 00:49:34.190
What if they don't get Mba?
If they don't get an Mba,
what are they identified as?

796
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.940
What does the employee,
I think the non Mbas are bad.
All right,
so they deviates.

797
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.160
Then the employers think they're bad.

798
00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:45.500
Even if they don't on the table and say they are good,

799
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.710
they're in fact by they identified as bad and so their pay off is water.

800
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.360
What are they going to get paid?

801
00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.020
I'm going to get paid 30 I'm sure enough,

802
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.950
35 is bigger than the first seat,
so they're not going to want to deviate.

803
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:05.990
All right,
so that's good news.
What about the bad workers?

804
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:07.730
It's check then.

805
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:13.640
So the bind workers in equilibrium then,
not Mbas,

806
00:50:13.641 --> 00:50:15.050
they don't get an Mba.

807
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.740
They're identified as bad and they're paid wars.

808
00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:24.350
What do they pay to these bad workers?

809
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.070
Somebody the pay

810
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.781
<v 1>30 right there.</v>

811
00:50:28.781 --> 00:50:33.350
Pay That paid their productivity so that pay off is just thirsty.

812
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:36.650
They didn't get an education so it was free is they get 30 for free.

813
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.970
So that payoff is just thirsty.
If they deviate,

814
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.620
if the bad workers deviates,

815
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.780
then they get an Mba.
So he comes bad workers,

816
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.460
they find their way into my class and som they have a miserable time.

817
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.920
I have a miserable time cause they're having a miserable time.

818
00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.040
But at the end of the day they're identified as good workers.

819
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.960
They didn't tell you this good workers and hence they're paid 50 and they pay

820
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:12.011
off is 50 minus three times 10 oh one 10 in a penny,

821
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.650
which is approximately 20

822
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.373
is that right?

823
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.370
<v 0>So they didn't want to deviate either.
I know I've done,
no,
I'm Don.</v>

824
00:51:26.371 --> 00:51:28.830
I've shown it to an equilibrium.
So just to recap,

825
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.200
to show that this was an equilibrium,

826
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:36.500
I had to show that the good workers happily self select into education and don't

827
00:51:38.851 --> 00:51:41.010
want to deviate and skip business school.

828
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:46.970
I have to show that the bad workers self select into not getting an education

829
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:52.140
and don't want to deviate and become a Mbas and I have to show that the

830
00:51:52.141 --> 00:51:56.520
employers in for from this what they should infer from this,
which was fine.

831
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.040
All right,
so I'm done.
This is indeed an equilibrium.
All right?

832
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:07.320
So notice in this equilibrium the good workers do manage to distinguish

833
00:52:07.321 --> 00:52:11.420
themselves from the bad workers and they do end up getting paid more.
All better.

834
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.970
The cost that they're going to die a year later.
All right,

835
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.460
so this is called a separating equilibrate,

836
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.770
which I can never spell.
I just want to spelling this wrong.
I don't mind.

837
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.390
It's a separating equilibrium.

838
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.560
<v 1>All right.</v>

839
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.790
<v 0>Why is it cool to separate in equilibrium?</v>

840
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:39.120
It's called a separating equilibrium because the types managed to separate and

841
00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:42.190
get identified.
That's slightly misleading.

842
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.720
The good types managed to separating it identified and the bad times they want

843
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:48.820
to get separated,
but they do get separated.

844
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.140
<v 1>All right.
Now</v>

845
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:57.940
<v 0>how many of you have seen some version of the Spence model before?
Some of you,</v>

846
00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:58.774
right?
All right,

847
00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.830
let's go into this in a little bit more detail to see if we've really understood

848
00:53:02.831 --> 00:53:03.664
it.

849
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

850
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.230
<v 0>Sorry.
In particular,</v>

851
00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.420
<v 1>actually,
let me get rid of that one</v>

852
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.810
<v 0>in particular.</v>

853
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.800
Could we get away with a shorter degree here?

854
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:30.801
We had people going to get Mbas and it took them three years each.

855
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:35.730
All right.
That seems an awful long time to get an MBA.

856
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.260
So how about,

857
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:40.490
<v 1>okay,</v>

858
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:44.930
<v 0>how about a one year,
one year MBA?</v>

859
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.880
<v 1>Right,</v>

860
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.930
<v 0>and some of you might be a,
I think it's just as homes.</v>

861
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.330
I'm going abstracting his own pole,

862
00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.510
but actually this is the kind of thing you hear about all the time.
If you read,

863
00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.050
if he doesn't,
the ads and the education press,
you keep on hearing schools,

864
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.840
perhaps schools who lack economics,

865
00:54:01.841 --> 00:54:06.540
professors are putting up the proposals for one year MBA degrees.
All right.

866
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.070
I won't mention any schools by name because I'll probably get in trouble.

867
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.490
All right,
so how about a one year MBA?

868
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.650
Let's see if that will work.

869
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.070
And will allow good workers to separate themselves from bad workers.

870
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:22.540
Let's assume that the cost per year are the same as they were before.

871
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.520
All right.
And let's suppose that this candidate equilibrium,

872
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:31.870
this putative equilibrium involves the good workers getting the Mbas,

873
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.760
the bad workers,
not getting an MBA.
And the employers just as before,

874
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.470
identifying Mbas as good and not Mbas as bad question.

875
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:45.320
Is that an equilibrium?
He doesn't have an equal level.

876
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.520
So who thinks yes?
Who thinks no?
All right.

877
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.540
So you can all tell me why then to the answer is no.

878
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:56.560
So why is that not an equilibrium?
Why is that not an equilibrium?
Somebody?

879
00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:02.050
Anybody.
What does that all?
Negroes only hasn't answered yet today.
Yeah,
maybe go.

880
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.470
So your,
and your name is what's mine?
I was want to shout out,

881
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.940
shout out Lada the dybbuk adults also benefit from doing the Mba because I'm,

882
00:55:11.501 --> 00:55:16.360
their payoff is still greater.
Good.
Good.
So what's wrong in this equilibrium?

883
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.730
It's not the employer's beliefs,
right?

884
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.340
If in fact people did follow this behavior,

885
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.610
then employers would be right to identify Mbas with good.

886
00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.880
It's also not the good workers problem.

887
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:32.410
If in fact employers are going to pay more to Mbas than the good workers,

888
00:55:32.411 --> 00:55:35.860
I could still go even more.
So we're going to want to go ahead and get Mbas.

889
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:40.600
The problem here,
right?
This is not an equilibrium,

890
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.453
<v 1>okay?</v>

891
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:49.460
<v 0>It's not an equilibrium and the problem is the bad workers,</v>

892
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:56.640
the bad workers,
incentives are wrong here,
right?
Why?

893
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.780
Because if the bad workers do what they're supposed to do in this equilibrium,

894
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:06.420
this equilibrium actually this equilibrium,
but in this supposedly equilibrium,

895
00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.460
what am I supposed to do is not to get an Mba

896
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:17.250
and get a pay off of 30 all right?

897
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.650
But if they went to and go to the NBA,

898
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:26.530
if they deviate,
if they deviate and no one else deviates,
just MTV thing.

899
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:29.710
If they deviates,
they get an Mba,

900
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:31.320
<v 1>okay?</v>

901
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.620
<v 0>According to the equilibrium that now identified as good workers</v>

902
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.700
identified as and as good.

903
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.360
And so that pay off would be 50 minus one year

904
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:52.080
at approximately 10 for a total payoff of foresee,

905
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.700
but 40 is higher than thirsty,
so that's violated our equilibrium condition.

906
00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:01.210
I want to see last rites are here.
The bad workers.

907
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:05.290
If it only took one year of pain and suffering to get an Mba,

908
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.170
the bad workers would go and get an Mba as well.

909
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.920
And that will be trouble because now everyone gets an MBA and it's just like

910
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:14.820
dancing on the table again.
Alright,

911
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.110
so how long the missed an MBA B in this model with this cost structure,

912
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:23.530
how many years must it take to get an Mba?

913
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.820
Two years,
right?
Right.
One year it didn't work,

914
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:34.410
but you can try at home and check that a two year or two year Mba,

915
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:42.240
a two year MBA will work two years where we just enough to put off the bad

916
00:57:42.531 --> 00:57:47.000
workers.
Leaving aside the numbers though,
what's the idea here?

917
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:51.620
The idea is that to work as a successful signal,

918
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.320
the signal has to separate the good workers from the bad workers.

919
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.290
That workers have to choose to be separated.

920
00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:04.790
They have to self select into being Mbas or not being Mbas.

921
00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:09.440
And we achieved,
we need just enough pain and suffering and let's be careful,

922
00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.510
just enough difference in pain and suffering for the workers to select

923
00:58:14.511 --> 00:58:19.370
correctly.
All right,
so what we need,
what we need,

924
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:23.410
<v 1>we need enough</v>

925
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:30.060
difference difference in cost

926
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.420
for good workers

927
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.110
to get the degree
and for bad workers

928
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.330
not to want to do science.

929
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:51.370
<v 0>So one thing we could do is have a two year degree.
How else if you would,</v>

930
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.150
if you would,
apps,
he insisted on having a one year degree.

931
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.870
How could you create a difference in costs that would work?
Suppose you are,

932
00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:02.730
suppose you are employed to advise some university out in the western wear.

933
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.940
Who wants to have a one year degree program?
All right.

934
00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.750
What should you do in that one year degree program to make it work?

935
00:59:09.751 --> 00:59:11.730
To make it allow people to separate.

936
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.280
Raising tuition isn't going to work.
Right?

937
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.760
Cause that's the same for good and bad workers need a way to separate the good

938
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:19.260
and bad workers,
right?
How are you going to do it?

939
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.280
You're gonna make it really hard,
right?

940
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.850
If you want to have a one year degree program,
it's got to be really hard.

941
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:28.580
You've got to really check out the difference between the good and the bad

942
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:31.910
workers.
So you need to hire professors who have really bad handwriting.

943
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.450
<v 1>Alright.
Alright.</v>

944
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:38.170
<v 0>Let's try and take a step back from this model</v>

945
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.630
and see what works.
See what we've learned here.
All right,

946
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:46.430
let's just try and draw some lessons off this.

947
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:48.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

948
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.830
<v 0>And I want a chore.
Two kinds of lessons.</v>

949
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:58.970
I wanted to grow lessons in general about what makes a good,

950
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.320
what makes us successful,

951
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:04.370
signal in society and may want to draw lessons about education.

952
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.120
So I want to start with nerdy lessons about game theory if you like.

953
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:09.500
And I want to talk about some more,

954
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.290
more specific lessons about the education system.

955
01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:13.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

956
01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.240
<v 0>So the key lesson here is the lesson we just let,</v>

957
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:33.020
the key lesson is to be a successful signal to be able to separate types of

958
01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:39.050
people.
You need that to be large differences in costs.

959
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.850
All right?
So the first lesson is,

960
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.193
<v 1>okay,</v>

961
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:53.050
<v 0>hey,
good signal
isn't it?</v>

962
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.700
It has to be costly.
It's an,
it has to be differentially costly.

963
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.800
<v 1>Okay?
Needs to be</v>

964
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.430
differentially

965
01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:09.120
deferentially

966
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.680
costly across types.

967
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.140
<v 0>And the reason is you want the types to self select so that better be</v>

968
01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:21.990
differences in costs.
Your love at capital here,

969
01:01:21.991 --> 01:01:24.720
you could have differences in benefits,
but we'll leave it as costs on it.

970
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.210
<v 1>All right?
That's one lesson.</v>

971
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.813
All right?

972
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:40.670
<v 0>Now what is that telling us in this modal that's telling us that if you make it</v>

973
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:45.320
very,
very easy to obtain qualifications in the u s society,

974
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.191
for example,

975
01:01:46.191 --> 01:01:51.191
if you lower the standards that you need to get a high school degree and perhaps

976
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:55.580
you lower the standards to get a college degree.
And I'll say I'm not,
I'm,

977
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:56.610
I'm not saying that is happening.

978
01:01:56.611 --> 01:01:58.880
I don't want to take a political position on this in England.
That's happening.

979
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.950
I can,
I can do that.
Okay.
They know that seems to be happening,
right?

980
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:04.700
So you lower the standards it takes to get a high school certificate in England

981
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.460
and then you have to lower the standards to get a college degree.

982
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.080
What are you going to see happen?

983
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.160
<v 1>What are you going to see happen?</v>

984
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.410
<v 0>You're going to see qualification inflation and you make it easy for everybody</v>

985
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:19.740
to get the first degree.

986
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.780
The good workers are going to go on and have to get a second degree.

987
01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:24.270
You make it easy to get the second degree,

988
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.940
they're going to go on and get the third degree.
All right?

989
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.700
So what this model predicts is if you,
if you,

990
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:33.210
if you get rid of this cost difference than workers,

991
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:36.510
we'll find a new way to raise the cost difference again.
All right?

992
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:41.220
And the way that takes place and listen in in some economies is you start seeing

993
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.890
qualification inflation.

994
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.090
<v 1>Okay?</v>

995
01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:54.030
<v 0>By qualification inflation,
I mean that pretty soon even to drive a dump truck,</v>

996
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.830
you need to have a university degree.
All right.
Okay.

997
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:02.370
And what are the lessons here for education more generally?

998
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

999
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.960
<v 0>This is a pretty sparse model of education,</v>

1000
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:19.940
but all of you and more and more immediately me are involved in education

1001
01:03:19.941 --> 01:03:21.530
system,
so we should care about it a bit.

1002
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:25.030
It's part of the most famous model of education.
As I say at one,
somebody that,

1003
01:03:25.031 --> 01:03:28.640
oh,
we'll prize.
What is it telling us about education?

1004
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.920
So the first thing I claim,

1005
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I claim that this is a rather pessimistic model of education.

1006
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:43.280
Why is this a pessimistic model of education?

1007
01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:48.170
What's pessimistic about this model?
Let's talk about that a bit.
Anybody?

1008
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.540
Some some hands up.

1009
01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:52.340
Don't we give them different hands was why is this a pessimistic model of

1010
01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:55.370
education?
Way,
way over that.
Got To get your head in another part of the room.

1011
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:58.970
It'll,
he'll give the camera on a work out anyway.
All right.

1012
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.080
You don't learn in high school.
Definitely.
No good,
good.

1013
01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.030
Let's just start the chat.
They end of the microphone,
but that was right.

1014
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.240
You don't learn anything at school in this model,
right?
Right.

1015
01:04:08.241 --> 01:04:11.060
This is a model with no learning.

1016
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.830
There's no learning in this model.
All right?
In finance.

1017
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.720
People in this model go in with that.

1018
01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:21.860
Productivity is at 50 and 30 I may come out with that.

1019
01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:26.750
Productivity is at 1530 nothing you do at school in riches you or makes you more

1020
01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:29.930
productive.
That's a pretty pessimistic lesson.
Here we are in lecture number.

1021
01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:32.840
What does that section,
I'm 23 or something.
Right on the message of this,

1022
01:04:32.841 --> 01:04:35.710
of this model is you guys haven't learned anything.

1023
01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:39.260
You've just had a lot of pain and suffering.
All right.
All right,

1024
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:43.040
so there's no learning in this model.
There's no learning.

1025
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:44.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1026
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.980
<v 0>Hi.
No,
I hope,
I hope that's not true as a model of education,
right?</v>

1027
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.520
I hope it's not true that we only have pain,

1028
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:58.140
but never,
never lived by us.
Let's pretend it's true,

1029
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:02.520
at least for now and see where it takes us.
All right,

1030
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.740
so a second observation of this model.

1031
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:08.480
If we believe this model of education in which you don't learn a thing,

1032
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.080
education is just being used by those people who are good anyway,

1033
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.040
to separate from those people who were bad anyway.
Right?

1034
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:22.230
Then education in this model is socially wasteful.

1035
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.640
Why is education socially wasteful of this model?

1036
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.530
And what sense is it socially wasteful

1037
01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.110
thinking from the point of view and economist in this model,

1038
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.530
the productivity of the workers doesn't change because of education,

1039
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.190
but some resources were used,
right?

1040
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:50.170
Some resources were used by the good workers to get an education,
right?

1041
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:53.200
At the end of the day,
the good workers are better off,

1042
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.460
the bad workers are worse off,
all right?
But that's,
and uh,

1043
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.980
employers were the same as they would have been otherwise.
All right.

1044
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:04.540
But that's just redistribution,
right?
There's no product from education.
Right?

1045
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.620
But resources,

1046
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:10.630
resources were wasted in education and I that makes sense.
So in particular,

1047
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:13.780
in our two year equilibrium,
right?
In free air equilibrium,

1048
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.720
it was the good workers who went to college or no,

1049
01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:21.790
in this case went to business school and they wasted three years at five apiece,

1050
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.960
right?
Until there's a waste of 15 a waste of 10 and the two year model.

1051
01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.120
All right?
According to this model,
education is socially wasteful.

1052
01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:34.400
How do we actually visualize that waste and society's expectation,

1053
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:38.260
the model seriously,
where is that waste manifested in society?

1054
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1055
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.220
<v 0>Where's that waste manifested?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1056
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:47.260
So you guys aren't working and where else does it matter who you guys sitting

1057
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:48.190
here as part of the waste?

1058
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:52.630
You should be out doing something else and where else is the waste?
Me?
Right,

1059
01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:55.180
right,
right.
You should take her to a port.
Yale,
Yale professors.

1060
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.050
Stop using them as Yale professors and wasting those resources and have us go

1061
01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:04.000
out and till the fields.
All right.
Drive taxis or something.
All right.
All right.

1062
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.280
All right,
so there's a social waste here,
right?
And that what we should do is,

1063
01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:12.310
according to this model,
is we should send the professors

1064
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:17.680
to drive taxes or dump trucks.
I guess

1065
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.260
I'm not claiming would be good at driving dump trucks.

1066
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.520
Our comparative advantages,

1067
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:27.550
certainly in teaching classes rather than drunk driving dump trucks,

1068
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.000
but it turns out in this model,
teaching classes is completely waste of time.

1069
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:31.691
All right?

1070
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:34.930
And therefore you're better off using those resources to drive dump trucks.

1071
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.450
All right,
third nosiest that in this model,

1072
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.250
the results of education is what?
It's good for the good workers.

1073
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.550
You guys managed to separate yourselves and get paid high wages.

1074
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:53.350
That's nice for the Yale graduates here,
but who are the losers in this model?

1075
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.760
Who are the losers?
The bad workers,

1076
01:07:57.761 --> 01:08:02.560
the 90% of workers in this economy who aren't naturally gifted,

1077
01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:05.950
who aren't going to find indication easy.
They in this model,

1078
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:09.790
end up being paid 30 without the education system.

1079
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:13.030
How much would they have been paid?
32 all right.

1080
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.730
So this model increases inequality,
and in this model,

1081
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:21.740
education increases in the quality and it doesn't increase inequality in a

1082
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:24.560
benign way.
Just by making the rich red shot,

1083
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:29.280
it increases in the quality by making the poor poorer.
Alright?

1084
01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.530
Increase education in this model increases

1085
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.710
inequality in this model.
It actually hurts.

1086
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.863
It hurts

1087
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.820
<v 1>the pole.
Yeah.</v>

1088
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.650
<v 0>How about strikes me as a pretty important lesson,
actually.
Again,</v>

1089
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:53.670
I don't think we should take this model to literally in the real world.

1090
01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:57.000
I at least hope that some of you are learning something at Yale.

1091
01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.020
You're looking at me extremely doubtful.
If you could possibly let again.
Yeah,

1092
01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:02.160
so maybe you're not,
I dunno,
right?
But in the real world,

1093
01:09:02.161 --> 01:09:03.870
I'd like to believe people are letting him.
Yeah,

1094
01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:07.560
but one of the things that's going on in education,
in addition to learning,

1095
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.520
one of the things is that you guys are separating ourselves.

1096
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.310
I'm signaling to employers that you're going to be,

1097
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.730
that you're going to work out,
you're going to be good workers for them.

1098
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.150
As a consequence,
that's great for you,

1099
01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:23.430
but someone else is being paid less.

1100
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.900
This is infringement is an important lesson in,
in a to here in an election year,

1101
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:31.710
in every election year in America,
I've been in a few action years in America.

1102
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.700
Now.
There are two things that all politicians agree on,

1103
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.770
whether that far right or far left or politicians agree on two things.
I agree.

1104
01:09:40.771 --> 01:09:45.750
The two things are good.
One kissing babies too.

1105
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.800
They all want to be quote the education president.
Is that right?

1106
01:09:49.801 --> 01:09:53.670
All of them is that right now as a parent of some babies,

1107
01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.140
I'm not sure I want to have politicians kissing babies,
but that's not,

1108
01:09:56.141 --> 01:09:58.110
that's not,
that's for another day.
All right.

1109
01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:02.160
The point here is what we're learning,
they don't go yet.
Guys,

1110
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:06.420
what we're learning here is that if education hurts the poor,

1111
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.550
maybe we shouldn't be so keen to decide that we should subsidize the education

1112
01:10:11.551 --> 01:10:14.670
sector itself,
although as an indicator,
I hope he don't tell me what the,

1113
01:10:14.671 --> 01:10:15.830
tell that to anybody.
All right.

1114
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:20.310
What's the takeaway message of this model and the takeaway messages for

1115
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:24.390
education to work as a signaling device to education,

1116
01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:26.460
to generate a separating equilibrium.

1117
01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.240
Some children have to be left behind.
All right.

1118
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.520
All right.
All right.
We'll talk about that.
Moral Wednesday.
