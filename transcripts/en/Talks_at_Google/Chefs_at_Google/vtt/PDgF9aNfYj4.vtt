00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.686
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, thank you

00:00:01.686 --> 00:00:04.260
guys for coming to our Guest
Chefs @ Google LAX program.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.950
We're super, super,
super excited

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.560
to have chef Dakota Weiss of
NINETHIRTY and The Backyard

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.730
here with us today.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.440
And in true "Top Chef" fashion--
I don't know if you guys know

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.500
she was a competitor
on "Top Chef"--

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.140
she just whisked in like 10 or
15 minutes ago and put all this

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.650
stuff together for you guys.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.910
So again, thank you
for joining the demo.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.169
And without further
ado, I'm going

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.544
to send it to chef Dakota.

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:26.170
DAKOTA WEISS: Hi guys.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.750
So I wanted to do
something today that

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.930
is reminiscent of Thanksgiving,
given that that's coming up.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.840
And I don't about everybody
else, but being a chef,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.700
Thanksgiving's a big
deal, because it's

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.830
revolves around food,
which is awesome.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.080
So I created the morning
after Thanksgiving breakfast.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.820
And this is something hopefully
you guys can take home and kind

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.910
of-- because everybody's
like, what do you

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.826
do with all leftovers?

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:52.690
Everybody's tired of turkey
sandwiches with the cranberry

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.090
sauce.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.060
So what I created is a
pumpkin pie smoothie.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.210
And really that's just
an excuse to have pumpkin

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.790
pie for breakfast, to be honest.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.630
And it is literally just
the whole pumpkin pie

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.250
with some fun ingredients.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.900
And then we're going to make
french toast with cranberry

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.120
sauce, with shredded up turkey
meat, and smothered in gravy.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.850
So kind of a play on
chicken and waffles,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.760
a little bit, but a
little more refined.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.155
So let's get started with
the pumpkin pie smoothie.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.760
Does anybody here
not like pumpkin pie?

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.500
That's funny.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.250
I am kind of the same way.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.230
I don't like pumpkin pie in
this format, but I love pumpkin.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.596
The texture is
really strange to me.

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:43.220
It's one of those
weird texture things.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.219
So I'm kind of the same.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.800
I wouldn't eat
pumpkin pie like this,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.850
but throw it in a blender
with some yogurt and honey?

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.890
We've got a party.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.230
All right, so, we're literally
going to take our pumpkin pie

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.920
and throw it straight
into the blender.

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.690
I mean, does this already
look good, or what?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.380
It is a little messy.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.950
Yogurt, to make it somewhat
healthy and breakfast-y.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.510
And we're going to
add milk, that's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.270
another part of our
healthy part of it.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.170
Smidge of cinnamon,
let's see-- vanilla.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.480
I like to go two capfuls.

00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:43.470
And then I'm going to
add a little bit of honey

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.960
to it, just because the crust
of it, I noticed yesterday

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.530
in my experimentation phase,
makes it a little bit savory.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.890
And so the honey kind of
sweetens it up a little bit.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.780
And then I'm going to
add a little bit of ice.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.380
And then have the
milk handy, just

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.440
in case you need to thin it out.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.980
Because obviously pureeing
a whole pie kind of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.980
makes it a little thick.

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:12.370
Who thinks I can do
this without a lid?

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.360
We're going to start
with-- stand back.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.450
So we're going to
keep the milk here.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.450
Give it a little stir.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.162
Little spit, all right.

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:03.650
We're almost there.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.200
Voila, first recipe done.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.245
OK, who wants to try?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.350
All right.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.350
I don't know, do you want
to come up and get it?

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.250
Do you want me to
bring it to you?

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.416
I don't know how that works.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.110
But it's pie for breakfast.

00:04:46.184 --> 00:04:48.100
AUDIENCE: Should have
done this for Halloween.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.475
This is really
the most terrified

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:52.004
I've been at a
cooking demonstration.

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:53.468
Sitting in the front--

00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:55.354
AUDIENCE: Scott, sit over there.

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:57.145
DAKOTA WEISS: You're
like, oh, my goodness.

00:04:57.145 --> 00:04:59.186
AUDIENCE: Everything we've
been taught not to do.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.560
DAKOTA WEISS: We like to
break rules in the kitchen.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.400
How is it?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.390
Tastes like--

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:08.430
DAKOTA WEISS: Pumpkin pie.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.270
Well, it absolutely
tastes like pumpkin pie.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.212
For me, it's a texture, though.

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:13.310
If you don't like the flavor
of pumpkin, then yeah,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.518
you're going to be like, meh.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.482
AUDIENCE: Chef,
chef-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.730
DAKOTA WEISS:
Vitaprep all the way.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.650
Vitamix, yeah.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.000
I mean, in my opinion,
it's the best.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.570
I mean, you just saw-- it
took an entire pie, crust,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.800
everything, with a little bit of
work with a spoon or a spatula.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.437
I would recommend maybe at home
using a rubber spatula, not

00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:47.260
a metal spoon.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.170
But Vitamix, absolutely.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.060
How is it?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.880
All right, cool.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.680
So now we're going to
make our french toast.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.930
So has everybody made
french toast before?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.600
Pretty easy, right?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:16.745
Start with awesome ingredients,
such as cream, eggs.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.350
And then I add a little
bit of brown sugar.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.016
I don't want to add
too much, because it

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.960
is kind of a savory
french toast.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.590
But a little brown
sugar will help

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.095
caramelize the french
toast part of it.

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:42.220
I'm going to whisk that up.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.957
I like to use brioche, and I
slice it about an inch thick.

00:06:53.957 --> 00:06:56.040
And then you're just going
to put that in the bowl

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.410
and let that egg mixture
really soak up into it.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.200
Butter, hot pan.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.490
And basically for the gravy
part and the turkey part,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.750
all I did was-- the
great thing about this

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.110
is all this stuff
is already cooked.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.790
So I just took the
gravy, heated it up.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.816
Shredded up the rest,
especially picking off

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:21.440
all that good part
of the turkey that's

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.950
left on there, if you didn't eat
it in the middle of the night,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.780
that is.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.910
Shred it all up, throw
it right into the gravy

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.620
as the gravy's coming
up to temperature.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.050
And basically you
just kind of make

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.134
like a turkey
gravy, more or less.

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:38.300
You can put this in the pan.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.560
When you see this butter
start to foam like that,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.060
that's a good sign
that your pan is ready.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.300
And then the cranberry
sauce, obviously,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.550
is already made as well,
which is super awesome.

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:05.610
Give that a stir.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.169
So I kind of just--
with french toast,

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:10.210
it's really easy to make.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.060
The trickiest thing to me
is when the french toast

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.580
is kind of raw in the middle.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.240
That's not super
awesome, in my opinion.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.400
So what I like to do
if it's really, really

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.310
thick French toast,
I'll cut it in half

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.950
and then sear the insides of it.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.280
I'll show you that
in a second here.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.449
Then we get nice little
brown caramelization.

00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:38.654
Has anybody ever had
gravy-smothered french toast

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:39.154
before?

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.059
Sound fun or it sounds weird?

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.930
I think it sounds fun.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.900
Especially since
being in LA, we've

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.380
got Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.130
It's similar.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.670
So you see we start to
get the little brown color

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.550
on the french toast.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.600
It takes a little bit of time,
but patience is a virtue.

00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:12.490
Does anybody have any awesome
plans for Thanksgiving?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.128
Going anywhere?

00:09:15.128 --> 00:09:15.836
Cooking anything?

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.956
No plans?

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:20.872
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.210
DAKOTA WEISS: That's
always a good thing.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.820
Anybody a football fan?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.894
Don't the Cowboys play on
Thanksgiving every year?

00:09:34.894 --> 00:09:37.070
I'm not a huge football fan.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.710
I think it's a big
deal for most people.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.210
And you can see on
the french toast,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.319
we're starting to get that
really yummy brownness,

00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:45.360
and that's really crispy.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.720
And the butter from
it adds a really nice

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.375
like toasty nuttiness to it.

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.950
So once you've got that
on both sides, what

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.312
I was talking about earlier
is, kind of just take it out.

00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:57.520
And I like to cut it like so.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.520
See how the inside's
kind of raw inside still?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.880
You just kind of slice it,
put it right on like that.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.930
That way you avoid raw
egg in the morning,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.517
because nobody
really likes raw egg.

00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:25.142
AUDIENCE: Do you
prefer ceramic knives?

00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:30.072
Or is just for small--

00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:31.530
DAKOTA WEISS: For
small stuff these

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.820
are really kind of fun knives.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.200
Plus they're pink,
and I love pink.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.740
But they're really lightweight.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.910
And when you're
cooking all day long

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.040
and you've got a
super heavy knife,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.330
after a while your
arm is just like, ugh.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.110
It's very tiring.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.210
Just depends on what
I'm doing, honestly.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.930
Something like this-- perfect.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.220
So see how we get a nice
cool little caramelization

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.890
inside there?

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.810
Yum.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.460
I'm just going to
kind of beautifully

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.990
place these on our plate.

00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:08.370
That one needs to
go a little longer.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.490
And then you've already got
your chicken, sorry chicken,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.850
turkey-- it is
Thanksgiving, right?

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:19.089
In a pot, heated for you.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.960
Cranberry sauce-- I heated
this up a little bit,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.645
just because I think it'll
taste a little better.

00:11:30.645 --> 00:11:33.150
But really you're going to
kind of just load it up.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.936
Top like that, and we're going
to add our delicious gravy

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:42.435
mixture.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.015
Voila, breakfast is served.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.810
Does it look good?

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.920
I think it's going
to taste delicious.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.220
So I'm going to make some
smaller ones for you guys.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.745
Any questions?

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:10.119
AUDIENCE: What
are you guys doing

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:12.644
at the restaurant
for Thanksgiving?

00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:14.060
DAKOTA WEISS: At
the restaurant we

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.910
do a family-style
Thanksgiving, just

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.260
because-- since I
have to work on it,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.790
I want to pretend
like I'm having

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.170
a normal Thanksgiving
like most people.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.320
So we have a pretty
traditional Thanksgiving menu

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.070
with the turkey.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.855
We're doing a Seckel pear salad,
a sunchoke parsnip bisque.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:38.230
Let me think what
else we've got.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.680
Pretty much normal,
pumpkin pie, of course.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.214
Pumpkin creme brulee, as well.

00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:47.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.640
DAKOTA WEISS: A pie
besides pumpkin?

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.640
I have a favorite that
I make every year.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.950
It's my favorite, since
I'm not a pumpkin pie fan.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.330
I make a buttermilk
rum soaked raisin pie.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.890
And they're really, really easy.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.150
And then I think another great
traditional one is pecan pie.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.360
Those are my two go-tos, since
I'm not a super huge pumpkin

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.160
pie person.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.890
What's that?

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.662
AUDIENCE: Do you
do the pie crust?

00:13:33.662 --> 00:13:36.150
Do you make the pie crust?

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.240
DAKOTA WEISS: Well, it
depends on if I have the time.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.350
AUDIENCE: Do you make
the crust [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:47.530
DAKOTA WEISS: It
just sticks together.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.150
Because you do it
when it's really cold,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.570
and it's kind of
like-- I'm trying

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.680
to think something
to relate it to.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.320
It just does.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.590
Because it's like the flour
and the butter and everything

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.082
has binded together.

00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:04.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.080
DAKOTA WEISS: Yeah,
you can roll it.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.708
I think that's a like super
awesome Martha Stewart trick.

00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:12.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.750
DAKOTA WEISS: It does
require patience.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.360
And especially with baking, I
don't have a lot of patience.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.750
And I'm not the best baker.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.931
It's a lot about measuring
everything, weighing everything

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:26.430
out.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.960
And I get a little too antsy and
I want it now, now, now, now,.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.920
I'm not super huge on like,
clearing off the teaspoons.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.290
So it is tricky.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.140
But like she said, the
rolling pin method is great.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.600
But as long as it's cold
and it's made properly.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.155
But if I'm at home usually
I just buy frozen pie crust.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.430
DAKOTA WEISS: Exactly, exactly.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.676
Are there any vegetarians?

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:07.326
Because I can make
it minus the turkey.

00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:10.700
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
tips for the perfect turkey?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:16.490
Is it buying the right
turkey, or cooking it right?

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.750
DAKOTA WEISS: It's still
a little of everything.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.500
For me, the most important thing
about having your turkey come

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.790
out moist, which I
think everybody-- that's

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.040
kind of their biggest thing,
like it's always so dry--

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.290
is to brine it.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.690
You know, put it in a
salt, sugar mixture.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.070
I like to put a
little bit of scotch

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:41.440
in mine, just because it makes
it so much better, and lots

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.880
of thyme, lots of garlic.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.630
It's basically just equal
parts sugar and salt to water.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.380
Let it sit overnight and then
take it out and roast it.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.590
I always shove a little
butter under the skin,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.825
because butter makes
everything better.

00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:00.250
AUDIENCE: Butter and scotch.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.260
DAKOTA WEISS: Butter
and scotch, right?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.086
What else could you ask for?

00:16:05.086 --> 00:16:07.280
AUDIENCE: Bacon.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.250
DAKOTA WEISS: Bacon, good one.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.920
All right, I don't know
if you have-- oh yes,

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.136
forks, right there.

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:16.690
Here's the morning after.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.270
I think I made enough.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.781
Please come up and try, or
I could bring it to you.

00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:27.530
Whatever's easier.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.120
There's lots, yes-- absolutely.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.786
AUDIENCE: You can eat
this for breakfast

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:51.560
and then a turkey
sandwich for lunch.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.970
DAKOTA WEISS: Probably, yeah.

00:16:56.697 --> 00:16:58.030
Does it taste like Thanksgiving?

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.620
AUDIENCE: What were the
proportions of [INAUDIBLE] egg?

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.890
DAKOTA WEISS: I usually
go almost equal.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.859
And then sometimes if
I'm feeling super saucy,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.550
I'll add a little
extra egg yolk just

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.636
to give it more of
a custardy feel.

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:15.138
AUDIENCE: Do you
put the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:27.869
DAKOTA WEISS: You said
Alton Brown said that?

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:28.585
He's a genius.

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:31.480
So I normally listen
to everything he says.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.354
I don't know.

00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:33.770
I also don't like
it, though, when

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.978
it gets really, really soggy.

00:17:34.978 --> 00:17:37.210
And brioche is very
absorbent bread.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.940
So if it gets too
soggy, it literally just

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.460
like crumbles to pieces.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.500
And then you've just got, like,
bread pudding so to speak.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.290
But I mean, he's pretty smart.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.540
And most of the time he knows
what he's talking about.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.980
I've not tried that technique.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.870
But I'm going to tonight.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.016
How is it?

00:17:56.016 --> 00:17:57.274
AUDIENCE: Delicious.

00:17:57.274 --> 00:17:58.690
DAKOTA WEISS: Would
you have that?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.200
It's easy to make
for breakfast, right?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.670
Everybody goes back
to their family

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.180
and wake up the next morning
and surprise your whole family.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:05.846
Look what I did.

00:18:08.184 --> 00:18:09.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:11.194 --> 00:18:12.860
DAKOTA WEISS: Bread
pudding, absolutely.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.478
Nothing wrong with
bread pudding.

00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:17.747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:17.747 --> 00:18:19.330
DAKOTA WEISS: If you
don't have plans,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.190
then definitely come to the
W. We've got a fun menu.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.190
We've got a turkey burger
that we're serving out

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.190
in our backyard
restaurant in case

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.406
you don't want to do the
whole big dinner thing.

00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:33.889
But we have everything.

00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:35.430
AUDIENCE: Are you
at the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:39.160
DAKOTA WEISS: There's two.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.100
I'm the one in Westwood,
which is on the UCLA campus.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.950
Well, near UCLA campus.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.850
It's kind of tucked
right between now

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.990
Wilshire and Sunset.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.930
And we've got a
huge backyard, lots

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.040
of outdoor seating with a
tent, given our cold weather.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.110
So, excellent-- thank you guys.
