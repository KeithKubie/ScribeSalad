00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.250
DR. JAMES GRIME: So we're
going to do a little

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.030
mathematical trick that I'm
hoping that people will like

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.060
and they'll try out on their
friends and family.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.890
So let's do it.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.530
We're going to write out
four-digit numbers.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.680
So like this, right?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.480
Now, you've got 3,485, but
we'll take it in turns.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.770
So give me a four-digit
number.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.280
You could just shout out four
digits if you want.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.935
Go on.

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:27.786
BRADY HARAN: You want
one from me?

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:28.132
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.530
BRADY HARAN: 7,721.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.840
DR. JAMES GRIME: 7,721.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.021
And now I'll come up with a
different one, like 2,278.

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:39.953
Give me another.

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:42.368
BRADY HARAN: 1,891.

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:45.130
DR. JAMES GRIME: 1,891.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.400
And I'll come up with another
one, like 8, 1--

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.645
something--

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:51.330
8.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.970
And we're going to add
these together.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.101
3,485, 7,721, 8, 1--

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.532
and 8, there you go.

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:04.720
So we see what that is.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.980
Let's see what the answer is.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.840
OK, so the final answer
is 23,483.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.120
Now, before I started the trick,
I made a prediction on

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.300
that strip of brown paper.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.690
Let's have a look.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.450
Let's have a look at
my prediction.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:36.790
If I open up my prediction,
it says, I predict 23,483.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.830
And then I think what you're
meant to say here is tra-da!

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.930
Do you want to see
how to do it?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.990
Shall we learn how to do it?

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.410
All right, and then people
can do it to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.780
their friends, as well.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960
Did you notice I
started it off?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200
So I picked a number
to begin with.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.070
Then you picked a number.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.830
Then the number I picked
after you-- and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.310
we took it in turns--

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.950
remember, I picked the digits
column by column add up to 9.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.930
So 7 and 2, 7 and 2,
2 and 7, 1 and 8.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.820
So these two together
are equal to 9,999.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.270
The next two rows, I
did the same thing.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.150
Can you see?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.995
They add up to 9.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.340
I had the 0 there when
you picked the 9.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.780
And that's 9,999.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.810
So the last four rows together
are going to be just shy--

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.004
well, this is just
shy of 10,000.

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:30.220
Add them together.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.050
It's just shy of 20,000.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.570
It's 2 short.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.470
It's 19,998.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.920
So I knew that the last four
numbers were 19,998.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.670
So what I did to make
the prediction--

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.680
I had thought of this
in advance.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.110
And then I added 20,000 to it,
which is quite easy to do,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.290
because you put the digit
2 at the beginning.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.000
And then because it's 2
less than 20,000, I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.240
subtract the number 2.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.520
So you put the digit
2 at the start.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.740
And then you subtract
2 from the end.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.550
And you can make your
prediction.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.410
And you can look like a
mathematical genius.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.610
MATT PARKER: Back to
the chosen card.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.990
You're just not going
to get far enough.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.233
But what you will do is you'll
take off, well, let's say 12.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:22.070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.370
And then obviously you're going
to do the thing with,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.690
oh, no, that's not it, it
didn't work, boo hoo.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.200
The trick now is, instead of
putting these back on top, put

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.450
them underneath.
