00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.320
Did Newton Really Have an Apple Fall on His
Head?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.809
In grade school you probably learned Newton’s
apple story around the time you learned that

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.120
George Washington chopped down a cherry tree,
that people in Columbus’ time thought that

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.769
the world was flat, or that the Pilgrims celebrated
the first Thanksgiving in America and invited

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.849
the Native Americans to join them.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.760
Since literally none of the latter three stories
here are true (follow the preceding links

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.029
for full details), you probably have your
doubts about whether Newton actually sat under

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
an apple tree and had something of a “eureka”
moment concerning gravity.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.059
It might surprise you to learn, then, that
your teachers got one of these stories (partially)

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.100
correct.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.450
Newton was indeed sitting under an apple tree
when he had his so-called “eureka” moment

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.469
on how gravity worked.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.690
Although, it took him over two decades more
to develop the fully-fledged theory of “universal

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.200
gravitation”, first published in his Philosophiæ
Naturalis Principia Mathematica on July 5,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
1687.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.050
He also didn’t complete it without some
ideas others had already come up with, such

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.949
as Christopher Wren, Robert Hooke, and Edmond
Halley (who Halley’s comet is named after);

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.380
though Newton claims particularly Hooke, who
corresponded heavily with Newton on gravity,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
and his ideas had little real bearing on his
work, other than simply to inspire him to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.660
continue working on the problem.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.440
As Newton stated when Hooke accused Newton
of plagiarizing his work:

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.840
Yet am I not beholden to him for any light
into that business but only for the diversion

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.740
he gave me from my other studies to think
on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.700
writing as if he had found the motion in the
Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it…

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.410
So perhaps “eureka” conveys much too strong
of a leap.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.280
From accounts, he was more just put on the
correct path while musing under the tree.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.380
Further, it would seem that the apple didn’t
fall directly on his head- at least there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960
is no documented evidence of this.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.640
But if you discount the notion that he near
instantly fleshed out his universal theory

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.580
and the “fell on his head” bit, the common
story is pretty accurate.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.060
One of the best sources we have for the “apple
falling on Newton’s head” anecdote is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.610
a manuscript written by Newton’s friend
William Stukeley.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.090
He published Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s
Life in 1752, becoming one of Newton’s first

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.119
biographers.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.500
Many of the incidences described in the book
were recorded much earlier than 1752, including

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.450
the “apple” story which was first documented
in 1726, the year Newton died, and then again

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.700
a year later by Voltaire in his Epic Poetry.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.840
Stukeley’s account is as follows:

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.500
After dinner, the weather being warm, we went
into the garden, &amp; drank tea under the shade

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.190
of some appletrees, only he, &amp; myself.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.060
amidst other discourse, he told me, he was
just in the same situation, as when formerly,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.290
the notion of gravitation came into his mind.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.670
“Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly
to the ground,” thought he to him self:

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.870
occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he
sat in a contemplative mood: “Why should

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.390
it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly
to the earths centre?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.010
Assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws
it.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.790
There must be a drawing power in matter.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
&amp; the sum of the drawing power in the matter
of the earth must be in the earths centre,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.070
not in any side of the earth.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.800
therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly,
or toward the centre.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.270
If matter thus draws matter; it must be in
proportion of its quantity.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.850
Therefore the apple draws the earth, as well
as the earth draws the apple.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.819
John Conduitt, Newton’s assistant and the
husband of his niece, told pretty much the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:24.990
same story.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.500
Newton lived with the pair in his later years
and doted upon their daughter.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.290
When writing about Newton, Conduitt said:

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.740
In the year he retired again from Cambridge
on account of the plague to his mother in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.910
Lincolnshire &amp; whilst he was musing in a garden
it came into his thought that the same power

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.140
of gravity (which made an apple fall from
the tree to the ground) was not limited to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.750
a certain distance from the earth but must
extend much farther than was usually thought

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.930
– Why not as high as the Moon said he to
himself &amp; if so that must influence her motion

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.530
&amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon
he fell a calculating what would be the effect

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.590
of that supposition but being absent from
books &amp; taking the common estimate in use

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.510
among Geographers &amp; our sea men before Norwood
had measured the earth, that 60 English miles

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.939
were contained in one degree of latitude his
computation did not agree with his Theory

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.880
&amp; inclined him then to entertain a notion
that together with the power of gravity there

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.900
might be a mixture of that force which the
moon would have if it was carried along in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.940
a vortex, but when the Tract of Picard of
the measure of the earth came out shewing

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.090
that a degree was about 69.12 English miles
He began his calculation a new &amp; found it

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.600
perfectly agreeable to his Theory.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.990
The “year [Newton] retired again from Cambridge”
was 1666, which means Stukeley’s recording

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.210
of the event took place some 60 years after
it happened.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.430
However, both Stukeley and Conduitt, among
others, appear to have independently heard

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.810
the story directly from Newton himself, making
it reasonable to believe a falling apple was,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.440
indeed, the source of Newton’s first significant
musings over how gravity works.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.470
There are many different places which claim
to be the home of the apple tree that inspired

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.120
Newton’s theory, but the most likely one—given
the accounts—is located at his family home

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.660
of Woolsthorpe Manor near Grantham, UK.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.050
And, yes, there is an apple tree there today
that is thought to be the apple tree in question,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.130
though it has re-rooted in the interim after
being knocked over in a storm in 1890.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.090
Now around 400 years old, the tree and the
property are protected by the National Trust.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.530
If you’re curious, the tree is a Flower
of Kent, which doesn’t produce very good

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.949
apples for eating by today’s standards,
though they are considered good cooking apples.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.630
Further, the apples in question are green,
not red as is often depicted in Isaac Newton/apple

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.630
images.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.830
You’ll note, of course, that Stukeley above
stated there was more than one apple tree

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.370
there at the time; so whether this remaining
one is “the” apple tree is a question

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.360
can’t be definitively answered until someone
invents a machine that can take us back in

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.650
time to observe the event.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.606
That being said, Dr Richard Keesing from the
Department of Physics at the University of

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:52.606
York makes a pretty good case for why it probably
is the correct tree.

00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:54.150
Despite this uncertainty, there are a many
trees that have been started as grafts from

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.340
the Woolsthorpe tree, including one at Trinity
College in Cambridge which sits beneath the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.590
window of the room Newton used when studying
there.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.040
Bonus Facts:

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.620
Astronomer Alexis Clairaut in 1727 commented
on Hooke’s accusations that Newton stole

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.150
Hooke’s work, summing up the situation nicely:
“One must not think that this idea … of

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.350
Hooke diminishes Newton’s glory… the example
of Hooke [serves] to show what a distance

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.590
there is between a truth that is glimpsed
and a truth that is demonstrated.”

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.910
Essentially, Hooke guessed at a notion that
Newton was able to prove.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.690
Newton himself never chose to make an official
guess at what actually was the underlying

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.260
mechanism of gravity.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.750
In fact, while he noted “It is enough that
gravity does really exist and acts according

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.040
to the laws I have explained, and that it
abundantly serves to account for all the motions

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.150
of celestial bodies,” he also stated “That
one body may act upon another at a distance

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.750
through a vacuum without the mediation of
anything else, by and through which their

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.850
action and force may be conveyed from one
another, is to me so great an absurdity that,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.020
I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters
a competent faculty of thinking could ever

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.020
fall into it.”

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.020
:-)
Besides the above references to who Newton

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.020
told the “apple tree” story to, two others
also gave an account of him telling the story

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.020
to them: Catherine Barton (his niece) and
Christopher Dawson (a student at Cambridge).

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.020
It isn’t clear whether Voltaire heard the
“apple” story from Newton himself or if

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.020
he was told it by a mutual friend or found
out about it in some other manner.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.020
That said, the pair were friends or at least
acquaintances, depending on your definition

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.020
of “friends”.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020
Voltaire was even present at Newton’s funeral.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.020
In 1976, Apple Computers briefly used a logo
that featured Sir Isaac Newton sitting beneath

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.020
an apple tree.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.020
It was designed by Ronald Wayne, a lesser-known
co-founder of the company.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.020
Apple later changed the logo to the more recognizable
rainbow apple with the bite taken out of it.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020
Newton has been commemorated in many different
ways.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020
Perhaps one of the larger monuments to his
genius is a statue by Eduardo Paolozzi which

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.020
stands near the British Library in London.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.020
The statue is based on an etching of Newton
by William Blake.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.020
William Stukeley, Newton’s biographer, had
quite the resume himself.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.020
In addition to being a doctor, he had a key
interest in historical monuments and is perhaps

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.020
best known for his excavation of Stonehenge.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.020
He was the first person to recognize the alignment
of Stonehenge on solstices and attributed

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.020
the iconic landmark to the druids.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.020
He later became a vicar, had a keen interest
in Robin Hood, and wrote music for the flute.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.020
Newton was buried in Westminster Abbey.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.020
Not far down the nave, John Conduitt was also
buried.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.020
According to an inscription, Conduitt “wished
his remains to be placed opposite this spot,

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.020
near to the ashes of the great Newton, to
whom he was linked by ties of affinity.”

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.020
Mercury was found in Newton’s hair when
it was examined after his death, likely a

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.020
result of his experiments in alchemy.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.020
Newton was the second scientist to be knighted,
though it’s thought he was granted knighthood

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.020
for political reasons rather than his achievements.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.020
He was knighted in April 1705, over 100 years
after the first knighted scientist, Sir Francis

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.020
Bacon, was given the honour in 1603.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.020
The value of “G” in Newton’s famous
“universal gravity” equation wasn’t

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.020
accurately determined until 71 years after
Newton’s death and 111 years after he published

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.022
the equation.
