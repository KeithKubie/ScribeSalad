00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,120
You are listening to radio lab, radio lab

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,740
from w. N y.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,741
S.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,620
E. N. N. P. R. Alright, so for this
podcast I want to talk about my kid. Uh,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,400
his name is a meal. This is
him right here. Oh by the way,

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,270
I do plan to make this interesting to
people who don't have kids cause I was

7
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:32,070
just one of those people two months ago.
So bear with me. But uh, OK. A meal,

8
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,060
he's two months old,

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,980
he still in the Munchkin phase and he's
just starting to tune in the world.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,970
So there are these moments like yesterday
for example, where he gets real quiet

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,970
and he just stares at me.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,850
It's kind of amazing actually,

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,860
but it also kind of presents
an interesting question
which I want to explore

14
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,350
right here. In fact, you can't avoid it.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,230
You're just staring at this
thing and you're like [inaudible]

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,570
what is this little creature experiencing?

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,000
Like here is a little human being
that is brand new in the world.

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,950
What does the world look like to a
tiny baby? What does it smell like?

19
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,000
What does it sound like?

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,700
And I have to find somebody who could
help me or at least begin to answer these

21
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:28,390
questions. Okay. Hello. Hi
Jad. Hi. Is this Charles? Yes,

22
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,250
that's right. Good to talk to you.
Charles. Before we get started,

23
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,950
can I just have you introduce yourself
so I can get your name right? Okay. Hi,

24
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:39,550
my name is Charles Fernie Ho on a writer
and developmental psychologist from

25
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:43,270
Dharma University. And back when
Charles had his first child at Dina,

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,570
he decided to tackle that
question of what is it like,

27
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,820
what's going on for this little
person as a dad, you know, as a,

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,630
as an Austrac new dad,
but also as a scientist.

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,320
So he wrote a book called a thousand
days of wonder. Scientists Chronicle,

30
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,810
if his daughter's developing mind,

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,000
amazing book where he basically goes
through what we do and don't know about

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,850
what's happening in the minds. A
little babies when they're brand new.

33
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,590
So I put the scenario to him.
Okay, meal's brand new. Oh,

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,930
when I'm sitting there holding him
and we're staring at each other,

35
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,790
what exactly is he seeing?

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,410
One difference that does relate to
their visual system is that they're,

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,810
the lens of their eye is absolutely
crystal clear. Whereas your Lens,

38
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:27,040
my Lens is because they're of a certain
age, they've become slightly yellowed,

39
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,510
so they filter out some of the blue
frequencies of the light that we see,

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,480
so we paint the picture out.
What would that be like for them?

41
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,360
I mean this is my, my stab at
imagining what this would be like.

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,600
If you can imagine being in
a Greek village in the summer

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:43,950
[inaudible]

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,780
that name Sun is directly overhead
and it's one of those villages where

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,150
everything is white. You need
the houses are all painted white,

46
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,990
you're wearing sunglasses and you
suddenly take off those sunglasses.

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,060
It's not bright. Yeah.

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,490
I think light is a big as probably
the biggest shock to newborn babies,

49
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,950
but it's interesting to consider did
that blinding Hayes of whiteness might

50
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,560
actually be how the world
really is. We just don't see it

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,580
in any case. Then I asked him about sound.

52
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,390
Do babies hear things differently than
adults the same way they see things

53
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,470
differently? And he said, yeah, we
think so. We think they hear Echo.

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,340
Yeah. The echoes are actually there.

55
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,790
Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,280
But our brains filter them out.

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,750
But it takes some time for
them to learn to do that. Um,

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,790
I mean the science behind it,
it's quite complicated and like,

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,260
I don't think I could
explain it now, but, um,

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,680
it's to do with the relative
times of arrival that the,

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,580
that the sound makes on the, uh, the two
years. But the brain basically has to,

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,520
has to learn to make this adjustment.
They can't do it straight away.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,560
And so a newborn baby's hearing, we
guess, we don't know for sure, again,

64
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,120
because we can't know what it's like,

65
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,020
but we guessed that babies hear
things in a very echoey way,

66
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,850
but it gets even stranger.
Tell me about the, uh,

67
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,680
the experiment with the
babies and the brain cap.

68
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,030
Yeah. I described the study
that was done with, um,

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,750
babies where they were taking EEG
measurements and these are the kind of

70
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:29,670
measurements that you get when you put
a net of 16 or so electrodes over the

71
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:30,504
scalp.

72
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,370
And these electrodes pick up the very
small electrical changes that go on as

73
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,310
your brain works and
it's a perfectly safe,

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,730
harmless procedure which you can
do with very young babies. Well,

75
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:42,960
usually when you do these studies,

76
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:47,961
you can see the way c see the way in which
particular parts of the brain respond

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,460
to different kinds of stimulus.

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,050
In an adult brain he says if
you show someone a picture,

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,220
you will see a little bit of electricity
towards the back of their brain.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,430
If on the other hand you heard a sound,

81
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,730
then the bit of your brain sort of
slightly further forward from that,

82
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,530
the auditory cortex would fire
and you wouldn't see any in the

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,160
visual cortex because different parts
of the brain have different jobs.

84
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,900
But what happened with these babies is
that things got very strange like the

85
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:19,680
researchers with show them a bunch of
pictures like boop, here's a circle, boop,

86
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,860
here's a cross. And often things
would work as they were supposed to.

87
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:26,160
They would see like a little spark in
the back of the baby's brain where vision

88
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,140
is processed. Sometimes they wouldn't.

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,690
Sometimes when they showed them, most say
a cross division part would be silent,

90
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,460
but they'd see a spark in the auditory
cortex, the hearing part of the brain.

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,370
So the picture would trigger
a sound in their head.

92
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,190
We don't know what it triggered in
their head for them subjectively,

93
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:50,191
but we do know that a part of the brain
that shouldn't have fired did fine.

94
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,530
They were hitting me w
w what you're saying,

95
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:57,740
but not quite allowing to pass through
your list. It they were hearing

96
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,720
the picture but we don't,

97
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:04,721
we don't know what they heard but it's
a good basis for saying that when a

98
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:10,661
newborn brain is developing
these different wirings
that lead information into

99
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,860
different parts of the brain,
it's still taking shape.

100
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,110
It might be, he says it inside a
meal's brain right now at two months.

101
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,560
All of his senses are
in a big synesthetic,

102
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,530
not so that when he hears my voice,

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,220
maybe he sees flashes of color or maybe
when he looks at the wall he hears tones

104
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,330
or maybe when light comes in through
the window he tastes it like salt or

105
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,140
something. I don't know. I mean
that's the thing. We can't,

106
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,510
and I mean there's really strong
philosophical grounds for being skeptical

107
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,950
there. I mean, actually I can't
know that anybody is conscious.

108
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,050
Wait,

109
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,730
what does that mean? I can't
know that you're conscious but,

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,170
but I'm talking to you.
Sure you are. But you know,

111
00:06:56,171 --> 00:07:00,580
you could be a really smart Zombie.
You could be a robot. You know,

112
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,760
I can't see you. You're
5,000 miles away. I mean,

113
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:07,510
it may be that I'm the only person in
the University of his conscious. Huh.

114
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,010
We tend to, you know, the vast
majority of us tend to say, well,

115
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,790
he looks like me and he talks like me
and he thinks like me and he perceives

116
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,180
like me, so he's going to be like
me. But it is a leap of faith.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,920
Then I told him about the,
uh, the stair, how, you know,

118
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,210
just in the last little bit,

119
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,540
and Emil has started to really stare
at us and we stare back and it's,

120
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,070
that's not a leap of faith.
That's for real. And he, um,

121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,050
you told me something really depressing

122
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,460
in those first couple of months.

123
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,560
The visual system is controlled by the
subcortical regions and they're kind of

124
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,700
the old bits of the brain. The cortex
is the relatively new evolution.

125
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,180
You're only speaking the relatively new
part of the brain that surrounds the

126
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:55,740
whole thing and there's a switch
between one kind of control system,

127
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,400
the sub-cortical system
and the cortical systems,

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,990
but as the handover happens, and this
is happening at about two months,

129
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,390
it's probably there's, it'd be interesting
to know if he's doing this now.

130
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,850
As the handover happens,

131
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,020
there is a kind of struggle for power
and the subcortical regions which were

132
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,700
controlling vision can have,

133
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:19,320
don't immediately want to cede power to
the cortical regions so the baby loses

134
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:19,710
control,

135
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,240
temporarily loses control of where he or
she is looking because of this struggle

136
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:24,870
for power,

137
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,650
really the scientists called a sticky
fixation and it's where a baby will just

138
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:32,130
keep staring at you. It's as if
the baby can't take his eyes off.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,030
Yes, this is what's happening now you're
telling me this is a brain glitch.

140
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,360
She's quite a well-documented phenomenon
and it's bad news for the parents who

141
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,680
think that their babies get gazing.
Gazing at them. Adore and Ah,

142
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,230
cause actually they just kind of,
they don't know where to look.

143
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,640
They can't control where they're looking.

144
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,400
They don't know how to look away
basically. Ah, depressing. [inaudible]

145
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,490
this might actually be one of those
cases where ignorance really is bliss

146
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,130
because the truth is you have to, you

147
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,790
have to make that leap of faith, or at
least you have to believe whatever it is.

148
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,760
You have to believe so that when he
looks at you and you look back at him,

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,073
you smile.

150
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,150
Because eventually that will teach
this little dude how the world works,

151
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,860
that humans operate on relationships,
which are these feedback loops,

152
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,660
which, okay, at this moment
in time for him or not real,

153
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,430
they will be soon.
