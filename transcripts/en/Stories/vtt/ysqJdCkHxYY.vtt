[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:05.890
NARRATOR: Well,
this isn't something

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.730
you see every day-- a big
black sign with a rather

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.500
unusual message on the side
of a road in a place that

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.800
looks like it's in
the middle of nowhere.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.420
"See mystery lights."

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.090
All right.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.040
I'm curious.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.650
What exactly does it mean?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.488
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.100
The person who pulled over to
photograph the mysterious sign

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.829
was this guy.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.620
JONATHAN ZEDDA: Hi.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.310
My name is Jonathan Zedda.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.390
I am a fine art photographer
based in Rome, Italy.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.570
The photo was taken
in Marfa, Texas,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.370
around January of last year.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.710
The photo is actually
the advertisement

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.520
billboard for a hotel in Marfa.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.400
But it was just so bold and big
compared to the desert scenery.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.830
That immediately
attracted my attention.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.040
I was in Texas as part of
an ongoing documentation

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.280
of the desert.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.060
I'm very fascinated
by the desert.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.610
It's an area that attracts me
a lot, especially image-wise.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.125
It's just that
there's no limits.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:11.470
The horizon is just so vast.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.980
And from a photography
point of view,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.530
it was just a beautiful place.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.780
NARRATOR: But we're not here
to talk about the desert,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.700
no matter how beautiful it is.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270
We want to know what
the mystery lights are.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.980
JONATHAN ZEDDA: I
was just driving back

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.300
toward the city on the highway.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.400
And that particular
sign was just there.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.560
And nothing else was around.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.209
So it was really easy to spot.

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:35.750
NARRATOR: Mystery
lights are actually

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.360
a thing here in Marfa, Texas.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.950
They're are strange phenomena
that occur year-around

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670
near route 67,
just east of Marfa.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.890
The lights, also referred to
as the Marfa ghost lights,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.690
are unexplained beams
of bright white lights

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.284
that flicker across the desert
horizon in the night sky.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.075
Catching a glimpse of
the lights is tricky,

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:58.559
as sightings are reported
only 10 to 20 times per year.

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:01.100
But for the onlookers who have
been lucky enough to see them,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.940
the only explanation
is that it's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.250
some sort of paranormal
activity or UFOs.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.470
To the skeptics, they
might just be car lights.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.590
JONATHAN ZEDDA: There was no
lights that particular day

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.190
or during my stay in Marfa.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.405
It was a beautiful place anyway.

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:20.080
The Marfa lights are just a
part of the beauty of the city

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.350
and the charm of the city.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.270
It's a small city in
the middle of nowhere

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.000
that was kept, like, in the
'50s, sort of like time machine

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.746
or time bubble in
the '50s of America.

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:32.870
NARRATOR: Though the town
sits in a desolate desert

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.190
with a population
just shy of 2,000,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.830
it's become a
popular destination

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.050
for contemporary
artists over the years.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.960
Today, the town is more
than mystery lights.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.820
It hosts gallery exhibitions,
art installations, festivals,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.900
and residency
programs, making it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.360
a rather unique and
expressive part of Texas.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.410
NARRATOR: Not every Texan is
even aware that Marfa exists,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.910
if not on the map.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.840
It's just plain interesting
to visit, period.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.340
And I don't know if you
can find anything like that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.209
anywhere else in the States.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.750

MALE SPEAKER: The Salton
Sea is a peculiar place.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.220
It's technically the
largest lake in California.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.180
It's located in the hottest
desert in North America.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.090
And it was created by accident.
