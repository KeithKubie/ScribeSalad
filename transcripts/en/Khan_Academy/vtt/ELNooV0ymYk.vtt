00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.467
- [Lecturer] Al is comparing
two recipes for homemade bread.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.720
The recipe for white bread calls for

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.332
4/10 of a kilogram of flour.

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.281
The recipe for whole wheat bread

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:15.448
calls for 385/1000 of a kilogram of flour.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.501
Which bread takes less flour?

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.606
So the white bread calls
for 4/10 of a kilogram,

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.703
while the recipe of whole
wheat bread calls for

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.870
0.385 kilograms, or
385/1000 of a kilogram.

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:39.822
Now the way I wrote it is important.

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:41.576
You always want to line up the decimals

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:43.224
when you are comparing,
because you want to

00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:45.446
compare numbers in the same place value.

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:48.014
And this is an interesting
example of even though

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.791
the number down here has
more digits it doesn't mean

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.421
that it's necessarily a larger number.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.160
What we want to do when we compare numbers

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.108
and this is true whether we're
dealing with decimals or not,

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.185
is we start in the largest place value.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.272
We could start in the ones place,

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:03.033
'cause both of these have zero ones.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.096
Then we go one place value
down, we go to the tenths place.

00:01:06.096 --> 00:01:11.040
The white bread, it requires 4/10 of flour

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.876
while in the whole wheat bread
we only have 3/10 of flour.

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:16.419
So we can stop right there.

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:18.469
This has more tenths than this does.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.498
It doesn't matter that this has more

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.009
hundredths and thousandths.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.507
Those are less significant.

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:27.184
They don't add up to as much
as what we're dealing with

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:30.590
when we look just at the tenths place.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.468
So because four is greater than three,

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:37.092
and we're in the tenths place
we know that white bread

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:40.377
takes more flour, but we
have to be very careful.

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:42.409
They said which bread takes less flour?

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.306
So it's going to be whole wheat bread.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.306
Three is less than four.

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:50.331
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:54.332
A group of fifth graders kept track

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.063
of the number of hours they spent

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.707
working on their science project right?

00:01:58.707 --> 00:02:00.509
Put the students in order from the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.750
least to greatest amount of time spent.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.173
The student with the least amount of time

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:05.901
should be at the top of the list.

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.509
So pause this video and
see if you can do this.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.167
And this is actually a screenshot

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:12.473
from the Khan Academy exercise.

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:13.983
If you're doing the Khan Academy exercise

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:15.318
you'd actually be able to click on these

00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:16.473
and move them around.

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:18.191
But let's compare them.

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.974
So as I mentioned in the last example,

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.723
when you're comparing numbers it's good

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:24.833
to line up the place
values, so let's do that.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.083
So Adam is 5.5.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.576
Aviv is five, and Jenny is 5.17.

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:37.659
So once again, start at
the largest place value.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.087
Start at the ones.

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:41.427
They all have exactly five ones,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.640
so then we move to the next place value.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.176
In this case, we're going
to go to the tenths place.

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:48.881
So when we look at the tenths place,

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:50.807
interesting things are going on.

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:52.584
Aviv has no tenths.

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:55.658
It's a blank here, but
you could do this as 5.0.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.872
So Aviv has the fewest tenths, then comes

00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:02.964
Jenny with only 1/10
and then Adam has 5/10.

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:06.089
So that tells us enough so
that we can order the three.

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.854
We don't even have to look
at the hundredths place

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:11.047
because the tenths here are different.

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.839
So the least number of tenths is Aviv,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.366
so that's going to be Aviv is the least.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.576
They all have the same number of ones,

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:19.547
but Aviv has the least tenths.

00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:21.341
Then comes Jenny.

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.809
Jenny, once again, they all
have the same number of ones

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.226
but then Jenny has less tenths than Adam,

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.738
and then comes Adam.

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:32.821
Adam has the most tenths.

00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:37.269
It doesn't matter that
Jenny also has 7/100.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.909
Notice you could view this as 17/100

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.936
which is going to be less than 5/10

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:45.480
which could also be viewed as 50/100.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.489
So the general way to think about it,

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.377
start at the most significant,

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.824
the largest place value, compare.

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:55.098
If things are equal, go
to the next place value.

00:03:55.098 --> 00:03:56.742
When things are different, then you have

00:03:56.742 --> 00:04:00.242
enough information to start ordering them.
