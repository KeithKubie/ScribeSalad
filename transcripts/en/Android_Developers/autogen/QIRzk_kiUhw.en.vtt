but doesn't do anything especially
especially because it doesn't know

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970

anything there's really no reason to

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109
anything there's really no reason to
 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.690
anything there's really no reason to
have that exactly so that's that's the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700

Oh even if it still does something you
 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.430
Oh even if it still does something you
shouldn't have it anymore that's true

shouldn't have it anymore that's true
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.839
shouldn't have it anymore that's true
yeah that is right there there is no

swear menu button is deprecated so yeah
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.909
swear menu button is deprecated so yeah
at this point we really shouldn't be

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919
at this point we really shouldn't be
 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.680
at this point we really shouldn't be
seeing that anymore me exactly so yeah

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
seeing that anymore me exactly so yeah
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.390
seeing that anymore me exactly so yeah
that would be step one is remove that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
that would be step one is remove that
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.729
that would be step one is remove that

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
menu button out having the little eyes
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.280
menu button out having the little eyes
that's is interesting now nothing's on

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
that's is interesting now nothing's on
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.319
that's is interesting now nothing's on
so you actually drag it oh you can click

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329
so you actually drag it oh you can click
 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.599
so you actually drag it oh you can click
as well click target doesn't seem to be

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609
as well click target doesn't seem to be
 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.940
as well click target doesn't seem to be
working a hundred percent of the time so

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
working a hundred percent of the time so
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650
working a hundred percent of the time so
that's a bit of feedback but yes it also

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660
that's a bit of feedback but yes it also
 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.479
that's a bit of feedback but yes it also
works the dragging is quite nice now the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
works the dragging is quite nice now the
 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.430
works the dragging is quite nice now the
other thing that confuse me too now that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
other thing that confuse me too now that
 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.229
other thing that confuse me too now that
back button what do you think that's

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
back button what do you think that's
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.080
back button what do you think that's
back oh that's a good question

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
back oh that's a good question
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.089
back oh that's a good question
it's just above the other back button I

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099
it's just above the other back button I
 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.009
it's just above the other back button I
would probably think undo it doesn't do

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019
would probably think undo it doesn't do
 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.599
would probably think undo it doesn't do
well it took me I was like what's gonna

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609
well it took me I was like what's gonna
 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.949
well it took me I was like what's gonna
happen when I push this button yeah

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
happen when I push this button yeah
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.330
happen when I push this button yeah
definitely anything which looks like a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340
definitely anything which looks like a
 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.800
definitely anything which looks like a
back button I think you're kind of

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
back button I think you're kind of
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.569
back button I think you're kind of
taking your usability into your own

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579
taking your usability into your own
 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.789
taking your usability into your own
hands here cuz you suddenly go oh is

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799
hands here cuz you suddenly go oh is
 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.830
hands here cuz you suddenly go oh is
this gonna exit no clearly kids aren't

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
this gonna exit no clearly kids aren't
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.759
this gonna exit no clearly kids aren't
gonna I think that but they're probably

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
gonna I think that but they're probably
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.259
gonna I think that but they're probably
not also knocking I think they might

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269
not also knocking I think they might
 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.059
not also knocking I think they might
they might get the regular back button

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069
they might get the regular back button
 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.770
they might get the regular back button
things undo that's a good point

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
things undo that's a good point
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.699
things undo that's a good point
particularly once you've made it

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709
particularly once you've made it
 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.500
particularly once you've made it
ambiguous here that maybe back means

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
ambiguous here that maybe back means
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.830
ambiguous here that maybe back means
undo you probably want to simplify that

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840
undo you probably want to simplify that
 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.080
undo you probably want to simplify that
so I don't think this is discoverable at

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090
so I don't think this is discoverable at
 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.590
so I don't think this is discoverable at
all

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600
all
 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.940
all
never have occurred to me to press the

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950
never have occurred to me to press the
 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.920
never have occurred to me to press the
googly eyes now in fairness a

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930
googly eyes now in fairness a
 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.570
googly eyes now in fairness a
six-year-old probably would think to hit

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
six-year-old probably would think to hit
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.730
six-year-old probably would think to hit
pretty much everything on screen so that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740
pretty much everything on screen so that
 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.530
pretty much everything on screen so that
would help but yes there's multi-level

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540
would help but yes there's multi-level
 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.240
would help but yes there's multi-level
undo but this is a children's app so

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250
undo but this is a children's app so
 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.700
undo but this is a children's app so
yeah exactly but that would be nice and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
yeah exactly but that would be nice and
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.380
yeah exactly but that would be nice and
particularly like so once you hit undo

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390
particularly like so once you hit undo
 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.590
particularly like so once you hit undo
having that stay on screen so that you

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600
having that stay on screen so that you
 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.030
having that stay on screen so that you
can do multi-level undo it would be nice

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040
can do multi-level undo it would be nice
 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.360
can do multi-level undo it would be nice
but I mean maybe maybe have these as

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
but I mean maybe maybe have these as
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.500
but I mean maybe maybe have these as
have as an action bar along the top

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510
have as an action bar along the top
 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.460
have as an action bar along the top
might be might be interesting I guess

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470
might be might be interesting I guess
 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.780
might be might be interesting I guess
you want to keep the screen clutter down

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790
you want to keep the screen clutter down
 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.770
you want to keep the screen clutter down
you don't want to have people

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
you don't want to have people
 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.330
you don't want to have people
accidentally pressing buttons so having

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
accidentally pressing buttons so having
 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.240
accidentally pressing buttons so having
it hidden in a ways is useful but okay I

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
it hidden in a ways is useful but okay I
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.740
it hidden in a ways is useful but okay I
mean there's an argument that the kids

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750
mean there's an argument that the kids
 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.970
mean there's an argument that the kids
are gonna match everything in the screen

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980
are gonna match everything in the screen
 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.470
are gonna match everything in the screen
so I can sort of see the argument for

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480
so I can sort of see the argument for
 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.850
so I can sort of see the argument for
hiding it but I think the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860
hiding it but I think the
 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.260
hiding it but I think the
discoverability can really be improved

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
discoverability can really be improved
 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.670
discoverability can really be improved
yeah what do you think Raymond do you

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
yeah what do you think Raymond do you
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.590
yeah what do you think Raymond do you
have a from a usability perspective an

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600
have a from a usability perspective an
 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.050
have a from a usability perspective an
idea here of how you can maybe make

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060
idea here of how you can maybe make
 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.650
idea here of how you can maybe make
these more or less obvious yeah so I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660
these more or less obvious yeah so I
 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.600
these more or less obvious yeah so I
mean I think the first thing is that I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610
mean I think the first thing is that I
 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.680
mean I think the first thing is that I
mean asking its Discoverer slidy things

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690
mean asking its Discoverer slidy things
 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.530
mean asking its Discoverer slidy things
like sliding drawers that's I think it's

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540
like sliding drawers that's I think it's
 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.940
like sliding drawers that's I think it's
asking a little too much and you know in

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950
asking a little too much and you know in
 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.310
asking a little too much and you know in
general we we recommend using gestures

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320
general we we recommend using gestures
 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.070
general we we recommend using gestures
to you know to uncover things sliding

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080
to you know to uncover things sliding
 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.530
to you know to uncover things sliding
drawers I personally am kind of against

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540
drawers I personally am kind of against
 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.260
drawers I personally am kind of against
but you know using gestures is normally

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270
but you know using gestures is normally
 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.940
but you know using gestures is normally
okay like you know paging between

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950
okay like you know paging between
 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.710
okay like you know paging between
screens and things like that but for

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720
screens and things like that but for
 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.100
screens and things like that but for
kids you know kids kind of they

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110
kids you know kids kind of they
 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.770
kids you know kids kind of they
understand you know simple gestures like

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780
understand you know simple gestures like
 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.570
understand you know simple gestures like
you know like sliding but as the new

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580
you know like sliding but as the new
 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.640
you know like sliding but as the new
really really really obvious I don't

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650
really really really obvious I don't
 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.350
really really really obvious I don't
think it is obvious in this case what

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
think it is obvious in this case what
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.730
think it is obvious in this case what
I'd probably do instead is really just

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740
I'd probably do instead is really just
 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.540
I'd probably do instead is really just
put it on screen and you know for things

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550
put it on screen and you know for things
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.240
put it on screen and you know for things
like back for things like you know

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250
like back for things like you know
 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.940
like back for things like you know
navigating to other pieces of art it's

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950
navigating to other pieces of art it's
 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.520
navigating to other pieces of art it's
actually like right now once you're in a

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530
actually like right now once you're in a

in and drawing there's no real way to
 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.220
in and drawing there's no real way to
get to other drawings so for that you

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230
get to other drawings so for that you
 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.540
get to other drawings so for that you
may want to use gestures like maybe

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550
may want to use gestures like maybe
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.110
may want to use gestures like maybe
slide left to kind of go back to the top

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120
slide left to kind of go back to the top
 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.810
slide left to kind of go back to the top

the very bottom something as simple as
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.090
the very bottom something as simple as
using a view pager to slide between

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100
using a view pager to slide between
 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.300
using a view pager to slide between
different colors even that may be a

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310
different colors even that may be a
 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.340
different colors even that may be a
little too on obvious in that case maybe

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350
little too on obvious in that case maybe
 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.840
little too on obvious in that case maybe
just have you know left and right

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850
just have you know left and right
 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.100
just have you know left and right
buttons yeah well there's already

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110
buttons yeah well there's already
 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.120

trained people who didn't notice that

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130
trained people who didn't notice that
 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.820

you could type the colors

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830
you could type the colors
 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.049

that's that's actually that gesture that

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:39.059
that's that's actually that gesture that
 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:40.729
that's that's actually that gesture that
you described is what I assume did the

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:40.739
you described is what I assume did the
 

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:42.559
you described is what I assume did the
page it was for was that if I started

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569
page it was for was that if I started
 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.089
page it was for was that if I started
swiping left or right it would take me

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099
swiping left or right it would take me
 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.399
swiping left or right it would take me
to a different region so that's why the

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409
to a different region so that's why the
 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.439
to a different region so that's why the
visual cue wasn't obvious to me that it

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449
visual cue wasn't obvious to me that it
 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.079
visual cue wasn't obvious to me that it
was I think just like in general when

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:51.089
was I think just like in general when

on gestures too much so I think in this

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:01.709
on gestures too much so I think in this
 

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:03.559
on gestures too much so I think in this
case kids may get confused oh how do I

colors which i think is somewhat

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479
colors which i think is somewhat
 

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.269

confusing yeah well you may want to do

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.610
confusing yeah well you may want to do

something even like you know have them

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879
something even like you know have them
 

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.059
something even like you know have them
smaller so that you can hear the kick

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:32.069
smaller so that you can hear the kick
 

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.119

magnifying glass that may make a little

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:43.079
magnifying glass that may make a little
 

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.689
magnifying glass that may make a little
more sense than kind of swiping left and

00:08:44.689 --> 00:08:44.699
more sense than kind of swiping left and
 

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:46.189
more sense than kind of swiping left and
right yeah I think so too

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:46.199
right yeah I think so too
 

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:48.049
right yeah I think so too
otherwise it's I really like the

otherwise it's I really like the
 

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:50.270
otherwise it's I really like the
simplicity of the app so it's

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.280
simplicity of the app so it's
 

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.010
simplicity of the app so it's
you know there's no ambiguity as to what

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.020
you know there's no ambiguity as to what
 

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.420

nice cutesy otherwise yeah I think it's
 

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.810
nice cutesy otherwise yeah I think it's
quite a nice app otherwise there's a one

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820
quite a nice app otherwise there's a one
 

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.330

more thing I wanted to add place on this

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:08.340
more thing I wanted to add place on this
 

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.580
more thing I wanted to add place on this
is one part of the app I think you might

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:10.590
is one part of the app I think you might
 

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.580
is one part of the app I think you might

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.490
called markers that was recently
released by a daniel-san lab who's in

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500
released by a daniel-san lab who's in
 

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.380
released by a daniel-san lab who's in
the interpret team and that shows how to

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.390
the interpret team and that shows how to
 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.000
the interpret team and that shows how to
do like all sorts of crazy pressure

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.010
do like all sorts of crazy pressure
 

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.940
do like all sorts of crazy pressure
sensitivity and as well as multi-touch

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:49.950
sensitivity and as well as multi-touch
 

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.400
sensitivity and as well as multi-touch
so this is on normal screen it's just a

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.410
so this is on normal screen it's just a
 

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.510
so this is on normal screen it's just a
normal capacitive screen you can

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:53.520
normal capacitive screen you can
 

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.860
normal capacitive screen you can
actually still get to some pressure data

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:54.870
actually still get to some pressure data
 

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.470
actually still get to some pressure data
so you know it's not the same as you

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480
so you know it's not the same as you
 

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.630
so you know it's not the same as you
know like your your your Wacom tablet

00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640
know like your your your Wacom tablet
 

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.280
know like your your your Wacom tablet
where you have you know 500 levels of

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.290
where you have you know 500 levels of
 

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.170
where you have you know 500 levels of
pressure sensitivity but you know if

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180
pressure sensitivity but you know if
 

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.530
pressure sensitivity but you know if
it's good enough to get you in ICU I

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.540
it's good enough to get you in ICU I
 

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.640
it's good enough to get you in ICU I
yeah that's also you can even consider

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:07.650
yeah that's also you can even consider
 

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.010
yeah that's also you can even consider
having a single just like massive like

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.020
having a single just like massive like
 

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.230
having a single just like massive like
take over the entire screen and just

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240
take over the entire screen and just
 

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.410
take over the entire screen and just
give like kids a playground to just

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420
give like kids a playground to just
 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.240
give like kids a playground to just
bring on nightly just before I'm drawing

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.250
bring on nightly just before I'm drawing
 

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.640
bring on nightly just before I'm drawing
booty not like or sex or anything just

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:22.650
booty not like or sex or anything just
 

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.710
booty not like or sex or anything just
just give them a giant canvas drawing

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720
just give them a giant canvas drawing
 

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.600
just give them a giant canvas drawing
yeah absolutely I don't get more obvious

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:26.610
yeah absolutely I don't get more obvious
 

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.800
yeah absolutely I don't get more obvious
to because it would never have occurred

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:27.810
to because it would never have occurred
 

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.950
to because it would never have occurred
to me that if I hit one of the three

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:30.960
to me that if I hit one of the three
 

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.360
to me that if I hit one of the three
objects on the on the right here that

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.370
objects on the on the right here that
 

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.700
objects on the on the right here that
that would mean that I get freeform

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:34.710
that would mean that I get freeform
 

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.230
that would mean that I get freeform
drawing whereas that would seem like one

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240
drawing whereas that would seem like one
 

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.329
drawing whereas that would seem like one
of the you know something which you

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339
of the you know something which you
 

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.860
of the you know something which you
would in particular want to be able to

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:39.870
would in particular want to be able to
 

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.579
would in particular want to be able to
do it's locked it's locked yeah of

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:43.589
do it's locked it's locked yeah of
 

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:44.090
do it's locked it's locked yeah of
course

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100
course
 

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.950
course
why isn't it working which is another

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:45.960
why isn't it working which is another
 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.480
why isn't it working which is another
tip as well so obviously you've got the

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:47.490
tip as well so obviously you've got the
 

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.860
tip as well so obviously you've got the
icon on the bottom which says locked

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:48.870
icon on the bottom which says locked
 

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.990
icon on the bottom which says locked
which to most adults should be pretty

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000
which to most adults should be pretty
 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.390
which to most adults should be pretty
obvious but I missed it which is

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:53.400
obvious but I missed it which is
 

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.829
obvious but I missed it which is
probably more of a reflection on me than

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839
probably more of a reflection on me than
 

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:57.980
probably more of a reflection on me than
on your app but that'd be like brilliant

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:57.990
on your app but that'd be like brilliant
 

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.210
on your app but that'd be like brilliant
you just cover the terror screen because

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220
you just cover the terror screen because
 

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.260
you just cover the terror screen because
you can't hear anything there yeah

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.270
you can't hear anything there yeah
 

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:00.770
you can't hear anything there yeah
exactly

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:00.780
exactly
 

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.030
exactly
you've already go sort of the partial

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040
you've already go sort of the partial
 

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.650
you've already go sort of the partial
opacity

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:02.660
opacity
 

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.900
opacity
you can make that so you can see through

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:04.910
you can make that so you can see through
 

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.040
you can make that so you can see through
it a little bit more but cover the

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.050
it a little bit more but cover the
 

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.990
it a little bit more but cover the
entire screen or when I when I press it

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000
entire screen or when I when I press it
 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.119
entire screen or when I when I press it
display a toast or something saying this

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:10.129
display a toast or something saying this
 

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.240
display a toast or something saying this
is locked you know purchase it from the

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.250
is locked you know purchase it from the
 

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.939
is locked you know purchase it from the
home screen something like that because

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:15.949
home screen something like that because
 

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:17.980
home screen something like that because
again it's not obvious like I know that

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:17.990
again it's not obvious like I know that
 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.179
again it's not obvious like I know that
when you first start up the app you see

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:19.189
when you first start up the app you see
 

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:20.499
when you first start up the app you see
the instructions for how to purchase

00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:20.509
the instructions for how to purchase
 

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:21.879
the instructions for how to purchase
yeah I like that you like you tell if

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:21.889
yeah I like that you like you tell if
 

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.379
yeah I like that you like you tell if
you tap the lock thing it should you

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:23.389
you tap the lock thing it should you
 

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:24.610
you tap the lock thing it should you
know fade out and like say you know

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:24.620
know fade out and like say you know
 

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.230
know fade out and like say you know
purchase from home screen and lock go

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
purchase from home screen and lock go
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.019
purchase from home screen and lock go
come back word some some way to live

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:29.029
come back word some some way to live
 

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:34.629
come back word some some way to live
yeah absolutely absolutely which is and

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639
yeah absolutely absolutely which is and
 

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.860
yeah absolutely absolutely which is and
you'll notice that I find the navigation

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:35.870
you'll notice that I find the navigation
 

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.730
you'll notice that I find the navigation
slightly tricky but otherwise yeah

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:39.740
slightly tricky but otherwise yeah
 

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.170
slightly tricky but otherwise yeah
otherwise it's it's it's definitely a

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:41.180
otherwise it's it's it's definitely a
 

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.400
otherwise it's it's it's definitely a
good idea and it's nicely implemented

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.410
good idea and it's nicely implemented
 

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.319
good idea and it's nicely implemented
you know just to go along further from

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:44.329
you know just to go along further from
 

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.490
you know just to go along further from
what Trevor was saying it might be nice

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:45.500
what Trevor was saying it might be nice
 

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.829
what Trevor was saying it might be nice
to have a little bit more animation a

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839
to have a little bit more animation a
 

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.079
to have a little bit more animation a
bit more dynamic mess ISM within the app

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:50.089
bit more dynamic mess ISM within the app
 

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:52.569
bit more dynamic mess ISM within the app
yeah maybe some subtle things like this

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:52.579
yeah maybe some subtle things like this
 

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:54.220
yeah maybe some subtle things like this
guy there could be like maybe tapping

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.230
guy there could be like maybe tapping
 

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.869
guy there could be like maybe tapping
his foot or yeah yeah

00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:55.879
his foot or yeah yeah
 

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:57.819
his foot or yeah yeah
so something again make it feel like

00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:57.829
so something again make it feel like
 

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.129
so something again make it feel like
you're just not staring at a static

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139
you're just not staring at a static
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.619
you're just not staring at a static
image absolutely yeah I think some some

00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:02.629
image absolutely yeah I think some some
 

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:04.660
image absolutely yeah I think some some
really subtle animations could make a

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:04.670
really subtle animations could make a
 

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.759
really subtle animations could make a
really big difference it's just you know

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:06.769
really big difference it's just you know
 

00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:08.410
really big difference it's just you know
it will attract your attention it will

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:08.420
it will attract your attention it will
 

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.179
it will attract your attention it will
make your eye focus on different parts

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:10.189
make your eye focus on different parts
 

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:12.550
make your eye focus on different parts
of it would be quite interesting yeah or

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560
of it would be quite interesting yeah or
 

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.410
of it would be quite interesting yeah or
yeah since there's an app designed for

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:14.420
yeah since there's an app designed for
 

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.610
yeah since there's an app designed for
kids you can even have like you know a

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:15.620
kids you can even have like you know a
 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.749
kids you can even have like you know a
little Easter eggs you know like you

00:12:16.749 --> 00:12:16.759
little Easter eggs you know like you
 

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:18.819
little Easter eggs you know like you
tamio like they I think going over here

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:18.829
tamio like they I think going over here
 

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:20.019
tamio like they I think going over here
right there's the background maybe you

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:20.029
right there's the background maybe you
 

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:21.460
right there's the background maybe you
know if this wasn't locked if I tapped

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.470
know if this wasn't locked if I tapped
 

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.530
know if this wasn't locked if I tapped
on this guy maybe you know you start

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:23.540
on this guy maybe you know you start
 

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.030
on this guy maybe you know you start
moving or a sound you play right so

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040
moving or a sound you play right so
 

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.579
moving or a sound you play right so
something people want make kids want to

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:27.589
something people want make kids want to
 

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:30.850
something people want make kids want to
go and explore a bit mmm absolutely

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:30.860
go and explore a bit mmm absolutely
 

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.769
go and explore a bit mmm absolutely
absolutely and it it's it's kind of nice

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:32.779
absolutely and it it's it's kind of nice
 

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.269
absolutely and it it's it's kind of nice
that all of the discovery things like

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279
that all of the discovery things like
 

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:36.939
that all of the discovery things like
the freeform drawing is all you know

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:36.949
the freeform drawing is all you know
 

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:38.949
the freeform drawing is all you know
totally you know you play with the app

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959
totally you know you play with the app
 

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.120
totally you know you play with the app
and you discover these things which is

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.130
and you discover these things which is
 

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.650
and you discover these things which is
kind of nice but it would also be

this is interesting I'm going to presume
that it's using some of the more

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.150
that it's using some of the more
 

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.290
that it's using some of the more
advanced geo well I guess GPS functions

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:32.300
advanced geo well I guess GPS functions
 

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.720
advanced geo well I guess GPS functions
a location-based service functions which

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:34.730
a location-based service functions which
 

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.560
a location-based service functions which
you can actually get you a lot of

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:35.570
you can actually get you a lot of
 

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.930
you can actually get you a lot of
information about the the way in which

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:37.940
information about the the way in which
 

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.870
information about the the way in which
the location-based services are using

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880
the location-based services are using
 

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.900
the location-based services are using
satellite information to to be able to

satellite information to to be able to
 

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.100
satellite information to to be able to
figure out what your location is sadly

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.110
figure out what your location is sadly
 

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.630
figure out what your location is sadly
we're probably not going to be able to

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:46.640
we're probably not going to be able to
 

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.160
we're probably not going to be able to
see it in here with a ceiling above our

heads wow that's true but still well
that's true okay so we've got zeroing

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:54.590
that's true okay so we've got zeroing

see useful exactly with the app itself

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:00.230
see useful exactly with the app itself
 

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.690
see useful exactly with the app itself
we can look at so it's it's kind of an

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:01.700
we can look at so it's it's kind of an
 

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.400
we can look at so it's it's kind of an
interesting display here it kind of

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:03.410
interesting display here it kind of
 

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.280
interesting display here it kind of
reminds me of sort of an old-school sort

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:06.290
reminds me of sort of an old-school sort
 

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.250
reminds me of sort of an old-school sort

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:12.080
and feel yeah I mean I'm not a big fan
 

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.740
and feel yeah I mean I'm not a big fan
of it though yeah mostly like it just it

this sort of fake LCD display but it
 

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.040
this sort of fake LCD display but it
doesn't really look like an LCD it looks

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.050
doesn't really look like an LCD it looks
 

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.960
doesn't really look like an LCD it looks
like a you know computer-generated yeah

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:30.970
like a you know computer-generated yeah
 

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.100
like a you know computer-generated yeah
I'd expect to see if you're gonna go for

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.110
I'd expect to see if you're gonna go for
 

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.510
I'd expect to see if you're gonna go for
something this mimicking a real display

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520
something this mimicking a real display
 

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.840
something this mimicking a real display
ads you know some gloss onto it make it

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:37.850
ads you know some gloss onto it make it
 

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:38.740
ads you know some gloss onto it make it
actually look real

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:38.750
actually look real
 

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.810
actually look real
you know who go for that you're gonna go

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:40.820
you know who go for that you're gonna go
 

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.660
you know who go for that you're gonna go
yeah the the digital look go for the

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:43.670
yeah the the digital look go for the
 

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.670
yeah the the digital look go for the
real look but in between it just looks

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:45.680
real look but in between it just looks
 

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.250
real look but in between it just looks

sort of mspaint dish to be honest no
 

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.440
sort of mspaint dish to be honest no
that's absolutely true I in fact one of

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:50.450
that's absolutely true I in fact one of
 

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.840
that's absolutely true I in fact one of
the first jobs I ever had out of out of

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:52.850
the first jobs I ever had out of out of
 

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.300
the first jobs I ever had out of out of
college I was a building software for an

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:55.310
college I was a building software for an
 

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.810
college I was a building software for an
industrial inspection company and

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:57.820
industrial inspection company and
 

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.650
industrial inspection company and
because all of the equipment that they

00:17:59.650 --> 00:17:59.660
because all of the equipment that they
 

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.990
because all of the equipment that they
usually use it's all sort of all school

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000
usually use it's all sort of all school
 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.850
usually use it's all sort of all school
with the LCD displays and everything and

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:03.860
with the LCD displays and everything and
 

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.290
with the LCD displays and everything and
so I made the software to try and look

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:05.300
so I made the software to try and look
 

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.480
so I made the software to try and look
as much like that as possible and you'd

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:07.490
as much like that as possible and you'd
 

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.890
as much like that as possible and you'd
find yourself getting into this arms

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:08.900
find yourself getting into this arms
 

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.460
find yourself getting into this arms
race where you want it to look just like

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:12.470
race where you want it to look just like
 

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.990
race where you want it to look just like
the real equipment then you do it first

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000
the real equipment then you do it first
 

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.070
the real equipment then you do it first
and you do it like this and everything

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080
and you do it like this and everything
 

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.120
and you do it like this and everything
is flattened you're like well that's not

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.130
is flattened you're like well that's not
 

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.280
is flattened you're like well that's not
quite right because their stuff glows so

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.290
quite right because their stuff glows so
 

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.510
quite right because their stuff glows so
how do I make this glow and then you

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520
how do I make this glow and then you
 

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.850
how do I make this glow and then you
start adding gradients to your images

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:21.860
start adding gradients to your images
 

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.760
start adding gradients to your images
and it just goes to a very bad place you

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:24.770
and it just goes to a very bad place you
 

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.890
and it just goes to a very bad place you
end up spending a lot of time trying to

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:26.900
end up spending a lot of time trying to
 

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.600
end up spending a lot of time trying to
you know do these little things with

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.610
you know do these little things with
 

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.700
you know do these little things with
with canvases and everything else to try

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:30.710
with canvases and everything else to try
 

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.620
with canvases and everything else to try
and mimic something which is done that

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:32.630
and mimic something which is done that
 

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:33.760
and mimic something which is done that
way because it's cheaper to do in

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:33.770
way because it's cheaper to do in
 

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.140
way because it's cheaper to do in
hardware not because it looks better

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.150
hardware not because it looks better
 

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.230
hardware not because it looks better
obviously the inward way of doing things

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240
obviously the inward way of doing things
 

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.090
obviously the inward way of doing things
yeah we tend to not really try and mimic

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.100
yeah we tend to not really try and mimic
 

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.330
yeah we tend to not really try and mimic
real displays very often real objects

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:42.340
real displays very often real objects
 

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.890
real displays very often real objects
and that's just sort of that's the hot

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:44.900
and that's just sort of that's the hot
 

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.410
and that's just sort of that's the hot
this this style we've chosen so an app

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:47.420
this this style we've chosen so an app
 

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.970
this this style we've chosen so an app
like this just feels out of place on the

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:48.980
like this just feels out of place on the
 

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.920
like this just feels out of place on the
system I mean ignoring the fact that we

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:50.930
system I mean ignoring the fact that we
 

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.630
system I mean ignoring the fact that we
have no action bar I don't know why

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640
have no action bar I don't know why
 

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.180
have no action bar I don't know why
there's no action bar we also have the

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.190
there's no action bar we also have the
 

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.430
there's no action bar we also have the
menu button of shame lisa has a menu so

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440
menu button of shame lisa has a menu so
 

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.200
menu button of shame lisa has a menu so
as shameful but I mean there's there's

00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.210
as shameful but I mean there's there's
 

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.670
as shameful but I mean there's there's
no reason that can be converted to it

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:00.680
no reason that can be converted to it
 

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.830
no reason that can be converted to it
into an action bar I mean I think the

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840
into an action bar I mean I think the
 

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.170
into an action bar I mean I think the
app would just look a lot nicer with the

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.180
app would just look a lot nicer with the
 

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.400
app would just look a lot nicer with the
splash of holo on there

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:06.410
splash of holo on there
 

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.380
splash of holo on there
tomato cream I think what the app

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:08.390
tomato cream I think what the app
 

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.970
tomato cream I think what the app
developer is trying to do if you go into

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:09.980
developer is trying to do if you go into
 

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.080
developer is trying to do if you go into
settings you can actually change the

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.090
settings you can actually change the
 

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.730
settings you can actually change the
theme so I think they were trying to

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:12.740
theme so I think they were trying to
 

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.170
theme so I think they were trying to
make it Thema Bowl you can choose like a

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.180
make it Thema Bowl you can choose like a
 

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.840
make it Thema Bowl you can choose like a
nighttime view or an Amber view or a red

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:16.850
nighttime view or an Amber view or a red
 

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.170
nighttime view or an Amber view or a red
view maybe yeah it's not so bad actually

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:20.180
view maybe yeah it's not so bad actually
 

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.330
view maybe yeah it's not so bad actually
a few outdoors you know to stargazing

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:22.340
a few outdoors you know to stargazing
 

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.310
a few outdoors you know to stargazing
you want a GPS because you're going

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320
you want a GPS because you're going
 

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.800
you want a GPS because you're going
hiking you know being able to set you

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:26.810
hiking you know being able to set you
 

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.180
hiking you know being able to set you
all right yes there yeah being able to

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.190
all right yes there yeah being able to
 

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.030
all right yes there yeah being able to
set a there you go like a knife and I

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:31.040
set a there you go like a knife and I
 

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.770
set a there you go like a knife and I
like that it's actually a pretty good

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:32.780
like that it's actually a pretty good
 

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.080
like that it's actually a pretty good
idea hmm but you know you could do

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.090
idea hmm but you know you could do
 

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.340
idea hmm but you know you could do
something like that and still trying to

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:36.350
something like that and still trying to
 

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.720
something like that and still trying to
do through the holo I think I think so I

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:37.730
do through the holo I think I think so I
 

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.700
do through the holo I think I think so I
mean this is again this is you know I

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.710
mean this is again this is you know I
 

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.440
mean this is again this is you know I
spent a lot of time in a previous life

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:41.450
spent a lot of time in a previous life
 

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.900
spent a lot of time in a previous life
working on boats you know we have a lot

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:43.910
working on boats you know we have a lot
 

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.760
working on boats you know we have a lot
of this equipment set up and you do you

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:45.770
of this equipment set up and you do you
 

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.350
of this equipment set up and you do you
have nice fun views as soon as the Sun

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360
have nice fun views as soon as the Sun
 

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.730
have nice fun views as soon as the Sun
Goes Down you have this much more muted

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:48.740
Goes Down you have this much more muted
 

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.169
Goes Down you have this much more muted
theme so people don't destroy their

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:50.179
theme so people don't destroy their
 

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:51.330
theme so people don't destroy their
night vision while

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:51.340
night vision while
 

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.549
night vision while
the controls and I kind of like the idea

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559
the controls and I kind of like the idea
 

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.289
the controls and I kind of like the idea
of making that sort of thing on

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:55.299
of making that sort of thing on
 

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.480
of making that sort of thing on
something like that but you know part of

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:57.490
something like that but you know part of
 

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.399
something like that but you know part of
me would say well what is the purpose of

00:19:59.399 --> 00:19:59.409
me would say well what is the purpose of
 

00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:01.049
me would say well what is the purpose of
your app and so if it is to sort of work

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:01.059
your app and so if it is to sort of work
 

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:02.940
your app and so if it is to sort of work
as a backup or as an alternative to some

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:02.950
as a backup or as an alternative to some
 

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.249
as a backup or as an alternative to some
of these GPS systems while you're

00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:05.259
of these GPS systems while you're
 

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:08.039
of these GPS systems while you're
navigating that first I would say it's

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:08.049
navigating that first I would say it's
 

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:10.200
navigating that first I would say it's
probably of questionable utility because

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.210
probably of questionable utility because
 

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.519
probably of questionable utility because
unless you're sitting on the roof of

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:11.529
unless you're sitting on the roof of
 

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:14.159
unless you're sitting on the roof of
your boat then you're gonna have this

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:14.169
your boat then you're gonna have this
 

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:15.389
your boat then you're gonna have this
problem where you don't have any

00:20:15.389 --> 00:20:15.399
problem where you don't have any
 

00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:17.610
problem where you don't have any
satellites in view if it's just an

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:17.620
satellites in view if it's just an
 

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.600
satellites in view if it's just an
aesthetic thing you're just really

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:18.610
aesthetic thing you're just really
 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.279
aesthetic thing you're just really
trying to mimic that style because

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:20.289
trying to mimic that style because
 

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:22.110
trying to mimic that style because
that's what you used to and you think

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120
that's what you used to and you think
 

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.549
that's what you used to and you think
that you know your users will sort of

00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559
that you know your users will sort of
 

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:24.899
that you know your users will sort of
appreciate that that's that's definitely

00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:24.909
appreciate that that's that's definitely
 

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:27.239
appreciate that that's that's definitely
a choice but I kind of agree with Trevor

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:27.249
a choice but I kind of agree with Trevor
 

00:20:27.249 --> 00:20:28.859
a choice but I kind of agree with Trevor
here I think you can do that without

00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:28.869
here I think you can do that without
 

00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:31.320
here I think you can do that without
making it look like an old Atari game so

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.330
making it look like an old Atari game so
 

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.789
making it look like an old Atari game so
you've got the same sort of layout the

00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799
you've got the same sort of layout the
 

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.499
you've got the same sort of layout the
same sort of graphics because the big

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:34.509
same sort of graphics because the big
 

00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:36.810
same sort of graphics because the big
graphics and these sorts of features are

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:36.820
graphics and these sorts of features are
 

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.820
graphics and these sorts of features are
definitely the right approach but you

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:38.830
definitely the right approach but you
 

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.169
definitely the right approach but you
just you know want to spend a little bit

00:20:40.169 --> 00:20:40.179
just you know want to spend a little bit
 

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:41.789
just you know want to spend a little bit
more time to think about how you can use

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799
more time to think about how you can use
 

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.440
more time to think about how you can use
that same layouts but on something which

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.450
that same layouts but on something which
 

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.359
that same layouts but on something which
is much more modern so mimicking a

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:45.369
is much more modern so mimicking a
 

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:48.600
is much more modern so mimicking a
modern GPS rather than a GPS which you

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:48.610
modern GPS rather than a GPS which you
 

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.950
modern GPS rather than a GPS which you
would have seen in a computer game in

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960
would have seen in a computer game in
 

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.919
would have seen in a computer game in
the 80s yeah yeah she brings up another

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:52.929
the 80s yeah yeah she brings up another
 

00:20:52.929 --> 00:20:54.299
the 80s yeah yeah she brings up another
point a just as far as like the number

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:54.309
point a just as far as like the number
 

00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:55.619
point a just as far as like the number
of options in here I mean there's a lot

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:55.629
of options in here I mean there's a lot
 

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.139
of options in here I mean there's a lot
of color schemes which you know not

00:20:58.139 --> 00:20:58.149
of color schemes which you know not
 

00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:59.850
of color schemes which you know not
necessarily a bad thing but just looking

00:20:59.850 --> 00:20:59.860
necessarily a bad thing but just looking
 

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.399
necessarily a bad thing but just looking
around the entire app you have a ton of

00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:02.409
around the entire app you have a ton of
 

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:03.450
around the entire app you have a ton of
settings

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.460
settings
 

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.369
settings
some of which are redundant you have a

00:21:05.369 --> 00:21:05.379
some of which are redundant you have a
 

00:21:05.379 --> 00:21:07.799
some of which are redundant you have a
an option to use Imperial or metric

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:07.809
an option to use Imperial or metric
 

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.440
an option to use Imperial or metric
units for your your speedometer Imperial

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:10.450
units for your your speedometer Imperial
 

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.379
units for your your speedometer Imperial
metric units for altitude you know it's

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:13.389
metric units for altitude you know it's
 

00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.060
metric units for altitude you know it's
like you could condense all of those

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.070
like you could condense all of those
 

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.409
like you could condense all of those
that you just want to think do I want

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:16.419
that you just want to think do I want
 

00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:18.570
that you just want to think do I want
Imperial or metric instances I can't

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:18.580
Imperial or metric instances I can't
 

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.190
Imperial or metric instances I can't
think of very many cases where I'd want

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200
think of very many cases where I'd want
 

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.889
think of very many cases where I'd want
my speed in one system and my altitude

00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:22.899
my speed in one system and my altitude
 

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:27.359
my speed in one system and my altitude
in another and you know there are some

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:27.369
in another and you know there are some
 

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.799
in another and you know there are some
other things there too you can choose

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:28.809
other things there too you can choose
 

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:32.369
other things there too you can choose
between if you go to this menu here you

00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:32.379
between if you go to this menu here you
 

00:21:32.379 --> 00:21:34.320
between if you go to this menu here you
can actually change all this to gauges

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.330
can actually change all this to gauges
 

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.759
can actually change all this to gauges
which again has the same problem where

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:35.769
which again has the same problem where
 

00:21:35.769 --> 00:21:36.960
which again has the same problem where
it looks sort of like a tiny name but

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:36.970
it looks sort of like a tiny name but
 

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.659
it looks sort of like a tiny name but
just like so many options on here and

00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:39.669
just like so many options on here and
 

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:42.930
just like so many options on here and
your this and honestly as a user yes

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:42.940
your this and honestly as a user yes
 

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.330
your this and honestly as a user yes
it's too much because I'd never find

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:45.340
it's too much because I'd never find
 

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.919
it's too much because I'd never find
them all yeah makes it an undiscoverable

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:46.929
them all yeah makes it an undiscoverable
 

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:48.720
them all yeah makes it an undiscoverable
right it's like you almost if you want

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:48.730
right it's like you almost if you want
 

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.220
right it's like you almost if you want
to be able to choose between different

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.230
to be able to choose between different
 

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.039
to be able to choose between different
gauges you may want to do that and then

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:53.049
gauges you may want to do that and then
 

00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:54.600
gauges you may want to do that and then
even going through the options on the

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:54.610
even going through the options on the
 

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.950
even going through the options on the
bottom there's you know there's this

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960
bottom there's you know there's this
 

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.619
bottom there's you know there's this
mode and this mode and then when you're

00:21:58.619 --> 00:21:58.629
mode and this mode and then when you're
 

00:21:58.629 --> 00:21:59.750
mode and this mode and then when you're
in sea

00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760
in sea
 

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.220
in sea
there's another mode here if you go to

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.230
there's another mode here if you go to
 

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.170
there's another mode here if you go to
navigation and then you have this mode

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.180
navigation and then you have this mode
 

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.300
navigation and then you have this mode
this mode and then you have it hidden

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:05.310
this mode and then you have it hidden
 

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.740
this mode and then you have it hidden
menu there it's the navigation her key

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:09.750
menu there it's the navigation her key
 

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.920
menu there it's the navigation her key
is very it's a bit difficult to find

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:12.930
is very it's a bit difficult to find
 

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.390
is very it's a bit difficult to find
especially without textual labels on

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400
especially without textual labels on
 

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.700
especially without textual labels on
those buttons yes so this is really

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:16.710
those buttons yes so this is really
 

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.290
those buttons yes so this is really
interesting so I mean it looks like this

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.300
interesting so I mean it looks like this
 

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.660
interesting so I mean it looks like this
app is does a lot of stuff like it's

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:20.670
app is does a lot of stuff like it's
 

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.580
app is does a lot of stuff like it's
basically every gauge your dial you

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.590
basically every gauge your dial you
 

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.160
basically every gauge your dial you
would want which has any very yeah which

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.170
would want which has any very yeah which
 

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.350
would want which has any very yeah which
yeah I like and and having you know I

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360
yeah I like and and having you know I
 

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.910
yeah I like and and having you know I
really want to make a big point of this

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:28.920
really want to make a big point of this
 

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.850
really want to make a big point of this
is that when we're sort of discussing

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:30.860
is that when we're sort of discussing
 

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.290
is that when we're sort of discussing
you know changing the UI to make it look

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:33.300
you know changing the UI to make it look
 

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.180
you know changing the UI to make it look
less old-school I really want to

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.190
less old-school I really want to
 

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.500
less old-school I really want to
emphasize that I don't think that you

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.510
emphasize that I don't think that you
 

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.840
emphasize that I don't think that you
should change the overall layout I love

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:38.850
should change the overall layout I love
 

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.580
should change the overall layout I love
that it's it's big buttons it's very

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:40.590
that it's it's big buttons it's very
 

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.860
that it's it's big buttons it's very
graphical you know everything is based

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:42.870
graphical you know everything is based
 

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.450
graphical you know everything is based
around sort of being able to see it from

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460
around sort of being able to see it from
 

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.950
around sort of being able to see it from
a distance I think that's a really good

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960
a distance I think that's a really good
 

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.250
a distance I think that's a really good
approach yeah like like I say when it

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260
approach yeah like like I say when it
 

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.750
approach yeah like like I say when it
comes to the mimicking the LCD stuff

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760
comes to the mimicking the LCD stuff
 

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.670
comes to the mimicking the LCD stuff
like having been there I can tell you

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:52.680
like having been there I can tell you
 

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.050
like having been there I can tell you
there's really not worth while and the

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.060
there's really not worth while and the
 

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.730
there's really not worth while and the
feedback that you get from most actually

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740
feedback that you get from most actually
 

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.440
feedback that you get from most actually
users is yeah that's really hard to read

00:22:59.440 --> 00:22:59.450
users is yeah that's really hard to read
 

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.090
users is yeah that's really hard to read
so it's a lot of effort which which may

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100
so it's a lot of effort which which may
 

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.070
so it's a lot of effort which which may
not entirely be worth it so it's

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080
not entirely be worth it so it's
 

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.750
not entirely be worth it so it's
something to keep a good question

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760
something to keep a good question
 

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.320
something to keep a good question
because Humira know we did from I don't

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:09.330
because Humira know we did from I don't
 

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.880
because Humira know we did from I don't
think I can see us because our camera

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:10.890
think I can see us because our camera
 

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.370
think I can see us because our camera
isn't glowing but yeah we can't see you

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380
isn't glowing but yeah we can't see you
 

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.440
isn't glowing but yeah we can't see you
eventually carry a few thoughts on this

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:15.450
eventually carry a few thoughts on this
 

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.310
eventually carry a few thoughts on this
place yeah yeah yeah so one thing that

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320
place yeah yeah yeah so one thing that
 

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.620
place yeah yeah yeah so one thing that
immediately confused me and I agree with

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:21.630
immediately confused me and I agree with
 

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.110
immediately confused me and I agree with
that like the the big the big dial is

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120
that like the the big the big dial is
 

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.440
that like the the big the big dial is
the big like I guess panels are awesome

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:27.450
the big like I guess panels are awesome
 

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.880
the big like I guess panels are awesome
one thing that confused me was a little

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:28.890
one thing that confused me was a little
 

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.010
one thing that confused me was a little
bit was about the the interactions

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020
bit was about the the interactions
 

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.080
bit was about the the interactions
basically you have these these four

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.090
basically you have these these four
 

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.400
basically you have these these four
panels at the bottom on this is on the

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:34.410
panels at the bottom on this is on the
 

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.630
panels at the bottom on this is on the
home screen you have these four panels

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640
home screen you have these four panels
 

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.490
home screen you have these four panels
at the bottom and touching them

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500
at the bottom and touching them
 

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.560
at the bottom and touching them
basically switches out those you know

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:39.570
basically switches out those you know
 

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.870
basically switches out those you know
the the main display at the very top but

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880
the the main display at the very top but
 

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.600
the the main display at the very top but
it wasn't clear that that those panels

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:44.610
it wasn't clear that that those panels
 

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.440
it wasn't clear that that those panels
were kind of like the top level

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:45.450
were kind of like the top level
 

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.710
were kind of like the top level
hierarchy and then above those four

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720
hierarchy and then above those four
 

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.720
hierarchy and then above those four
panels those four buttons was kind of

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.730
panels those four buttons was kind of
 

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.490
panels those four buttons was kind of
the thing you're currently viewing so I

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500
the thing you're currently viewing so I
 

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.020
the thing you're currently viewing so I
would try to use some sort of better

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.030
would try to use some sort of better
 

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.080
would try to use some sort of better
visual indication that at the bottom is

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.090
visual indication that at the bottom is
 

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.910
visual indication that at the bottom is
kind of like your primary control set

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:58.920
kind of like your primary control set
 

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.860
kind of like your primary control set
and then at the very top is something

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:00.870
and then at the very top is something
 

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.170
and then at the very top is something
that is a member of that control set

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:03.180
that is a member of that control set
 

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.970
that is a member of that control set
it's not currently visible because you

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980
it's not currently visible because you
 

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.200
it's not currently visible because you
know touching it they're kind of like

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.210
know touching it they're kind of like
 

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.970
know touching it they're kind of like
tabs but the current tab is not visible

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980
tabs but the current tab is not visible
 

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.550
tabs but the current tab is not visible
yeah but somehow indicate that that what

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:10.560
yeah but somehow indicate that that what
 

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.380
yeah but somehow indicate that that what
you're viewing at the top is one of the

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:12.390
you're viewing at the top is one of the
 

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.920
you're viewing at the top is one of the
things

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:12.930
things
 

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.750
things
that is you know in this other set of

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760
that is you know in this other set of
 

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.520
that is you know in this other set of
controls at the bottom and then when you

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:16.530
controls at the bottom and then when you
 

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.360
controls at the bottom and then when you
touch on because the the number is the

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:20.370
touch on because the the number is the
 

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.160
touch on because the the number is the
one that has heading speed and altitude

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.170
one that has heading speed and altitude
 

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.490
one that has heading speed and altitude
you bring up another set of controls

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:24.500
you bring up another set of controls
 

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.870
you bring up another set of controls
where basically speed out student

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880
where basically speed out student
 

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.030
where basically speed out student
heading are kind of a secondary set of

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.040
heading are kind of a secondary set of
 

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.670
heading are kind of a secondary set of
quote-unquote tabs and you can apply the

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:31.680
quote-unquote tabs and you can apply the
 

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.100
quote-unquote tabs and you can apply the
same visual maybe some sort of like like

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.110
same visual maybe some sort of like like
 

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.790
same visual maybe some sort of like like
arrow indicating that you know the top

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:37.800
arrow indicating that you know the top
 

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.610
arrow indicating that you know the top
screen is a child of the creat of the

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620
screen is a child of the creat of the
 

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.920
screen is a child of the creat of the
you know lower buttons something like

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:42.930
you know lower buttons something like
 

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.000
you know lower buttons something like
that I don't know if I'm explaining this

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.010
that I don't know if I'm explaining this
 

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.710
that I don't know if I'm explaining this
very well but I think it's just the

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720
very well but I think it's just the
 

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.630
very well but I think it's just the
hierarchy isn't clear immediately from

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640
hierarchy isn't clear immediately from
 

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.150
hierarchy isn't clear immediately from
from the current presentation yeah no I

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:50.160
from the current presentation yeah no I
 

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.680
from the current presentation yeah no I
totally agree it's sort of the idea of

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:51.690
totally agree it's sort of the idea of
 

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.150
totally agree it's sort of the idea of
this being a toggle but it's not really

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:53.160
this being a toggle but it's not really
 

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.740
this being a toggle but it's not really
a toggle it's just swapping out whatever

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:54.750
a toggle it's just swapping out whatever
 

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.260
a toggle it's just swapping out whatever
the currently selected option is was not

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.270
the currently selected option is was not
 

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.700
the currently selected option is was not
obvious to me either and then similarly

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:58.710
obvious to me either and then similarly
 

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.830
obvious to me either and then similarly
as as Trevor pointed out this

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840
as as Trevor pointed out this
 

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.630
as as Trevor pointed out this
there are basically two modes you've got

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640
there are basically two modes you've got
 

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.120
there are basically two modes you've got
navigation mode which has which allows

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.130
navigation mode which has which allows
 

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.250
navigation mode which has which allows
you to it works a lot like my tracks in

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260
you to it works a lot like my tracks in
 

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.900
you to it works a lot like my tracks in
a way it'll let you keep track of

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:08.910
a way it'll let you keep track of
 

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.610
a way it'll let you keep track of
waypoints and where those locations are

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620
waypoints and where those locations are
 

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.700
waypoints and where those locations are
which is really really cool but then and

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:13.710
which is really really cool but then and
 

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.200
which is really really cool but then and
then there's GPS test which is another

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.210
then there's GPS test which is another
 

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.270
then there's GPS test which is another
version and it's basically two apps with

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280
version and it's basically two apps with
 

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.160
version and it's basically two apps with
one within one app and it's not obvious

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.170
one within one app and it's not obvious
 

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.530
one within one app and it's not obvious
like when I'm sitting here I think okay

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:21.540
like when I'm sitting here I think okay
 

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.000
like when I'm sitting here I think okay
well I want to go back to the other mode

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.010
well I want to go back to the other mode
 

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.130
well I want to go back to the other mode
and so I hit back and and that just

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140
and so I hit back and and that just
 

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.370
and so I hit back and and that just
exited the app the right way to do it is

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380
exited the app the right way to do it is
 

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.570
exited the app the right way to do it is
to go back into a GPS test from here so

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:31.580
to go back into a GPS test from here so
 

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.650
to go back into a GPS test from here so
might not be the right name for this

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:33.660
might not be the right name for this
 

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.960
might not be the right name for this
part I think it's so much more than that

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:35.970
part I think it's so much more than that
 

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.850
part I think it's so much more than that
we're just trying to build gonna see the

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860
we're just trying to build gonna see the
 

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.040
we're just trying to build gonna see the
GPS yeah absolutely I mean that's the

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.050
GPS yeah absolutely I mean that's the
 

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.930
GPS yeah absolutely I mean that's the
thing I can I can almost imagine where

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940
thing I can I can almost imagine where
 

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.600
thing I can I can almost imagine where
this has come from like you know you

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:43.610
this has come from like you know you
 

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.950
this has come from like you know you
fired up the Android SDK you see all

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960
fired up the Android SDK you see all
 

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.600
fired up the Android SDK you see all
this cool stuff you can do with GPS and

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:47.610
this cool stuff you can do with GPS and
 

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.310
this cool stuff you can do with GPS and
so you're gonna test all the GPS AP ice

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320
so you're gonna test all the GPS AP ice
 

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.470
so you're gonna test all the GPS AP ice
and then you create this app from it but

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480
and then you create this app from it but
 

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.630
and then you create this app from it but
I almost feel like it's time to move

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640
I almost feel like it's time to move
 

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.700
I almost feel like it's time to move
beyond that in terms of the app name and

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:55.710
beyond that in terms of the app name and
 

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.860
beyond that in terms of the app name and
try and be a bit more descriptive as to

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:57.870
try and be a bit more descriptive as to
 

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.630
try and be a bit more descriptive as to
what it does and and even you know in

00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640
what it does and and even you know in
 

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.430
what it does and and even you know in
terms of your navigation here GPS test

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440
terms of your navigation here GPS test
 

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.170
terms of your navigation here GPS test
in navigation seemed like two very

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:03.180
in navigation seemed like two very
 

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.300
in navigation seemed like two very
different functions they both use the

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.310
different functions they both use the
 

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.330
different functions they both use the
GPS certainly but in terms of why you're

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340
GPS certainly but in terms of why you're
 

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.070
GPS certainly but in terms of why you're
going to use them they're very different

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080
going to use them they're very different
 

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.620
going to use them they're very different
and I'd be tempted to have reason why I

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:12.630
and I'd be tempted to have reason why I
 

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.570
and I'd be tempted to have reason why I
mean having owned one of the really old

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580
mean having owned one of the really old
 

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.100
mean having owned one of the really old
Garmin GPS

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.110
Garmin GPS
 

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.930
Garmin GPS
this is basically the way the UI works

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940
this is basically the way the UI works
 

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.580
this is basically the way the UI works
you turn it on it gave you the GPS

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:19.590
you turn it on it gave you the GPS
 

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.930
you turn it on it gave you the GPS
tennis screen would show you all the

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940
tennis screen would show you all the
 

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.460
tennis screen would show you all the
staff and satellites and after a while

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:22.470
staff and satellites and after a while
 

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.840
staff and satellites and after a while
you get a lock and you switch over to

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:23.850
you get a lock and you switch over to
 

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.560
you get a lock and you switch over to
your Waypoint navigation so like I said

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:27.570
your Waypoint navigation so like I said
 

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.430
your Waypoint navigation so like I said
it really does feel like they're

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440
it really does feel like they're
 

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.910
it really does feel like they're
building a proper GPS unit shown on one

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:31.920
building a proper GPS unit shown on one
 

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.260
building a proper GPS unit shown on one
of the fancy ones with mapping and

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:33.270
of the fancy ones with mapping and
 

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.630
of the fancy ones with mapping and
everything coming for your phone yeah

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640
everything coming for your phone yeah
 

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.030
everything coming for your phone yeah
that's it and I mean I think that's a

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.040
that's it and I mean I think that's a
 

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.300
that's it and I mean I think that's a
valid use but on the other hand I'm not

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.310
valid use but on the other hand I'm not
 

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.370
valid use but on the other hand I'm not
sure you if you're using it like that

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380
sure you if you're using it like that
 

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.380
sure you if you're using it like that
actually seeing that screen is too

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:45.390
actually seeing that screen is too
 

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.670
actually seeing that screen is too
useful I wasn't sure what to use from

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:46.680
useful I wasn't sure what to use from
 

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.830
useful I wasn't sure what to use from
the old GPS unit either really what you

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840
the old GPS unit either really what you
 

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.180
the old GPS unit either really what you
want to know is you know you have an LED

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.190
want to know is you know you have an LED
 

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.730
want to know is you know you have an LED
that says is my GPS lock ever read and

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740
that says is my GPS lock ever read and
 

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.230
that says is my GPS lock ever read and
then you could click on that and have

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240
then you could click on that and have
 

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.480
then you could click on that and have
that pull up your whole GPS yeah so they

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:56.490
that pull up your whole GPS yeah so they
 

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.710
that pull up your whole GPS yeah so they
really don't spoil them to you what do

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720
really don't spoil them to you what do
 

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.880
really don't spoil them to you what do
you want this have to do do you want it

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:58.890
you want this have to do do you want it
 

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.460
you want this have to do do you want it
to be a GPS test app or you want to take

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:01.470
to be a GPS test app or you want to take
 

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.840
to be a GPS test app or you want to take
it to the next level okay I think you

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:02.850
it to the next level okay I think you
 

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.010
it to the next level okay I think you
could I think you could actually just

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020
could I think you could actually just
 

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.370
could I think you could actually just
say this is my GPS utility happen yeah

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380
say this is my GPS utility happen yeah
 

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.110
say this is my GPS utility happen yeah
absolutely and you know as far as that

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120
absolutely and you know as far as that
 

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.820
absolutely and you know as far as that
goes that may then control how you

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:10.830
goes that may then control how you
 

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.710
goes that may then control how you
decide to structure your navigation

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720
decide to structure your navigation
 

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.270
decide to structure your navigation
because I think fundamentally even more

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:14.280
because I think fundamentally even more
 

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.560
because I think fundamentally even more
important than the graphics element

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:15.570
important than the graphics element
 

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.020
important than the graphics element
which I think I'm quite sure a lot of

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.030
which I think I'm quite sure a lot of
 

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.340
which I think I'm quite sure a lot of
people going to disagree with us and be

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.350
people going to disagree with us and be
 

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.560
people going to disagree with us and be
like no I love the old-school stuff so

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:21.570
like no I love the old-school stuff so
 

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.360
like no I love the old-school stuff so
it's always subjective exactly what I

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.370
it's always subjective exactly what I
 

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.740
it's always subjective exactly what I
think much more important than that is

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:24.750
think much more important than that is
 

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.480
think much more important than that is
sorting out the navigation make make it

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:26.490
sorting out the navigation make make it
 

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.730
sorting out the navigation make make it
much clearer where you are in the app

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740
much clearer where you are in the app
 

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.530
much clearer where you are in the app
how to move to different parts of it and

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:30.540
how to move to different parts of it and
 

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.910
how to move to different parts of it and
make everything work together and I

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:31.920
make everything work together and I
 

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.700
make everything work together and I
think figuring out what is the the key

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:34.710
think figuring out what is the the key
 

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.320
think figuring out what is the the key
purpose I talked a little bit about this

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:36.330
purpose I talked a little bit about this
 

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.380
purpose I talked a little bit about this
during my i/o session this year but what

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:39.390
during my i/o session this year but what
 

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.790
during my i/o session this year but what
is the focus what is the thing that you

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:40.800
is the focus what is the thing that you
 

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.920
is the focus what is the thing that you
want people to associate your app with

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:42.930
want people to associate your app with
 

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.680
want people to associate your app with
is it oh yeah I want to check to see

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:45.690
is it oh yeah I want to check to see
 

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.870
is it oh yeah I want to check to see
what the GPS quality is so I'm going to

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880
what the GPS quality is so I'm going to
 

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.670
what the GPS quality is so I'm going to
use GPS test and fire it up and see

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:49.680
use GPS test and fire it up and see
 

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.380
use GPS test and fire it up and see
exactly how many satellites are in view

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:51.390
exactly how many satellites are in view
 

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.040
exactly how many satellites are in view
and what the act

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.050
and what the act
 

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.620
and what the act
accuracy is or do you want it to be like

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:54.630
accuracy is or do you want it to be like
 

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.330
accuracy is or do you want it to be like
okay I'm going for a hike or I'm going

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340
okay I'm going for a hike or I'm going
 

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.860
okay I'm going for a hike or I'm going
fishing and I want to be able to mark

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:57.870
fishing and I want to be able to mark
 

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.600
fishing and I want to be able to mark
down the best fishing spots or the best

00:27:59.600 --> 00:27:59.610
down the best fishing spots or the best
 

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.790
down the best fishing spots or the best
you know hiking trails and so I'm going

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:01.800
you know hiking trails and so I'm going
 

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.010
you know hiking trails and so I'm going
to use GPS test navigation to do that

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020
to use GPS test navigation to do that
 

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.990
to use GPS test navigation to do that
chances are it's going to be one or the

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000
chances are it's going to be one or the
 

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.880
chances are it's going to be one or the
other it's what your users are using or

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:07.890
other it's what your users are using or
 

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.890
other it's what your users are using or
you know what your direction for the app

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900
you know what your direction for the app
 

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.750
you know what your direction for the app
is and so I would try and find a way to

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760
is and so I would try and find a way to
 

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.090
is and so I would try and find a way to
focus more on that and make everything

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100
focus more on that and make everything
 

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.580
focus more on that and make everything
else sort of more supportive of that and

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:16.590
else sort of more supportive of that and
 

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.680
else sort of more supportive of that and
try and really get that focus as tight

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:18.690
try and really get that focus as tight
 

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.370
try and really get that focus as tight
as you can and one minor in here add on

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380
as you can and one minor in here add on
 

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.680
as you can and one minor in here add on
to that just a to navigation and streety

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:26.690
to that just a to navigation and streety
 

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.899
to that just a to navigation and streety
oh I think we lost Roman commit well

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:28.909
oh I think we lost Roman commit well
 

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:33.609
oh I think we lost Roman commit well
yeah remember guys when I was uh when I

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:33.619
yeah remember guys when I was uh when I
 

00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:35.259
yeah remember guys when I was uh when I
was crawling around on the floor we do

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:35.269
was crawling around on the floor we do
 

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:37.149
was crawling around on the floor we do
remember plugging stuff yeah yeah yeah

00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159
remember plugging stuff yeah yeah yeah
 

00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:39.219
remember plugging stuff yeah yeah yeah
that's because somebody unplugged the

00:28:39.219 --> 00:28:39.229
that's because somebody unplugged the
 

00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:41.469
that's because somebody unplugged the
Chromebook and then used its original

00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:41.479
Chromebook and then used its original
 

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:45.239
Chromebook and then used its original
plug to do something else

00:28:45.239 --> 00:28:45.249
plug to do something else
 

00:28:45.249 --> 00:28:48.039
plug to do something else
we have no hangout okay that's just the

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:48.049
we have no hangout okay that's just the
 

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.549
we have no hangout okay that's just the
way it is

00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559
way it is
 

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.200
way it is
sorry Roman if you can still hear us

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.210
sorry Roman if you can still hear us
 

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.089

five minutes excellent all right let's

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:21.109
five minutes excellent all right let's
 

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.680
five minutes excellent all right let's
have a look so we're going to do a quick

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:23.690
have a look so we're going to do a quick
 

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.789

community service announcement type type

00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799
community service announcement type type
 

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.129
community service announcement type type
talk on on one of the apps or a kind of

00:29:30.129 --> 00:29:30.139
talk on on one of the apps or a kind of
 

00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:31.299
talk on on one of the apps or a kind of
app which is which we get a lot of

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:31.309
app which is which we get a lot of
 

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:33.279
app which is which we get a lot of
nominations for and that is a virus

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:33.289
nominations for and that is a virus
 

00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:36.129
nominations for and that is a virus
checkers oh yes so I can't see but I'm

00:29:36.129 --> 00:29:36.139
checkers oh yes so I can't see but I'm
 

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:37.899
checkers oh yes so I can't see but I'm
gonna assume that you put there put

00:29:37.899 --> 00:29:37.909
gonna assume that you put there put
 

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.489
gonna assume that you put there put
something on screen but so we get a lot

00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:39.499
something on screen but so we get a lot
 

00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:42.099
something on screen but so we get a lot
of nominations for virus checking apps

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:42.109
of nominations for virus checking apps
 

00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:44.349
of nominations for virus checking apps
and one of the struggles we have is that

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:44.359
and one of the struggles we have is that
 

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:46.029
and one of the struggles we have is that
you know if we decide we want to put it

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039
you know if we decide we want to put it
 

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.289
you know if we decide we want to put it
up and talk about it is that it's then

00:29:47.289 --> 00:29:47.299
up and talk about it is that it's then
 

00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:49.479
up and talk about it is that it's then
already being removed from market or

00:29:49.479 --> 00:29:49.489
already being removed from market or
 

00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:51.190
already being removed from market or
from Google Play before we actually get

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200
from Google Play before we actually get
 

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.739
from Google Play before we actually get
a chance to look at it so there is kind

00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:53.749
a chance to look at it so there is kind
 

00:29:53.749 --> 00:29:55.779
a chance to look at it so there is kind
of a clue as to where I'm going with

00:29:55.779 --> 00:29:55.789
of a clue as to where I'm going with
 

00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:58.690
of a clue as to where I'm going with
this based on that and the struggle here

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:58.700
this based on that and the struggle here
 

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.259
this based on that and the struggle here
is that a lot of the times these apps

00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:01.269
is that a lot of the times these apps
 

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:03.849
is that a lot of the times these apps
they're basically trying to spread fudge

00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:03.859
they're basically trying to spread fudge
 

00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:05.589
they're basically trying to spread fudge
so it's a case of all it's a computer

00:30:05.589 --> 00:30:05.599
so it's a case of all it's a computer
 

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:06.789
so it's a case of all it's a computer
type thing and I don't want to get a

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799
type thing and I don't want to get a
 

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.259
type thing and I don't want to get a
virus if I want to get malware so I

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:08.269
virus if I want to get malware so I
 

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:11.080
virus if I want to get malware so I
better download a virus checker to make

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.090
better download a virus checker to make
 

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.810
better download a virus checker to make
sure that that doesn't happen to me the

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820
sure that that doesn't happen to me the
 

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.419
sure that that doesn't happen to me the
problem is well I know I'm gonna turn

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:16.429
problem is well I know I'm gonna turn
 

00:30:16.429 --> 00:30:17.889
problem is well I know I'm gonna turn
that around slightly the good news is is

00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:17.899
that around slightly the good news is is
 

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.359
that around slightly the good news is is
that really isn't something that you

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:19.369
that really isn't something that you
 

00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:21.039
that really isn't something that you
need so you don't need virus checkers

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:21.049
need so you don't need virus checkers
 

00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:23.919
need so you don't need virus checkers
for your Android phones most of the

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:23.929
for your Android phones most of the
 

00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:26.560
for your Android phones most of the
cases what these apps claim to do isn't

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:26.570
cases what these apps claim to do isn't
 

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.539
cases what these apps claim to do isn't
quite legit and so that's why a lot of

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:28.549
quite legit and so that's why a lot of
 

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:30.339
quite legit and so that's why a lot of
these will disappear from Google plays

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:30.349
these will disappear from Google plays
 

00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:32.469
these will disappear from Google plays
because they're basically claiming to be

00:30:32.469 --> 00:30:32.479
because they're basically claiming to be
 

00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:33.639
because they're basically claiming to be
able to do something which they can't

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:33.649
able to do something which they can't
 

00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:35.469
able to do something which they can't
and a lot of that's because they're

00:30:35.469 --> 00:30:35.479
and a lot of that's because they're
 

00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:37.239
and a lot of that's because they're
already sandboxed and that's a really

00:30:37.239 --> 00:30:37.249
already sandboxed and that's a really
 

00:30:37.249 --> 00:30:38.919
already sandboxed and that's a really
part of that security model is that apps

00:30:38.919 --> 00:30:38.929
part of that security model is that apps
 

00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:41.140
part of that security model is that apps
can't mess with other apps

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:41.150
can't mess with other apps
 

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.510
can't mess with other apps
which has the very positive side effect

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520
which has the very positive side effect
 

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.640
which has the very positive side effect
of meaning that viruses are very very

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.650
of meaning that viruses are very very
 

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.410
of meaning that viruses are very very
difficult to create so you know we

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:47.420
difficult to create so you know we
 

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.390
difficult to create so you know we
certainly have had some small issues

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.400
certainly have had some small issues
 

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.400
certainly have had some small issues
with malware and there's processes in

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:51.410
with malware and there's processes in
 

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.810
with malware and there's processes in
place to remove those but in terms of

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:52.820
place to remove those but in terms of
 

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.090
place to remove those but in terms of
apps infecting other apps interfering

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:55.100
apps infecting other apps interfering

with the way they work you know isn't

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:56.930
with the way they work you know isn't
 

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.010
with the way they work you know isn't
really an issue or it's the side effect

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.020
really an issue or it's the side effect
 

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.360
really an issue or it's the side effect
of that is of course by the same token

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:01.370
of that is of course by the same token
 

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.190
of that is of course by the same token
having an app which is supposed to go

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200
having an app which is supposed to go
 

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.720
having an app which is supposed to go
through and scan other apps and modify

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:04.730
through and scan other apps and modify

virus checker works doesn't work either

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.150
virus checker works doesn't work either
 

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.990
virus checker works doesn't work either
right yeah so yeah there's really you

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000
right yeah so yeah there's really you
 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.850
right yeah so yeah there's really you
you can't write a virus checker so if we

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:12.860
you can't write a virus checker so if we
 

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.460
you can't write a virus checker so if we
see one that sort of immediately raises

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:15.470
see one that sort of immediately raises
 

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.080
see one that sort of immediately raises
a red flag for everyone on the team and

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.090
a red flag for everyone on the team and
 

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.330
a red flag for everyone on the team and
we ask what the heck is this app doing

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.340
we ask what the heck is this app doing
 

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.610
we ask what the heck is this app doing
and most of the time the answer is it's

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:21.620
and most of the time the answer is it's
 

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.060
and most of the time the answer is it's
it's lying to the user exactly and so

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.070
it's lying to the user exactly and so
 

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.020
it's lying to the user exactly and so
even if it's not doing anything

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.030
even if it's not doing anything
 

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.820
even if it's not doing anything
malicious in and of itself which often

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:27.830
malicious in and of itself which often
 

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.010
malicious in and of itself which often
they aren't it's simply it's claiming to

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.020
they aren't it's simply it's claiming to
 

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.960
they aren't it's simply it's claiming to
do something which you can't do and that

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:31.970
do something which you can't do and that
 

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.240
do something which you can't do and that
definitely raises flags and to be honest

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.250
definitely raises flags and to be honest
 

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.220
definitely raises flags and to be honest
a lot of the time we've seen situations

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.230
a lot of the time we've seen situations
 

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.290
a lot of the time we've seen situations
where apps like this are just trying to

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:38.300
where apps like this are just trying to
 

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.710
where apps like this are just trying to
prey on on people's sort of preconceived

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720
prey on on people's sort of preconceived
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.540
prey on on people's sort of preconceived
notions of what they need and they also

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:43.550
notions of what they need and they also
 

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.820
notions of what they need and they also
tend to have a pretty high correlation

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:45.830
tend to have a pretty high correlation
 

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.130
tend to have a pretty high correlation
of spam within the app description and

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.140
of spam within the app description and
 

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.740
of spam within the app description and
so on itself so it's basically for

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:50.750
so on itself so it's basically for
 

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.910
so on itself so it's basically for
whatever reason people trying to get

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:51.920
whatever reason people trying to get
 

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.980
whatever reason people trying to get
people to download this app and then you

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:53.990
people to download this app and then you
 

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.540
people to download this app and then you
know do advertising things around that

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:55.550
know do advertising things around that
 

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.280
know do advertising things around that
now it's not always the case but that's

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:57.290
now it's not always the case but that's
 

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.690
now it's not always the case but that's
that's certainly something which we've

00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:58.700
that's certainly something which we've
 

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.690
that's certainly something which we've
found a lot of so we won't be reviewing

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:01.700
found a lot of so we won't be reviewing
 

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.250
found a lot of so we won't be reviewing
any virus checker apps because as far as

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:03.260
any virus checker apps because as far as
 

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.840
any virus checker apps because as far as
we're concerned the answer is it does

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:04.850
we're concerned the answer is it does
 

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.300
we're concerned the answer is it does
nothing so in case you're wondering

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:07.310
nothing so in case you're wondering
 

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:08.380
nothing so in case you're wondering
while we see it passed them in the

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:08.390
while we see it passed them in the
 

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.870
while we see it passed them in the
future

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880
 
 

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.760
 
checking okay which I think technically

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:15.770
checking okay which I think technically
 

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.020
checking okay which I think technically
you could do you can run through the

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.030
you could do you can run through the
 

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.190
you could do you can run through the
whole package list and search for

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200
whole package list and search for
 

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.930
whole package list and search for
package name and you can't look inside

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:19.940
package name and you can't look inside
 

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.760
package name and you can't look inside
of it but you could match against known

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:21.770
of it but you could match against known
 

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.000
of it but you could match against known
packages but honestly that's not even

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.010
packages but honestly that's not even
 

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.380
packages but honestly that's not even
really needed on really bit anymore

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:26.390
really needed on really bit anymore
 

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.430
really needed on really bit anymore
because you can just go and click on a

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440
because you can just go and click on a
 

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.900
because you can just go and click on a
notification and find out that a map it

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:28.910
notification and find out that a map it
 

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.930
notification and find out that a map it
came from so exactly so it's something

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:31.940
came from so exactly so it's something
 

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.490
came from so exactly so it's something
which you know we're definitely very

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:33.500
which you know we're definitely very
 

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.650
which you know we're definitely very
keen to try and make sure that the

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:35.660
keen to try and make sure that the
 

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.600
keen to try and make sure that the
platform is free of anything which is

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:37.610
platform is free of anything which is
 

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.160
platform is free of anything which is
going to be annoying frustrating and

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.170
going to be annoying frustrating and
 

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.470
going to be annoying frustrating and
malicious against users and we will try

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480
malicious against users and we will try
 

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.670
malicious against users and we will try
and find a ways to do that within the

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:42.680
and find a ways to do that within the
 

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.530
and find a ways to do that within the
platform itself because you know quite

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:44.540
platform itself because you know quite
 

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.910
platform itself because you know quite
simply it's not something that can be

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:45.920
simply it's not something that can be
 

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.760
simply it's not something that can be
done effectively or even at all in most

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:48.770
done effectively or even at all in most
 

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.659
done effectively or even at all in most
cases by a third party

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:50.669
cases by a third party
 

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:52.740
cases by a third party
all right so let's have a let's have a

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:52.750
all right so let's have a let's have a
 

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.270
all right so let's have a let's have a
look at what else have we got so we've

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.280
look at what else have we got so we've
 

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.799
look at what else have we got so we've
got a bunch of notes apps I don't think

00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:55.809
got a bunch of notes apps I don't think
 

00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:58.110
got a bunch of notes apps I don't think
we really have enough time to look at

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120
we really have enough time to look at
 

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.669
we really have enough time to look at
them so let's have a look at run double

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679
them so let's have a look at run double
 

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:01.140
them so let's have a look at run double
instead I'll have a look at will do a

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.150
instead I'll have a look at will do a
 

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.570
instead I'll have a look at will do a
notes app review next week there's

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:03.580
notes app review next week there's
 

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.370
notes app review next week there's
always a lot of notes apps which we get

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:05.380
always a lot of notes apps which we get
 

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.230
always a lot of notes apps which we get
up for review so I think that's what

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240
up for review so I think that's what
 

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.640
up for review so I think that's what
we'll do next week is just get like a

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:08.650
we'll do next week is just get like a
 

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.020
we'll do next week is just get like a
whole collection of them we'll go

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.030
whole collection of them we'll go
 

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.610
whole collection of them we'll go
through the the moderator queue so if

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:11.620
through the the moderator queue so if
 

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.529
through the the moderator queue so if
you have a Notes app that you'd like us

00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:13.539
you have a Notes app that you'd like us
 

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:14.909
you have a Notes app that you'd like us
to look at probably a good opportunity

00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919
to look at probably a good opportunity
 

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:16.560
to look at probably a good opportunity
to put it into the moderator queue and

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:16.570
to put it into the moderator queue and
 

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.600
to put it into the moderator queue and
we'll we'll run through like a bunch of

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:18.610
we'll we'll run through like a bunch of
 

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:20.250
we'll we'll run through like a bunch of
them and pick out the best and worst of

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:20.260
them and pick out the best and worst of
 

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.020
them and pick out the best and worst of
each all right so this is uh see what is

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.030
each all right so this is uh see what is
 

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.700
each all right so this is uh see what is
the name of this app this is a run

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:26.710

more concerned with so what I'm not sure

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760
more concerned with so what I'm not sure
 

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.970
more concerned with so what I'm not sure
of here is whether or not this app is

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:32.980
of here is whether or not this app is
 

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.220
of here is whether or not this app is
officially sponsored by run double or

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.230
officially sponsored by run double or
 

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.919
officially sponsored by run double or
this is a an app which someone is built

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:37.929
this is a an app which someone is built
 

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:40.710
this is a an app which someone is built
to help support something by third party

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720
to help support something by third party
 

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.210
to help support something by third party
yeah authors inspire run CC 25k exactly

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:45.220
yeah authors inspire run CC 25k exactly
 

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.829
yeah authors inspire run CC 25k exactly
and so that it brings up a question mark

00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839
and so that it brings up a question mark
 

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:48.119
and so that it brings up a question mark
for me and and so this this is

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:48.129
for me and and so this this is
 

00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:50.399
for me and and so this this is
potentially so again I don't know in

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:50.409
potentially so again I don't know in
 

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:54.119
potentially so again I don't know in
this particular case and I try and find

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:54.129
this particular case and I try and find
 

00:34:54.129 --> 00:34:57.270
this particular case and I try and find
out exactly but if it if it is a run

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280
out exactly but if it if it is a run
 

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.069
out exactly but if it if it is a run
double app then that's great

00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079
double app then that's great
 

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:01.469
double app then that's great
yeah it's certainly something we'd like

00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:01.479
yeah it's certainly something we'd like
 

00:35:01.479 --> 00:35:03.059
yeah it's certainly something we'd like
to see if it's not so this is an app by

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:03.069
to see if it's not so this is an app by
 

00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:04.529
to see if it's not so this is an app by
someone who's has built something to

00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:04.539
someone who's has built something to
 

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:06.359
someone who's has built something to
support the third party you want to be

00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:06.369
support the third party you want to be
 

00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:07.890
support the third party you want to be
really cautious about the way that you

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:07.900
really cautious about the way that you
 

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.410
really cautious about the way that you
promote that because there are rules in

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:10.420
promote that because there are rules in
 

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.559
promote that because there are rules in
the Play Store about not creating apps

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:13.569
the Play Store about not creating apps
 

00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:15.120
the Play Store about not creating apps

and app descriptions which make it seem
as though your app is officially

you know here it isn't clear to me
 

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.650
you know here it isn't clear to me
whether or whether or not that's the

whether or whether or not that's the
case and so you want to be make sure

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:41.859
case and so you want to be make sure
 

00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:43.709
case and so you want to be make sure
that you're really clear to your users

00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:43.719
that you're really clear to your users
 

00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:46.349
that you're really clear to your users
as to is this official is this something

00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359
as to is this official is this something
 

00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:48.269
as to is this official is this something
that's in support of another app and

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:48.279
that's in support of another app and
 

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:49.289
that's in support of another app and
make sure of course that you have

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:49.299
make sure of course that you have
 

00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:51.299
make sure of course that you have
permission from them to use their api's

00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:51.309
permission from them to use their api's
 

00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:52.920

or their resources in that kind of a way
 

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.799
or their resources in that kind of a way
so we're really conscious about trying

00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:55.809
so we're really conscious about trying
 

00:35:55.809 --> 00:35:57.749
so we're really conscious about trying
to not confuse users and make sure that

00:35:57.749 --> 00:35:57.759
to not confuse users and make sure that
 

00:35:57.759 --> 00:35:59.009
to not confuse users and make sure that
they know exactly what's going on in

00:35:59.009 --> 00:35:59.019
they know exactly what's going on in
 

00:35:59.019 --> 00:35:59.400
they know exactly what's going on in
here

00:35:59.400 --> 00:35:59.410
here
 

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.219
here
I'm a little confused so yes that's what

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:02.229
I'm a little confused so yes that's what
 

00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:03.719
I'm a little confused so yes that's what
I wanted to that's what I wanted to

00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:03.729
I wanted to that's what I wanted to
 

00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:07.249
I wanted to that's what I wanted to
check so let's go back into the app so

00:36:07.249 --> 00:36:07.259
check so let's go back into the app so
 

00:36:07.259 --> 00:36:09.749
check so let's go back into the app so
yeah the the big thing here is that the

00:36:09.749 --> 00:36:09.759
yeah the the big thing here is that the
 

00:36:09.759 --> 00:36:13.979
yeah the the big thing here is that the
UI is it's it's it's too bright yellow

00:36:13.979 --> 00:36:13.989
UI is it's it's it's too bright yellow
 

00:36:13.989 --> 00:36:16.079
UI is it's it's it's too bright yellow
is too much and then you've got the

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:16.089
is too much and then you've got the
 

00:36:16.089 --> 00:36:18.630
is too much and then you've got the
small icons with the white text again

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640
small icons with the white text again
 

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.009
small icons with the white text again
sort of old-school looking icons which I

00:36:22.009 --> 00:36:22.019
sort of old-school looking icons which I
 

00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:23.789
sort of old-school looking icons which I
mean they're the reasonable resolution

00:36:23.789 --> 00:36:23.799
mean they're the reasonable resolution
 

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:27.779
mean they're the reasonable resolution
but they're also look very victory so

00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:27.789
but they're also look very victory so
 

00:36:27.789 --> 00:36:30.390
but they're also look very victory so
yeah I definitely work on that like

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400
yeah I definitely work on that like
 

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.890
yeah I definitely work on that like
right now it's not particularly

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:31.900
right now it's not particularly
 

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.289
right now it's not particularly
appealing like just don't make it want

00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:34.299
appealing like just don't make it want
 

00:36:34.299 --> 00:36:36.499
appealing like just don't make it want
to go away because it's hurting too much

00:36:36.499 --> 00:36:36.509
to go away because it's hurting too much
 

00:36:36.509 --> 00:36:38.819
to go away because it's hurting too much
well yeah

00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:38.829
well yeah
 

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.199
well yeah

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:43.900
she's one screen back so first off here
 

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.380
she's one screen back so first off here
the change plan which lets you I think

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:46.390
the change plan which lets you I think
 

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.209
the change plan which lets you I think
yeah I think if you click something here

00:36:48.209 --> 00:36:48.219
yeah I think if you click something here
 

00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:50.880
yeah I think if you click something here
it lets you oh it works now it tried to

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:50.890

00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:57.849
why even buy it no I didn't so at least
 

00:36:57.849 --> 00:36:59.370
why even buy it no I didn't so at least
a few minutes ago when I try to do this

00:36:59.370 --> 00:36:59.380
a few minutes ago when I try to do this
 

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.150
a few minutes ago when I try to do this
I don't even know how to get back there

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160
I don't even know how to get back there
 

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.789
I don't even know how to get back there

up creepy ah there we go
 

00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:07.229

so that's nothing that's confusing like

00:37:07.229 --> 00:37:07.239
so that's nothing that's confusing like
 

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:09.180
so that's nothing that's confusing like
these menus are pretty much the same why

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.190
these menus are pretty much the same why
 

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.920
these menus are pretty much the same why
is it and there's three ways to get to

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:10.930
is it and there's three ways to get to
 

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:11.350
is it and there's three ways to get to
this

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:11.360
this
 

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.080
this
you're there there or there there I

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.090
you're there there or there there I
 

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.880
you're there there or there there I
should just be one menu but also when

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:15.890
should just be one menu but also when
 

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.170
should just be one menu but also when
you probably you're looks like the

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:17.180
you probably you're looks like the
 

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.660
you probably you're looks like the
description says couch to 5k and I click

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:19.670
description says couch to 5k and I click
 

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.660
description says couch to 5k and I click
buy and the description now does not say

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:22.670

anything someone great couch to 5k in
 

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.490
anything someone great couch to 5k in
weeks three to nine I guess is sort of

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:27.500
weeks three to nine I guess is sort of
 

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.290
weeks three to nine I guess is sort of
similar but it doesn't match exactly and

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:29.300
similar but it doesn't match exactly and
 

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.180
similar but it doesn't match exactly and
hmm that confused me for a second yeah

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.190
hmm that confused me for a second yeah
 

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.730
hmm that confused me for a second yeah
it's not clear exactly what remaining

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:33.740
it's not clear exactly what remaining
 

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.930
it's not clear exactly what remaining
weeks three and nine which I guess

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:34.940
weeks three and nine which I guess
 

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.420
weeks three and nine which I guess
implies that this is weeks one two three

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:37.430
implies that this is weeks one two three
 

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:41.110
implies that this is weeks one two three
and then this must be nine it's all the

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.120
and then this must be nine it's all the
 

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.270
and then this must be nine it's all the
same thing yeah yes I'm basically a my

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280
same thing yeah yes I'm basically a my
 

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.620
same thing yeah yes I'm basically a my

big advantage of you're not billing is

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720
big advantage of you're not billing is
 

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.540
big advantage of you're not billing is
that it removes those barriers it's

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:22.550
that it removes those barriers it's
 

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.460
that it removes those barriers it's
fewer clicks between I want this and I

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:24.470
fewer clicks between I want this and I
 

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.470
fewer clicks between I want this and I
have this so you want to make sure that

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480
have this so you want to make sure that
 

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.960
have this so you want to make sure that
that's a smoother passes possibly I

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:28.970
that's a smoother passes possibly I
 

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.610
that's a smoother passes possibly I
almost like I said every that upgrade
