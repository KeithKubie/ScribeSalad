00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, you will be given intercepted messages

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
from a Diffie-Hellman exchange between two people,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
including p--a large prime number, g--a generator, g of a mod p

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where a is Alice's private key, g of b mod p where b is Bob's private key,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a message which has been encoded with g of a  b mod p as the key.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You will also be given timing information from the modular exponentiation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as described in a previous question.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Your job will be to use the side channel to determine the key and decode the message.
