00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
our societies are very interested in
winners but they don't really know what

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.740
to do about losers of which there are
always by definition far more for a long

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.570
time around success and failure

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.190
the chaps tends to be very upbeat we
hear about resilience bouncing back

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.710
never surrendering and giving it another
go

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
but there's only so long this kind of
talk and go on at some point the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.099
conclusion becomes inevitable

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
things won't work out the political
career isn't going to have a comeback

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
there'll be no way of getting financed
for the film the novel won't be accepted

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
by the 32nd publisher the criminal
charges of forever going to take one's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.570
reputation on stuffed up big time

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.600
where is responsibility for success and
failure lie

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
nowadays squarely with the individual
concerned that's why failure isn't just

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.800
hard as it's always been

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
it's a catastrophe there's no
metaphysical consolation no possibility

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.550
of appealing to an idea of bad luck

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.890
no one to blame but oneself no wonder
suicide rates climb exponentially one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.090
societies become modern and start to
hold people profoundly responsible for

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.770
their biographies meritocracy is turn
failure from a misfortune to an

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.810
unbridgeable existential verdict on the
state of one's soul but not all

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
societies and errors have seen success
and failure in such a stark light in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.259
ancient greece another rather remarkable
possibility quite ignored by our own era

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.930
was envisaged you could be good

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.579
and yet fail to keep this idea at the
front of the collective imagination

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
the ancient Greeks developed a
particular art form tragic drama

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.460
they put on huge festivals which all the
citizens were expected to attend to act

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.820
out stories of a Pauling often grizzly
failure

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.020
people would seem to break a minor law
will make a hasty decision or sleep with

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.090
the wrong person and the result was
ignominy and death yet what happened was

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.439
shown to be to a large extent in hands
of what the Greeks called fate or the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.490
gods

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.030
it was the Greeks poetic way of saying
that things often work out in random

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.020
ways according to dynamics that simply
don't reflect the merits of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.040
individuals concern in the poetic

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.090
the philosopher Aristotle to find the
key ingredients of tragedy

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.200
the hero of a tragedy should be a decent
person better than average often

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.299
highborn but prone to making small
mistakes as we all do at the start it

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.109
may not be obvious that it's an error
they're making but by an unfortunate

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.400
chain of events for which they're not
wholly to blame this small mistake leads

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.400
to a catastrophe a tragedy is the
sympathetic morally complex account of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
how good people can end up in disaster
situations

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.349
it's the very opposite of today's
tabloid newspaper or social media sphere

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.919
where the mob rushes to make judgments
on those who slipped up

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.599
Aristotle thought is extremely important
that people see tragic works on a

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.069
regular basis to counter their otherwise
strong inclinations to judge in to

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.169
moralize a good tragedy should for
Aristotle inspire both pity and fear

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.150
pity for the tragic hero based on an
understanding of how easy it is to make

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.159
the slip that leads to a disaster and
fear for oneself as one realizes how

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.260
open our lives are two careering out of
control all of us could quite quickly

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.680
come apart if ever events chose to test
us

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.370
tragedy is meant to be a corrective too
easy judgment

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.530
it exists a counter on natural instincts
to admire only the successful to spurn

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.000
all those who fail and to dismiss
unfortunates as losers

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.739
we're currently very uncomfortable
around the idea of a good person not

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.790
succeeding

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.940
we'd rather say that they weren't good
at all that embrace a far more

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.040
disturbing and less well publicized
thought that in fact the world is very

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.199
unfair but without the idea of tragedy
we make existence for everyone far

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.650
crueler and far more judgmental than it
really need be

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.329
it's time to look back in history to
recover an extremely important idea
