MALE SPEAKER: Please welcome
Stephen Voltz and Fritz Grobe.

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:05.454
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.523
STEPHEN VOLTZ: My
name is Stephen.

00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:13.690
I used to be a trial lawyer.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.120
FRITZ GROBE: And my
name is Fritz.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.320
And I used to be a professional
juggler.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.230
On a Saturday morning in June
of 2006, we posted a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.195
three-minute video online that
ended both of our careers.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.810
STEPHEN VOLTZ: It did
start new ones.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.060
FRITZ GROBE: Yes.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.580
STEPHEN VOLTZ: It's great to be
here at YouTube, especially

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.900
for us, since that's sort
of our home base.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.050
You guys, since we've started,
have really grown.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.870
It started with home video
and viral video.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.270
And now you're doing news, and
music videos, and programming,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.830
and you're beginning to
replace television.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.550
What we're really interested in
is the viral video stuff,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.370
the stuff that people really
share actively online.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.530
And the key question is, what
makes people do that?

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.700
What makes people
share something?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.460
What's the content?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.010
What is it that makes someone
watch something passively, and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.650
other people watch something
else and make it viral?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.160
So for the past year or so,
Fritz and I have been busy

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.800
writing the "Viral Video
Manifesto," which is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.920
essentially an "Elements of
Style" for viral video.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.930
It's not about what camera to
use, or how to get good

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.590
lighting, or SEO, or thumbnail
selection.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.730
It's about the content.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.130
Its about, what is it inside
those videos that makes people

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.730
want to share it?

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.140
We've looked at the traits of
the videos that we've had that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.600
have gone viral, and a lot of
other videos that have gone

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.000
viral, and have looked to see,
what is it about that content

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.302
that makes them contagious?

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:43.120
FRITZ GROBE: So this is
a new kind of video.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.470
And the techniques of old
media, the techniques of

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.920
television and film,
just don't work.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.330
As we looked at our own videos
that have gone viral, as we

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.060
looked at other people's videos
that have gone viral,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.700
and we started talking to people
like Trish Sie from OK

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.330
Go, Judson Laipply, Matt
Harding, Charlie Todd--

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.380
started to see that, yes, there
are consistent patterns.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.420
There are techniques
that work.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.610
STEPHEN VOLTZ: When we first put
that video online back in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.790
2006, we told one person.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640
We were really weren't
ready to go live yet.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.600
So I just told my brother
David in San Francisco.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.830
And he told a friend of his in
Seattle, who put it on Fark.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.800
By the end of the first day,
we had 14,000 views.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.080
This is back in 2006.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.200
By the end of the second day, we
had tens of thousands more.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.700
And now it's become a viral
video classic, with millions

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.060
and millions of views--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.430
hard to count because of so many
bootleg copies, actually.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.930
FRITZ GROBE: And after we
posted that first video,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.540
Stephen and I, we were both
going to be gone for the next

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.310
several weeks after that.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.420
So we asked our friend Jason if
we could put his name and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.060
phone number on our website--

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.650
just in case Letterman called.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.720
Well, Monday morning, about 48
hours after we posted that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.040
first video, Monday morning,
Jason calls and says, you know

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.390
how you asked if you could put
my name and phone number on

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.010
your website--

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.210
just in case Letterman called?

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.410
Yeah, Letterman called.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.830
That was Monday morning.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.870
Tuesday morning, "The Conan
O'Brien Show" called.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.180
Wednesday, we were on "All
Things Considered" on NPR.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.760
Thursday, we got an email from
the folks at WET Design, the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.930
people who built the Bellagio
fountains, one of the big

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.300
inspirations for that first
Coke and Mentos video.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.225
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I was afraid
they were going to sue us.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.040
FRITZ GROBE: And that was the
beginning of EepyBird as a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.320
company and the beginning of an
amazing ride that now, six

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.800
and a half years later,
just keeps rolling.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.930
In the last six and a half years
since that first video,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.700
well, we've made videos
with a quarter of a

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.590
million sticky notes.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.950
We built a Coke and
Mentos-powered rocket car,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.690
which, actually, you can
see on YouTube in 3D.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.100
It was directed by Rob Cohen of
"The Fast and the Furious,"

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.750
so we called it "The Fizzy and
the Furious." And we made

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.880
videos working in conjunction
with McDonald's, Coca-Cola,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.410
Office Max, ABC Family,
and more.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.990
Each of the major projects has
gone viral and gotten several

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.660
million views.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.220
STEPHEN VOLTZ: And it's had an
astonishing impact for the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.790
brands as well.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.620
Our campaigns for Coca-Cola
spiked two-liter Diet Coke

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.660
sales in the United States
by over 5%--

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.180
twice.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.040
And they boosted Mentos
sales by 15%

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.120
for three years straight.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.230
FRITZ GROBE: But we didn't set
out to be viral video experts.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.580
What we studied was clowning.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.430
We studied European-style,
simple, red-nosed clowning.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.930
STEPHEN VOLTZ: We both studied
with a lot of different

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.560
teachers, but, in particular,
with Avner Eisenberg at the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.100
Celebration Barn Theater
in South Paris, Maine.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.200
At one point, I had
a one-man clown

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.970
show up in San Francisco.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.920
FRITZ GROBE: And I toured with
a Cirque du Soleil spin-off.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.430
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Between the two
of us, we've spent a lot of

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.530
time studying that kind
of performance.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.930
What makes one circus act

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.200
breathtaking and another boring?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.320
FRITZ GROBE: What makes one
clown funny and another, oh,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.033
dear God, make him stop?

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:33.680
STEPHEN VOLTZ: It turns out
it's all about making a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.570
connection with your audience.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.610
When you're performing in a barn
in the woods of Maine,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.770
you can't pretend you're on
Broadway with all the lights,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.370
and the sets, and the dazzle.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.720
You've gotta drop all that
pretense and just focus on

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.743
connecting with the people
you're in front of.

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:54.440
FRITZ GROBE: And it turns
out that viral video

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.460
is exactly the same.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.860
This isn't television, with all
the crane shots, and dolly

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.510
shots, cameras covering every
angle, pans and zooms, and

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.760
quick edits.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.790
This is reality seen through
a cell phone camera.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:25.993
Television has spent decades
perfecting video production--

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:26.350
STEPHEN VOLTZ: You got it.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.720
FRITZ GROBE: --techniques.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.080
STEPHEN VOLTZ: You got it.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.380
FRITZ GROBE: But online, what
you've gotta do is cut through

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.292
all that and focus on connecting
with people.

00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:45.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.270
FRITZ GROBE: This is a
new kind of video.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.230
All the production techniques
from TV and film don't work.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.190
All the techniques that you've
seen in old media, they're

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.555
actually in your way.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.440
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Television uses
quick edits, and crazy camera

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.420
angles, and fast cuts, and news
crawls, and zooms and

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.430
sound effects to keep us
from turning away.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.330
And those techniques trick us
into watching by exploiting a

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.385
primal human reaction called
the orienting response.

00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:41.350
The orienting response is what
kicks in when we hear a sudden

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.900
noise or we see a
sudden movement.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.050
Now, all of our senses
immediately, involuntarily,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.780
automatically orient
to that stimulus

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.480
just for a few seconds.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.190
Now, from an evolutionary
standpoint, that's really

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.800
important because that noise
might be a snake in the grass.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.800
Or that movement might be
a tiger about to attack.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.530
FRITZ GROBE: And television is
constantly stimulating our

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.230
orienting response.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.500
A quick cut or sudden zoom
forces us to pay attention, if

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.650
only for a moment.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.340
When that moment is gone, they
hit us again and again.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.050
So we literally can't
turn away.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.580
And the orienting response
is really powerful,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.450
but it has a cost.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.860
Literally, the orienting
response causes your heart

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.840
rate to slow.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.980
And for a few seconds,
the alpha waves in

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.179
your brain are blocked.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.932
That's what television does with
its cuts, and its edits,

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:43.530
and its sound effects.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.750
So with television--

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:52.830
oh, actually it's Robert Kubey
at Rutgers, and Mihaly

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.560
Csikszentmihalyi in Claremont.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.320
They studied TV viewers.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.740
And they found that they report

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.380
being relaxed and passive.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.130
And that passivity continues
even after you've

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.410
turned the TV off.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.840
And that's exactly what you want
if your objective is to

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.810
keep people from changing
the channel.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:23.546
TV numbs us into this lethargic
stupor so that we,

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:27.490
when we finally stumble off to
bed, we realize we've just

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.870
spent the last three hours
watching reruns of "Dukes of

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.343
Hazzard."

00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:34.530
STEPHEN VOLTZ: But online,
putting your audience into

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.350
that kind of a trance
is a problem.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.700
To go viral, your goal is to
get people to stop what

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.260
they're doing and actively sit
up and tell their friends

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.510
about what they've just seen.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.150
Researchers at the University
of Pennsylvania--

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.990
Katherine Milkman and--

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.520
FRITZ GROBE: Jonah Berger.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.150
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Jonah Berger--

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.600
have looked at what makes people
share content online.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.880
And what they've found is that,
in fact, when we're

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.730
passive, we don't share much.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.460
What gets us sharing, what's
really most contagious, is

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.830
content that puts us in an
active, positive mood, that

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.480
gives us active, positive
emotions.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.680
So it's things that amaze us, or
things that make us laugh--

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.310
that's what's contagious.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.610
FRITZ GROBE: As we did the
work for the "Viral Video

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.130
Manifesto," we found that
whether you're on stage or

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.860
online, it's exactly the same.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.070
You need to cut through the
tricks and the flash of old

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:32.510
media and focus on creating
a human connection.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.110
So to create contagious content,
there are four core

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.020
principles we've found are
crucial to understand.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.090
First, be true.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.580
Don't fake it.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.696
Make it real.

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.830
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Second,
don't waste my time.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.180
Get down to business
right away.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.340
FRITZ GROBE: Third,
be unforgettable.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.260
Show us something we have
never seen before.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.520
STEPHEN VOLTZ: And, finally,
ultimately,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.670
it's all about humanity.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.390
FRITZ GROBE: And it's important
to note that you

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.080
don't have to be perfect
in all four of these.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.190
You can go viral with a strength
in one area making up

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.640
for weaknesses in others--

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.950
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Particularly
three or four.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.010
FRITZ GROBE: Yes.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:27.160
But the more you can stick to
all four rules, the better.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.350
So let's dig into each
of these four rules

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.550
a little bit more.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.520
So first, be true.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.070
So we crave true, authentic
experiences.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:44.540
But television gives us a
packaged version of reality,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.900
whereas the internet, the
potential is now to give us

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.900
that raw, unfiltered
experience.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.560
So a sneezing baby panda,
or a kid biting

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.150
his brother's finger--

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.430
these are not made by actors.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.430
These are not made by editors.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.120
These don't have camera
people with fancy film

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.510
school camera moves.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:16.760
These are made by real people
for real people.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:23.930
So contagious videos, the
opportunity with viral video

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.165
is to make us a fly
on the wall.

00:12:27.165 --> 00:12:30.110
Because anything that interferes
with the feeling

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.200
that we are there reduces the
emotional connection.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.320
So make us a fly on the wall--

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.500
no actors, no edits, no
fancy camera moves.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.770
Viral videos show us real people
having real reactions

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.740
to real events.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.890
So what really happens when
you drop 500 Mentos mint

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.680
candies into 100 bottles of
Coke, as we did, for the

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.210
Extreme Diet Coke and
Mentos experiments?

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:05.410
What really happens when you
send 250,000 super balls

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.950
bouncing down a hill in San
Francisco, as Sony Bravia did

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.940
for their Bouncing
Balls video?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:20.730
And what really happens when a
car with an invisible driver

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.240
pulls up to a drive-through,
as Rahat Hussain did in

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.530
Invisible Drive-through Prank?

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.630
FRITZ GROBE: These videos
captured the real thing when

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.690
it really happened.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.800
They didn't recreate anything.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.516
They just captured the truth.

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:45.740
STEPHEN VOLTZ: In June of 2009,
a video appeared on

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.360
YouTube with the description,
"a magical moment happens in

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.570
Disneyland USA on a summer
evening when a young man

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.540
proposes to his girlfriend
in Disneyland--"

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.265
FRITZ GROBE: Registered
trademark.

00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:59.060
STEPHEN VOLTZ: --resort."
It was fake.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.410
If you couldn't tell from the
description, it was fake.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.700
This video has dozens of shots,
lots of cuts, a crane

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.510
shot, I think, probably
three or four

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.810
cameras, the perfect couple--

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.100
this is a toothpaste
commercial.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.120
The folks at Disney didn't
trust that a real wedding

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.390
proposal would be interesting
enough to go viral.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.780
But consider this--

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.150
that same month, Jill Peterson
and Kevin Heinz from Minnesota

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.243
posted video of their wedding
party going down the aisle in

00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:31.950
the JK Wedding Entrance Dance.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.460
This video was real.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.180
This video was one of the
most popular viral

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.230
videos of the year.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.980
FRITZ GROBE: Now, coming from
the circus, I've seen a lot of

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.430
great handstands in my life.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.700
This is not one of them.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.960
But it's beautiful.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.160
These are not the greatest
dancers, but we love them for

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.510
that because they're real.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.100
So JK Wedding Entrance
Dance, it's true.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.460
And then there's nothing
in the video production

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.640
techniques that interfere with
the feeling that we are there.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.660
It's shot with one camera, no
edits, there's no second take

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.490
for this video.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:27.550
So what you want to do is just
throw away the script, trust

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:32.910
the truth, and just turn the
camera on and get everybody

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.216
dancing down the aisle.

00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:38.850
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Our next rule
is, don't waste my time.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:43.110
For us, that means nothing
but money shots.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.070
If you've got a baby monkey
riding backwards on a pig,

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.130
show us that immediately.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.710
As Elvis said, a little
less conversation,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.960
a little more action.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.810
FRITZ GROBE: And as Natasha
Veruschka, the queen of

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:01.130
swords, said, less chitchat,
more swallowing.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.820
She's a sword swallower.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.000
STEPHEN VOLTZ: We learned this
lesson the hard way, with our

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.640
Extreme Sticky Note videos.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.180
We had spend months developing
dozens of really cool effects

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.950
with sticky notes.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.250
We used these--

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.130
FRITZ GROBE: Zigzag pads.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.500
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Zigzag pads.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.620
They're made for pop-up
dispensers.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.980
So you pull one out, the
next one comes out.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.280
And we discovered you
could make a little

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.110
waterfall with it.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.500
FRITZ GROBE: In fact,
we spent about three

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.760
days exploring this.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.240
Literally, one of the first
ideas we had was, it seems

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.400
like it should be able to
flow like a Slinky.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.490
But you can see, it catches.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.410
It doesn't quite work.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.190
I kid you not, for three days
we tried everything

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.460
we could think of.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.680
We made sculptures,
and puppets, and--

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.560
after three days, if finally
occurred to us to try this.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:59.960
That was it.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.035
That waterfall led us to--

00:17:14.525 --> 00:17:18.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.849
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So that's about
4,000 sticky notes.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.079
For our Extreme Sticky
Note video, we had a

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.150
quarter of a million.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.079
But how did we start?

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.170
FRITZ GROBE: So let's
take a look.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.270
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So first, there's
a woman at her desk.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.630
And we're watching our
old video, and then

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.620
her boss comes out.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.970
And he seems like he's
kind of a jerk.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.120
And he gives her lots
of work to do.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.560
And she gives him a look.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.300
Then finally, he leaves, and
then we go by this guy, who's

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.370
not doing anything.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.450
And then there's a couple guys
in the back that look like

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.720
maybe they've got-- these guys
are us, and they've got a

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.130
couple of--

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.610
it's a complete waste of time.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.260
FRITZ GROBE: So that video
started with an agonizing 58

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:04.150
seconds of that before we got to
what we promised you, which

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.920
was extreme sticky note
experiments, with hundreds of

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.550
times what you just saw there.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:17.440
So there were some compromises
that were necessary.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.750
That video actually debuted
simultaneously online and on

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.640
television, so we had to be
working within the rules of

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.620
television as well.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.480
But we'd like to show you a
video that we made just for

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.180
internal purposes in the very,
very early days of working

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.370
with sticky notes.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.760
This was just our little video
to say, this is what we're

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.580
working on.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.260
STEPHEN VOLTZ: It's a proof
of concept for us.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.950
FRITZ GROBE: Proof of concept
to give us a hint of what we

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.910
might be able to do.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.404
Let's take a look.

00:18:46.404 --> 00:19:44.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.720
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.750
FRITZ GROBE: So that
video doesn't have

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.590
any of the big effects.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.610
That's literally a few
hundred sticky notes.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:00.430
But there's a lot about that
video that we liked better.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.560
The big video, it took 58
seconds to get started.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.790
That video, it's all over
and done in 58 seconds.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:14.280
So we found ourselves wondering,
how many people

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.380
watched the big video and just
switched over to something

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.010
else before we got down to
business, before we showed you

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.300
what you're there to see, which
is crazy, cool stuff

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.910
with sticky notes?

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.660
Now, the big video,
it did well.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.450
It got several million
views, won some

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.370
great industry awards.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.260
But it could have
been a lot more.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.220
So what got in the way?

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.670
Well, story got in the way.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.930
It turns out that, unlike almost
all other forms of film

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:51.900
and video, viral video
is not about story.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.880
Advertisers, filmmakers, we're
used to thinking of everything

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.560
as a story because stories are
powerful tools for grabbing

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.770
and holding attention.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.730
But surprisingly, in viral
video, story is

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.880
just a waste of time.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.960
One of the most important things
we realized is that

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.890
viral video-- actually, it's
under the heading of, The Most

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.140
Important Idea in This Book--

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.690
is the 21st century side show.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.860
And in the side show, if you
have a sword swallower, show

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.150
her swallowing swords.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.310
Don't tell us her life story.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.010
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Look at all the
top videos on YouTube, all the

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.010
viral videos.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.750
They're not telling stories.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.730
They're music videos.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.670
They're novelty songs.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.620
They're crazy dances.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.650
They're a kid biting his
brother's finger.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.170
They're a panda sneezing.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.070
This is vaudeville.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.650
This is sideshow.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.390
So if you want to go viral, as
tempting as it may be to make

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.880
everything a story,
don't do it.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.890
Just get down to business.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.730
FRITZ GROBE: And just like a
sideshow act, every viral

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.590
video has a hook.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.020
It has something that provokes
that reaction--

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.735
I have never seen this before.

00:22:05.735 --> 00:22:08.470
And that brings us to rule
number three, be

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.180
unforgettable.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.520
The goal in viral video is to
have something that would make

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.750
for a great carnival barker's
pitch, so that you can

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.140
imagine, step right up,
step right up--

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.470
whoops, sorry.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.440
Step right up, step right up,
watch a baby monkey riding

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.260
backwards on a pig.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.100
STEPHEN VOLTZ: There's a hook.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.920
FRITZ GROBE: There's a hook.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.490
See what happens when you drop
an iPhone into a blender.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.930
There's a hook.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.880
And watch, oh yes, watch a
guy dance Gangnam style.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.520
There is something we have
never seen before.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.840
And all these videos
have great hooks.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.950
So how do you find a hook?

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.470
Well, for us, we try to do
something different and then

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.650
take it further than
anyone else has.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.350
STEPHEN VOLTZ: For us, in our
work, it means doing way more

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.960
exploration than anyone
would expect.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.380
You want to explore your corner
of the world until

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.980
you're the world's leading
expert, until you own it.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.290
I would venture to guess that
Fritz and I are the two

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.200
world's leading experts on
dropping candy into soda to

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.460
make geysers.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.480
FRITZ GROBE: Candy sodology.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.215
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Candy
sodiology.

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:20.460
FRITZ GROBE: There we go.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.630
STEPHEN VOLTZ: And in the same
way, we started out to be the

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.620
world's leading experts, our
goal was to be the world's

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.310
leading experts in sticky
note waterfalls.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.510
You want to explore your idea
like that until you own it.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.850
And that may get you
to unforgettable.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.410
FRITZ GROBE: So looking back,
OK Go owned dancing on

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.290
treadmills in "Here it Goes
Again." Cleary and Harding

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:48.020
owned dancing with their hands
"We no Speak Americano." Each

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.290
of these videos was unlike
anything anyone had seen

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.880
before, and as a result, got
millions of people telling

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.120
their friends, oh my god,
you've got to see this.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:04.430
So when we talk to people who
want to make viral videos, we

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:10.910
ask them, what odd thing are
you passionate about?

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.310
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So I liked
being a trial lawyer.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.840
I really enjoyed it.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.640
But except when I was actually
in the middle of a trial, or

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.910
in those few crazy weeks leading
up to one, when I went

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.646
home at night, my cases weren't
what I thought about.

00:24:23.646 --> 00:24:27.380
What I found myself thinking
about were things like, I

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.650
wonder if I can play "Stars
and Stripes Forever" on

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.090
glasses of water--

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.890
which turns out I can.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.030
FRITZ GROBE: And I grew up
as the son of two math

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.860
professors.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.090
And I went off to study
math at Yale.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.380
And then I quit school
to become a juggler.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.060
And my parents were thrilled.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:52.610
But I love math, and
I love juggling.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.470
But what I discovered was that,
when I got up in the

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:02.650
morning, what I wanted to do,
what I was just itching to do,

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.850
was juggle and climb through
coat hangers.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.940
And that's what can lead
to your viral videos.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.860
That passion, that exploring
whatever it is you're excited

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.830
about can be what tips you
into viral territory.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.420
So our question is, what do
you find yourself thinking

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.010
about when your time
is your own?

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.080
Explore that weird little
corner of the world that

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.190
you're curious about, like we
did with Coke and Mentos, with

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:36.510
sticky notes, and so on, until
you take it all the way to

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.760
unforgettable.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.100
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Now, people often
come up to us and ask us

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.780
if we can guess what
their favorite part

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.680
of our videos is.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.000
So is it that 12, 15
geysers going off

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.780
all at once in synchrony?

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.750
Is it 40,000 sticky notes
falling from the

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.430
ceiling all at once?

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.460
Is it Fritz shooting down
the road on a Coke- and

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.546
Mentos-powered rocket car?

00:25:59.546 --> 00:26:02.960
It turns out it's
none of those.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.740
Almost everybody's favorite
moment is at the

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.720
end, when we do this.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.360
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Now, all that
other stuff is important.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.450
Those are our hooks.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.250
We wouldn't be able to
do this unless we'd

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.140
done the other stuff.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.150
But the favorite moment is that
one moment of humanity

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.840
when we throw our arms up.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.630
And that brings us to
our fourth rule--

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.730
to make a connection,
Ultimately,

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.720
it's all about humanity.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.190
When we throw our arms up in air
in that moment of triumph,

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.100
the audience gets to celebrate,
our viewers get to

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.380
celebrate with us, in that
absurd accomplishment.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.261
You actually feel a little
bit of what we feel.

00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:43.800
Neuroscientists have discovered
that emotion itself

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.940
is contagious.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.650
So when you see us in that
actual moment, of we're really

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.050
feeling that crazy moment of
joy for a moment there, you

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.580
actually feel a little
bit of what we feel.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.430
Just neurologically,
that kicks in.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.040
So if you're looking to go
viral, if you're looking to

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.970
create content that goes
viral, show us

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.960
your moment of triumph.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.350
Show us real human emotion.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:08.220
Give us some real moment of
human reaction to connect to.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.490
FRITZ GROBE: The most compelling
online videos, from

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:18.050
JK Wedding Entrance Dance, to
Susan Boyle, to David After

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.930
Dentist, Charlie Bit My Finger,
and, actually, one of

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.720
our all-time favorites, Where
the Hell is Matt, these videos

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.410
show us moments of--

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.150
STEPHEN VOLTZ: He's OK.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:31.710
FRITZ GROBE: Yes--

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.690
moments of real humanity
and real emotion.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:42.790
They show us the raw humanity
that creates that strong

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.343
positive emotion.

00:27:44.343 --> 00:27:47.920
And that strong, positive
emotion is something that we

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.880
want to share.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.360
We want to share that experience
with our friends.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.600
So finally, we'd like to take
a look at one of the hot

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.940
videos of the month and see how
it stacks up on the four

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.890
rules from the "Viral Video
Manifesto." This is the

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:14.860
Drive-through Invisible Driver
Prank from Rahat Hussain.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.180
And I'll give you some sound.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.570
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.672
-And what I'm going to do with
this costume is, I'm going to

00:28:19.672 --> 00:28:22.438
put it on, and I'm going to go
through a drive-through.

00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:23.932
-Hi, just a brownie?

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:24.430
-Yeah.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.680
-Oh my god.

00:28:31.402 --> 00:28:32.896
-Am I tripping, son?

00:28:32.896 --> 00:28:33.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:33.892 --> 00:28:35.142
-Come here.

00:28:37.876 --> 00:28:38.400
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.470
FRITZ GROBE: So that's just a
little bit of that video.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.580
So let's take a look at how
it does on the four rules.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.510
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So first,
rule one, be true--

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.305
great.

00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:51.460
It starts out, it's just him
in a parking lot explaining

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.650
what he's going to do.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.275
There's no set.

00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:54.680
There's no studio.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.790
I think it's just on the
hood of his car.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.220
And that tells us immediately
we're seeing something real.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.830
And then he begins to explain
what he's going to do.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.850
And he explains the prank.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.620
Now, pranking someone's
not true.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.530
You're being dishonest
for a moment.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.670
But with us, we're
totally in on it.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:13.250
He's completely authentic, and
it's clear to us, also, that

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.780
he's being straight with us.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.990
So high marks there, as well.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.290
And then there's the seat.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.000
He shows us exactly
how it's made.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.730
It's just cardboard covered
with fabric.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.080
And it's not very good.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.890
It looks like cardboard
covered with fabric.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.350
But it's good enough.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.260
And he knows that.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.920
And he knows that in the
lighting, and the setting that

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.820
he's going to be doing
it, it will work.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.400
But for us to see that lousy
cardboard and duct

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.840
tape back is great.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.030
That lack of polish helps all
of the audience realize--

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.700
this is for real.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.780
This is really happening.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.060
The shinier it is, and the more
polished it is, you begin

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.970
to get into areas where people
may not trust you.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.890
So showing us that mediocre car
seat costume really helped

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.160
with the truth of it all.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.770
And then, for the rest of the
video, he shows us what Allen

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.110
Funt, who was the creator of
"Candid Camera," who invented

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.210
this kind of entertainment back
in the '40s, with radio,

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.200
called people in the act
of being themselves.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.310
So it's just real reaction
after real

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.500
reaction after real reaction.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.570
And it's there that he really
hits it out of the park.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.710
So very true, very high marks
on rule number one.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.680
FRITZ GROBE: And rule number
two, don't waste my time--

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.800
again, he does very,
very well.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.370
It's basically just setup,
punchline, punchline,

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.645
punchline, punchline.

00:30:35.645 --> 00:30:37.490
Its very, very simple.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:43.260
The structure of sideshow
is set-up and pay-off.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.050
You need just enough set-up so
that you understand what

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.830
you're about to see.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.140
If you don't understand that
the sword is real, then it

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.350
doesn't make the sword
swallowing as real.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:00.080
So what he does here is just
say, I'm going up to a

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.940
drive-through.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.980
Here's my costume.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.950
Here we go.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.100
And then its punchline,
punchline, punchline--

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.230
really, really good.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.810
A word about the edits,
about the cuts.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.380
So he goes from one reaction
clip to another.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:21.230
And with rule number one, be
true, your goal, ideally, is

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:26.700
one, un-interrupted shot so that
you maximize the feeling

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.300
that you're just there.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.780
And every cut pulls
us away from that

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.920
feeling, ever so slightly.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.500
But here the cuts are
to save us time.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.130
We don't need to watch
him driving from one

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.620
restaurant to the other.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.160
You want to give us nothing
but the money shot.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.950
So that's where rule number
one, be true, actually

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.160
competes with don't
waste my time.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.620
And he uses edits, like we
sometimes do in our videos,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.310
just to keep moving from one
money shot to the next.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.430
So that's what he does.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.980
And he does it very well.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.460
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Rule three,
be unforgettable.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.480
This is usually the toughest
one, and the most important.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.420
And here it's really
interesting, because we've all

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.250
seen a magician be
invisible before.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.830
That's not new.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:18.470
And in fact, the idea even of an
invisible driver isn't new.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.180
There was a photo that
went viral a couple

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.566
years ago with this.

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:25.490
You can see the hands
at the bottom.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.850
So even that wasn't new.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.980
But what Rahat does that is
really unforgettable is he

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.270
gives us those human
reactions.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.500
Those people are actually
experiencing something

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:36.860
unforgettable.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.270
None of those people we saw in
the video are ever going to

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.440
forget the time they went to
hand the brownie to the person

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.530
in the car, and there
was nobody there.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.310
And we get to see that.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.100
So he shows us moment after
moment after moment of people

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.080
having an unforgettable
experience and experiencing

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.540
that surreal reality that he
puts in front of them.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.260
What's that one woman say,
am I tripping, son?

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.990
It's like, that's the
world we get to see.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.490
And we get to be part of that.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.450
So on unforgettable, even though
he takes something

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.340
we've all seen before, a
magician being invisible, he

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.390
really hits it out of the park
by showing us the reactions of

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.820
people to what he's got.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.540
FRITZ GROBE: And that is a
direct line into, ultimately,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.250
it's all about humanity.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.770
This video just shows us the
fun reactions, the funny

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.590
reactions, just that awesome
humanity that we get to relate

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:28.550
to on screen that's so
incredibly powerful.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.270
So this video does really
well on all four rules.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.590
It's no surprise it's gotten 30
million views in the last

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.500
couple weeks.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.240
It's doing very well.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.260
So with viral video, the
bottom line is this--

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.350
it's about connecting
with people.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.120
And that's what "The Viral Video
Manifesto" is really all

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.366
about, connecting with people.

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:56.010
STEPHEN VOLTZ: And the ways to
connect with people haven't

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.480
changed for thousands
of years--

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.970
be yourself, don't waste my
time, show us something we've

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.830
never seen before,
and be authentic.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.060
FRITZ GROBE: Everyone has the
tools in front of them now.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.230
Anyone can go out and capture
those moments of simple,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.350
unforgettable humanity.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:23.090
All you need today is a cell
phone and a YouTube account.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.954
So thank you guys very much.

00:34:24.954 --> 00:34:27.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.690
FRITZ GROBE: And I think we have
some time for questions.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.221
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering
if there's anything you

00:34:34.221 --> 00:34:36.966
could-- so there's all these
positive things you can do to

00:34:36.966 --> 00:34:37.489
make a viral video.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.049
Are there also, like, opposite
things, or additional things

00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:42.610
that you can do to make
sure that your video

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.080
would never go viral?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.710
Mistakes that you could make,
that even if you did these

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.790
four things, that would prevent
your video from being

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.080
successful.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.010
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I think so.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.690
I think those are the flip-side
of a lot of stuff

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.770
we've talked about.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.190
So add a lot of story.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.910
Story doesn't go viral.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.840
Story is what makes every other
kind of film and video

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.190
work, but it doesn't get people
leaning forward and

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.620
telling their friends.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.250
A lot of edits and a lot of cuts
remove people from the

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.380
feeling that they're really
there in that moment, which is

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.520
why the goal, the golden
chalice, is that one

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.270
uninterrupted shot.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.150
Like, OK Go does that a lot, and
the wedding videos do it.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.730
All the Charlie Bit My Finger
videos are all uninterrupted.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.090
So the more you want to chop it
up, and edit it, and change

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.850
perspective, the more
people are going to

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.020
withdraw from that.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.250
FRITZ GROBE: But I think what
we've found is that the videos

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:33.720
that stay closest to these four
rules quite consistently

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.590
do go viral.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.670
There are videos like little
Darth Vader, for instance,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.750
that isn't true.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:44.550
It's all staged.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.690
It's all acted.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:49.175
But it's so unforgettable.

00:35:49.175 --> 00:35:52.620
I mean, it's staggering to see
this little kid trying to use

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.350
the force, is something you've
never ever seen before.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:01.890
But then imagine if,
by some miracle--

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.220
well, it could actually even
be done as a little prank.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:10.050
Imagine a dad actually
pranking his son.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.130
STEPHEN VOLTZ: If all that
Little Darth Vader was

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.750
actually shot on a cell phone
camera by some dad who did it.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.840
FRITZ GROBE: Who goes, I'm going
to start the car right

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.190
when he goes like that,
and it's set up

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.850
like invisible driver.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.180
That video would be even more
powerful because it would have

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.980
that truth.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.180
STEPHEN VOLTZ: The other thing,
if you want to kill

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.500
your video, if you're hoping
it will go viral--

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.060
product shots.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.850
Death.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.720
Instant death.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.130
I mean, we work with a lot of
brands, and we're constantly

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.530
fighting internal battles about,
we need to get their

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.380
brand in there where
it can be seen.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.730
But man, if you have one whiff
of this is a commercial, it's

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.800
really hard.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.630
FRITZ GROBE: Yeah.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:52.400
Actually, way back in 2006,
2007, I was literally watching

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.700
this video going, oh, this is
great, I've got to tell Steve

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.230
about this.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.000
Oh, this is awesome.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.850
This is going to be so cool.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.635
And it's all this crazy,
weird stuff.

00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:03.056
And then right in the middle
of it, it's like--

00:37:03.056 --> 00:37:04.435
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Ding.

00:37:04.435 --> 00:37:05.855
FRITZ GROBE: And I was
like, oh, screw it.

00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:06.740
Next.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.180
It was this instant--

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.060
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So then
he sent it to me

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.910
just as a bad example.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.650
It's like, look how
they ruined this.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.000
And actually, that stuck in our
memory because it was such

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.195
a puncturing of all
the expectations.

00:37:16.195 --> 00:37:19.140
FRITZ GROBE: Well, you go from
that active positive emotion.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.520
You go from that, like, oh,
I've got to tell somebody

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.000
about this.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.680
This is so--

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.600
oh.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.260
Well, that was stupid.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.270
So--

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.020
STEPHEN VOLTZ: It's
all be true.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.075
On the other hand, speaking of
be true and putting product

00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:34.830
shots in, the Will It Blend guy,
there's no question of

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.250
what he's doing.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.830
He's got his blender there,
and his brand's in the

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:37.730
background.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.940
And if he's got a blender that
powerful, after a while, I

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.890
kind of want to know
what the brand is.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.450
But he doesn't go, and now
another commercial from--

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.830
FRITZ GROBE: Blendtec.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.960
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Blendtec.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.900
He just does it, and it's
integrated really nicely.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.940
But if you have product
shots--

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.825
if you had to give me one secret
weapon to kill a video,

00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:58.340
that's what I would use.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.070
Thanks, good question.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
mentioning the whole product

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.330
shots thing.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:06.380
There was a viral video last
year of Beckham kicking a

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.210
soccer ball into the stands.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.700
And although it wasn't like,
he never held up the Pepsi

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.332
can, he was clearly holding
a Pepsi can

00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:12.625
through the whole thing.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:14.740
And just seeing that was enough
to know that this whole

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.660
thing was staged.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:23.570
Actually what I want to ask
about was, on YouTube now, our

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.680
major focus now is on trying
to get people to come here

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.080
every day to watch their
favorite channels.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.590
And obviously, building a
sustained audience is very

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.452
different from having one
thing that goes viral.

00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:39.560
And a lot of what we've seen
here are by creators who maybe

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.520
created one thing, and it got
huge, and then no one ever saw

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.790
them again, never even thought
to go back and learn more

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.910
about this creator.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:51.940
So how does this fit with a
programming strategy that

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.060
somebody who wants to have a
sustained audience coming back

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.520
and watching them every week?

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.550
FRITZ GROBE: Right, right.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:03.350
So when you want a sustained
audience, you've gotta produce

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.180
regular content.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.010
You've just gotta keep
cranking stuff out.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.710
And that makes it really
difficult to be unforgettable,

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.810
in particular, because the
pressure's on you to be

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.110
unforgettable, what,
every day?

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.670
Every week?

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.930
It's like, no.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.420
But you can be fun, you can be
good, you can be solid every

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.770
day or every week.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:29.220
But if you can stick to these
principles and instill that

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.180
active, positive emotion, then
as you produce your regular

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.440
content and build
your following,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.310
then you can see spikes.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.570
STEPHEN VOLTZ: The thing that
takes time, the thing that

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.850
takes budget, just because
it takes time, is the

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.250
unforgettable piece of it.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:47.020
But all the rest of
the stuff is also

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.510
important and powerful.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.440
And the question is actually
something we're struggling

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.720
with now because we've had a
career so far, of the last six

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.840
and a half years of
these big spikes.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.720
And then we disappear and
write books and do other

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.040
things, and then we give
another spike.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.930
And we're beginning to think
about, well, we need to build

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.380
our YouTube channel, actually,
and get people coming back.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.240
And so we're looking to do
interesting cool stuff that's

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.296
not, oh my god, unforgettable,
in between what are going to

00:40:11.296 --> 00:40:12.740
be like, we hope, the
tent poles, and

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.850
sort of build an audience.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.120
And ideally, we'll go along,
so we have a spike.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.890
And some people will stay and
see our regular stuff.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.680
And then we'll get
another spike.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.950
And maybe we'll get more people
to stay, and we get

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.110
another spike with another
spectacular, we call them, and

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.720
build it that way.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.340
But I think you need the time
to get that unforgettable

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.030
stuff, or you need to
be really lucky.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.760
But in between that, there's a
lot of stuff that you guys

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.480
probably understand better than
we do about just building

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.270
regular audience.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:42.350
FRITZ GROBE: And I find, with
some of my favorite recurring

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.360
creators, people I go
back to a lot--

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.756
I really like My
Drunk Kitchen.

00:40:48.756 --> 00:40:50.500
She's awesome.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.370
And so she's really true.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.310
She just has this way--

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.240
there's no pretense.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.450
This is it's not all
glitz and glamour.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.490
And it's not perfect.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:05.730
It's her.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.170
You get to see who
she really is.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.680
It's true.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.660
It has that humanity.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.850
And again, it keeps
it efficient.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.410
It is edited to give you the
punchlines, to give you

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.720
minimal set-up, punchline,
set-up, punchline.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.850
So while those edits do pull
us away a little bit, they

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.720
also keep from wasting
our time.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.980
So then, every once in awhile,
an episode of something like

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.500
My Drunk Kitchen comes along
that I'm like, oh my god, that

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.270
was so good, I've gotta share
that with my friends.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.700
And then I'll come back to
watching it, and watching it,

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.180
and then go, oh my god,
I've gotta tell

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.156
people about this one.

00:41:46.156 --> 00:41:48.540
STEPHEN VOLTZ: The last thing
I tag that with is, some of

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.790
the people who've been the
biggest successes in TV have

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.500
followed a lot of these rules,
because they're themselves.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.320
So Johnny Carson.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.380
And Ellen is really great.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.340
She's Ellen.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.590
You turn around, it's
like, that's who

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.820
you get all the time.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.520
She really is who--

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.540
what you see is who she is.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.720
We actually did the show, and
she's just like that.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.050
She's super nice.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.225
And letting that come
through, Tom

00:42:13.225 --> 00:42:14.090
Bergeron is another example.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.390
He's just a really good host
because he just is under

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.610
control, and he has
a good time, and--

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:21.420
FRITZ GROBE: One of the fun
things about Tom Bergeron is

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.655
that he came from the same
performing arts school in

00:42:23.655 --> 00:42:25.700
Maine that we went to.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:31.970
And that has encouraged this
kind of, be true, cut through

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.530
all of the tricks and the flash
and just be yourself.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:34.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.440
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So subtract out
the unforgettable, and those

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.560
personalities are, in large
part, really powerful, I

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.890
think, because they let
themselves be who they are.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:42.540
And that's--

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.550
AUDIENCE: What about
Stephen Colbert?

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.160
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I think that's
a great question.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.270
I think Stephen Colbert is
saying, let's play this game.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.230
I'm Stephen Colbert, and now
I'm going to pretend to be

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.230
this guy over here.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.250
And what would he say?

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.940
It's like a party game.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.530
But I think we know who he is.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.350
At least, we know the
game he's playing.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.870
We know that he's
playing a game.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.000
If he was, I'm going to try
and do this completely

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.465
straight, it would be weird.

00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:06.940
I don't know if that
would catch.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.051
AUDIENCE: One is, if you had
to do a viral video with

00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:12.696
everyone in this room,
at this venue, what

00:43:12.696 --> 00:43:14.380
would you come up with?

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.130
And the second question
is, do you ever

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:18.476
get viral video block?

00:43:18.476 --> 00:43:20.480
You know, similar to
writer's block?

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.160
STEPHEN VOLTZ: [LAUGH]

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.640
AUDIENCE: Are you ever stuck,
and can't come up with an

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.461
idea, and do you ever
doubt yourself?

00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:28.260
FRITZ GROBE: Yes.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.200
Absolutely yes.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:38.630
To bite off the second question
first, so when we set

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.640
out to make our second video,
which is a sequel to the

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.760
Extreme Coke and Mentos
Experiments, it was called the

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.120
Domino Effect.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.620
And the idea was, it was 250
geysers spread out over a huge

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.730
field in Maine.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:00.040
And we pulled a pin that set off
the first Coke and Mentos

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.380
geyser, that then triggered
the next geyser, that then

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.460
triggered the next in this
giant chain reaction.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.410
That was our second novel.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.820
And it had all of the
second novel agony.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.820
It was so incredibly difficult
to go, all right, we're going

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.740
to try to do this again?

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.230
And it's always daunting.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.360
In particular, the day of
shooting, it was the single

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.210
most difficult day in
our history, because

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.540
literally, it took--

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.390
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I'm
remembering.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.420
FRITZ GROBE: --eight hours
to set everything up.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.710
And so literally, we're
checking everything.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.310
I'm walking along
double-checking everything,

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.900
because if this works,
it works.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.210
If it doesn't work, oh man.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.350
STEPHEN VOLTZ: There
was no other times.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:51.920
We had everyone had come
out to set up.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.953
And then the weather
was getting cold.

00:44:52.953 --> 00:44:54.650
And if we didn't
shoot it then--

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.680
FRITZ GROBE: This was our
chance to get it.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:55.960
STEPHEN VOLTZ: --it
was going to be

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.500
like spring or something.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.210
FRITZ GROBE: And it
was a hot day.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.420
So all the soda has been sitting
out for eight hours

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.700
with little Coke and Mentos
nozzles on top of it.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.790
The soda--

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.510
STEPHEN VOLTZ: So we had a
little tube on top that had

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:11.310
the Mentos inside.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.740
So they're sitting up there, and
you pull a pin, and then

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.380
they'll drop in, and that'll
cause a reaction.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.190
FRITZ GROBE: So the soda's
been evaporating up--

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.810
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Little bits
of it, all afternoon.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.220
FRITZ GROBE: --and condensing
onto the

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:24.170
Mentos inside the tubes.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.040
So at the very last minute,
I had to fix one nozzle.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.490
And I look, and the Mentos
are sticky--

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.070
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Which means they
may be stuck together,

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.250
which means they may not drop.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:39.060
So the entire set-up may
be just stuck together.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.620
FRITZ GROBE: So I walk
over to Stephen as

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.730
we're getting ready--

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:43.500
STEPHEN VOLTZ: And we're like,
we're ready to roll.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.224
FRITZ GROBE: All the cameras are
ready, and I go, just so

00:45:45.224 --> 00:45:47.052
you know, this may not work.

00:45:47.052 --> 00:45:48.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.800
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Let's find out.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.415
Actually, if you look carefully
at that video, you

00:45:52.415 --> 00:45:53.830
can see that conversation
going on.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.540
FRITZ GROBE: Yeah, it's
like, oh boy.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.340
But particularly where
the objective is this

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:05.200
unforgettable, which can feel
so daunting, really, what we

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.420
do is just go, all right, what
are we interested in?

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.600
Right now, we're
playing with--

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.810
can I say?

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.500
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.403
FRITZ GROBE: Right now we're
hanging upside down.

00:46:14.403 --> 00:46:17.340
STEPHEN VOLTZ: That's right.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.770
FRITZ GROBE: And it's just
about, let's explore it.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.110
Let's see what we find.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.250
And then, at a certain
point, we go, yeah, I

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.300
think we found something.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.340
Let's film it and see
what happens.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.860
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I think the issue
for us now is more-- and

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.620
this actually goes to question
about what would we do with

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.020
the people in this room to
make something viral--

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.990
is time.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.160
To get to that unforgettable
stuff, you have to explore

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.190
sticky notes, or Coke and
Mentos geysers, or paper

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.120
clips, or paper airplanes, or
whatever it is that you're

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.830
interested in, really
thoroughly, and go past where

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.670
anyone else has gone before.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.260
And if you're doing sticky
notes, that's easy.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.360
No one's ever done
that before.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.530
So in a couple of weekends, we
were ahead of the whole world

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.980
on sticky note waterfalls.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.640
And then we just needed to
explore it enough so we felt

00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.810
like we had sort of a critical
point of enough content.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.970
And when we're working with
sponsors, in particular,

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.800
they're often time-crunched.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.720
They want something
by March 2.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.270
And that's the difficult part.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.918
But I think if we have time, I
think we've sort of figured

00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:14.310
out our process enough now to
feel like, if we have the

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:16.130
time, we could do it, which is
probably why I don't think we

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.830
could do a viral video
right now with the

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:18.790
people in this room.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:21.060
But if you guys want to come
back every afternoon for six

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.100
weeks, we'll have something.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.740
FRITZ GROBE: We can do it.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.910
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I don't know what
it will be, but we will

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.490
totally have it.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.760
FRITZ GROBE: We live way out
in the woods of Maine in a

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.190
town of about 1,500 people.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.700
And it's really, really helpful
that there's not a

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.570
whole lot to do.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.370
STEPHEN VOLTZ: There's drinking,
which is what a lot

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.530
of the other residents do.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.850
FRITZ GROBE: Where we live
really lends itself to that,

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.120
like, all right, let's spend
the next six months

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.060
exploring how to--

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.790
I mean, building the Coke
and Mentos rocket car.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.060
It took years, in between
everything else.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.352
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Not
solid, but yeah.

00:47:57.352 --> 00:47:57.600
FRITZ GROBE: It took forever.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.720
STEPHEN VOLTZ: From the
idea to when we

00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.620
actually did it, it took.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.700
FRITZ GROBE: From the very
first, like, sitting on a

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.150
skateboard with four geysers.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.330
STEPHEN VOLTZ: You went
about this far.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.580
FRITZ GROBE: Yeah, it was
literally like, [WHOOSH].

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.382
It's all about those
little victories.

00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:15.632
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.160
FRITZ GROBE: If you look online,
there is the Coke and

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.660
Mentos rocket car early
experiments--

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.210
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Which is actually
better, in some ways,

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.540
than the actual Coke and
Mentos rocket car.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.680
FRITZ GROBE: Yeah, you will see
just how pathetic it was.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.935
AUDIENCE: This assumes that the
video speaks for itself,

00:48:33.935 --> 00:48:36.710
and all these four components
are within the video.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:40.380
But for a channel that's just
starting out, how would you,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.885
in this world of curated
content, where would you share

00:48:42.885 --> 00:48:44.112
your video?

00:48:44.112 --> 00:48:45.510
What sort of sites would
you post on?

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.840
Would you share on
other sites?

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.702
Is there a certain
outside-of-the-video virality,

00:48:52.702 --> 00:48:56.150
I guess, rule book.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.880
STEPHEN VOLTZ: I think the
answer is there absolutely is,

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.470
and we ask other people
to help us there.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:04.170
FRITZ GROBE: Yeah, I mean, what
our focus has been on is,

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:09.830
is this "Elements of Style?"
There's all of this knowledge

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.010
that's been gathered for
decades about how

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.810
to make a TV show.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.870
But what is the content?

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.960
How do you make a video
to go viral?

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.490
STEPHEN VOLTZ: But
you're right.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:25.140
When we started, when we put
what we call experiment 137,

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:30.070
our first Coke and Mentos,
online in June of 2006,

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.960
content by itself could
rise to the top.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.566
But really, we told
one person, and

00:49:33.566 --> 00:49:35.110
then it was on fire.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.310
And now there's so much noise
out there, you need to figure

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:43.020
out some strategies to just rise
above the noise and then

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.690
travel on your merits
across the internet.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.540
But rising above the
noise is a project.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.080
FRITZ GROBE: One of the curious
things that we can

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.580
tell you a little bit about
the Coke and Mentos rocket

00:49:51.580 --> 00:50:00.610
car, where what we found
was that it caught

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.830
on amongst car fanatics.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:08.530
And that, in particular, when
we released the second video

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.500
of the Coke and Mentos rocket
car mark two, we were able to

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.460
go, it's a new world record.

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.690
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Ah, that was a
great hook, if you can get a

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:18.146
new world record.

00:50:18.146 --> 00:50:18.995
FRITZ GROBE: Now, we're
the only competition.

00:50:18.995 --> 00:50:19.300
STEPHEN VOLTZ: That's right.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:19.727
[LAUGH]

00:50:19.727 --> 00:50:23.980
FRITZ GROBE: So it wasn't like,
oh, we beat the German

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.640
engineering on this.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.980
It was simply, we built one
that went further than the

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.410
last one we built.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:36.270
But that hook got it into all
kinds of car- and driver-type

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.470
blogs, and magazines,
and things.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:43.930
So we were, along the way,
looking for the places where,

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.650
is this going to appeal to art
people, with sticky notes.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:51.070
Is this going to appeal
to engineers?

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.920
The Coke and Mentos rocket car
ended up taking hold on some

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.860
green websites.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:02.590
Now, it goes about one foot
per liter of fuel.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:08.410
So it's not exactly a
fuel-efficient vehicle.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:09.760
But--

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.530
STEPHEN VOLTZ: But they got a
kick out of it as sort of an

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:12.550
alternative energy hook
to it that got them.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.830
FRITZ GROBE: --as a funny way
to talk about, hey, let's

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.340
think in new ways about
fuel efficiency.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.130
STEPHEN VOLTZ: As a ways that
you guys can take away, if

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.640
you're trying to work on a
project, world records are a

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.790
really good hook.

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.020
That often gets news headlines
and attention that can bring

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.700
you more views.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.890
And if you're doing something
like sticky notes, or paper

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.770
airplanes, or whatever your
thing is, you can set your own

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.320
world record, and then
you can break it.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.810
So it's a plan you can have
going forward, if once you've

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:42.090
become the owner of that little
space, you can then

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.577
start using hooks like world
records to get attention and

00:51:44.577 --> 00:51:46.670
get your video above
the noise.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.530
FRITZ GROBE: So thank
you guys so much.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.710
And we hope you'll visit our
website, and send us emails,

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.210
and Tweet, stuff like that.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.530
We'll see you later.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.010
STEPHEN VOLTZ: Thanks a lot.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.260
FRITZ GROBE: Thanks.
