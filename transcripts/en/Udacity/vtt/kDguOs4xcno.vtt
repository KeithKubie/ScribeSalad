Now, let's discuss WiFi security.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.970
The earlier WiFi security standard is
called Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.260
WEP has been shown to be easily pickable
even when it is correctly configured.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.100
Therefore, you should no longer use WEP.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.530
The new standard is 802.11i,
and it is implemented as WPA2.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.805
WPA stands for WiFi Protected Access II.
