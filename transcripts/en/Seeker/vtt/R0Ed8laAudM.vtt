00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.100
OMG THERE'S AN ASTEROID FLYING BY THE EArrr…

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.630
I have just been informed that happened on
Monday.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.110
But it's STILL COOL!

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.700
astro girls and astro boys

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.020
Last Monday 2004 BL86 made a spectacular flyby
of our planet; it was the closest object to

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.710
pass until 2027 when 1999 AN10 passes inside
the moon's orbit.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.890
We know this because NASA's Near Earth Object
office has a list of everything that's HAS

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.449
or WILL pass close to the Earth from 1900
to 2200.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.710
And just because BL86 was the closest in a
while, doesn't mean it's the only one.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.359
Asteroids ranging in size pass us all the
time.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.549
Most asteroids are not necessarily discovered
by NASA, but by organizations and astronomers

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:55.679
the world over.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.300
BL86 was discovered in 2004 by MIT's Lincoln
Near Earth Asteroid Research lab or LINEAR.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.990
When a Near Earth Object or NEO is discovered,
the discovery is sent to the International

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.340
Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center;
and if they confirm it, they give it a designation

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.390
of a year, and alphanumeric combo.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.990
They measure closeness of these orbits in
two ways, by AU -- or astronomical units,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.829
or LD lunar distances.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.689
An AU is the average distance from the center
of the sun to the center of the Earth, and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.450
LD is average from Earth to the Moon.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.070
BL86 was .0080 astronomical units or 3.1 lunar
distances.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.500
This sounds close, but 2015 BE92 will only
pass .0083 AUs or 3.2 lunar distances TOMORROW

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.299
-- and as you might have guessed from the
designation, 2015 BE92 was only DISCOVERED

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.329
THIS YEAR.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.609
But let's not get into fear-mongering; YES,
there are MILLIONS of asteroids flying around

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.560
out there, and some COULD end our existence.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.049
Through hearty international efforts we've
catalogued 95-percent of all human-extinction

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.440
asteroids -- which are those more than 1 kilometer
wide -- and none of them are going to hit

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
us.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440
None.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.860
But just for fun… what if in that last five
percent we find one that IS going to hit.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.860
What could we do?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.440
It all depends on WHEN we discover it.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.770
The sooner the better.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.030
The more lead-time NASA and other space agencies
have, the better.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.940
As Scott Hubbard said last week, "The reason
dinosaurs went extinct is, they didn't have

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.080
a space program!"

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.260
Aside from sending Bruce Willis, Batman, and
a she-Elf to blow it up; which wouldn't work

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.260
anyway.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.790
You'd have to blow up many bombs over decades
to deflect a massive asteroid.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.720
But there is another way…

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.830
My favorite plan is the gravity tractor...

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.220
With lead time of 20 years, NASA scientists
could construct and launch a craft which then

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.070
parks near an asteroid; then they physics
does the rest.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.570
The gravity of that man-made satellite will
slowly pull the asteroid off it's collision

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.160
course over the period of a year.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And BOOM!

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
We're saved!!

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.475
There are no daring men and women risking
their lives, but there is SCIENCE!

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:06.475
I know, it doesn't sound exciting, but it
is!

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:07.475
We HAVE A PLANNNNN!

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:08.475
Of course, the bigger the asteroid, the larger
the craft or the more lead time we'd need,

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:09.475
right?

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.200
