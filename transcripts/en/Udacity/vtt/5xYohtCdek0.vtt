Alcohol is a teratogen, and you should remember that term from our lesson on

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.090
development. This means that if alcohol is in the system while the woman is

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.533
pregnant it can have serious consequences on the fetus. And one of those

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:17.454
consequences is called fetal alcohol syndrome. Now, fetal alcohol syndrome is a

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:22.418
collection of physical and behavioral abnormality. Some of the diagnostic

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:26.572
criteria for FAS include growth retardation both before and after birth as well

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:32.517
as abnormalities in the face and head. Now, its important to know that there is

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:35.790
no known safe level of alcohol consumption while pregnant.
