Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio, w. N. Y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. I thought we would begin, uh, by looking backwards at a, at a wonderful moment in the history, cinematically of parasites. Here's the cinematic history of parasites. Okay. So do you remember that movie? I'm not going to tell you the name of it. Yeah. Starts out. In fact, I have the script right here. Setting space.

Speaker 2:          00:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:34          okay. Vast empty space script continues to stars shine cold and remote like the love of God. Ooh, you imagining this? Yes. Now floating in that vast nothingness as a tiny dot of a ship, you can barely see it

Speaker 2:          00:52          to the interior of the ship dead. Here we are in a ship full of astronauts who are tired and dirty. Renee will tell you, look dead, no

Speaker 1:          01:02          bouncing around and you just get the feeling. This is a normal day in their astronauts lie until they're on the computer. Radar is a disturbance, some kind of distress. Second transmission here. Yeah. Do you think we're going to check this out so they trace the signal, eventually get into a pod and show me and they find themselves at this abandoned ship. Totally abandoned. It's like a ghost ship. I've never seen anything like it. I knew I hadn't had to crow. It's empty except for these weird eggs and the astronauts are like looking at the eggs and touching the eggs and going, okay, now fast forward. We're back into the first ship. Okay, everything's fine for the most part and then something happens and I want you to, I've got the computer there in front of you. Okay? We'll push this. Push the space bar. Space bar.

Speaker 2:          02:01          All right, you're at the table. Everyone's dressed. The first thing that I get to do when I get to get some decent food, you can dig it, man. Talk to talking, chatting me or having like salad was eating and talking. One of the guys gets a little weird, right? Oh, he's not feeling so good. One of the guys, what are you doing? Oh, now he's coughing, coughing. Don't tell me trouble breathing. He's falling back onto the table. His chest is heaving, his wrist. Oh my gosh. He's kicking his head wildly and he's like flexing all over the table and something. He's like, Oh, Oh God, there's a red thing. I read the horrible sneaky thing. This is of course the classic scene from the original alien movie scene

Speaker 3:          02:59          where the little thing bursts out of the guy's chest and like hisses why did, because I think I figured out why that scene is scary. I mean, when I first saw this movie, that scene went over and over and over in my mind, and it's had this effect on a lot of people and I think I know why. What are, you know, it's not that the little creature is disgusting, which it is. It's that it was there all along. Sitting there. Yeah, inside him, like incubating, waiting to think that you sitting in that seat right there could have in your gut these little worms that are wriggling around doing more or less what that alien was doing and I can't even see them in, you can't even talk about it. So it's not, today's subject on radio lab will be flowers. Even meadows coming up after this

Speaker 4:          03:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:58          no, we're not doing that. We're doing, we're doing that an hour on parasites. These little creatures that live inside us invisibly and yet can have a huge influence over who we think we are. What is a parasite precisely and mature. And just to sort of slide us in, get us into the mood. I'm already not in the mood. We thought we would get things started. Maybe I'll just move this over here. Well there really is no other way to start a show on parasites except with this guy. You should introduce yourself. My name is Carl Zimmer. Carl's is a science writer and parasites have been on his radar ever since. He was a little boy. I grew up on a little farm and my mother would raise tomatoes sometimes in her pensionable garden and sometimes there would be these caterpillars feeding on them. And my mom would be very annoyed and every now and then I would notice that some of them didn't look very well and they had this little sort of fuzzy white bumps on them and I didn't really know what they were.

Speaker 3:          04:53          Well, it turned out that they had been attacked by a parasitic wasp, which had laid its eggs inside of it. Those exit hatched and had become larvae and those larvae were swimming around inside that Caterpillar while I was eating my mother's tomatoes and they were growing, growing inside the caterpillar. And then finally when they were ready, they came out and only then did their host die. And when he finally found out that that is what was happening inside those fuzzy white bumps, profound situation, this whole universe of a baby's growing into adolescence, that's when I guess I sort of got very hooked, which is probably an understatement because you are sort of like capital p parasite man. And if you look, yeah, in the New York Times or science magazine or any of the places, Carl writes, a suspicious number of his articles are pretty flattering to parasites.

Speaker 3:          05:45          People who have been dismissing parasites for a long time, calling them degenerates. Now I would argue that parasites are not degenerate. They have gained the ability to live inside three, four, five, six different species. So do you find that you sort of, you're a lawyer for them. Hey Sir, you call this degenerative. How dare you sir? Say that. I think I'm a defender of all in the collected and put upon species out there. Why wouldn't a parasite the what? I think you mean when you say degenerate because the title thing, it infects something else. It sucks. Whatever. It's not independent. Right? So when you say it's not degenerate [inaudible] what do you say that? Well, let's start with saying it's not independent or any of us independent Kit Carson. How have you stripped all the bacteria out of Kit Carson? Kit Carson would get very sick. Daniel Boone on the other hand, now there's a guy in the pendant alone in the woods.

Speaker 3:          06:36          Daniel Boone eat, I guess Daniel boot eats pigeon like the rest of us. What's your point? Right point is the Daniel Boone eats meat. He ate bread, which came from plants, was the question of degrees. Though we're not living inside the intestinal track of some other creatures, so why does living in side seem like it's a degenerate thing as opposed to us know? We can't even synthesize a lot of our own vitamins anymore where the degenerates in a lot of ways, no code, no com. If you are a creature that lives off someone else's vitality, cheaters would be another way of putting it. But listen, can you appreciate it? I'm going to cut this short right here. Carl says, no, no, no. They're amazing. Time and time again, he says, no, no, no. In the argument went on, still waiting to hear about how you, how you are able to photosynthesize until you answer.

Speaker 3:          07:24          Do it for me, but I go about it in a mental way. You can't even do it yourself. Like I said, the argument went on and on with Roberts saying one thing and Carl firing back and me adding another. Okay, and here's what we're going to do just to be fair and square about this. We're going to bring in an independent moderator. Lolo yourself. Yeah. You're going to be the monitor. Yeah, you'd get that Mike, Right? You're going to be the moderator and a you listening right now. We will leave it to you, your decision and this one lightning round of go ahead. Should I like to do that? Okay. Yeah. Parasites. Are they evil or are they awesome? Starting with number one, that a parasitic wasps, there are probably 200,000 species of parasitic wasps out there. Big Wasp, small ones. They're generally pretty tiny and they go after all sorts of things. Some will lay them in house caterpillars. Spiders are the one Carl's going to tell us about this. This particular wasp is called imp likes. Compressor goes after [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          08:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:25          and for those of you who never thought you'd feel sorry for a caucus,

Speaker 4:          08:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:29          keep listening. So what it does is it [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:33          flies around and it looks for a cockroach. And once it finds that Cock Roche

Speaker 3:          08:40          kid land and then

Speaker 5:          08:42          the fight begins, they tumbled back and forth around, around until finally the wasp somehow manages to arch its back around the body of the cockroach and uh, stings it

Speaker 3:          08:56          right in the belly. The cockroach twitches for a second and then false. The cockroach is paralyzed. Now the wasp takes its time. Repositions itself puts its butt up right near the cockroaches head

Speaker 2:          09:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:11          and delivers a second stink. The Stinger actually threads its way to a particular spot in the brain. And this does something odd. Moments later the cockroach recovers of stands up. I can walk again, but something is wrong, very wrong. It just stands there

Speaker 6:          09:30          like a week.

Speaker 3:          09:32          It can't run away. Move. It has essentially lost its will. What does that mean? Uh, it's,

Speaker 5:          09:39          yes, it is a puppet. It's become a Zombie basically. And so now the wasp will literally grab onto the cockroaches antenna and start pulling on it. How does it grab with, what does it grin? I plead with its mouth. Imagine tiny wasp guiding a cockroach across the desert floor, like a dog on a elite. And so it leads it down, down, down, down into a little borough it's made and the cockroach says, okay, whenever you want to go. Then

Speaker 3:          10:15          once the wasp has the Roach in the borough lays its eggs on the underside of the cockroach. Tonight you've got this drugged roach sitting on top of some wasp bags and then the wasp goes out and it seals the borough. It buries the cockroach alive. Well, it's a shell. It's in a little chamber. It doesn't want to kill the cockroach because this, the cockroach is gonna feed. It's, you know, it's young. Yeah. So then the eggs hatch and then they drill inside. The cockroach is still just sitting there. How's it staying alive at this point? What parasites are very careful, you know, they won't eat vital organs that will kill it. Instead, Carl says they just feast on the extra stuff. There's a lot of stuff inside of a cockroach, a lot of fluid just floating around. It's of Wonderbread essence of skin, old hair, and you can just feed on any, the host stays alive. Wow. And then what happens? Eventually a little baby wasp larva grows up inside the cockroach and develops into an adult. And then one day in the wash eats its way up a little hole out of the, out of the cockroaches body shakes off its wings and flies off, and then the Roche dies, then the roach dies. Why only then? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:35          that to me sounds like of the purest description in nature of evil that I can imagine. Wouldn't you agree? Well, Darwin certainly said that God should not be personally blamed for having created parasitic wasps.

Speaker 2:          11:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:56          but if you ask Carl, he'll have you think about that moment. The moment where the wasp stings, the brain parasitic wasp can attack a cockroach and inserted Stinger into one specific part of the cockroaches brain and inject a precise little cocktail of drugs that then turns the cockroach into it. Slave. I know that that Wasp didn't get a phd in neurobiology and yet it has performed a kind of brain surgery very precisely in a very elegant way. Uh, or evil might be the other way. [inaudible] go. Go ahead. But there's a complexity there that you can't deny

Speaker 2:          12:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          12:37          or can you, we leave it

Speaker 3:          12:39          to you bringing us to example number two, parasitic mean to food. I mean, here's, here's a another example that I actually was looking at today. Can you holding your computer up to the glass and on the screen is a big black and it looks like it's carrying a cherry, right? A Cherry. That's about twice the size of the ant. That Red Cherry is actually parasites inside of the aunt making it look like a red cherry. What part of the aunt is that? Is that it's bought essentially? Yeah. Wait a second. Is it, it looks like it's sticking. It's big red button up into the air. Yeah. Their behavior is changed or they, they waggle around their, their, their tail as it were. Now. Why on earth would a parasite turn on ants but red and then make it stick? It's bought up into the air. Well, let's say you put an ant down.

Speaker 3:          13:30          It has this bright red from your end and an ordinary and in front of a bird. Birds can go for that red and very quickly because it thinks it's a berry. Yeah, and then what? It's going to swallow this little package full of nematode eggs. So that's the way the nematode eggs get into the sky. They buy their airplane tickets by advertising themselves as berries. Yes. What's the benefit of being in the air? Well, the only place that this parasite can reproduce is inside the bird. And how better to spread your seed? Far and wide, the drop from the sky

Speaker 7:          14:05          with the birch droppings. That is brilliant. That's brilliant. I mean, look at the [inaudible] that it's red.

Speaker 3:          14:12          It's up in the air. Yeah. Is it amazing? It's like how can a stupid little thing be so brilliant? Because they're not degenerates, but they're still cheating. And then just to bring his point home, just to pick a common one. Carl offered up his third and final example. Number three, blood flukes. Blood flukes are, um, related to flatworms tapeworms. So their eggs start out in the water,

Speaker 3:          14:45          fresh water in Africa, Asia, parts of South America. And the first part of their life, they go into a snail and come back out into the water and they're swimming around and they start looking for a human. So imagine a foot going into the shallow end of the pot. I see toes, I see bottom of foot, I see ankle. Well, if you're a blood fluke, you don't see anything. You don't have eyes. But eventually you find a foot, secrete a little enzyme, basically turn a little bit of skin into butter and you slip into the vein and now

Speaker 5:          15:19          you're going to swim my circulatory system. Sure you're going to ride along in the blood. And now it's time to find a mate, a mate. So their sex. So there's a male and female. So what you're saying, sure. They're animals. They're animals. I would have never called them animals. It's interesting you say that. That's a whole nother topic I guess so. All right. So the female is very thin, literally have a standard issue where I'm kind of thing, but the male is very strange. It's, it's kind of like like a canoe. It's gotta be trough down in the middle. Uh, and at one end it's got a giant sucker. Should we urge some of our listeners to tune away at this point because, but it's about to happen. May Not be acceptable in family hour. Um, actually blood flukes are, are fairly monogamous and loyal.

Speaker 5:          16:07          So you know, if you're looking for or for animals to reinforce your family values, blood flukes pretty good. And eventually two blood flukes find their way toward each other and the male does this sort of court ship or whatever reason the female says, yes, I accept your courtship. The female joined, the male fits in the trough. Oh, so it's like a groove. The female goes and occupies the groove right now this isn't just, this isn't mating. This is way beyond meeting. The males will feed the female for starters, and they will stay this way for a long, long time. Really? Yeah. Like days, years. Years, years. Yeah. Oh my God. Years in human or years to them. Just years. Years, years. Years. Years. Like the earth going around the sun kind of years. Yes. In fact, there've been cases where people show up at their doctor's feeling awful and the doctor does some tests and says, oh, you've got blood flips.

Speaker 5:          17:06          No, you had to have been in Africa to get this disease. When have you been in Africa? And the person said 40 years ago, 44 zero 40 years ago. Yeah. And the reason that they're getting sick is that these male and female blood flukes are still together making eggs. And Carl's literally glowing when he says this. I have to admit, I do love the thought that parasites are among the most monogamous animals on the planet. It's heaven. I mean, you're going to spend the rest of your life together. And so our story concludes that the image of two blood flukes

Speaker 3:          17:49          in your veins for nearly half a century got hand to him. He's good. Carl, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. And there is a a species of take part that's going to be named after me. No kidding. Wow. It's not quite as much of an honors do you think? At first I was talking with the Paris autologist and she was telling her fellow expert about how she was going to name one for me and then they got into a conversation about, you know, that was good that you named that particular tape form for him because he's kind of thin and it's kind of a thin day for him. You know, my aunt is, she's, she's a little round and it's a kind of a round table of nine named her after and you just suddenly discover there are a lot of tapeworms to be named. How many is a lot. I mean tens of thousands of species of tapeworms. Wow. So they got us beat many times over. I once a estimates that if you took all the viruses in the ocean and you stuck them into end, how far would it go? And, um, it was many light years, way beyond our galactic neighborhood. They other ones there more cheats than there are honest people. Honest creatures on earth. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:20          we should go to Brackney. Same. And I think we can, thanks to Lulu Miller and of course Carl Zimmer, who has written many books, including parasite rex, a book we shamelessly parasitized for the making of the previous segment. Also want to encourage you to go to our website where you can find pictures of the, uh, the blood fluke spooning the ant with swollen red button. And of course the a wasp with the cockroach, Letcher porn, and it's all yours. It radiolab.org
