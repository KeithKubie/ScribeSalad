00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.580
Under Jewish dietary laws (called kashrut),
eating pork in any form is strictly forbidden.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.150
Jesus Christ was Jewish.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.509
So why, on the anniversary of his resurrection,
do people traditionally serve ham?

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.390
You’ll often read it’s because ham is
supposedly a “Christian” meat, able to

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.850
be consumed by Christians but not certain
other prominent religious groups.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.320
However, the real reason is simply because
it’s in season.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.670
While modern food storage techniques and supermarkets
with efficient and worldwide supply chains

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.100
shield us from this fact somewhat, like fruits
and vegetables, different meats also have

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.300
seasons, and these depend on a variety of
factors including what the animals were eating

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.010
and when, where they were in their growth
cycle, and the availability (or lack) of refrigeration.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.439
With pigs and cows, before refrigeration,
it simply made sense to slaughter them in

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.439
the fall.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.940
Since it takes a fair amount of time to butcher
a beast as large as a hog or steer, the cold

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.330
temperatures helped keep the meat from going
bad before it could be properly prepared.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.380
Another consideration was taste.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.740
Shortly before slaughter in the fall, hogs
would be fed things like apples and acorns

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.970
that would greatly improve the flavor of the
meat they would ultimately provide.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.410
As one specialty pork producer noted:

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.140
The tradition of acorn-fed pork goes back
millennia . . . . The oak nut was a diet staple

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.610
because the pigs roamed and rooted about for
acorns in the forests of Italy and Spain.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.360
An acorn diet is today best known as what
makes the prized and pricey Jamón Ibérico

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.490
of Spain so succulent.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.400
Butchered in the fall, most hams were prepared
and allowed to properly cure over the winter

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.350
to further develop their flavor.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.790
This was a particularly important food source
this time of year in some parts of the world

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.540
where the rest of the stored meat would have
already been eaten, with little other meat

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.510
of any real quality available.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.070
This was the case in North America where the
other traditional spring meat, lamb, was (and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.409
still is) less in vogue, which is also why
eating ham on Easter in North America is much

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.000
more popular than other regions where Easter
is celebrated.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.270
Conversely, in Europe, lamb is commonly served
at Easter, and the tradition actually traces

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.549
its origins to Jewish Passover feasts.

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.010
This is also certainly fitting for Easter,
with Jesus as the “lamb of God.”

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.080
Born shortly before the holiday, young lamb
may be slaughtered within 6 to 8 weeks, and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.310
thus offer a fresh, as opposed to cured, option
for Easter protein when historically other

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.090
such protein sources were scarce at this time
of year.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.530
Eggs are popular at Easter, at least in part
due to the fact that spring is the peak season

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.620
for their production.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.790
As a result, eggs have been a part of spring
celebrations since long before Easter was

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.010
a thing; for example, decorated eggs have
been a part of the Iranian New Year, Nowruz,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.270
(observed on the spring equinox) for millennia.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.860
In addition to the refrigeration factor, like
pigs, cows are also thought to be tastier

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.270
when slaughtered in the fall.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.170
This is due apparently to the fact that “the
frost has killed flies and sweetened the grass

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.819
[so the] cows are more comfortable.”

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.250
Among other things, cows slaughtered when
fatigued or in distress also negatively impacts

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.240
the shelf life of the meat.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.940
Turkey is also tastiest in the fall because,
as the weather cools and the days shorten,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.010
their hormone levels shift and they fatten
up.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.890
On the other hand, since most chicken eggs
are laid in the spring, those that are allowed

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:40.650
to grow into chickens are traditionally slaughtered
in

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.420
the summer.
