00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:10.221
Would you like to know 
what's in our future?

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:14.724
What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now?

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.276
Well, you're not alone.

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:20.620
Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.285
and they all employ people
called futurists

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:26.163
who attempt to forecast the future.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:29.120
Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.790
In the middle of the 20th century,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.402
a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.459
consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.945
who together forecast 
many of the technologies

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.136
we take for granted today,

00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:42.575
including artificial organs,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.532
the use of birth control pills,

00:00:44.532 --> 00:00:49.333
and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.288
One way futurists arrive
at their predictions

00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:55.961
is by analyzing movements and trends
in society,

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.605
and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:01.852
with varying degrees of probability.

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:06.522
Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders,

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:09.324
enabling them to weigh 
options for the future

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:13.758
that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail.

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:18.495
Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.131
There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.805
which would make no sense
to anyone in the present.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:25.831
Imagine, for example,

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:30.426
transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.142
into the 21st.

00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:37.774
You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235,

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:42.215
that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city,

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:45.463
or destroy it one fell swoop.

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:48.911
"How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know.

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.064
"That's not science, that's magic."

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.995
And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.728
His 19th century grasp of science

00:01:55.728 --> 00:02:00.021
includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics.

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:04.108
In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays,

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:05.582
or the atom bomb,

00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:07.420
let alone the theory of relativity

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.504
or quantum mechanics.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.037
As Arthur C. Clarke has said,

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:15.754
"Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic."

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:19.842
How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:23.674
as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century?

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:27.695
We may think our modern technology
and advanced data analysis techniques

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:31.167
might allow us to predict the future
with much more accuracy

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.492
than our 19th century counterpart,

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:34.971
and rightly so.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.058
However, it's also true that our 
technological progress

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:43.376
has brought with it new increasingly 
complex and unpredictable challenges.

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:47.491
The stakes for future generations to
be able to imagine the unimaginable

00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.682
are higher than ever before.

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:51.348
So the question remains:

00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:53.091
how do we do that?

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.796
One promising answer has actually been
with us since the 19th century

00:02:56.796 --> 00:02:58.760
and the Industrial Revolution

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.525
that laid the foundation 
for our modern world.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.326
During this time of explosive development
and invention,

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:08.992
a new form of literature, science fiction,
also emerged.

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:12.918
Inspired by the innovations of the day,
Jules Verne, H.G. Wells,

00:03:12.918 --> 00:03:16.784
and other prolific thinkers explored
fantastic scenarios,

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:19.552
depicting new frontiers of human endeavor.

00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:22.418
And throughout the 20th century
and into the 21st,

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:26.211
storytellers have continued to share their
visions of the future

00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:31.338
and correctly predicted many aspects
of the world we inhabit decades later.

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:32.799
In "Brave New World,"

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.217
Aldous Huxley foretold 
the use of antidepressants in 1932,

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.310
long before such medication 
became popular.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.971
In 1953, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
forecast earbuds,

00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.293
"thimble radios," in his words.

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:50.997
And in "2001: A Space Odyssey,"

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:58.076
Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,
flat-screen news pad in 1968.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:01.524
In works that often combine entertainment
and social commentary,

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:05.418
we are invited to suspend our disbelief
and consider the consequences

00:04:05.418 --> 00:04:10.628
of radical shifts in familiar 
and deeply engrained institutions.

00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:11.497
In this sense,

00:04:11.497 --> 00:04:15.882
the best science fiction fulfills 
the words of philosopher Michel Foucault,

00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:20.867
"I'm no prophet. My job is making windows
where there were once walls."

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:25.699
Free from the constraints of the present
and our assumptions of what's impossible,

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.466
science fiction serves as a useful tool
for thinking outside of the box.

00:04:30.466 --> 00:04:32.331
Many futurists recognize this,

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.452
and some are beginning to employ
science fictions writers in their teams.

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:40.765
Just recently, a project called iKnow
proposed scenarios

00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.464
that look much 
like science fiction stories.

00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:45.941
They include the discovery of
an alien civilization,

00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:50.352
development of a way for humans
and animals to communicate flawlessly,

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:52.921
and radical life extension.

00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.116
So, what does the future hold?

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:57.210
Of course, we can't know for certain,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.808
but science fiction 
shows us many possibilities.

00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:02.781
Ultimately, it is our responsibility

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:06.084
to determine which 
we will work towards making a reality.
