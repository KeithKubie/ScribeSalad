00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.050
- [Voiceover] Try to evaluate
the following integral.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.618
So assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:06.930
so let's work through this together.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.353
And if at any point you get inspired,

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:09.907
always feel free to pause the video

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:12.851
and continue on with it on your own.

00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:14.417
So the first thing that
might have jumped out at you

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:15.859
we have a rational expression.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.843
The degree in the numerator is the same as

00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:19.410
the degree in the nominator,
so maybe a little bit

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.007
of algebraic long division is called for.

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:23.171
So let's do that.

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:28.171
Let's take X-squared minus one

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:32.516
and divide it into X-squared,
put that in a different color,

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:36.805
divide it into X-squared
plus X minus five.

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:41.805
So X-squared plus X minus five.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.020
And so let's look at
the highest degree terms

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.404
how many times does
X-squared go into X-squared?

00:00:46.404 --> 00:00:49.593
It goes one time, let me
write this in a new color.

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:50.405
Goes one time.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.405
One times X-squared minus
one is just going to be

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.445
X-squared minus one.

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:57.477
Now you subtract this
green expression from

00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:00.372
this mauve expression or I could just add

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.276
the negative on it, so let me just take

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.156
the negative of it.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:06.214
So it's going to be
negative X-squared plus one

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:09.959
and we're going to get the X-squared's

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.575
X-square minus X-square is zero,

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:13.751
so those cancel out and
we're going to be left with

00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:18.751
X and the negative five
plus one is negative four.

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:22.630
So we have X minus four left over.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.771
So we can rewrite the
expression that we're trying to

00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:27.324
find the antiderivative of.

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:32.324
We can rewrite it as one plus X minus four

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:43.248
over X-squared minus one.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:45.192
Maybe I'll do that in that purple color

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:47.927
since I already used it as the purple.

00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:50.663
Over X-squared minus one.

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:53.915
So we did one thing, now
we have a lower degree

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.406
in the numerator than we
have in the denominator.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:57.928
And obviously this is
fairly straight forward,

00:01:57.928 --> 00:01:59.176
take the antiderivative of,

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.500
but what do we do now?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.905
It's not clear if we look
at X-squared minus one

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:06.906
it's derivative would be two-X,

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.715
which is the same degree as this,

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:10.635
but it's not X minus four,
so it doesn't look like

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:13.845
you u-substitution it's
going to help us with this.

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:15.957
So what can we do now?

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:18.258
Now we can take out another tool in our

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:22.042
algebraic tool kit, we will do

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.626
partial fraction expansion.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.241
Which is essentially
writing this as the sum

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:28.855
of two rational expressions that have

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.721
a lower degree in the denominator.

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:32.352
So what do I mean by that?

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.226
So this term right over here,

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.016
X minus four over X-squared minus one,

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.001
we can rewrite that as

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.545
X minus four over, instead
of X-squared minus one,

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.539
we can factor this.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.353
This is X plus one times X minus one.

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:47.457
So let's write that,

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:51.728
this is X plus one times X minus one.

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:53.503
When we think about
partial fraction expansion

00:02:53.503 --> 00:02:55.360
we say okay, can we write this as the sum

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.360
of something, let's call
that A, over X plus one,

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.350
plus something else, let's call that B,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.063
plus B over X minus one.

00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:15.807
Can we do that?

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:18.144
And to attempt to do
that, if we had just add

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:21.120
these two things, what would we get?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.456
Well we would find a common denominator,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:26.048
which would be X plus
one times X minus one,

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:29.310
and so you would have, if
any of this looks unfamiliar

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.975
I encourage you to review the videos

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:33.022
on partial fraction
expansion, because that's

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.745
exactly what we're doing right over here.

00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:38.416
But this would be equal to
if you were to add the two

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:41.280
your common denominator
would be the product.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
So it would be X plus
one times X minus one.

00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:53.309
So the first term I would
multiply the numerator

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.426
and the denominator times X minus one.

00:03:55.426 --> 00:04:00.426
So it would be A times X minus one

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.984
plus B, the second term I'll multiply the

00:04:03.984 --> 00:04:08.984
numerator and the
denominator times X plus one.

00:04:09.554 --> 00:04:10.790
And so what do we get?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.790
This is going to be equal to AX,

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.523
maybe I'll do this all in one color.

00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:22.571
This is going to be equal to

00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.571
AX minus A plus BX plus B

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:38.483
and then all of that
over this stuff we keep

00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:39.682
writing over and over again.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:41.937
Actually, let me just copy and paste this.

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:46.937
So copy and paste, I can use
that over and over again.

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:51.058
So we have that over that.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:54.754
So let's see, now we
can group the X terms.

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:59.754
So we can rewrite this as,
so if we take AX plus BX

00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:06.825
that's going to be A plus B times X.

00:05:07.445 --> 00:05:12.445
Then we have a negative A and a B.

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:17.652
So plus B minus A, and I'll
just put parenthesis around that

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:21.333
just so I kind of group
these constant terms.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:24.437
Then all of that's going to be divided by,

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:25.943
good thing I copied and pasted that,

00:05:25.943 --> 00:05:29.445
X plus one times X minus one.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:33.824
So now this is the crux of
partial fraction expansion.

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:35.668
We say, okay we kind of went through this

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.101
whole exercise on the thesis
that we could do this,

00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:40.868
that there is some A and
B for which this is true.

00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:43.685
So if there is some A and
B for which this is true,

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:45.847
then A plus B must be the coefficient

00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:48.340
of the X term right over here.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.594
So A plus B must be equal to one,

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:53.396
must be equal to this coefficient.

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:56.852
And B minus A must be
equal to the constant,

00:05:56.852 --> 00:05:59.095
must be equal to negative four.

00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:01.061
Or if they are then we
will found an A and a B,

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.265
so let's do that.

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.581
I'll do it up here since I have
a little bit of real estate.

00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.581
A plus B is going to be equal to one,

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:12.244
and B minus A or I could write that

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:17.244
as negative A plus B is
equal to negative four.

00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:21.493
We could add the left hand sides

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:22.743
and add the right hand sides

00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:24.676
and then the A's would disappear.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:28.724
We would get two B is
equal to negative three

00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:32.325
or B is equal to negative three halves.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:37.325
We know that A is equal to one minus B,

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.012
which would be equal to
one plus three halves,

00:06:43.012 --> 00:06:44.932
since B is negative three halves,

00:06:44.932 --> 00:06:46.756
which is equal to five halves.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:48.128
A is equal to five halves.

00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:51.297
B is equal to negative three halves.

00:06:51.297 --> 00:06:53.328
And just like that we
can rewrite this whole

00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:55.617
integral in a way that
is a little bit easier

00:06:55.617 --> 00:06:58.043
to take the anti or this whole expression

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.819
so it's easier to integrate.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.962
So it's going to be the integral of

00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:08.962
one plus A over X plus one.

00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:12.859
A is five halves and so I
could just write that as,

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:14.267
let me write it this way,

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:18.393
five halves times one over X plus one.

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.538
I wrote it that way because
it's very straight forward

00:07:20.538 --> 00:07:22.874
to take the antiderivative of this.

00:07:22.874 --> 00:07:26.491
Then plus B over X minus one.

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:29.467
Which is going to be
negative three halves.

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:34.467
So I'll just write it
as minus three halves

00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:38.810
times one over X minus one.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.400
That was this right over here, DX.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.466
Notice all I did is I took this expression

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.921
right over here and I did a little bit

00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:51.249
of partial fraction expansion

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:55.522
into these two, I guess
you could say, expressions

00:07:55.522 --> 00:07:57.698
or terms right over there.

00:07:57.698 --> 00:08:00.482
It's fairly straight
forward to integrate this.

00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:04.337
Antiderivative of one,
it's just going to be X.

00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:07.153
Antiderivative of five
halves, one over X plus one,

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.786
is going to be plus five halves,

00:08:10.786 --> 00:08:13.762
the natural log of the
absolute value of X plus one.

00:08:13.762 --> 00:08:15.538
We're able to do that
because the derivative

00:08:15.538 --> 00:08:17.352
of X plus one is just
one, so the derivative

00:08:17.352 --> 00:08:19.410
is there so that we can
take the antiderivative

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.572
with respect to X plus one.

00:08:21.572 --> 00:08:23.355
You could also do
u-substitution like we've done

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:26.577
in previous examples, U
is equal to X plus one.

00:08:26.577 --> 00:08:31.074
And over here, this is going
to be minus three halves

00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:33.570
times the natural log
of the absolute value

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.322
of X minus one, by the
same exact logic with how

00:08:36.322 --> 00:08:38.514
we were able to take the
antiderivative there.

00:08:38.514 --> 00:08:43.249
And of course we cannot
forget our constant.

00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:44.433
And there we have it.

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:47.394
We've been able to integrate, we were able

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:51.156
to evaluate this expression.
