00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.850
Stephen Hawking is so famous, you'd recognize
his voice anywhere.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.070
But he also famously has ALS, which normally
gives patients a very short time to live.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.250
So who is Stephen Hawking, and how is it that
he has lived so long with this disorder?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.450
Hello world, Trace with a non-synthesized
voice here for DNews.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.860
Stephen Hawking is 74.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860
You know him.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.630
He's published over 200 papers and books.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.869
IMDb has him appearing in 65 tv shows and
movies as himself.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.760
Hawking is an intelligent and popular mind
in science and pop culture, in part because

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.190
of his outrageous and cerebral theories on
how the universe works, and also that he does

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.210
it all from a wheelchair, with a computer
synthesizer for his voice.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.710
But that's not really why he became such a
big deal in science.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.920
In 1970, Hawking and his colleague Roger Penrose
published a paper in the Proceedings of the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.039
Royal Society A proposing a new theorem for
describing the Big Bang and how the universe

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.449
began as a singularity… and will likely
end as one.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.640
See, in 1970, The Big Bang theory was still
debated, but because of this paper (and others)

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.409
it gained more credence!

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.810
After that, through conversations with other
physicists about black holes, Hawking came

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.440
up with a way to stitch together two branches
of modern physics -- General Relativity and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.430
Quantum Theory -- basically, how the universe
works on a macro level and a WAY smaller than

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.430
micro level.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.890
Another paper in Nature in 1974 proposes the
idea that black holes (governed by general

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.901
relativity) can emit radiation and explode;
and a few years later in 1980 he works to

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.680
unify general relativity and the beginning
of the universe by describing the moments

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.780
after the Big Bang using quantum theory.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.810
These suggestions were also, and kind of obviously,
super controversial.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.469
Though today, physicists generally think Hawking
Radiation does help black holes evaporate.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.799
He's gone on to continue proposing these cockamamie
ideas, all while his ALS makes him less and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530
less physically abled.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.020
At age 21 he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis or ALS; also known as Lou

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.430
Gehrig's Disease; though you're likely familiar
with it thanks to the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.610
ALS is a "progressive neurodegenerative disease
that affects nerve cells in the brain and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.750
the spinal cord".

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.520
The word amyotrophic literally means no muscle
nourishment.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.920
But the muscles aren't what's directly affected
by ALS.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.190
Instead, nerve cells (called motor neurons)
in the brain and spinal cord degenerate.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.590
These motor neurons tell the body's muscles
to flex, so gradually, the brain loses control

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.120
of its ability to command muscles.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.920
ALS affects everyone differently.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.370
For example, there are two neuronal groups:
the upper and lower motor neurons.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.100
If ALS degrades the upper motor neurons located
in the brain: muscles will tighten and resist

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.100
movement.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.510
If it hits the lower motor neurons in the
spinal cord: the person will feel weak, get

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.900
twitches, and their muscles will waste away.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.380
As ALS progresses, it will start somewhere
and then spread to surrounding motor neurons,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.990
affecting muscles all over the body.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.330
This can take away the ability to walk, write,
speak, swallow, and breathe.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.590
Once the muscles don't get commands, they
begin to atrophy -- or shrink.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.720
There's no cure, yet.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.500
And the ALS Association says half of people
diagnosed live three or more years, but only

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.340
ten percent will live more than 10 years.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.350
Though, Hawking is still kicking it, figuratively
speaking!

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.600
For some reason, Hawking's ALS didn't affect
his ability to breathe (which would deprive

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.200
him of oxygen) or swallow (which could cause
dehydration or malnourishment) -- and left

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.150
his face under his control.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.200
We know he can move his face, because that's
how he controls his computer voice!

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.260
A set of letters, scrolls in front of him,
and a twitch from the cheek (detected by the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
arm on his glasses), selects a letter, then
another, then words begin to appear as well.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.970
Though, there's no guarantee this will work
forever.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.790
In the 1990s, he still had the use of his
finger, but no longer.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.480
He lost the ability to speak, not because
of ALS, by the way, but because of a terrible

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.200
case of pneumonia he acquired in 1985 while
visiting CERN in Geneva.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.390
Doctors in the UK gave him a tracheotomy to
keep him breathing and he lost his ability

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.900
to speak as a result.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.940
If you're thinking (like I was) holy crap,
this guy has had a lot of stuff happen to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.940
him.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.820
Just remember, this doesn't keep Hawking down.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.260
He's travelled the world, and experienced
zero gravity, (he, in his computer-voice,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.000
told reporters after, "space, here I come.")
and he told the New York Times in 2011, “I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.500
am lucky to be working in theoretical physics,
one of the few areas in which disability is

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.570
not a serious handicap.”

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.030
And he's kept his sense of humor, appearing
on the Simpsons, Last Week Tonight, and more.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.380
In 2002, a neurologist told the British Medical
Journal, "I am not aware of anyone else who

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.500
has survived with [ALS] as long.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.509
…the disease seems to have almost burnt
out.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.990
... This kind of stabilisation is extremely
rare."

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.130
No one knows exactly why Hawking has lived
so long with ALS, but it's pretty clear that

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.220
he is a unique mind and man.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.320
When asked by the New York Times to give advice
to others who may suffer from a disability,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.490
Stephen Hawking said, "Concentrate on things
your disability doesn’t prevent you doing

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.380
well, and don’t regret the things it interferes
with.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.840
Don’t be disabled in spirit, as well as
physically."

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.380
Hawking has predicted many things in his lifetime,
and he also thinks that for humanity to survive,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.740
we’re going to have to leave Earth.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.090
We have video about why he thinks that, here.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:38.620
What’s your favorite thing about Stephen
Hawking?

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.250
Why do you think he’s cool?
