00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.305
The answer to this one is actually 2/5.

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:04.870
And don't worry if you put 5/2,
or 200/500.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.530
We're still learning this stuff.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.160
But just because I said 500 first does
not mean it goes in the numerator.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.960
So how do we decide which
number goes in the numerator?
