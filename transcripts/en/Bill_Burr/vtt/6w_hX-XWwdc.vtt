00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.150
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:07.090
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.200
July 30th,

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.210
2018 what's going on?
How,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.500
<v 2>AH,
yeah.
Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.760
<v 1>I'm a little bit late here with this podcast.</v>

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.960
<v 3>MMM.</v>

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.940
<v 1>You know,
I was out there in Houston,
Texas for two nights in Dallas for one</v>

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.470
and I want to thank everybody that came out and uh,
the weather was great.

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.810
It wasn't that hot,
you know?
I mean it was hot,

11
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.740
but it wasn't like Texas hot when we flew into Houston.
I saw,
you know,

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.510
a nice green fucking grass in that shit.

13
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.700
I didn't realize Houston was right on the water.

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.980
I always thought you still had to drive like an hour before you get to the Gulf

15
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:48.350
of Mexico.
I don't think I ever looked at that.
And I know a lot of [inaudible]

16
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.313
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.900
<v 1>no,
I didn't.
I didn't want to watch a bunch of people losing their houses.</v>

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
Did you watch it with your fucking popcorn before there was that disaster?

19
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.550
Did you know that it's sat right on the Gulf unless you live there,

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.520
<v 3>that's actually,
you know,
something.
Every time I go to a,
um,
a state,</v>

21
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.370
I kind of look where everything's positioned and it's so fucked.

22
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:14.900
How like your brain remembers it.

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.920
That guy always thought Austin was inbetween Houston and San Antonio turns out

24
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.110
it isn't.
It's north,

25
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:26.810
just northeast of San Antonio on the 30th.

26
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.630
And then like a,
you know,
fucking San Antonio,

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.490
Houston are kind of parallel with one another.

28
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.830
And of course Dallas is all the way up there on top

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.080
<v 1>Dallas,
Texas where the heat is real and the titties ain't.</v>

30
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.920
<v 3>Um,
I had an awesome time when I was up there.
And guess what,</v>

31
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:50.480
guess what old freckles has done?
He hasn't drank this whole month.
Oh,

32
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.340
did he want one last night?
But he didn't.
Um,
I'm going to,

33
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.690
yeah.
This is my new thing.

34
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.460
I'm drinking the way I smoke cigars once every 10 to 14 days.

35
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.070
If I do that,
if I do that alone,

36
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.140
I will cut down on my drinking by at least
172%.
Now,

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.220
I don't know what ever do,
um,
that's the game plan.

38
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.500
So I got a little,
uh,
little,
little Shindig August 7th.

39
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.070
Then I go right back on the wagon until fucking,

40
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.470
I'm going to try and go back on the wagon.
That's the hardest thing for me.

41
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.970
Once I go off a whole daddy's playing the game again.
Oh,
he's,
he's in the gang.

42
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.290
You get a little dirt on a beautiful.
Um,

43
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.040
yeah.
So,
uh,

44
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.150
Nate Craig was out there with me crushing it every single night.
And um,

45
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.080
I dunno,
don't have anything bad to say,
but I know you.
I think it was weird.

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.520
It was weird going to Dallas and not sitting in a Binya texts.
Other than that,

47
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.080
it was a good tam.
Um,
all right.
That just bumped me out.
Why would I bum you up?

48
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.870
Good News.
Hey,
you know,
something,
his taste is something that you,

49
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.210
you might not have known about me,

50
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.630
but sensed when you were in my presence is I swear to God,

51
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.770
if I wasn't a comedian,
I could have been a manager.

52
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.380
Well,
at least I could.
I could have been a talent scout,
you know,

53
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.130
telling you how many more do I have to call?
Remember long time ago I said,

54
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.930
you know,
I've been watching this drummer on Instagram at the pocket queen.

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.710
Well,

56
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.330
that drum is going to be sitting in with the Seth Meyers show all this week.

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.470
What did I say?
Go ahead.
Go back and look at the old podcast.
Listen to him

58
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.430
was right there.
I could've done it.

59
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.970
I could've brought the red socks out of there.
Fuck at age six,

60
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:43.750
year curse earlier.
If they had me as a talent scout,
I could just see,
no,

61
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.050
I can't see it in sports.
I can't see everyone at whatever you know,

62
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.751
you don't really is,

63
00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:52.120
is you make a fucking thousand guests and then one of them comes in and then

64
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.390
what you really do is you just brag about it,
which is,
which is what I'm doing.

65
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.950
So anyways,
I'm back out here in Los Angeles.
All right.

66
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.760
I'm sitting in a very progressive manner.
Um,

67
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.300
you know,
when I watched last night,
I watched a couple episodes of,
uh,

68
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.050
Seinfeld's new,
uh,
comedians in cars.
You got to see the Brian Regan won.

69
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.960
The Dave Chappelle worn is awesome.
It's Dave Chappelle.
But this Seinfeld one,

70
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.120
the car that Brian Regan likes,
I actually like it too,
but it's a 2005,

71
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.010
like two Cedar Cadillac or something like that.
The level with,

72
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.370
I've met I on all the episodes.
I've never seen Seinfeld shit on a car.

73
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:34.450
Like he shat on that car

74
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.230
from the way it looked to the options to describing the person that was going to

75
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.490
drive it.
Um,

76
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.720
and then Reagan of course it was Reagan and he was fucking hilarious.

77
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.080
But I was kinda hoping he was going to bring up how much he did not care for

78
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.910
Brian's tastes and cars,
but you should check it out.
Uh,
if you get a chance.

79
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:58.480
So anyways,
here's my story.

80
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.360
So I'm in Houston,
right?

81
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.930
And I was supposed to fly up to Dallas and once again I fucked up.

82
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.240
I want to fly into love field cause that's the smaller one in Dallas fee and

83
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:14.050
whatever that fucking Metro airport,
whatever the hell it is,
it's gigantic.

84
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:17.170
But this time I actually went through Dallas airport and it was,

85
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.910
it was real easy.
Oh,
I know why because I wasn't connecting,

86
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.810
connecting through Dallas.
She always got to get on that fucking monorail.

87
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.230
And I swear to God,
if you're,
if you're in terminal B,

88
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.440
your connecting flight is in terminal a and you always have to go all the way

89
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.930
around.
You always miss it.
Just buy one share.

90
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.900
You could grab your bags and start running through the airport,
you know,

91
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.190
like Oj Simpson back in the day,
I guess,
you know,
maybe that's an option.

92
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.130
I don't know.
Um,
so anyways,

93
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:53.110
I was going to fly from Houston,
but uh,
Nate didn't get a ticket,

94
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:55.450
thought we were driving up.
So I was like,
God,
fuck it.
You know what?

95
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.680
I can't remember last time I took the 45 north up to,
uh,

96
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.030
from Houston to Dallas and uh,
canceled my fight flight.

97
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.120
We just fucking drove up there.
And um,

98
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.910
I gotta tell you,
man,
that is a,
uh,
it's an intense state.

99
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.730
Dallas,
Not Dallas,
Texas.
I me,
I mean,
there's just like nothing out there.

100
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:22.630
And then all of a sudden you just,
you finally fucking come on something.

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.450
You get so fucking excited,
some sort of barbecue joint.
I'm like,

102
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.640
maybe we should start there.
Man near the middle of nowhere.

103
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.380
Everything starts looking good,
looking at it and they got fireworks.

104
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.690
Let's pull over,
man.
We've got to get some of those.
I haven't seen anything,

105
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.260
any signage,
civilization for the last fucking hour.
Uh,

106
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.390
but we ended up stopping at this gas station with it.

107
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.880
They got this checklist of archaea and a Slovakian.

108
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.240
I don't want to start the fucking wars over there.
Um,

109
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.430
little,
uh,

110
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.700
dessert thing that they have that some people put meat in.

111
00:06:56.701 --> 00:07:01.220
Some people put fruit in it or whatever.
And I only seen him in Texas.

112
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.380
It's usually when I'm on the 35,
right around Waco,
Texas.
Um,

113
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.920
I was joking about that guy all weekend.
You know,
Joel Olsteen.

114
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.450
I was teasing those people down in Houston going like,

115
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.420
I can't believe you guys were surprised that that guy didn't let you into his

116
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:21.860
house when the hurricane cave.
You know,
he's,

117
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:25.430
he's selling out a basketball arena,
talking about Jesus.

118
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:29.540
Do you think this guy's even remotely honest on any level?

119
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.980
Let's do that thing where I have my eyes closed going.

120
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.790
Jesus doesn't want you to step on my blue rug.
I'm

121
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.100
talking about David Koresh anyways,
as I was named David Credit.

122
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.180
Really good looking guy,
man.

123
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.580
You remind me of that guy that who started in California Californication

124
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.650
he's also written,
uh,
um,

125
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.360
the x files.
David Duchovny Sorta David.

126
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.780
Do companies sort of understated by with them with like Richard Gere's here

127
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.190
or was that I got more of a Rambo here current,
you know,
I gotta look it up.
No,

128
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.730
but like if you could go back in time,

129
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.540
we got hey to the cops right before they'd go went nuts.
Amen.

130
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.460
You got to get this gay scene.
His Jesus.
Well,
I see look like,
ah,
you know,

131
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:20.810
he kind of looks like a,

132
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.410
let's go Rambo haircut like David Duchovny would just a splash or Richard Gere

133
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.710
sounds like a cover of people magazine.
[inaudible] know.
Um,
what are,

134
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:36.620
what are you looking up David Koresh?

135
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.020
The K factor.
He definitely would have got the plane ticket to Vegas.

136
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.720
They'll get the guy,
you know what I mean?
If you tick off those fucking Glenn,

137
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.130
he looks like he could have done the Bjorn Borg story is what's going to freak

138
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:53.990
me out.
How long did this go live from?
1959 to 1923 Oh,

139
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.680
Jesus
was,
he was 30.
Oh,

140
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.160
he's 33.
You know those Jesus freaks,
that's when they like to die.

141
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.090
That's when they like today.

142
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.630
Oh Gee is died at 33.

143
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.450
So if I fogging die too,

144
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.050
then that means I'm just as his father or to make no sense.

145
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.580
I thought it was gonna come out on Sun anyways.
Um,

146
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.230
so I've been eating perfectly the whole weekend and then I stopped and I got a

147
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.750
couple of those,
uh,
with,
I didn't know what the fuck they're called.

148
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.740
Checklist servo hammers.
I'm going to get you the name of them.
I can't find it.

149
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:39.270
It was called like a collage or something like that.

150
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.490
I can't find it.
What the f come on there it is.

151
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.320
Kol a c h e.
Oh my God.
That does the delicious.

152
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:53.360
Hey Nia.
Wait,
who is that?
Hey.

153
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.730
Hey Buddy.
Oh,
you've got your book.

154
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.990
Do you want me to read your story baby?

155
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.500
Oh,
is it?
Hi Buddy.
Hi Buddy.
Can I get kiss?

156
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.490
Nah.
All right.
Oh,
the boss baby.

157
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.180
Do you guys like to listen to old freckles Riggio kids book.

158
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.420
Oh,
you didn't?
Okay.
I don't touch that.
Don't touch that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Thank you.

159
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.630
I appreciate you showing me that was there.
Yeah.
I have to do a podcast,
man.

160
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.810
I don't know if I could do this right now.
All right.

161
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:29.610
From the moment the baby arrived,

162
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.390
it was obvious that he was the boss.
Yeah.

163
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.320
He looks like he put mom and dad on the round,

164
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:42.150
the clock schedule with no time off.
Thank you.
Does this seem familiar,
Kiddo?

165
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.140
Um,

166
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.260
bombing with arena and then he set up his office right smack dab in the middle

167
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:51.960
of the house.
She's not even listening to me.

168
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.410
I have like no charisma here whatsoever.
She's finding the crap on my couch.

169
00:10:55.411 --> 00:11:00.270
Way more interesting.
He made demands many,
many demands.

170
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.670
You've got a little Trump suit on and he was quite particular.
No,
I like that.

171
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.550
If things weren't done to his satisfaction,
he had a fit mount.

172
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.390
Sounds like these parents need to pooch kick them into his crib.

173
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.620
He conducted meetings lots and lots and lots of meetings.

174
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.000
Hey,
are you interested in this at all?

175
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.910
I had to get back to my podcast.
Keep reading.

176
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.360
All right.
Many of the meetings happen in the middle of the night.

177
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.460
The funky thing,
when was this written?

178
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.810
Marla
trasy.
Then an old black woman,
Marla.

179
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.280
The funky thing that came out of nowhere is it the 70s

180
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.700
never ever said a single word that made any sense,
but that didn't stop.

181
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.720
She wants to run around
like,
do you want to look at this?

182
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.610
I just feel like everybody's fast forwarding through this.
Whoa,
whoa.

183
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.310
All right.
And then daddy went back to his podcast.
The end.

184
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.480
Is that cool?
Bye.

185
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.880
Okay.
Um,
yeah,

186
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.190
I have to get back to a particularly excrutiatingly unfunny podcasts that have

187
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:29.920
been recording.

188
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.940
Anytime I start and I start like promoting something or whatever the hell I just

189
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.340
did out of my,
my whole brain just goes out the damn window.

190
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.460
Do you want me to read that book again?
Okay.
Sorry guys.

191
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:43.060
This is just part of it now.
The boss,
baby by Marla phrase,

192
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.030
from the moment the baby.
All right.
Let me get back to this.

193
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.080
So
bye.
Bye.

194
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.320
Bye.
I love you.

195
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.350
Yeah,
there you go.
She can't sit.
She just goes and Yang,
Yin and Yang.
Um,

196
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.790
she,
yesterday after,
uh,
I flew back from Dallas,
um,

197
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.760
I landed at lax and I met a friend of mine,
believe it or not,
um,

198
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.090
who owns one of those Vietnam era fucking helicopters,

199
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.900
the Huey ewh ones.
And uh,

200
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.560
he was there with his instructor and they pick me up in the thing.

201
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:29.920
I literally at least sounded like I was in fucking apocalypse now.

202
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.180
And um,
you know,

203
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.820
he flew around up the coast of Malibu and all that stuff and then we landed at

204
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:41.800
the small airport,
got some lunch and then they let me fly it.
And uh,

205
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.800
it was amazing.
You know,
it's funny,
they,
old people always said,

206
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:48.910
if you can fly in our 22,
you can fly anything.
Um,

207
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.420
they are 22 is the little egg beater that I fly and it's kind of like driving a

208
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:56.320
car.
I would say with like no power steering power brakes.
You,

209
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.030
you're really doing it.
Um,
but despite all that,

210
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:04.290
anytime you get a new helicopter,
it's like,
it's not just like,
you know,

211
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:04.931
if you would just to like,

212
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.810
if someone was to like taxi it out for you and you just took off,

213
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.850
it's very easy to fly anything.
But it's like when you come to a hover,

214
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.290
you know,

215
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.260
and you're doing little turns and stuff and trying to set it down on the pad,

216
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.440
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's when I sit there thinking like that,
you know?

217
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:24.790
Okay,
you might be able to fly it,
but I don't think you can maneuver it.
Well.
So,

218
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.150
uh,
we just did it some pad work and then I flew from a

219
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.730
camera ratio all the way out to,
uh,
to Burbank.

220
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.870
It was amazing.
It was fucking amazing.
And,
um,

221
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.390
I want to thank my buddy for letting me do it.

222
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.650
Not naming any names or any of that crap that was speaking I helicopters.

223
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.800
Everybody keeps telling me I've got to see that new Tom Cruise mission

224
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:48.640
impossible.

225
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.910
Doesn't it seem like my podcasts lately that I'm subtly throwing in advertising?

226
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.350
I swear to God I'm not.
I watched that movie.
Uh,

227
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.753
<v 5>okay.</v>

228
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.670
<v 3>Uh,
the,
uh,
the death of Stalin yesterday on the plane.
Jesus Christ.</v>

229
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.330
I don't know who,
who the hell wrote that man?

230
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.570
How do you turn that guy into a comedy?

231
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.680
But somehow they did with those fucking hilarious,
um,

232
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.780
two of my favorites of all time.
Uh,

233
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.840
Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey tambor all run it.

234
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.580
They are absolutely hilarious.
And I wish I knew the name of the,

235
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.800
one of the other lead cronies there.

236
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.423
<v 5>MMM.</v>

237
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.500
<v 3>It's fucking amazing movie.
This,

You know what it is?</v>

238
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:37.010
I don't have my fucking headphones.
I don't have a microphone.
I just,

You know,
I'm under the fucking gun.

240

I gotta go fucking meet somebody.
I've got,
I got no time.

241
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.660
We'll feel maybe if you want to drive and flying around and fucking amazing

255
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.730

How do you not sit and watch that man?
It's a,

256
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:46.580

It's,
it's endless and I can't wait to go,

265
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:20.170
but right before I do that,
or the day after assumption,

266
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.950
I'm going to be in Rochester,
New York home of Steve Gadd,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.311
with,

268
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:29.990
with Dean del Ray coming off play marbles performance up at the just for laughs

269
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.800
festival.
MMM.

270
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.730
Anyways,
uh,
I can't,
you know,
something that's the first time ever,

271
00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:42.820
I'm actually starting to feel my God damn age,
you know,

272
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.740
and I was in Dallas,

273
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:48.370
the fact that I had like two shows and I wrote up sitting down in that frigging

274
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:50.750
car,
I'm telling you,
you know,

275
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.850
I was like going like,
it seemed like I was had to go shovel somebody driving.

276
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.230
Once I get out on the stage,
I'm fine,
but,
um,

277
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.830
actually I'll probably find the whole time,
but I'm just like,
uh,

278
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.120
just the thought of it.
Two shows never bugged me.

279
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:11.000
Three was always like,
all right,
what the fuck?

280
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.000
What am I working in a mine here?

281
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.300
I thought I'd got into show business to have a nice,
easy fucking life here.
MMM.

282
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.810
Yeah.
Just spent like feeling my age.
So I gotta get back to a,

283
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.960
I don't know what you know,
cause I shouldn't be feeling,

284
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.630
I used to feel a little bit in my fucking nose on my,

285
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.600
my shoulder's fine and now my knee is fucked up.

286
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.180
I don't even know what the Hell I did to it.
Just crawling around,

287
00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:41.180
playing with my daughter.
All of a sudden just my knee all of a sudden

288
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.220
felt like really?
I don't know what hot stinging pain,

289
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.250
but it's not constant and it's only when I put pressure on it.

290
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:52.800
So I don't think that it's bone to bone.
Thank God.

291
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.490
I don't think I'd been active enough to have that shit.

292
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.200
This is one of my favorite things to do,
by the way.

293
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.830
Just to let you guys know what some of my ailments are and then you guys all

294
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.050
just turn into doctors is one of my favorite thing though.

295
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.190
Do you know what that is?
It's actually your kidney.
Hear me out.

296
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.500
One time there was this guy right?

297
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:14.100
And they just fucking goes into that shit and he was out on the golf course.

298
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.500
You guys,
you know,
I'm gonna have the doctor look at my,
my knees.

299
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.910
And the next day he died of a,
uh,
a kidney apparatus,

300
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.120
kidney,
uh,
uh,
aorta.
What'd they call it?

301
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.270
Kidney Hemorrhage.
Camera's [inaudible],

302
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.230
I'm sorry.
It was eight.
That fucking little checklists of Aki and dish.

303
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.093
And then,

304
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.250
then I went right back to salads and I was fine and find a file and then late at

305
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:43.290
night,
these goddamn hotels,
they always get me,

306
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.040
they always had the little snack thing I'd eaten.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect.

307
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:49.290
When I was in Houston,
an unbelievably,

308
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:52.800
there was no snacks right now everybody knows Houston was voted,
uh,

309
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:55.140
unprecedented.
Back to back.
They went back to back.

310
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.800
Is the fattest city in America.
Okay.
And this is no,
you know,

311
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.140
sound like these are,
this is some little fucking,

312
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:06.030
you're not going up against cupcakes here in America.
No Pun intended.
All right?

313
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.420
Okay.
We use some of the fattest people on the planet.
I don't even think we are.

314
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.180
I've got to be honest with you.
Maybe we are,
but collectively,

315
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.560
well,
when you're in the cities,
you know,
you don't see a lot of fat people.

316
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.370
You're in the city.
There's just too many eyes on you.
You know,

317
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.330
you get out in the country,
man.
I mean,
shit,

318
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.020
you can just walk you property fucking butt ass naked.
Who gives a,
you know,

319
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.670
nobody cares how fat you get.
And those overalls,
we'll,
we'll hide the,

320
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.100
the first 40 pounds.
Who's kidding?
Tow.
Remember Uncle Jesse,

321
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.640
that big goddamn beer belly he had,
but he had an the overall,
so you look,

322
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.970
you look like Santa Claus.
Just a good old boy.

323
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.190
Never in no home.
Mm

324
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.800
<v 1>is dumb.
Explore the booze and fucking regret.
He doesn't even know his kids.</v>

325
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.180
Um,
was that what that whole thing was about?

326
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.910
He was uncle Jesse.
Beau and Luke were cousins.

327
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.780
He must've come from a big family because that should have been odds out.

328
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.210
We should have been one of their dads.
Right.

329
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.113
<v 3>Cooter</v>

330
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.690
<v 1>is crazy.
Cootie catcher ears on.
Um,</v>

331
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.720
I'm actually at the end of the sixth season of a 77 sunset strip.

332
00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:23.140
It got canceled after 20 episodes.
And,
uh,

333
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:26.300
I'm really gonna miss that show and I hope that me TV,

334
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.200
which I'm going to look up right now is going to go back to episode one again

335
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.080
cause I missed it.
They start,

336
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.060
I could have watched the whole series since last November and I didn't even know

337
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:36.920
it was on.
Um,

338
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.860
and I would love to and I really wanted to see those first five episodes cause

339
00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:47.660
he was in la anytime they weren't in La,
I would always hit pause just to see,
uh,

340
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.350
if I could recognize where they were.
There we go.

341
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.310
Meet TV 77 sunset strip.
Come on man.
Give me a fucking showing.

342
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.710
Gimme a showing schedules that one 77 has its roots in an underrated,

343
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.050
I don't care about that.

344
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.810
<v 3>Come on,
let's schedule.
Watch.</v>

345
00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:12.644
It's going to be over.

346
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.990
<v 1>I'm sorry.
We have no listings of that weeknights at 4:00 AM,</v>

347
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.060
but are they going to start over again?
But you stopped.

348
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.400
I didn't get one on Thursday or Friday,
Thursday or Friday.

349
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.840
So,
um,
let me read some of the advertising hits.
We,
I,

350
00:22:29.841 --> 00:22:33.050
I got nothing for you here this week guys.
The red sox speak to twins.

351
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.190
There's something,

352
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.470
we've got the Phillies tonight for some more exciting inner league play.

353
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.790
They have inner league play like every fucking two days now.
You know,

354
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.290
they always go,
they always got to kill it.

355
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.870
The Yankees dead fucking big man there,
Aaron.

356
00:22:48.871 --> 00:22:53.670
Judge Way Guy fucking chipped a bone in his hand.
You know,

357
00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:56.620
it hit him right in the palm to mass,
got a fucking killed,
you know,

358
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.590
you know sometimes like chip in your elbow seems like,

359
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.690
well it's kind of sticking out so it wouldn't hurt that much.

360
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.730
It's designed for that.
Like,
you know,
the inside of your palm,

361
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.310
but chip that as far as like the worst bones to break his another one cheekbone.

362
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.140
Yup.
Begging file that into fuck that.
Uh,

363
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.880
you want to break your neck?

364
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.770
<v 3>You can break a toe.
You know what I mean?</v>

365
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.160
<v 1>Why do you think that they were torturing you and they wanted you to give up</v>

366
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.890
where the base was?
You could handle a broken toe,
right?

367
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.013
<v 6>Ah,</v>

368
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.940
<v 1>I was so bad.
I'm still not telling you</v>

369
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.893
<v 6>fuck.
Yeah.</v>

370
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.750
<v 1>You know,
once the,
once the guy goes to the rusty tools though,
it's,
it's like,</v>

371
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.120
all right man,

What the fuck do you want to know?

372
00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:45.740
I don't give a shit.
What are they going to call you?
Let me go.
I tell you,

373
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.760
I know you're gonna kill me.

374
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.090
Let me just tell you where everything is and you just take out the drill.
Hey,

375
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.190
smiley.
Oh,

376
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.730
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.

377
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.780
I ain't doing you want me to read the boss baby again?
Huh?
Oh,

378
00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:08.500

Huh?
Whoa.
Oh,

380
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.400
Okay.
Uh,

Crying.

381
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.880
Angry.
Surprised.
There you go.

382
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.990
Good job buddy.

383
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.330
Where's your toe toe?
You know that word,

384
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.280
honey?
I have to read advertising here so I can keep buying you food.
Huh?

385
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.370
Keep buying food.
Yeah.
That's how it works.
Come on.
All right.
Oh,

386
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:53.020
look at this first one,
honey.
Whoa.

387
00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.490
<v 3>There we go.
Oh,

I'll be out there in a minute.</v>

388
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.070

Oh my God.
Oh,

389
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.140
she's holding her arms out.
Oh,
just holding her arms out looking at me.

390
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.590
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Okay.

391
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.190
<v 1>And now I have to continue podcasting under these circumstances.
All right,</v>

392
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.720
first read of the week,
honey.

393
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.650
Millions of people are using honey to save money while shopping online.

394
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.720
And why wouldn't they?
It's very hostile.

It's ingenious,

397
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:43.870
but one of my absolute favorite things about honey is how much better it makes

398
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:48.320
shopping on Amazon.
Um,

399

Okay honey.

400
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.520

Honey,

404
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.790

So you can decide if you want to buy or wait for the price to come up and down.

408
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.060
Then I read the right.
It even shows you is the,
the item's prices.
Prices changes.

409
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.560
Its price changes.
Honey,

410
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.540

472
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.680
Owning a couch from hell is like a rite of passage.
I eat too expensive,

473
00:30:55.681 --> 00:30:58.440
too heavy,
too cheap to warn.
You.

474
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.050
Found it on a street corner and God knows who fucked on it.
Uh,

475
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.310

How amazing your new borough conscious.

477
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.840
Oh I used to live with Robert Kelly back in the day and uh,

478
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.810
I think Bobby Watch Sanford and son too much because he was constantly bringing

479
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:17.790
things in from the sidewalk.

480
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:21.720
One of these was a couch that he then put a bed spread over,

481
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.430
which was I guess supposed to block out the potential body lice or maybe broken

482
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.700
cracked pipe that you could sit on.
You know,
you know what,

483
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.200
you know what I really wish

484
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.290
other than that I could hug Bob Right now and tell him that it was okay that he

485
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.850
took that couch off the sidewalk.

486
00:31:37.851 --> 00:31:42.770
I really wished that burrow existed back then cause me and Bobby could have

487
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:45.890
fucking ordered a couch right after all these years of suffering.

488
00:31:45.891 --> 00:31:46.724
Was that personal enough?

489

517
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.640
<v 1>All right.
Let's get to some of the questions for this week.</v>

518
00:33:36.641 --> 00:33:37.474
I guess that's what we'll do.

519
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.720
We'll do a couple of questions and then we'll fucking go back to some more

520
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.350
advertising if I can actually figure out how to read it.
All right.

521
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:48.880
Russia feeling left out.
Hey,
you bill burr off.

522
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.550
Uh,

523
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.920
I've been listening to you tell you talking about your upcoming Eastern European

524
00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:55.360
tour in the latest podcast,

525
00:33:55.361 --> 00:33:59.740
but not hearing about any stops in Russia leaves me quite scarred and

526
00:33:59.741 --> 00:34:02.440
traumatized every time the podcast ends.

527
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.700
Is this guy making fun of millennials or how soft Americans are,

528
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:09.970
or are millennials a worldwide problem?
I mean,

529
00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:14.380
what's the deal with leaving us out?
Stand up is very popular here right now.

530
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:17.650
Stand up in Russia.
I mean,
are you allowed to talk about anything?

531
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.750
I can't see going over there and doing a Vladimir Putin fucking impression?

532
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.360
Could I?
Then what happens?

533
00:34:25.361 --> 00:34:29.620
All of a sudden somebody sprays some mist on me and I'm sure you can easily pack

534
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:34.280
a full show several times over in places like Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
Uh,

535
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.280
besides think of all the experiences you can have in the Oji Vodka capitol of

536
00:34:39.281 --> 00:34:42.550
the world.
It's dirt cheap with the current exchange rates.

537
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.030
The cities are beautiful and quite different from what you see anywhere else.

538
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.670
The people are friendly,
welcoming,
and fun loving.

539
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.010
Was this written by the KGB or is this really a regular person?
You never know.

540
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:55.840
I mean,
we haven't gotten along for a long time.

541
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:58.210
I know it kind of died down for a minute,
but you know,

542
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.000
it's always going to be Yankees and red sox with us,
unfortunately.
Um,

543
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.670
to be honest with you,
dude,
I'm actually,

544
00:35:03.671 --> 00:35:08.590
I was talking to my agent about trying to add Moscow,
um,

545
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.440
which I shouldn't have said because now everybody's always trying to add it.

546
00:35:11.441 --> 00:35:14.950
And then if I don't,
then I'm a fucking asshole.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

547
00:35:14.951 --> 00:35:19.180
I know we have a bad rap currently even heard you mentioned that gay people and

548
00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:20.800
journalists have been killed here,

549
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:25.060
which would be laughable to us if not so many people believe those stories.

550
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.080
<v 5>Uh,</v>

551
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.250
<v 1>oh,
you don't think,
oh my God,
am I who's living under the right media bubble?</v>

552
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.670
Anyways,
but let me ask,
just ask you one thing.

553
00:35:35.671 --> 00:35:38.820
If you're so skeptical about the media in your everyday life,

554
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.980
why go around and believe what that same media is spewing about other countries?

555
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.730
Not Saying you should take my word for it.
Come and see for yourself.
Hey,

556
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:51.420
come on over,
Bill.
We're not killing anybody over here.
Grab it.

557
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.970
Make your own decision and the meantime,

558
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:58.971
give a little gift of laughter to melt are cold my strike chef loving hearts.

559
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:04.990
I don't even want to say have a nice day and go fuck yourself.
Oh Man.
Um,
no,

560
00:36:04.991 --> 00:36:09.820
I would love to fucking go over there and,
uh,
I dunno what the fuck the belief,

561
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.060
but I do know this a,
we're not the only one's lying,

562
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.620
you know?
Okay.
It's don't believe the American media,

563
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.330
but believe my media about my country.
Well,
I guess maybe I should believe.

564
00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:25.780
I mean,
look,
I don't think I would if I went over there.

565
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.880
Yeah,
it would be honest.
I don't know.
Maybe you're being honest.

566
00:36:30.881 --> 00:36:32.170
Who the fuck knows?
You know,

567
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.270
I think we should just grow up and joined forces.
Um,
okay.
A R P oh,
hi bill.

568
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.810
[inaudible] I've heard on your podcast that you,
oh wait,
by the way,

569
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:47.811
have you guys seen the Vladimir Putin fucking goes out and plays hockey and they

570
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:51.330
just letting them score right and left.
I got a fucking post that video,
you know,

571
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:56.190
that's that type of shit.
You know what I mean?
Like,

572
00:36:56.191 --> 00:36:59.560
do you think they'd let Donald Trump score?
They probably would,

573
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.770
but we always had that thing.
Oh,
they're not,

574
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.870
they're letting them score cause they don't want to get sent to Siberia.
Um,

575
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.200
a a a p hi boo.
Hey,
you know something,

576
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:11.940
I would like to hear from more Russian people.

577
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:14.670
I want you guys to infiltrate my fucking podcast here.

578
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.040
Like you did the last election.
Oh,
a hot take.
I don't even know if he did that.

579
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.330
Um,
[inaudible] I have no idea.
I don't pay it.
I don't watch the news.
Um,

580
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.730
a R P hi bill.

581
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:30.960
I heard on your podcast that you received a r p invitation to join.

582
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.260
The biggest benefit we get from arp is that it is a very large lobbyist for us.

583
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:41.850
Old People.
Please join.
Thanks.
Oh my God.
Did I just joined a group?

584
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.340
Um,
yeah.
For those of you didn't listened last week.
I turn,
uh,

585
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.130
I'm 50 years old now.
Mooc makes me qualified for Aa,
our P and I can,

586
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.820
I can go to the movies for like $8.
You know,

587
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.740
I can get a custom cane walking cane or something if I want.

588
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:04.550
There's a whole bunch of things I can do.
Um,
I'm actually,
you know what,

589
00:38:04.551 --> 00:38:05.960
I was on the road and I saw there was an email.

590
00:38:05.961 --> 00:38:07.640
It was something I needed to fill out.

591
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.653
<v 5>Okay.</v>

592
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.390
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead further.
You know,
I gotta be honest with you guys,</v>

593
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.480
I'm always honest on this podcast.
Last night,
yeah.

594
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.500
Had this little square of fucking weed and she goes,
take a bite of it.

595
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.120
I got,
I hate eating wheat,
I don't like eating.
And she goes,
no,
just try as,

596
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.520
I don't know,
I don't want to do.
So she talks me into it.

597
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.510
I'm eating dinner and I ate the fucking thing and I never really felt anything

598
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.000
in about 10 minutes ago on this podcast.

599
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.890
All of a sudden fucking hit me like 12 hours later,
you know,

600
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:40.720
I'm not like fucking tripping,

601
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:44.650
but I think that's why I was reading like x,
x,
x,

602
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:47.020
x twice instead of once.
I have no idea.

603
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:50.860
I thought this shit is supposed to make you like clearer.
I,

604
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.770
I really Miss Booze.
I mean,
you just kind of know what's going to happen.

605
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.160
Like what,
what's going on right now is just like some Bruce Lee shit.

606
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.990
It's my brain swell up now and I just keel over on my own podcast.
Um,

607
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.000
anyways,
nutrition.

608
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:10.170
You goofy baldheaded bat baldheaded potato look and Fuck Jesus Christ.

609
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.450
Your heart shit in the mail,
man.

610
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.220
I know you are looking to go to a nutritionist for advice.
Be warned.

611
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.500
This industry isn't particularly well-regulated.
Yeah,
I know,
I know.

612
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:27.640
It's terrifying.
Basically once they,
they have that degree,

613
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:32.680
they don't have any oversight like real doctors.
If they fuck you over,

614
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:36.820
there's only so much that you can do.
Well I could sue them.

615
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:38.590
But you already saying they don't have the money of a doctor.

616
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:40.990
So what's the point?
A here's what you should do.

617
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.560
A find a nutritionist that provides advice based on lab work.

618
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.740
Most of these cuts we'll just have you keep a food journal and then give you

619
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:52.030
advice based on what you ate over the week.

620
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.330
This is stupid and it can be both misleading and inaccurate.

621
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.980
Not to mention expensive
lab.

622
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.310
Finding the person that provides advice based on lab work.
Well,

623
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.430
I mean it's can't you just fucking sit there thrown out stats.

624
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:14.230
Quarter five doctors recommended this is barriers.
Um,

625
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.820
anyways,
be whatever product they get you to start taking.

626
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:23.950
Ask them if they get money for the referral and what are they gonna say?
Yes,

627
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.020
I'm a good nutritionist.

628
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.680
Won't try to sell you something just because they get a kickback and an even

629
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:30.514
better one.

630
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.760
We'll give you a list of options of things you can do based on your blood work.

631
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:34.960
And I make this all makes sense.

632
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:37.690
I guess eight people that have to give their opinion,

633
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.540
give you their credentials as a means of validating their opinion.

634
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:41.470
But for context,

635
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.660
I'm a member of Team USA and competed in the 2006 Olympics in Rio.

636
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.320
Jesus Christ did fucking thrown your Dick on the table here.

637
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.270
The only reason I say this is that a is for the example that team USA is

638
00:40:55.271 --> 00:41:00.271
sponsored by Coca Cola and even our nutritionist attempt to hook us up on

639
00:41:00.371 --> 00:41:05.290
protein brand,
um,
on approaching brand owned by coke.

640
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:06.790
Yeah.
That's how it works.

641
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:10.630
Everybody has a side deal despite it being an inferior and more expensive

642
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:15.220
products.
Wow.
They recommended it to the athletes,

643
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.900
isn't that,
and it was,
it was gold medals on the line anyways,
just saying,

644
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:24.790
be careful who you listen to.
They even do elite athletes with this shit.
Well,

645
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:25.301
you know what,

646
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:29.460
that's probably one of the most informed fucking emails I haven't read or are

647
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.130
yeah,
I guess it is an email write letter.
When I was,
oh,
when I was a kid,

648
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:36.910
they called them letters.
Yeah,
I know.
I have to watch out for that.

649
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:41.360
I'm one of the reasons I got a nutrition in this.
It's is because,
um,

650
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.730
when I went online,
anything that I looked up about food,

651
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.830
I mean the whole front,

652
00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:51.480
I don't know how many pages was just all big time websites and um,

653
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.170
and then just confirm everything was conflicting.
You know,
these are good.

654
00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:59.620
Don't eat those all day.
You've got belly flat.
You know what the problem is?

655
00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:04.120
Bananas.
A lot of people think bananas are fucking,
is just like,
you know,

656
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.000
I don't know.
I love when people do things.

657
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.790
You start telling you like certain fruits and vegetables are bad for you.

658
00:42:08.791 --> 00:42:12.240
It's like,
yeah,
well I imagine if I eat a fucking Bushel of them,
it's not good.

659
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.300
But isn't there also like some sort of a potassium or some shit?

660
00:42:15.301 --> 00:42:19.100
I get out of bananas.
I don't know.
Gorillas eat them.

661
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:22.370
They look pretty fucking buff.
A 23.
And me,

662
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.560
uh,
here's the old Billy cito.
Oh,
hey there Billy openly cheeto Dick.

663
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:33.570
Oh Man.
Come on man.
A link to the article at the bottom,

664
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:38.760
but I know you don't read.
So here's the gist.
Alright,
hang on a second.

665
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.820
23 and me is getting lots of money from big pharmacy.

666
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.220
What the fuck is this?
Okay.
And he goes,
all right,
he goes,

667
00:42:47.221 --> 00:42:48.330
you were absolutely right.

668
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.720
This company 23 and me is set to make 300 million from sharing their users

669
00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:58.350
generic information with big pharmacy.
Oh,
is that one of those,
uh,

670
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.170
like ancestry.com websites?
Uh,

671
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:07.270
they say it's so the buying company can use the data to develop medical

672
00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:11.820
breakthroughs or some shit.
But I'm sure we all know that's bullshit except,

673
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.820
except to see robot replacements within a decade or two anyway,

674
00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:21.200
so you could use some vindication from a fellow conspiracy nuts.
Have a good one,

675
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.890
and go swap your own spit.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

676
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.120
I would actually guess that
all of that is true.

677
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.740
Okay.
The,
they're going to use all of that information,

678
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.570
um,
to develop new drugs.
I would think because they're trying to make money,

679
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.980
none of which will cure you.
They'll just keep you up,
you know,
on the hook.

680
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.520
We'll keep them all just alive enough that he keeps buying them a little pill.

681
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.380
Um,
and then I also think the robots are going to come.
Absolutely.
You know,

682
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.340
but the bottom line is,

683
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.550
is the people who are making the robots are overseeing it are also human.

684
00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:00.910
So it's in their best interest to try and cure ship for other humans.

685
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.203
Right.

686
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:06.350
I already told you my philosophy right on my fucking theory was basically I

687
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:10.390
shouldn't have told you guys about that fucking stupid pot square thing.

688
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:13.270
Cause right now you're like,
oh man,
just cause he's high.
You know,

689
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:17.370
fucking people who are like into,
we'd always give it credit.

690
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.340
You know,
like I didn't already have this thought.

691
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.930
I had this paranoid thought stone sober alone in a hotel room.

692
00:44:24.931 --> 00:44:25.681
This is what I think.

693
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:29.850
I think that they're going to fucking use that shit to build robots and then

694
00:44:29.851 --> 00:44:31.110
they're going to kill everybody off,

695
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.490
keep a certain amount of people alive and their job's going to be to like keep

696
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:39.630
reproducing so the Illuminati can harvest the organs.

697
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.810
I swear to God that's got to be from the weed man.
No,
I swear to God,

698
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.000
I've actually said that on stage this weekend.
Stone sober after eating a salad.

699
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.780
You know,
a lot of those salads actually have chemicals sprayed all over him.

700
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:59.010
So you're actually,
I know,
I know.
There's no fucking way around it.
Alright,

701
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.810
Bill from a lady,
uh,
hey,

702
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:08.000
build the blahzay blahzay cunt,
the blazo count.
Um,

703
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:13.130
I'm a relatively recent listener of your podcast as if seeing you at cluster

704
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:15.630
fest in San Francisco a year ago.

705
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

706
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.090
<v 1>That sentence makes no sense.</v>

707
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:24.350
I am a relatively recent listener of your podcast as of seeing you at cluster

708
00:45:24.351 --> 00:45:28.880
fest in San Francisco a year ago.
All right.
I guess that does make sense.

709
00:45:28.881 --> 00:45:32.660
But it was kind of written it up,
passive aggressive Shakespearian way.

710
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.640
You could've fucking arrange the letters a little more,
uh,
straightforward there.

711
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.200
So,
all right,

712
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:45.510
I'm not going to lie.
That one right there.
That was the weed.

713
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.420
I literally have a meeting and a half hour.

714
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:49.680
Like what the f I'm just going to fight.

715
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.450
I can't imagine the show I'm going to agree to do.
All right.

716
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.150
Not Looking where I was going.

717
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.350
I almost accidentally walked into you while you were on your way to interview

718
00:45:58.351 --> 00:46:01.710
Jerry Seinfeld.
Uh,
most is the same lady.

719
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.240
I probably came off as rude from my deer in the headlight moments of literally

720
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:09.210
running into one of the best comedians of all time that I write this.

721
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.540
So I hope you can accept my late apology.

722
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.580
What am I in fucking in Lord of the rings here?
Yeah.
Is it you are forgiven.

723
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.373
She is spared.

724
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.850
I thought your interview and headliner act was terrific and hope to see another

725
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:27.390
one of your shows.
That was one of the coolest fucking days ever,
by the way.

726
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:32.250
I fucking got,
got to do a,
I do my own show that day.

727
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.390
No,
it wasn't.
It was a day after I'd finished my show.
The next day.
Uh,

728
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:39.640
I get to interview Jerry Seinfeld in a theater in front of,
I don't know,

729
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.680
couple of thousand people while he promoted the latest season of comedians in

730
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:48.510
cars.
Had a great time.
And then I walked out the door and,

731
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:53.100
uh,
had a car service to go over with Josh Adam Meyers.

732
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.060
We had booked a car service to go to the NBA finals to see like game three of

733
00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:59.520
the NBA Finals,
um,

734
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.660
golden state versus the Cleveland Warriors.
And the driver was so cool.

735
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:05.340
He let us smoke cigars in the back.

736
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:07.423
<v 3>C'Mon man.</v>

737
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.940
<v 1>Great fucking days in my life.
Anyways.
Um,</v>

738
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.920
I'm glad you mentioned you wanted more women to write to your show.
I would love,

739
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.830
yeah.
Cause I love trashing you.
No,
I'm kidding.
I would like to hear that.

740
00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:19.311
What did,
did she,

741
00:47:19.311 --> 00:47:23.180
you think I would love if you had more female guests on your podcast?

742
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.090
Oh Gee.

743
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:32.020
I don't think I've ever had a woman on my is that need on sexist,
sexist,

744
00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.770
sexist?
I don't think I actually appeal to women.

745
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.600
And I can tell you why.

746
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:42.630
Because my shows a sausage fest and when I go outside I can't even tell you how

747
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.110
many times somebody will be like,

748
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.150
it'll be a couple and they want a picture and like the wife or girlfriend takes

749
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:53.830
the picture and they never want one.
Just the guy does.
So I mean,

750
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.290
I don't know.
I think maybe this is just like a,

751
00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:57.643
<v 5>okay.</v>

752
00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:58.911
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

753
00:47:58.911 --> 00:48:02.750
I'm trying to think of something that's so strictly for guys like footballs.

754
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.480
You know,
basically that version.

755
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.880
I was trying to pick something to actually offend women.

756
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.100
Footballs are for everybody.
Anyways,

757
00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:14.630
I was wondering if you could give me some dating advice.
Um,

758
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.930
society generally teaches women at a young age that men are suitors and women

759
00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:22.920
are courted.
But as a 27 year old woman who dates women,

760
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:28.020
sometimes it gets particularly difficult to figure out who does what role,

761
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.720
especially if both women are very feminine.
Well,

762
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:34.920
at that point you've got to step it up.
Also just be a staring contest.

763
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.550
Right?
Sometimes these roles just fit naturally,

764
00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:41.760
but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction.

765
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.900
And the whole thing just falls apart.
Let me ask you this.
All right.

766
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.410
Because opposites attract.
They always say,

767
00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.770
<v 5>mmm.</v>

768
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:55.480
<v 1>And I've dated people who are too similar to me and it's just we want a yin and</v>

769
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:57.220
a Yang.
We would to yangs.

770
00:48:57.221 --> 00:49:00.910
So we had half the fucking thing taken care of and the rest was a shit show.

771
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.540
So when the lesbian world,
all right,
if both women are feminine,

772
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.520
does that have less of a chance of making it as a relationship we want to hear

773
00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:13.180
from lesbians were taking college at Fat,
fat,
fat.

774
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.680
Sometimes these roles just fit naturally,

775
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.090
but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction and the whole thing just

776
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:19.924
falls apart.

777
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:25.020
I'm also not naturally comfortable with approaching women in bars or social

778
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:28.720
events that eventually wait for someone else to make the first move.

779
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.170
Risa,
why you got all the power?
Because it's,
it's,
it's,
it's all women,

780
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:38.790
right?
So there's no fucking,
there's nothing to hide.

781
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.940
There's nothing holding you back here other than that voice in your head going,

782
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:45.670
what if she says no?
Recently,

783
00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:49.330
I feel like I've missed out on some good opportunities for dates because of
this.

784
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.860
What advice would you give to someone who wasn't used to being the proactive or

785
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:57.160
leading role in a dating situation?
Uh,

786
00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.210
thanks and best wishes to your family.
Oh yeah,
go fuck yourself.
Well,

787
00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:05.210
why don't you just start hitting on somebody you're not interested in,
you know,

788
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:06.160
just as practice.

789
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.570
I just say that stupid is dumbest most over the top shit.

790
00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:14.270
I mean I'm applying to this.
Two is a guy.

791
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:17.040
If you're afraid to talk to women,
it's kind of like a,

792
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.010
you got to see the humor in it.

793
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.970
You got to see the humor and getting up thinking someone gave you a look like,

794
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:25.870
yeah,
I'm in to you.

795
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.230
And you walk all the way over there and it turns out they were looking at

796
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:34.310
somebody else or whatever you say to them,
just completely bombs.

797
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.740
And then instantly in that moment,
you know,

798
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.930
I should just turn around and walk back to where I was.

799
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:43.310
But just out of some stupid pride,
you'll continue to stand there for 10 minutes.

800
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.220
No adding rather than ripping the bandaid off,

801
00:50:46.221 --> 00:50:50.360
just slowly tearing it off so that person can reject you for another fucking

802
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.550
sixth of an hour.
Um,
oh,
she said,
ps,

803
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.090
I've been Vegan for six plus years and found it does work.

804
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.720
It does wonders for my health.
Changing my diet.

805
00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:07.610
Literally cured a moderate skin condition I had since I was a child.

806
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:12.620
Uh,
if you're still curious about giving v Veganism a trust,
a test run,

807
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:17.150
sorry.
I'd say try it out for a month and see how you feel.

808
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.830
It definitely works for me,

809
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.480
but I know that's not the case for everyone who tries it.
Um,
yeah,

810
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:25.850
I'm trying to be lazy about learning how to do it.

811
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.780
I just like go to a nutritionist,
teach me,
you know,

812
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.710
I was just like,
hang out with somebody that's,
you know,
show me some of the,

813
00:51:34.711 --> 00:51:36.280
just give me a fucking big,
you know what?

814
00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:39.460
I wish they just had like a giant march madness,

815
00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.950
like poster for how to be a Vegan,
like that.
Easy.
You know what I mean?

816
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.610
Like you look,
okay,
these two teams play.
Now,
this team's names here.

817
00:51:48.611 --> 00:51:49.930
So I know it won that game.

818
00:51:49.931 --> 00:51:53.440
I wish they could just fucking do that and break it down and the bracket leads

819
00:51:53.441 --> 00:51:57.310
to the finals,
which is protein or at least the fucking,
whatever the fuck,

820
00:51:57.311 --> 00:51:59.770
whatever else you need.
Carbohydrates.
I don't fucking know.

821
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.350
I swear to God.
I am literally going to sue my girl,
my wife,

822
00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:06.470
a fucking drug in me here.

823
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.270
I can't even keep my fucking thoughts straight at this point.
Um,
girlfriends,

824
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.860
arguably racist family.
Oh boy.
Oh Jesus.

825
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.320
Uh,
I'm a black guy in Louisiana with the girlfriend who is white.

826
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.120
Her family is very religious and reserved as am I.

827
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.790
Although we are kind of religious,

828
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.000
her and I know our families per se,

829
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.620
where we have our beliefs and don't shove them down people's throats.
Anyways,

830
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.630
the problem is she has,
she had a kid with a black guy right before I met her.

831
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.650
All right.
She has a type,
her kid is not even six months.

832
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.560
He left her high and dry and wants nothing to do with them.

833
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.750
Now seeing as we are in the south,

834
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:54.440
I asked her a normal correct question down here.

835
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:58.040
Is your family okay with you dating a black guy?

836
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.380
That question gets asked all over the country.
By the way,

837
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.580
there's this myth that racism is just down in the south.
Um,

838
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.800
she was very honest and said,
Eh,

839
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.960
my mom and dad should be fine.
He eats fried chicken every Sunday.

840
00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:13.950
So you'd love them.

841
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:19.320
She said that my grandparents and that generation,
uh,

842
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:24.210
not so much.
Well,
she was making,
I guess this is a joke,

843
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.600
this one like reading it,
you're like,
I don't know how this was set anyways.

844
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.760
Fair enough.
I'll work with that.
The problem is after she talked me up to her mom

845
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.100
and her mom saw a picture of me,
she was like,
oh no,
he's black.

846
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:43.320
You just going to get hurt.
So I don't know if her mom was just inherent

847
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:45.330
inherit,
oh,

848
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.660
inherited the racism or if she feels that way because of black guy ditched her

849
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:52.740
pregnant daughter.
Uh,
how do I approach this?

850
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.970
They live in the woods.

851
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.650
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

852
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.980
<v 1>This sounds like a fucking Tarantino movie.
You know,</v>

853
00:54:02.981 --> 00:54:05.640
one of those little shorts that he makes,
you know,

854
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:10.470
and going back to visit them is kind of sketchy to me and I haven't told my mom

855
00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:13.860
because she'd have an aneurysm.
Yeah.

856
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.190
Don't go in the woods of fucking Louisiana to fucking visit some pistols.

857
00:54:19.191 --> 00:54:22.620
Like get out.
Don't fuck it.
Do that.

858
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:27.300
And their kids it.
Yeah.
And the chicken.
Ah,
wait a minute.

859
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.460
This is get out you motherfucker.

860
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.690
<v 0>Is that what this is?</v>

861
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.510
<v 1>Oh,
I've been had.
You know what?
That's embarrassing.</v>

862
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:43.310
Anyways.
Rough and rowdy,
bro.
No,
wait,
is it,
did she get pregnant in that movie?

863
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.470
No.
I don't know if that's real or not.
Hey Nia,

864
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:55.160
she probably left.
Left the scene of the crime.
All right,

865
00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:00.090
well I've got a couple more advertisements to read here.
Oh,

866
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:04.830
the black Tux everybody.
Yes.
Next with the black tox.
Oh,

867
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:08.590
Jesus.
Wedding season is upon us.
Oh,

868
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.410
they're always getting married in the summer,
right.

869
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:11.810
If they're broke ass couple of,

870
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.730
there's no air conditioning in the fucking church and then they're the,

871
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:18.910
they're the ones who always want to have the long fucking religious ceremony and

872
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.550
wedding season is upon us.

873
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.660
You're going to be doing it big and going out to all of your buddies weddings.

874
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.310
When you're bringing a date,
you want to look fresh,
but it has to be convenient.

875
00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.350
That's where the Black Tux,

879
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:48.410

880

It's funky.

And lastly,
but not leastly,
simply safe,

899
00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.460
simply safe.

900
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.700
These guys obsess over the details and it's why the alarm system is so good.

901
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:04.840
Here's an example.

902
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:09.841
A typical glass breaks sensor sometimes gets fooled of false positive.

903
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:14.740
Sounds like drop plates,
a baby crying.
Uh,
I was,

904
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:18.430
I supposed to like,
here's an example.

905
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.900
Was I supposed to like try to make a funny example?

906
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:25.570
I never know what this copy simply safe,
uh,

907
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:29.140
didn't want to settle for typical because really good home security should be

908
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:30.100
really accurate.

909
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:35.140
So they actually constructed a glass break tests facility,

910
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.680
all swimming breaks classical.
Okay.

911
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.210
Should be a break glass test facility,
class break.

912
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.990
They ran over 10,000 live glass breaks situations,

913
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.430
refining their detection technology.
It was so accurate.

914
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:54.280
It can distinguish a broken plate from a broken window.

915
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.830
How fucking boring was that?

916
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:03.080
And what does that some guy looking at like the,
the,
the volume,
the sequence,

917
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:07.420
the same sound wave two,
you had 500 different sounds of broken glass.

918
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:12.580
What if somebody breaks a window with a wine glass?
Honey,
sorry,

919
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:15.610
I'm not going to be home tonight.
Yeah,
I got a break.
Uh,
you know,

920
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.240
I got to see what happens when you frisbee a plate into some fucking stained

921
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:23.200
glass.
Um,
but you know what,
God bless these guys for doing it.

922
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.040
This is the level of details.
Simply safe puts into everything they do.

923
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:29.500
They're the Daniel Day Lewis of breaking glass.

924
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:32.590
It sets them apart from other security companies.

925
00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:36.160
Simply saved system is designed so you'll never notice it.

926
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:40.360
Never have to think about it.
It's that.
It's that easy and intuitive.

927
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:44.980
There's no contract.
They work hard to earn your business.
24,

928
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:49.690
seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch.
It's just $15 a month.

929
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.990
It's the best around the clock protection.
You can find,

930
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:56.350
or do you simply saved security system today.

933
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.750
It's an I know why and simply,
all right,
that's going to be the podcast.

934
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:16.990
Um,
from Monday,
July 30th.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

935
00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:20.020
Have a great week and go fuck yourselves.
