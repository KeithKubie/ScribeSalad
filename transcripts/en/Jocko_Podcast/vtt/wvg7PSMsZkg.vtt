00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.300
I'm a huge fan of the podcast and I'd like your advice.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.610
When I was younger,

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.320
I joined the National Guard in an attempt to do something with my life and get

4
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.550
out of depression.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.100
I lost my discipline and goals after basic training and continued in depression

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.810
and disorganization.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.890
I had the opportunity to go to fight to flight school,

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
but instead tested positive on a drug test and I was given a general discharge.

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.980
I of course,
take full responsibility and feel like an idiot.

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.470
How would you recommend moving past this failure?

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.270
What would you have done if your seal career ended with a mistake?

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.660
<v 1>Well,
if my seal career had ended with a mistake,</v>

13
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:51.661
I would have figured out what my next mission was going to be.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.670
That's that's what I wanted done.
I mean,
I would have said,
okay,
I liked that job.

15
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.630
I failed at it.

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.440
What can I learn from that and what can I do next differently to make sure I

17
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:08.080
don't make that mistake again?
I'm going to learn from the past,

18
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:11.350
but I'm not going to dwell on it.
There's no point in dwelling on it.

19
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.450
The only point in dwelling on it just to learn from it.
So,

20
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.520
so that's what I would do here.

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.910
And then I would take what I learned from my experiences of where I failed and I

22
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:26.320
would also take the positive things that I learned because you even that even

23
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:27.730
that failure is a positive.

24
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.830
Even that failure as a positive because you realize you realize the value of the

25
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:34.900
opportunity that you had and you blew it and you're like,
okay,

26
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.610
I'm never gonna let that happen again.
A lesson learned,

27
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.450
I'm actually stoked I get to learn that lesson because there's going to be more

28
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:43.690
opportunities that come up in life and you've got to make sure that you don't

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.620
disregard those opportunities when they come up.

30
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.280
And so I would have taken those lessons learned,
take that,

31
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.940
take that failure and turn it into something positive and made good things

32
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:57.170
happen when I figured out what my new mission,

33
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:01.780
a new career was going to be pretty straight forward.
Yeah,
you can,

34
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.250
you can do so much good and yellow.

35
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.890
That's going back to this story that I told about Jeff in the beginning of this

36
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:12.250
podcast.
One of the wording,

37
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.280
some of the wording that I struggled with in the kids' story,

38
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.240
and again,
it's on the,
it's the word could podcast.

39
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.220
One of the things that I struggled with in telling the story was I ended up

40
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:28.990
saying Jeff had gone too far and he couldn't correct himself.

41
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.160
Yeah,

42
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.160
he had gone too far and he couldn't come back and that's a real hard thing to

43
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:41.611
tell a person and it's a real hard thing to tell a kid and they're the reason

44
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:47.410
why I left it that way.
The reason why I kept it like,
listen,

45
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.750
you can make mistakes that you can't come back from,

46
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.740
especially as a kid.
You can make mistakes that you can't come back from there.

47
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.360
Pretty rare,
right?

48
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.840
There's not too mistakes that are so grievous that you can't recover from them.

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.530
Like this guy,
hey man,
he made a mistake,

50
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.790
failed the drug test given a general discharge.
That sucks.
Guess what?

51
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.810
He can do all kinds of good in the world.
He can make up for that 10 fold.

52
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.440
He can start a business,
make money,
he can create a family,

53
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.100
he can raise great kids and there's so many things that he can make sure his

54
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.130
kids understand that and know that and learn from it.

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.950
And he can make sure some other neighborhood kids in high school,

56
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.300
kids in grade school kids,

57
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:31.270
he can make such an impact on the world by learning from that mistake.

58
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.350
So it's very,
it's a harsh thing to say like,
hey,

59
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.240
there's some things you can't now what this guy can't recover from and this is

60
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.420
what the,
this is the fact that you have to face,

61
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.550
and this is why I told them this way and the kid story,

62
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.510
he didn't understand when he made that mistake,

63
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.230
he didn't understand that there are some mistakes you cannot recover from.

64
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.130
He can't be a pilot now.
It's not going to happen.

65
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.420
Zero chance of him being a military pilot.
That's the way it works.

66
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.770
So if I would've had the opportunity to tell him when he was 13 years old,

67
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.730
hey listen bro,
I get it.
You're going to step outside the box sometimes,

68
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.340
but there's some mistakes that you can make that you'll never be able to recover

69
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.560
from.
So think about what you're doing before you do them.

70
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.110
You need to think about what you're doing before you do them.

71
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.670
And if I were to have the opportunity to tell him that when he was 13 years old,

72
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.790
he might've had a better decision making process when he got older.

73
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
That's why I left it that way for those kids so that they recognize that there

74
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.530
are some things that you do as a,
as a person,
as a kid,

75
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.210
that you cannot recover from,
you cannot recover from them.

76
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.400
Now that being said,

77
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.390
when you take this and you put it in perspective as an adult,
Cnas,
an adult,

78
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:46.780
you have much broader world to be a part of.

79
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.610
And just because he's not going to be a pilot,
a military pilot,
by the way,

80
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.890
just because he's not going to be a military pilot.

81
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.710
There's all kinds of other opportunities out there and you can explain that to

82
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:00.490
an adult,
but it's hard to explain that to a kid.
So what other opportunities,

83
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:02.860
I mean even if especially like,
oh,
you want to be a pilot,
cool,

84
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.620
you can become a civilian pilot and you can,
you know,

85
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.200
you can fly and you can make things happen that way.

86
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.730
But what we're not going to do and what I would not do is dwell on the past and

87
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.010
dwell on what the mid,
the big missed opportunity is.
Because guess what?

88
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.820
That's an,

89
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.480
that's a missed opportunity that there's all kinds of people in the world would

90
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.900
love for that to be their biggest mistake that they've made.
That's it.
That's it.

91
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.230
They would love,
there's someone sitting in prison right now that's like,
man,

92
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:33.130
I wish all I did was get a fail a drug test and I could have learned my lesson.

93
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:38.131
Instead I'm sitting here in prison or I got injured really bad cause I did

94
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:42.400
something that I shouldn't have done or I made a bad decision or I got someone

95
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.690
that I care about hurt or injured because I took them in the car when I was

96
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:51.340
drunk.
Like those are the kind of mistake,
this mistake.
Sure.
It's a bummer.

97
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.200
Guess what?
There are infinitely,

98
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.030
infinitely worse mistakes that he could have made infinitely worse.
So

99
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.430
you're all right,
man,
you're okay.
Learn from it.

100
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.230
Don't dwell on it.
Move on and go.
Go do something really positive in the world.
