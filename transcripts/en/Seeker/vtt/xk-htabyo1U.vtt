Oh glass, you beautiful amorphous translucent
mystery, tell me your secrets.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.219
Hello everyone, Julian back again for DNews.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.119
Physicists from the University of Waterloo,
McMaster University, ESPCI ParisTech, and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.060
Université Paris Diderot all joined forces
to answer a long standing question about glass,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.009
and that question was: how does glass form?

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.080
Yes even though we’ve been making it for
over three and a half thousand years, we still

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.969
weren’t sure how or why it formed until
physicists from four separate institutions

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.899
solved the puzzle just last month.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.200
Apparently the answer was a lot simpler than
anyone expected, combining two older models

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.280
for how glass molecules behaved.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.900
One is molecular crowding, that states that
the molecules on the surface of the glass

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.310
can keep moving while the more crowded molecules
on the interior can’t unless the molecules

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.750
around it cooperate.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.570
This cooperative movement is the second puzzle
piece, and it’s both helped and hindered

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.230
by the weak bonds between glass molecules.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.489
Taken together, these ideas explain how glass
behaves at a molecular level, and believe

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.030
it or not, it’s more tricky than you think.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.439
Glass isn’t technically a solid, and you
may have been told it’s a liquid but that’s

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.439
not true either.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.960
It’s an amorphous solid, meaning it lacks
the crystalline or polycrystalline repeated

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.900
structures of other solids.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.790
This lack of a pattern and the weak chemical
bonds explains how glass can behave like a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.740
brittle solid, and also accounts for the glass-liquid
transition, which is when heated glass is

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.079
between a supercooled liquid state and solid
state and it behaves like a rubbery viscous

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.079
liquid.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.810
The molecules on the surface of glass never
actually stop moving though, even when cooled.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.830
They do move EXTREMELY slowly, but they move
nonetheless.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.939
A common myth about glass is because of this
movement, antique glass has sagged over the

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.900
years and that’s why many old building and
church windows have glass that’s thicker

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.900
on the bottom.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.659
That’s likely just an imperfection in how
the glass was made, because for a flat pane

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.340
of glass to sag at room temperature would
take longer than the age of the universe,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.640
and I don’t think churches have been around
that long.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.340
Plus even older glass from egypt doesn’t
have that sagged quality to it, so there goes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.340
that myth.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.750
The lack of a crystalline structure is often
used to explain why glass is transparent,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.570
and I’d like to debunk that while we’re
at it.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.420
You may have heard that light passes through
glass because there’s space between the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.940
disorganized molecules and photons can get
through.It’s not the space between the molecules,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.280
but the way the molecules react with photons.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.450
Which is to say, they don’t.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.360
Photons in visible light don’t have enough
energy to excite the electrons in glass, so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.260
instead they pass through it unchanged.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.220
Ultraviolet light however does have enough
energy to excite the electrons, so when UV

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.500
light hits oxide glass like in your car’s
window, the photon is absorbed and the UV

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500
light is stopped.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.810
It’s why you don’t get sunburned sitting
inside your car with the windows rolled up.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.140
And if you were some hypothetical creature
that could only see ultraviolet light, you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.760
wouldn’t be able to see through a window.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.370
This glass stuff man, it’s cooler than you
think.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.460
Case in point, we’re trying to search for
life on Mars in glass.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.921
Dr. O’Neill explains here.

00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:07.430
Have you heard 
the “glass is a liquid” myth before?

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.660
It’s pretty common and it drives me mad.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.120
