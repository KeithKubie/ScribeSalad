1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,670
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,770
my family and I and my family,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,400
I inherited flat Butts Syndrome.
It's embarrassing.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,140
It's embarrassing.

5
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:16,141
Have your butt hurt because you have no
padding when you sit and have no pants

6
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:20,920
fall, have your pants fall because there's
nothing in the back to hold them up.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,540
After week I def notice something
extra in the back. I'll keep using.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,190
That's the people that you want to buy
your butt cream cause they're morons.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,940
That's like people that give money to
preachers that fly in private jets.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,870
Yeah. I think and as crazy
that don't work, but I,

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,540
I'm telling you government bottle work,
Joe, I'm telling you, let's look at this.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,330
Who would have known it works faster
on your breasts and on your button,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,340
but it's work. [inaudible] this is
not real. It is real looking at me.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,030
I can't see shit.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,140
I'm telling you God.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,130
But listen, these fucking the people
that are writing these reviews,

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,080
not only does it works, that's
it works. Not only does it works,

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,060
it increased my breast size.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,570
They probably should change the name
to breasts and button hansman butter.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,160
I know it for the, but I know it for
the but so I figured, let me see,

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,540
will it do anything for my breast
since it's in quotes, all natural.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,590
So I did so with,
within a week,

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,030
my breasts was fuller.

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,820
Last time I seen them this size was
right before it was time to breastfeed.

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,450
My baby is now nine years old.

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,990
Oh. So I imagine that what
we was doing in the ghetto,

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm telling you at thick
as butter does work.

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,240
It I watch, I made it people who knows
what I'm talking about from the south.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,130
Say Joe, we did that
and it worked out well.

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,560
You should have done it on one titty.
Did it just to see no,

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,080
John wanted nothing to be here.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,390
I know there's only one way to find out
that actually works. One cheek, one tick.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,760
You bounce it out left cheek,
right Tim?

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm going to find that but butter
and rub it on my crack baby.

35
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,370
One of her titties and see if they grow
in their head and just don't even tell

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,730
them what you're doing. Just
put it on one today. I okay.

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm gonna have to get her to do it.
I don't think I feel appropriate.

38
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:27,000
How old is she now? She's
nice. Too late. No, no.

39
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,840
She's well known for you can do it.
You have a five year. I can test it,

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,730
but she already got a big ass booty.
Oh yeah. Then what? I'm going,

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm going to get some of that and see
if it works. My husband would kill me.

42
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't know if it's true, but I don't
think it is. It doesn't make sense.

43
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,910
But then again, I'm not a
scientist. I'm telling you.

44
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,550
It's like that peanut butter that they
used to send to the ghetto to choke.

45
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,643
Nick rolls out

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,070
and you realize, oh, the bubble
machine. You got a machine for 13,

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,130
13.
Yeah.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,820
Whenever we're talking about,
let's keep it rolling.

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,570
The um, yeah, the uh, so you don't
get caught up and popping them though.

50
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,390
I know. That's a problem of getting
too high. You're like, I'm talking,

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
what do we do? Let's just pop bubbles.
The bubbles fly marquee races.

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,490
It's like for them to really like take
in the basic wisdom they got from the

53
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,010
mythological creature.
They needed a mythological creature.

54
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,950
The mythological creature said
something to them along the lines of,

55
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,720
you need to love yourself more.
You need to give more to your community,

56
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:38,080
whatever the message is.
But if your Uber driver said that to you,

57
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,640
it wouldn't get through because it
wasn't like phosphorescent it didn't have

58
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,360
multiple heads.
So similarly with these religions,

59
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:51,361
what happens is you do get
some real transcendent wisdom
that's sort of timeless

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,700
mixed in with it. And then the people,
because they realize like, oh my God,

61
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,560
it was kind of a fairy tale. They also
reject the good stuff inside of it.

62
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,390
And that to me is the big tragedy of
any kind of fundamentalist literalist

63
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,860
interpretation that's being forced
on people is because within that is

64
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:13,480
inevitably something great or it wouldn't
be so viral like Christianity wouldn't

65
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:18,130
be here right now if there wasn't a
core thread in it that had a beautiful

66
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,520
message in it. It makes me, yeah,

67
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,400
well,
nicer people.

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,570
I actually have a really big conversation
this weekend with a very good friend

69
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:24,930
about it,

70
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,620
about another very good friend who's
very religious and we were saying like,

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,330
I think for some people it's an amazing
framework and a guide to live your life.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,440
I really do believe that.

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,910
I have several friends who are
very devout Christians. Yeah,

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,320
it's beautiful. And they,
they're the nicest people I
know. And Mormons, by the way,

75
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,360
I have friends that are
Mormons still to this day.

76
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,930
I have several friends that are Mormons
and there are some of the nicest people

77
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,350
and I don't care if they believe something
that I don't believe in. That's okay.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,700
It's okay. It is okay. But I mean,

79
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,710
the idea that everyone is supposed to
buy into stuff without questioning it is

80
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,540
the reason why we are 51 year old,
16 year old

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,330
dude.
I agree.

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,080
And then there's the deeper symbolic shit.

83
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,790
It seems to be encoded in Christianity,

84
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,820
whether from people projecting their own
understanding on a pretty wild symbol

85
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,140
sat or maybe it was intentional.
Either way. There is like a quilt,

86
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,580
like you know the uh,
if we talked about this,

87
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:30,840
like if you take a cube and unfolded,

88
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,260
it makes a cruise effects and like the
cube represents pre big bang conditions

89
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,740
and the crucifix represents past,
present,

90
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,410
and future intersecting with Aternity.

91
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,200
So if you have a a square. Oh,
I get it. So the the length,

92
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,210
the height is twice the
width. Yes. Oh, okay.

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,770
Maybe it unfolds into a crucifix for
people that are annoyed with that sound.

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,950
It sounds like a pencil sharpening over
and over and over again. We're sorry.

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,980
Sorry about that

96
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,620
y'all. But bubbles don't come free.
You need machine. Got To have,

97
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,200
we got to hire somebody. Hire
some dude. Just blow bubbles.

98
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
What did you do?
I blow bubbles on the jre Bro.

99
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm like fucking manly wrestler Dude,
man.

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,230
Definitely do that.

101
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,150
Have different people come in and blow
bubbles and then occasionally they chime

102
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,620
in. Hey, I'm going to be on the
Jerry next week. What are you doing?

103
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm blowing bubbles. Oh, cool. You're
the bubble blower for the week.

104
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,090
It wasn't real animal at one point
in time. I don't think it exists now.

105
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,120
I think it existed. It's just a primate
in the fucking woods. Yeah. Oh, okay.

106
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,550
You don't think it exists?
You believe that exists now?

107
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,080
I did up to a certain point,

108
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,840
but I was like in this era with all
of the cameras and everything else,

109
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:45,060
somebody would've caught one. Okay.
Right. Good. Yeah, I was a little worried.

110
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,700
I was like, yeah, I don't believe in it
now. I believe it existed at some point,

111
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,560
but I don't believe it exists.
Let me tell you something.

112
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:55,080
Charlemagne has this amazing
power to manifest shit. Okay,

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,120
so I see how it could lend itself.

114
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,160
When you believe something so much,
it becomes real. Right, right.

115
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,210
I could see how it manifests
itself into things like big foot,

116
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,130
like you believe in things.
I mean Sasquatches wasn't,

117
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,950
it's not a far fetched idea. It's
literally just a primate in the woods.

118
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm just saying. When you were young and
you believed that you were a teen wolf.

119
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,680
Yeah. That was like he, no, no, no.

120
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,133
Third Grade.

121
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,960
He believed that his ears actually
changed shape. No, they did.

122
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,794
I was sitting at the

123
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,940
lunch table telling everybody I was
going to turn into this Werewolf at

124
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,960
lunchtime and I was saying this for like
a week straight and we was all sitting

125
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,270
at the table and I was just sitting
there like this going to happen.

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,430
It's happening.

127
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,210
And my ears actually come around
to points into like two seconds.

128
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,850
All the kids at the table
saw it and jumped up and ran.

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,090
So they fucked up my concentration.
So if I had kept that concentration going,

130
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,030
I probably would've turned full
fledge werewolf in that moment.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,750
Maybe levitated possibly. I've done
that before. Really? Oh yeah. I used to,

132
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:03,650
I grew up Jehovah witness,

133
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,620
so I used to leave the kingdom hall and
I would walk outside of the kingdom hall

134
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:10,280
and I would like jump in the air and be
looking down at the kingdom hall and not

135
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,900
to stay up there for awhile and then I
would come down. But here's the thing,

136
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,280
he's not, he's not doing bits
right. He really believes this shit.

137
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,810
I'm just telling you
what happened in my life.

138
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:23,180
I don't know if you believe what you
believe it, if you don't, you don't.

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,373
Memories of strange thing.

140
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,200
Um,
it's a very ominous feeling because it's,

141
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,130
there are no f, first of
all, everything is one color.

142
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:38,050
It's like a dark pewter color and
there are no right angles anywhere.

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,740
It's as if somebody took a,
I've said this before,

144
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,830
somebody took a model out of in fashion
did out of wax and then he did it just

145
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:51,250
for a short time. So everything melted.
Everything looks like it's fused together.

146
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:55,180
Everything has a radius of
curvature or to, uh, items.

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,300
It's a, it's a really weird
looking thing. But, um,

148
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,090
uh,

149
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,090
there was almost nothing other than
a small foldable hatchway that,

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,030
um, that looked recognizable.
Everything was, uh,

151
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,980
was really unworldly to pick on it.
A way to describe it.

152
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,200
So you,

153
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:22,080
you get inside this thing and it's
designed for something that's much smaller

154
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,070
than a human being.
Yeah.

155
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,370
You can't really stand up till you get
to the very center of. And how tall you?

156
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm five. 10. And what do you
think this was designed for?

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,390
I'd say something close to half my eye.
Wow.

158
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,800
So these little three foot
tall ish creatures. Yeah.

159
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:41,670
And that the seats were small too. I
mean obviously it was made, you know,

160
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,500
for something something small,
but there is no, like there's,

161
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,500
there's nothing else in there.
There's just seats,

162
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,430
the reactor and some of the
sub components. There's no,
there's no control panels.

163
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:57,580
There's no bathroom. There's
no, no decorative, uh,

164
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,140
components or artwork or anything that
you would recognize or trim. I mean,

165
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:06,000
it's just a very bare bones thing.
You're not seeing any screens.

166
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,660
Well,
there are archways around.

167
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:14,661
It adds that are part of
the superstructure and that
one of the archways can

168
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,060
become a transparent,
when I was in there,

169
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:23,061
there was another group working on one
of the archways and you could call that a

170
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:28,000
screen more or less.
So through that archway it would be,

171
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,800
it would maintain the
solidity, the, the solid,

172
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,870
whatever metal it was. Yeah. But you could
say it just became transparent. Yeah.

173
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,750
I saw that happen once
or twice before I left.

174
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,690
Did you ask any questions
about what the no,

175
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,670
there's no asking because
no asking questions,

176
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,540
but when you watch something
become transparent and you
realize it's still there,

177
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,680
but you can now see through it. Yeah, I
may not now that's not that impressive.

178
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,590
We do have some liquid crystal
materials that are like that.

179
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,610
You know they had seen in smart
glass. Yeah, they call it smart glass.

180
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:03,570
So this is just a, and I don't know
if the craft is made of, you know,

181
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,490
an advanced metal or a ceramic.
It was cold to the touch. So, um,

182
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,360
you know, I would lean more
towards a metal. You're not
allowed to ask questions?

183
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,830
No,
the only,

184
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,020
they work on the buddy system so I can
only exchange ideas and talk to Barry.

185
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,150
Now this really interferes with science
because science is based on free

186
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,230
discussion and ideally you get a bunch
of guys together, exchange ideas,

187
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,660
work on problems and that's
how things move forward.

188
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,980
But they're still over the
top concerned about security.

189
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,480
They split everything off and
everybody becomes stagnant.

190
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,390
It, it, it, it,

191
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,990
it just destroys any of the progress
you can make or at least makes it go so

192
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,860
slow. Um, they, I think they wound
up shooting themselves in the foot,

193
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,640
which is probably why they arrived at
this bottleneck that they needed to get

194
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:58,660
this madman with a jet powered Honda
come in and see what he could do.

195
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,730
I think that was an act of desperation.

196
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:03,310
I think they wanted someone that
thinks out of the box and let's,

197
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,450
let's just give this guy a try
here because they weren't in,

198
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,810
and they might have done this four
more times since, uh, you know,

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,930
up until the point in time today, assuming
they're still working on this thing.
