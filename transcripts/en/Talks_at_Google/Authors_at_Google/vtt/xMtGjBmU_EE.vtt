&gt;&gt;Marcus Du Sautoy:
[applause]

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.060
Well, my first love is doing mathematics and
the mathematics that I really love doing is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.000
trying to understand the world of symmetry.
So, if I was cast out and I had to spend the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.029
rest of my life in just one building somewhere
around the world then it would the Alhambra

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.700
that I would choose to be banished to. Because
this, for me, is a real palace celebrating

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.310
the subject of symmetry. What I would like
to do is to give you a little bit of a mathematician's

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.739
perspective on how I see this world of symmetry
in a particular. What I see when I go around

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.609
the Alhambra.
I've never thought of mathematics being a

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.579
language before, but actually it's an incredibly
powerful language. It's a language which helps

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.530
you to understand where we've come from, what's
going to happen next. Symmetry is in a sense

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.170
a language which nature uses to communicate.
If you take a bee in the garden, a bee has

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.911
very bad vision. It can't judge distances,
it sees the world in black and white but what

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:20.660
it can pick out is shapes with symmetry because
it knows that that's likely to be a flower

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.060
with sustenance. The flower itself also needs
to have the bee coming to propagate its genetic

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.560
heritage. So, in some ways, the symmetry is
being used like a billboard, communicating

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.140
between the bee and the flower. In fact, it's
said that research has found that the more

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.750
symmetrical a flower, the sweeter the nectar
inside the flower. Humans too; we also use

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.100
symmetry as a way to communicate information.
Here are two faces which I've made artificially

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.090
symmetrical down below. Now, if I ask you
which of these do you find more beautiful

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.610
most people are drawn to the artificially
symmetrical ones. Why is that? Because actually

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.890
it's communicating information. It's very
difficult to make symmetry so if you can make

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.019
your face perfectly symmetrical; you're actually
giving a signal. You are telling somebody

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.640
that your DNA, your genetics is very good
or your upbringing is very good and you're

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.520
going to make a good mate.
Plato got something which is really at the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.230
heart of modern science, which is that you
find symmetry, the mathematics of symmetry,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.190
underpinning so many different bits of the
scientific world. So, for example, molecules,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.250
well, crystals are possible. If you understand
symmetry, you understand why crystals which

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.091
may be made out of different things behave
in a similar way. In biology actually, you

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:44.730
don't want to get a symmetrical object because
they're rather nasty. A virus is actually

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.600
symmetrical and it uses its symmetry as a
path or way to propagate itself very quickly

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.360
because it's a very efficient program to make
more copies of itself. So, for example, the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.410
H1N1 virus was in fact a symmetrical object.
So, understanding its symmetry gives one some

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.610
understanding of what it might do.
But it's not just scientists who are interested

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.520
in symmetry. The artists too have a fascination
with this world of symmetry, but they have

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.190
a slightly more ambiguous attitude towards
it. Here's Thomas Mann writing in "The Magic

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.140
Mountain" about symmetry. He has a character
who describes a snowflake and says, "I shuddered

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.480
at its perfect precision, found it deathly,
the very marrow of death." I think for many

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.630
artists symmetry is rather constricting because
it sort of forces you to do certain things

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.280
so I think there's a little bit of tension
with this world of symmetry. Of all the buildings

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.900
in the world, I think the one which really
celebrates symmetry is the Alhambra but of

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.400
course it's on the walls really, I think,
where the beautiful symmetrical games are

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.140
being played. And for me as a mathematician
this palace really poses all the interesting

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.250
questions about symmetry. What exactly is
symmetry? If I showed my son this wall here

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.190
and asked him does it have any symmetry and
he said no, it doesn't look symmetrical at

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.709
all but what he was looking for was left right
reflectional symmetry. This doesn't have any

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.340
left right reflectional symmetry but it does
have symmetry. But what does it mean to have

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.930
symmetry? Also, how can I say, articulate,
that two of these walls have the same symmetries?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.760
How can I say if the Moorish artists discovered
all the symmetries that are possible on the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.759
walls in the Alhambra? Now, actually, to be
able to articulate these ideas, the Moors

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.539
didn't have this sophisticated language to
be able to talk about these questions. In

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:45.120
fact, it took a mathematician called Évariste
Galois, who is a French revolutionary who

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.319
discovered a language to be able to articulate
the games that are going on in the Alhambra.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:59.849
Now, Évariste Galois had an incredibly dramatic
life. He was in fact shot in a duel at the

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:07.479
age of 20 over love and politics it said.
But already by the age of 20, this young mathematician

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.909
had already cracked one of the great mathematical
problems at the time which gave him this insight

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.789
into how to understand symmetry. That language
he left for us, a language that we call group

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.039
theory, has enabled us to actually navigate
this world of symmetry. This 18 year old boy

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.991
had developed a new way of looking at symmetry
which enables us to answer those questions

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:34.819
about the Alhambra. And what Galois realizes
is that really symmetry is like the magic

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.669
trick moves. What can I do to these tiles?
I can move them until suddenly they all line

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.210
up again and I can put them down exactly where
they were before. So, I like to describe symmetry

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.639
as the magic trick move. If you close your
eyes and I pick up these tiles and I move

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.449
them around and put them back down again in
a different way, you open your eyes and they

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.889
don't look like they've moved so that is what
symmetry is for Galois. Actually, it's interesting,

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.300
because for mathematicians, symmetry is actually
something with a lot of motion in it. It's

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.779
got life; it's got movement, unlike Thomas
Mann who thought it was very deathly. For

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:14.479
mathematicians, it's the moves that you can
make to the wall which are the key to symmetry.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.809
But what Galois realizes is not just the individual
moves, but how they interact with each other

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:25.210
which is key. So, I'm going to push you a
little bit mathematically now so brace yourselves,

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.509
but I want to explain this language that Galois
developed to explore the symmetries of these

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.080
two objects. So, two simple objects. I've
got a six pointed star with a little twist

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.589
on it and a triangle. So the magic trick moves,
the symmetries, are the things that I can

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:44.319
do to these objects which leaves them exactly
where they were so first of all, I could rotate

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.319
it by a sixth of a turn and it looks like
it did before. Okay, I can rotate it by a

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:54.499
third of a turn and it still looks like it
did before I moved it, or I can rotate 180

00:06:54.499 --> 00:07:00.059
degrees, half a turn, so that's three symmetries
or I could move all the way around to two

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:05.449
thirds of a turn, a fifth symmetry takes me
five sixth of a turn around so there are five

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.589
different symmetries that I can do to this
starfish. Now actually there's a sixth symmetry

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:18.360
that Galois identified here. This sixth symmetry
is just leaving something where it is so that…

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.289
it's strange. It means everything has one
symmetry which is just picking it up and putting

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.229
it down again. Now, it seems a bit silly but
actually this is as powerful as the concept

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:32.020
of the number zero and we heard earlier about
the Arabs, actually the Indians were the first

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.690
to develop the idea of zero. Beforehand, the
Europeans said, "Why do we need a number for

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.559
zero? If you're not counting anything, you
don't need a number." But the Indians realized

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:47.319
the power of zero to actually make advances
in mathematics. So, here again this is like

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.029
the zero symmetry, if you like to think about
it. So, there are six symmetries that this

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:56.929
starfish has. Let's take the triangle. I can
rotate that by a third of a turn clockwise

00:07:56.929 --> 00:08:02.360
or a third of a turn anti-clockwise and I've
got, now I can reflect this as you said. I

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.340
can reflect in the line through 'x' or I can
reflect in the line through 'y' or I can reflect

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.039
in the line through 'z.' So, five symmetries
again, plus the extra symmetry where I'm just

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:18.139
picking it up and put it back down again.
So, both of these objects have six symmetries.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:24.789
So, should we say they have the same symmetries
because they have the same amount of symmetry?

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:29.789
Well, now you feel there's some difference
between these objects, but how can we articulate

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:32.501
why the symmetries of these things really
are different?

00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:38.409
For Galois, what he realized is, it's the
interactions of these symmetries which distinguish

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:45.989
them. If I do one magic trick move followed
by another one, the combination is a third

00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:50.630
symmetry so you can actually develop a kind
of algebra. If I do one thing followed by

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.149
another, what's the answer? It's a third symmetry.
So, here I'm going to do a little bit of changing.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:01.850
This is the power of the language of mathematics.
Galois changed geometry into a kind of algebra

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.560
which tells me how the symmetries interact.
So, what I'm going to do, I've given names

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.069
to each of the symmetrical moves so 'a' is
just leaving the thing where it is. Capital

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:16.720
'B' is the turn where the little yellow dot
rolls down to the lowercase 'b' so 'c' is

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.019
a third of a turn, 'd' is half a turn, 'e'
around to here, and 'f' there. Now, what happens

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:30.260
if I do a sixth of a turn followed by a third
of a turn? So I'm going to do rotation 'b'

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.620
followed by rotation 'c', which is a third
of a turn, and the combined effect of those

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:43.050
is if I'd just done half a turn in one go.
So, this table shows me how the symmetries

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.020
interact with each other and this was the
inspirational move of Galois is that this

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.100
is key to understanding the symmetries of
this object. If I do this in a different order,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.649
doesn't matter really, do the third of a turn
followed by a sixth of a turn, it still ends

00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:02.240
up in the same place. So, there's some symmetry
in the way the symmetries interact, but that's

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.050
not true for the triangle.
Let's do two symmetries of the triangle. We're

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:12.850
going to rotate by a third of a turn anti-clockwise
then reflect in 'x'. The combined effect is

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.279
if I've just reflected in 'z' but now do these
in a different order; do the reflection first

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.670
and then rotate by a third of a turn and it
ends up in a different place. It's as if I'd

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:29.139
reflected in the line through 'y.' So, the
way these symmetries interact enables me to

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:33.990
distinguish the symmetries of the triangle
from the symmetries of that six pointed starfish.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.921
And in fact, Galois developed a sort of set
of rules for how the symmetries interact.

00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:42.940
It's a little bit like the rules for Sudoku.
I don't know whether any of you do Sudoku's

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.379
here but remember you are not allowed the
same number in any column or any row. Well,

00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:53.480
that's the same for symmetries as well. You
are not allowed any symmetry in the same row

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.971
here, in the main body of the table, or in
the same column. And Galois developed some

00:10:57.971 --> 00:11:03.379
rules for the way symmetries must interact
which enabled him to prove actually that if

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:08.459
an object has six symmetries, then either
its symmetries behave in the same way of the

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:14.940
triangle or the six pointed starfish. So,
it enabled him to abstract the idea of symmetry

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.761
underlying something and this is perfect now
when we go to the Alhambra. Because if we

00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:25.060
look at the tiles on the walls in the Alhambra,
how can we say when two of those walls have

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.870
the same underlying symmetry? Now, they might
look geometrically very different but Galois's

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:37.110
language enables to say actually the symmetries
of these two walls are the same symmetries,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.509
although they look very different. So, we've
got this beautiful walls with these little

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:47.360
twisted triangles and here I've got this six
pointed star with this kind of 'z'. So let's

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.279
look at the symmetries of these two walls.
Remember, symmetry are the magic trick moves

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:56.779
so I can pick up these third tiles, rotate
them by a sixth of a turn around the point

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:00.769
where all of these little triangles meet,
and then they all line up again so that's

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:04.889
one symmetry, a sixth of a turn around there,
but I've got another symmetry. I can rotate,

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:08.959
I can fix the point in the middle of one of
these tiles and rotate by a third of a turn

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:14.740
there and they all line up perfectly. Now,
there's another rather hard symmetry to find

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.149
but if you actually fix halfway along an edge,
you can actually fix that point, rotate all

00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:26.710
of them by 180 degrees, and then suddenly
all of them fit perfectly down on top of each

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.670
other. It's quite fun. I mean, this is the
fun thing about going to the Alhambra. At

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.690
least, for me as a mathematician.
[laughs]

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.790
It's trying to find, well, where are all of
these points where you fix things, rotate

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.870
them, or reflect them, and if you go now.
So, you've got those points there but you

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.639
see the same symmetries happening on this
wall which looks very different. Rotate by

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:50.069
a sixth of a turn around the point in the
middle of the six pointed star and everything

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:55.949
matches up. The third of a turn is actually
where all of these 'z' pieces meet so again

00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:59.319
rotate by a third of a turn and eventually,
ping, third of a turn and everything matches

00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:05.430
up. The half one is really difficult to find.
It's halfway between the two six pointed stars.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.699
Here if you rotate everything, you have to
rotate it by 180 degrees before it all matches

00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:15.930
up. So, although these walls look very different,
Galois's language says but no, the symmetries

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.121
will interact in exactly the same way. In
fact, you could put one wall on top of the

00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:25.170
other and whatever symmetry you did to one
wall would give you a symmetry of the wall

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.319
underneath. So, this actually, this group
of symmetries, we give the name 632 because

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:35.879
of these three different sorts of rotations.
Here are two different, three different, well,

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:40.610
this is actually the tiles that we met when
we entered the Alhambra. This is actually

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.750
the ceiling in that first room in the Alhambra
and this is the tiles on the floor. Now again,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.490
these pictures look very different but the
underlying symmetries, thanks to Galois's

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.620
language, we can say are actually the same.
And this group of symmetries we call 4,4,2.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.019
Nothing to do with football but because of
the fact that there's a place where I can

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:04.160
rotate by a quarter of a turn, a different
place here, and here again somewhere we have

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.500
to rotate by half a turn. So, Galois's language
is absolutely extraordinary. I think it does

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.560
for symmetry what the idea of number did for
us many years ago. I mean, the concept of

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.959
number is very abstract. For example, I've
got one, two, three, four, five, six people

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:25.449
on the front here and they're sitting on six
chairs. Now, the people are very different

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:31.870
from the chairs, you'll be glad to hear, but
the abstract idea of the number six is common

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.879
to both of them. But we've abstracted this
idea of number which is common to things which

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:44.440
have very different physical manifestations.
Galois did the same thing for symmetry. These

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.920
walls look very different but he's found a
way to abstractly say, "No, the symmetries

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:55.139
underlying them are actually the same." And
using those kind of Sudoku rules, it wasn't

00:14:55.139 --> 00:15:00.480
Galois but mathematicians at the end of the
19th century were able to then say well, how

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.290
many different symmetrical games are there?
If these are all the same, how many different

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.650
ones are there? But using this language of
Galois, we discovered there are actually only

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:15.940
17 different symmetrical designs that you
can make in the Alhambra and actually one

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.149
of the games we play in that chapter of the
month of October was to go and see did the

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:27.470
Moorish artists discover examples of all 17.
They are incredibly inventive with the way

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.230
that they tried different shapes and things
like that. Very often they repeated things

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:38.550
like the 6,3,2 or 4,4,2. In fact, it took
me several days but we managed to find examples

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.600
of all 17 there but I think it's the power
of mathematics to say that however hard you

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.209
try, you are not going to be able to make
a new symmetrical wall which is going to have

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:54.890
symmetries different from these 17. So, I
can describe this symmetrical tile using numbers.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:01.569
It's a tile which has points at 0,0 and then
you move one step north to 0,1 and one step

00:16:01.569 --> 00:16:07.790
east to 1,0 and extreme point at 1,1. Three
dimensions that I can use the height above

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:14.130
sea level so I use three coordinates, 0,0,0.
I can describe all of the points on a three

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:21.660
dimensional cube. Now, if I want to make symmetrical
shapes to tile my Alhambra in higher dimensions,

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.069
I run out of pictures. We don't have pictures
of four dimensional shapes, but the wonderful

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:30.420
thing about Descartes Dictionary, this power
of the language of mathematics, is that actually

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:38.970
I can describe for you a four dimensional
cube. It starts at point at 0,0,0,0 and then

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:47.639
it has edges running to four points at 1,0,0,0,
0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1, all the way through

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:53.160
to the extreme point at 1,1,1,1. I think that
is the power of mathematics, you know? Although

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.800
I didn't realize my dream to become a diplomat.
Come here to Brussels to represent my country

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.029
or whatever. Actually, I ended up learning
another language which allowed me access to

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:07.780
a very strange country. In a way, I say I'm
an ambassador for the world of mathematics,

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.130
so that's what I spend my research doing.
It's trying to explore this world of symmetry.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:17.300
What other, we know there are 17 in the Alhambra
but what about the Alhambra in four dimensions,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.260
five dimensions? So, actually that's what
I spend my life doing, creating symmetrical

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.690
objects. The exciting things for me about
mathematics is although we understand the

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.530
symmetries in the Alhambra, there are still
many things about symmetry we don't understand

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.410
and I think that's what for me makes mathematics
so exciting. It's a living subject because

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:42.170
of all the things we don't understand. I actually
always love coming back to this quote that

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.740
my professor in Japan that I work with told
me about because I think it sums up why mathematics

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.290
is a living subject. "In everything… uniformity
is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.410
makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling
that there is room for growth…" In some

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.090
ways, it's all the unsolved problems, the
symmetries I don't understand, which make

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.880
mathematics such an exciting, living subject.
So, thank you very much.
