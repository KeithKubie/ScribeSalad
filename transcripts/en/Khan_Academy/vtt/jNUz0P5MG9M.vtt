00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.390
The following table
describes the relationship

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.580
between the number of
servings of spaghetti

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.119
bolognese-- I don't know
if I'm pronouncing that--

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.380
or bolognese, and the
number of tomatoes

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.110
needed to prepare them.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.330
Test the ratios for
equivalents, and determine

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.510
whether the relationship
is proportional.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.415
Well, you have a
proportional relationship

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:20.790
between the number of servings
and the number of tomatoes

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.656
is if the ratio of
the number of servings

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.530
to the number of tomatoes
is always the same.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.238
Or if the ratio of
the number of tomatoes

00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:28.300
to the number of servings
is always the same.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.810
So let's just think about the
ratio of the number of tomatoes

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.980
to the number of servings.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.210
So it's 10 to 6, which is
the same thing as 5 to 3.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.450
So here the ratio is 5 to 3.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.860
15 to 9, if you divide both
of these by 3, you get 5 to 3.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.550
So it's the same ratio.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.560
15 to 25, if you divide both
of these by 5, you get 5 to 3.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.700
So based on this data,
it looks like the ratio

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.200
between the number of tomatoes
and the number of servings

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.660
is always constant.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
So yes, this relationship
is proportional.
