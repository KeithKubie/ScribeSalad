00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer is that the charge distribution will look like this.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The positive charge will attract the negatives over to this side

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but this negative has to come from somewhere.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, previously they were hanging out positive charges over here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Once they leave those positive charges, that leans a deficit of electrons on this side,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and so this left side becomes positively charge as the right side becomes negatively charge.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What we have just discovered is the phenomenon known as polarization,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's what we call when charges separate--positive on one side and negatives on the other.
