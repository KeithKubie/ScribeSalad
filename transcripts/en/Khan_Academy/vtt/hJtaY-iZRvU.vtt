00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.353
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians, hey Paige.

00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:03.186
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:04.908
- [Voiceover] So today, we're
gonna talk about parentheses.

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:07.243
So, before we get into
what parentheses do,

00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:10.748
I would like to talk very
briefly about the word origin

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:12.676
of parentheses or parenthesis,
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:16.843
because it comes from Greek,
so para means besides,

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.571
and thesis means placing, right?

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.654
So it's placed beside, approximately,

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.636
and how we use parentheses is

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:30.969
we kinda put 'em to the side for little,

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.166
what are called asides in
writing, little interruptions.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.807
So let's lay out the
functions of parentheses.

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:43.644
And I should say, the singular form

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:46.144
of parentheses is parenthesis.

00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:54.492
That's just one of these.

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:57.409
Two of 'em is parentheses, like so.

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:03.480
So Paige, what is a parenthesis,
and what does it do?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.199
- [Voiceover] So a parenthesis
is a piece of punctuation

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.410
that has kind of a lot
of different functions.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.110
It can indicate remarks
by the writer of a text.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.254
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:20.995
- [Voiceover] Or specify a
definition or a reference.

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:24.583
It can also show
interruptions by an audience,

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:27.763
but overall, the parenthesis separates

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:31.337
a piece of technically
unnecessary information,

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:35.419
or what we called an aside,
from the rest of the sentence.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:38.378
- [Voiceover] So it separates
inessential information.

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.744
- [Voiceover] Right, you can take out

00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:42.215
what's in the parentheses,

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.069
and the sentence will still make sense.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.920
- [Voiceover] All right, so
let's take these one at a time.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.295
So here we've got something like,

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.097
the cookie, which was
still warm, was delicious.

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:51.220
Now we could, conceivably,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.983
take that out of the sentence, right?

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:57.314
'Cause the sentence is basically,
the cookie was delicious.

00:01:57.314 --> 00:01:59.542
But if we wanted to

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:02.834
add an additional remark by a writer,

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:06.432
which is whoever ate
the cookie, namely me,

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:09.506
we would put in this parenthetical remark.

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:12.147
- [Voiceover] Right, it's
some extra information.

00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:14.064
- [Voiceover] And when
I say parenthetical,

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:17.698
I'm talking about this little aside here.

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:19.909
That's what I mean by a parenthetical.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.377
So this is what's called
a parenthetical aside.

00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:24.443
So the second way in
which you use parentheses

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.865
is to specify a definition or reference.

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:28.967
So let's say I wanted to quote

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:32.018
Paige's as yet unwritten autobiography.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.367
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:36.187
- [Voiceover] So, what I'm doing here

00:02:36.187 --> 00:02:38.930
is I'm using this parenthetical aside

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.847
to cite where in her book she said,

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:43.901
"Oh no, a tiger!"

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.172
So let's say this is, what I'm doing here,

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.275
this sentence is like an excerpt

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:50.007
from some essay that I'm writing

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.226
about Paige's life and times,

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.270
which I've italicized
here because it is a book.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.261
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.220
- [Voiceover] So what I'm
doin' here is I have the quote,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.569
and then, in order to say where
that reference comes from,

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.378
I give the author's last name,

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:06.752
the name of the book, and then p. 38,

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.888
and all of that is inside
parentheses, like so.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.798
That's the second use of the parenthesis.

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:15.913
So let's say you're taking
down a transcript of a speech.

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:17.189
You're typing up someone's speech,

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.854
and they start coughing, and it interrupts

00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:20.811
the way they're giving a speech.

00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:23.040
Let's say I was trying
to render the sentence,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.244
"Furthermore, (coughs) I
must firmly state that."

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:30.117
- [Voiceover] Right, so you
can include the coughing

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.219
in the sentence
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.632
when you're writing it
down or transcribing it.

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.121
Like, if we think this is
important enough to note,

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.015
we can just sort of say, voop, voop,

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:41.234
yup, coughing happened here.

00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:42.510
- [Voiceover] I see.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.003
So those are the uses of the parenthesis.

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.033
You can indicate remarks by the writer,

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.635
as in our first example,

00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:52.218
or specify a definition or a reference,

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.416
which we did here with
the reference to my book,

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:57.161
or you can show an interruption in speech.

00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.360
That's it!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.842
- [Voiceover] Sweet!

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:01.949
So what happened with that tiger?

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.090
- [Voiceover] That's a long story.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.895
- [Voiceover] All right,
we'll talk about that later.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:06.038
You can learn anything.

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:06.871
Dave out.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.519
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
