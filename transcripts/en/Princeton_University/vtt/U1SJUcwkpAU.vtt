00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
I have taken the survey. 
I took the survey

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.490
because it's an 
extremely important

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.200
issue, and it remains 
important across

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.639
the years as we 
continue to do it

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.139
especially now that 
we're getting into

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.389
the third year. 
It's really not just the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.099
one-and-done kind of deal. 
You have to

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.560
make sure to continue 
to reassess and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.510
reevaluate the impact 
of programs that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.730
we're putting in place 
to create a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.900
better environment on campus.
