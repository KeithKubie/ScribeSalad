WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.470
I have not been working out regularly,
regularly for several years now.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
Obviously I'm fat and lazy,
but I want to get after it.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.890
So the question is,
should I go all in level nine,
destruction,

4
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:18.690
maximum madness or ease into it at level three.
Cruising.

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.820
Uh,
all right,
well this,
there's a couple of different approaches.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.130
Now when I hear this,
first of all,
you don't want to get hurt,
right?

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.290
And you also don't want to make yourself try and do things that are so hard and

8
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:38.350
so painful that you can't do it repeatedly.
Yeah.

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.010
So if you just destroy yourself,
Matt,
what did he say?
If you destroy yourself,

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.890
level nine destruction,
maximum madness.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.130
But then you can't work out for two more weeks.
Well guess what?

12
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:51.380
What'd you do in the mean?
No.
Let's say realistically you got Dom's comes.
Sure,

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.880
right?
Delayed onset muscle soreness.

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.780
Let's say you did so many burpees that your legs,

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.290
you couldn't sit down without your legs being in pain.

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.480
So you take,
so you take three days,
four days.

17
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.050
Have you ever had Dom's so bad that you took four days off?
No.
Okay.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.160
Let's say you take three days off,
what did you do during those three days?

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.360
Did you hold the line?

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.450
Did you stay on the path or were you eating Cheetos on your colon?

21
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.163
That's what you are doing.

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.370
So if you destroy yourself to where you can't stay on the path,
that's not good.

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.050
You want to stay on the path.

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.880
I think doing something that you can handle or maybe something just beyond what

25
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.570
you can handle every single day is more important.
So going at a level,
not,

26
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.230
not cruising level,
not level three,
but let's,

27
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:46.350
let's find a solid level five where you can,
you're pushing yourself.

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.390
I write a thousand words a day when I'm writing and let you do the equivalent of

29
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.450
that.
Right?
The reason I read,
cause if I said,
okay,
I'll do it tonight.

30
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.100
I just say today I just have to write 5,000 words.
That's five hours.

31
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.510
We'll do I have five hours today.
No I don't.
Yeah,

32
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.290
I can squeeze out 52 minutes though and get a thousand words written that I can

33
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:11.190
do.
So that's,
that's what I think you needed to do.
You need to get consistent.

34
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.940
If you bite off more than you chew than you can chew your you,

35
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.170
you might very well choke on it.
So don't,
so don't do that to say,

36
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.460
so pick something realistic.
Do,
do people say that?

37
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.080
That must be a same time I heard it.
So if you bite off more than you can chew,

38
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.750
you might choke on it.
Did you make that up or you get that from somewhere?

39
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.630
I think I,
well I just,
I don't know.
I think I made it up,

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.850
but I'm sure someone like be like no,

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.290
this guy said it in 1978 yeah,
I heard it.

42
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.000
That's the beauty of it.
Good.

43
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.770
So pick something realistic like for something that you can handle and then get

44
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.850
after it.
Then the other thing here is he doesn't talk about his diet at all.

45
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.220
And that's clearly equally important and you have to change

46
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.621
your diet.

47
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.310
If you're gonna Change Your Life and you're going to change your health.

48
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.560
So stop eating sugar,
stop eating processed foods,

49
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.920
no more soda and juices and no more Gatorade

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.510
just to start with this or whatever it is.
Whenever it is that you're doing.
Uh,

51
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640
whoever asked this question,
whatever,
you know what you're doing.

52
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.080
If you're eating donuts and don't,
don't eat donuts anymore,
stop.

53
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.600
Just stop eating those.
Yeah.
Get rid of that sugar,

54
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:25.810
sweetness craving thing.
Yeah.

55
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.270
And then just keep making your diet cleaner and cleaner as time goes by.
Yeah.

56
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.330
So
that's what I think.

57
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.870
Is there any time that it's good?
Because sometimes

58
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.470
I think it's good when people do go like,
alright man,
um,
Dolan.
Yeah.

59
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.760
Like I,
whatever happened,
they went up the staircase and they,
they,

60
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
they got all tired and they say,
you know what?
I'm done.
Yeah.

61
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.730
It starts tomorrow.
But I think in those cases,
most of the time,
who was it?

62
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.620
Who was it that we were talking to?
Talking to someone,

63
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.900
someone that they are,

64
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:06.840
I was talking to someone that their first thing they tried to do,

65
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:07.860
they couldn't do it all.

66
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.810
Like they tried to run three miles and they were like,
you know,
what?

67
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.100
Can't do it.
Can't run three miles.
Oh,
it might've been that guy.

68
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:20.550
There's a guy that's losing a bunch of weight on the interwebs.
Oh yeah.

69
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:22.930
That's what it is.
I think he's down in Texas.
Uh,

70
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.510
but he's trying to lose a lot of weight and you're first time he went to try to

71
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:30.510
go for run didn't happen.
That didn't happen.

72
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.490
So he had to just run less.
I had to just walk actually start slower.

73
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.810
So yeah,
you,
you start with what you can do,

74
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.030
but there is a little bit of,
there is,
there is,

75
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.930
I would try,
I would say this,
keep this one in the,
in the back of your mind,

76
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.010
there is the whole thing of like,
you know what?
I'm changing my life right now.

77
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.430
You'd go home,
you'd get the garbage can out,
you bring it into the kitchen,

78
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.820
you throw away the Twinkies,
you throw away the pop tarts,
you throw away the,

79
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.230
that you pour the,

80
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.670
the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the path and you just don't look

81
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.210
back.
Yeah.
That's a good thing to do too.
Yeah.
But again,

82
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.980
if that person's 300 pounds,
they're not going to be able to do.

83
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.340
I mean,
they're going to push themselves.
Yeah.

84
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:20.520
They could push themselves too hard,
I guess so you just gotta be careful.
Yeah.

85
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.090
See,
it's funny when I'm,
when I'm kind of looking at the question,
I'm like,
well,

86
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.510
obviously you want to start slow,
right?
Obviously,

87
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.090
but then I don't feel like you hear about these guys.

88
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.940
Just like how you said they just,
they throw everything away.
They were like,

89
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:36.490
I'm a new different person right now.
I think we're,
we're,

90
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.620
we're crossing streams here or I am,

91
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.880
there's diet and then there's like a workout.
Yeah.

92
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.780
Because Diet,
you can pretty much go cold Turkey today.
Yeah.
It limits,

93
00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:49.850
and you may or may not be able to relate to this,

94
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:52.160
but if you cook strait extreme on your day,

95
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:55.670
like all of a sudden you're hit with these,

96
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.570
the byproducts of changing your diet,
especially if you'd like,

97
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.130
like mountain dew every single day.
Right.
And you just,
all of a sudden,
boom,

98
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.430
stopped doing a month.
You'll go through stuff that you might not expect,

99
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.170
like the craving will hit you so hard.
I on friggin minimal doses of mountains.

100
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.610
Yeah.
Basically.
Basically I'm going to say no,
just stop drinking mountain there.

101
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:19.400
You don't need it.
I,
yeah.
And I dig it.

102
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.130
And you're going to go through withdrawals,
right?
Yeah.

103
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.130
Through caffeine withdrawals and sugar withdrawals.
You're going to get the,
the,

104
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.830
the Keto flu and all those things are gonna happen and it's going to be rough.

105
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.110
But yeah,
but they'll just say it like that is going to be real fucked.
That talk.

106
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.150
Hey Bro.
Seriously,

107
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:35.450
if you go into that and you experience these types of things and it's gonna

108
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.680
apply to everything,
by the way,
any big changes that you make where you,

109
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:41.540
you have to deprive yourself of these bad things that you've become kind of

110
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.660
addicted to or whatever,
you're going to go through all kinds of changes.

111
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.050
And that goes for workout too,
by the way.
Cause like just the soreness alone.

112
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.210
Oh Dang.
I wasn't expecting the soreness.
Oh,

113
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.350
I'm like tired now because the workout like was kind of hard.
It's like,
Oh shit.

114
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.690
I wasn't expecting that.
I was extracting the field right after my workout.
Hell,

115
00:06:57.691 --> 00:06:58.550
everyone says or whatever.

116
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.340
So you're gonna run into all these little things that no one tells you about.

117
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.190
And then it's like,
well,
I didn't sign up for that little part of it.

118
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.390
And then what about that little part?

119
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.150
And then you're going to impact the Diet thing.
I think you're wrong.

120
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.940
I think the Diet thing,
I think if you're good,
I think it's very,

121
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.620
I think it's easier,
in fact to just be like,
I'm done.
It's not like,
okay,

122
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:19.460
you know what?
I'm only going to eat a quarter bag of Cheetos a day from now on.

123
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.200
I don't think that works.
I think you've gotta be like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

124
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.850
She does not know Cheetos in my house.

125
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.450
But I do think that you could work out so hard that you're so sore that you,

126
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.650
that you say,
Oh man,

127
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.560
I'm just to like kind of like the Jujitsu question earlier on.
Like you could be,

128
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.520
what if someone's so sore that they can't do their job right and they're just

129
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.010
sore all day at work?
Well that's not cool.

130
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.490
So I think for Diet you can,

131
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.500
you can go cold Turkey or actually called steak or hot steak.

132
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.770
And then I think for working out is the one you,
you,

133
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.290
you figure out what you can do and you push it a little bit harder,

134
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.200
but you don't go level nine,
maximum destruction madness.

135
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.490
I think you're wrong respectfully.
And which part do you think I'm wrong on that?

136
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.560
I think if you go extreme with your diet,

137
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.830
I think that it'll work for some people for sure.
Uh,

138
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.810
but depending on who you are,
but I think you're more,

139
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.450
if you go extreme with the Diet you don't like slowly phase out or what's the

140
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.000
notes you're thing,
you know what's interesting?
I don't know if you remember,

141
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:27.230
I read a letter a while back on the podcast about a guy that had red way,

142
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.830
the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and man,

143
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.330
that guy did what you're saying.
He just made little changes.

144
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.900
He made little changes along the way.
So maybe it's personal,

145
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.760
it's probably personality.
In fact,
let's just go ahead and say it's personality.

146
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.630
Some people are gonna just have to get the damn Cheetos out of their house.

147
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.270
All of them.
Yeah.
And some people say,
you know what,

148
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.260
I'm only going to have this one cup full of Cheetos every day.
Yeah.

149
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.920
And even that's okay,
but,
but here's where you gotta be careful.

150
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.390
You may lie to yourself
and you can lie to yourself.
Hey,

151
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.990
you can lie to yourself on the,
Ah,
you know,
I don't really that,

152
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.590
that not that big of a deal today.
If I just have two cups of Cheetos and say,

153
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.460
yeah,
yeah,
nine cubs the Cheetos later,
but you still bothered him.

154
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.960
Cheeto dust and respectfully,
I don't like your Cheetos example.
Why?

155
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.650
Because you're like,
I'm going to allow myself to eat.
Okay.

156
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.730
Don't allow yourself Cheetos.

157
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.910
That's not how small of a change you're going to make you.

158
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:29.010
If you're not gonna eat Cheetos anymore,
you're not going to eat Cheetos anymore.

159
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.950
I'm saying like if you go extreme on your diet,
let's say you eat would,

160
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.490
wouldn't you say what you're saying is,
hey,

161
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.620
I'm going to change my diet.
Okay,
sir.

162
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.580
I used to eat every day.

163
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.640
I'd eat a whole bag of Cheetos and now I'm only gonna eat one cup of Cheetos

164
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:52.020
from the bag of day.
That's improvement.
It is improvement.
It's small improvement.

165
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.070
And if I could do that,
then why?
Why is that not okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

166
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.150
If you choose to do that,
but okay,

167
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:01.130
now we're going into the specifics of a certain person's thing.

168
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.610
I would say this,

169
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.180
this is more along the lines of what I'm thinking as far as specific examples.

170
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.950
If you're going to go,
if I'm going to eat one bag of Cheetos,

171
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.500
obviously that's not all I'm eating.
I'm eating other stuff.

172
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.850
I'm the small change is I'm not gonna eat Cheetos anymore.

173
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.320
I'm going to cut out Cheetos.
That's it.
I'm still not eating that good.
You know,

174
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.310
I'm cut up Cheetos or let's say a,
I get um,
you know,

175
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.270
drive through every day,
three times a day.
Okay.

176
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.650
I won't get dragged through anymore or all.
That's a big change.

177
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.570
Not necessarily,
depending on what you get going from three drive throughs a day,

178
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.740
two to zero.
The how's that?
Not a big,
that's a big challenge is going from like,

179
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.360
and there are certain people,

180
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:47.361
actually I was talking to someone the other day that had lost 150 pounds a

181
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:51.840
female.
And it was interesting,
her nutritionist,

182
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:55.350
she hired a nutritionist and the nutritionist said,
okay,

183
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.640
what are the foods you can't live without?
Yeah.
And we'll work around those.

184
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.500
That's a pretty cool thing.
And what she said was,
I need cheeseburgers and fries.

185
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.880
So then what she got told was something along the lines of,
okay,

186
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:12.780
you can have cheese burger and fries on Friday.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.

187
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.240
So it was the same.
So they can,
instead of,
you know,
this,

188
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:19.590
this whole thing of I can never read it.
Now what I'm saying is there are people,

189
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.860
and I think I'm one of these people where it's like,
Oh,

190
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.840
if I have cheeseburgers and fries today,

191
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.600
well then I might as well just get a mint chocolate chip milkshake with it.

192
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.350
And if I did that tonight,
then you know what,
tomorrow morning,
Hey,

193
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.630
after you get done training,

194
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.700
maybe if you know that she's Burger's good yesterday,
I'll climb.

195
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.570
So maybe it's my own personal weakness,
but for me,
I,

196
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.680
I'd prefer to be just like on the path.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why the 80 20 rule,

197
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:46.320
and I talked about this in the field manual,
the 80 20 rule,

198
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.140
maybe it works for some people and I guess it does work for me,

199
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.800
but I'd rather just be straight on the program,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
And,

200
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.530
and then,
and you know what,
you know Tim Ferriss has that thing where,

201
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.790
where he's talked about the thing where he goes six days hardcore strict and

202
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:08.140
then the seventh day you literally eat whatever you want as much as you can.

203
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.760
And I tried that.
I have,
and it's really,

204
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:16.690
really good because you feel really,
really good.

205
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:21.070
Not only physically but just about the whole d I'm on the program and you kind

206
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.910
of know.
And on that,
on that cheat day you do,
they call it the Cheetah,

207
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.940
you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any guilt at all.

208
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.390
Even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to be coming off a real strong

209
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:36.880
weak to like be to feel good appeal.

210
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.420
Cheeseburgery like cheeseburgers are good too.
Yeah.

211
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.850
And that's really that bad of a cheat day or a cheeseburger.
Fries,
fries.

212
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:50.590
Then you're starting to go into it for sure.
But
like,
you know,

213
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:54.150
a cheat day,
cheat day,
like as Tim Hill,
it'll be like for real,

214
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.820
like a whole thing of donuts.
Box a cookie.
Yeah.
Whatever you want.

215
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.700
Straight up whatever you want us to discuss.
Here's the thing though,

216
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:01.540
with when you,

217
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:05.290
when you start to eat healthy and then you try to eat a whole box of donuts,

218
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:08.470
you after like one,
two,
three,
maybe six,
eight donuts,

219
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.640
you going to be like in six donuts.
Easy.

220
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.190
Six donuts in one setting.
Gosh,
you know those,

221
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.980
I think they're called intimates old fashioned there.

222
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.320
The little chocolate donuts.
No.
You know what?
A full size donut.
Straight up.

223
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.330
They're kind of little bit bigger too,
you know?
Okay.
You know,

224
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.070
uh Oh man.
I can't even fathom eating six donuts.

225
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.960
Ever since I started talking so much smack about donuts.
I can't literally,

226
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:40.870
can never have one again in my life.
Yeah,
no,
you're not allowed for sure.

227
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:45.490
A hundred percent a hundred percent not even even have a bite.
Even if you are,

228
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.220
like,
if someone was like,
Hey,
just out when I was a little kid,

229
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:50.260
my parents would buy the chocolate dawn.

230
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:55.030
That's the hostess chocolate covered in chocolate.
And those things are good.

231
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.420
Yeah.
You can't even have one of those again.
Nope.
Nope.

232
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.660
I did the six day cheap program.
Nobody,
even then you can't,
I can't do it.

233
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.320
You know,
you know the old fashioned donut is right.

234
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.750
It's like a doughnut with a hole in it right now.
It's called old fashion donuts.

235
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.970
They're like,
um,
it's,
they're kind of glazed in,
almost like a,
not,

236
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:13.691
they're not crispy,

237
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:17.680
but they're kind of hardy are hard and on the outside and then their regular

238
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:21.640
soft on the inside and they have this glaze over them.
Okay.
So I think it's,

239
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:23.530
I forget the name.
I think it might be intimate,

240
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.890
but they have old fashioned donuts where they're not as hard,

241
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.980
but they're kind of hard and they're just bigger.
Anyway.

242
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:30.920
Those are my favorite ones.

243
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:33.510
And I used to get chocolate milk and heat up the chocolate milk.

244
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.220
Looks like hot chocolate and donuts and all.
Yeah,
easy money.

245
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.110
Like I'll eat two boxes of those for sure.
Oh,
I used to anymore.
Oh yeah.

246
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.480
So nine point there is on a cheat day you just go like,

247
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.680
no shame.
But after,

248
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.590
the thing is you can't just eat doughnuts four times a day or three times.

249
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.630
You don't feel good.
Like your stomach gets all upset in.

250
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.910
The more healthy you eat,
the more it's going to be like that.

251
00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.680
So the longer you're on the path,
you start like if you ate some donuts,

252
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:05.000
like the other day we went to the Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream,

253
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:09.350
some mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Was it good?
Fine.
It was good.

254
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.710
But you know the kids are doing whatever's tracks through the night.
Yeah.

255
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.680
You eat a big,
large double.
You know what?
After.
After that you're like,
Bro,

256
00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:19.880
I don't feel right.
You know,
so unless you're just committed to eat it,

257
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:21.860
cause I don't know,
you don't want to waste it or something like that,

258
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.250
you're going to be like,
aw my cheat.
Your cheat day is not going to be that bad.

259
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.680
This is what I'm saying.
Oh okay.
But I'm still do have that fight.

260
00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:31.260
I'll make it happen.
It depends on what it is.
Yeah.

261
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.450
You can pump some Chili fries or something.
I don't like Chili fries.
All right.

262
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.910
So yeah,
maybe what's the verdict then?

263
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.890
I think just in the middle of the road.
Nut.

264
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.480
The whole study life balance.
Yeah.
So you're saying balance as well.

265
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.330
I'll tell you though,
man,
if that balance doesn't work for you,

266
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.790
you're going to have to step it up.
You're gonna have to go hardcore.

267
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.740
I'd give yourself two weeks,

268
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.490
two weeks for a balanced approach on the diet side.

269
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.690
If you can't get your shit under control and two weeks you got to go hardcore,

270
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.080
you've got to get in there with garbage clinic can throw away the Twinkies,

271
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.670
throw away everything else.
That's crap.

272
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:12.671
And your fridge and go hardcore that go and start with a fast too right now.

273
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.540
Hey,
a fast as awesome a faster way.

274
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.990
I don't even know that there's that much to expect.
The only for a day,

275
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.280
if you never done it before,
it's not that big of a deal.
There's no little stuff.

276
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.170
Don't eat your day.
There's little,

277
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.080
there's not take you from a normal human being.
Just little stuff that you,

278
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.840
if you're not,
if you go in and not prepared for it,
then you're like,
oh,

279
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.470
I actually think the more you think about and prepare for it,

280
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.590
the more psychologically ordered it is just to be like,
oh yeah,
you know what?

281
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.010
I woke up this morning.
I haven't eaten last night call.

282
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:48.310
I'm not going to eat until tonight.
Every time.
That's a fast,
yeah,

283
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:51.200
so I end it like that when I'm like,
I'm not going to until this.

284
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.070
Then I go through little stuff,
but if I just happy,
if I'm too into work,

285
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.620
I only drink coffee and I forget and I'm like,
Dang,

286
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:02.450
if if I eat and I haven't ate for like 12 hours or 16 and I'll be like,
oh,

287
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:05.450
I'll just go another three.
That's my 15 cause it's like 15 right.

288
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:10.451
15 hours is when your body starts to kind of shift to like I think 15 whatever

289
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.010
it is called.
So I'll just wait that shower.
It's like cool.
Done.
But if it planet,

290
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.270
that's when,
yeah,
I dunno.
Let it depends on who you are,
man.

291
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.330
I agree with the fans off.
Yeah.

292
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.780
That's a great way to kick things off and get like jump onto the path.
Yeah.

293
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.310
This junk bond with a fast.
Yep.
Hey,
go see your doctor or whatever.

294
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.440
Do you have to go see a doctor to fast 24 hours if you've been probably,

295
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.180
yeah,
close.
Uh,
uh,
fat,
Lazy,
you know,

296
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.460
especially if you're older or something like that.

297
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.980
I think seeing it talks about how to get a personal trainer.

298
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.040
Depends on what you mean by Helmut Young Woman.
I just talked to,

299
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.270
she's like personal trainer and nutritionist hired in both lost a hundred and

300
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.340
whatever pounds.
So yeah,
I think she was an excess of 300 pounds.
Yeah.

301
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.760
And when I met her she's completely normal.
Right.

302
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:06.630
Like you know completely like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight

303
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:08.880
trouble in her life.
Yeah.
That's pretty amazing.
Yeah.

304
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.440
So hire the trainer,
hire the,

305
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.860
the the nutritionist.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think that helps.

306
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.430
I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like

307
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.530
that when I can kind of look up that stuff.
But here's the thing,

308
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:27.540
I went in with this bias like,

309
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.890
cause I kind of had a background in it so I'm like why would I can just go look

310
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:34.980
and,
but I'm looking it up but I have all this other knowledge.
The same rule.

311
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.690
You try it for two weeks,

312
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.730
see if you can keep yourself on the path and if you can't got to bring someone

313
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.250
in.
Right.
Here's what I like.

314
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.770
Hire a trainer but not like an everyday.

315
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.880
It's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program.
Yeah,

316
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.150
that's you know it's going to depend on who you are straight up.

317
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.500
You know who can keep you on.
Yeah.

318
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.230
That's the biggest part of all this and I've said this a billion times like you

319
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:04.740
know what you need to do.
Yeah.
You know what you need to do.
You know?

320
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.160
You know what you need to do.
If you can't get yourself to do it,

321
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.410
maybe you need to get someone to help you do it.
Yeah.

322
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.950
The weird thing is like nutritionists and stuff,

323
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:16.050
you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like,
okay,

324
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:19.110
we're going to go put you on a low fat diet.
You know what?

325
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:22.560
You'd be really not good senior in the wrong direction.
I don't know how many.

326
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.660
Do you think there's still nutritionists that are doing that right now?

327
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.230
There are.
I know there are actually there are out there,

328
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.200
so you've got gotta be careful that
check

329
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.070
next west.
Last thing that,
I'm not going to draw it out.

330
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:42.810
But you said you know what you need to do in one time.

331
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:46.800
You said imagine what your day would look like.
Like if you,

332
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.390
like everything you did

333
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.760
was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of thing.
Well,

334
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.900
the full,

335
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.350
the full statement is if you wrote down tonight what you were supposed to do

336
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:04.400
tomorrow and then you did the things that you were supposed to do,

337
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.180
imagined how that day would feel and imagine what you get done in that day.
Yeah.

338
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.250
And then imagine if you did that everyday for a week.
Yeah.

339
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.840
And imagine if you did that everyday for a month and he did it for a year and

340
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:17.250
imagine where your life would be.

341
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.370
Your life would be in a completely different trajectory.
Completely.

342
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:23.550
Completely different.
Yeah.
And that's true with working out.

343
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.490
That's true with nutrition.
That's true with business.
That's true in education,

344
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:31.080
that truth,
knowledge,
truth,
everything,
everything.
Yeah.

345
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.770
Kind of know what we're supposed to do.
Yeah.
Oh,

346
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.420
I thought you were going to say some people don't know what to do.

347
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.720
And that could be the case.
Some people they've never worked out before,

348
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.600
and if you're a person that's never worked out before,

349
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.870
you probably need to bring someone into the game that's going to help show you

350
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:46.704
how to work out.

351
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.800
If never done any reading about eating and you have no idea what's going to be

352
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.800
good for you,

353
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.920
you're probably a person that might need to bring someone into the game to help

354
00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:00.930
you get over that.
Yeah,
and it's still completely goes with exactly what he said.

355
00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:04.990
It's like you know what to do and even to help that you know what not to do.

356
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.540
Like when you're about to make decisions,
I'm gonna do this or not do this.

357
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.790
Like you know which one is you should or shouldn't do.

358
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.490
So let's say I don't know anything about working out,

359
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.490
but I know I have to get in shape.
We all know and you know,

360
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:16.780
we all know when we got to get in shape.

361
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.970
So then you know you're going to hire somebody.

362
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:22.000
You know you've got to do something.
You know that you shouldn't just be like,
oh,

363
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.590
well I'm not going to do it.
I don't know.
I'm not going to do it.

364
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:27.250
Things to do tomorrow and a trainer.
Yeah,
join a gym.

365
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.240
Get a trainer.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
This is what you can do.

366
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.620
Find out what to do.
There you go.
Then in that case,
so you,
it makes sense.

367
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.460
Sometimes when you put things in,
just say stuff,
just put it on the table.

368
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.900
Just starts to make sense.
