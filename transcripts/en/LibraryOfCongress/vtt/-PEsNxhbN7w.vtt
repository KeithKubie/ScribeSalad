00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.360
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well,
good afternoon, everyone,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.230
and welcome to the African
and Middle East Division.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb Chief of the
division, and I'm really very,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.080
very happy to see you all here
for this special presentation

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.660 position:56%
with Israeli artist Avner Moriah who
will talk to us about his new book

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.550
"From Text to Image:
Illumination as Visual Commentary".

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.650
I hope it will not be
only about the new book,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.740
that it'll be about more than that.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.350
As most of you already
know, our division,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.150 position:56%
and this is my little commercial for
our division because we're webcast,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.280
and we want the world to know
where this event is taking place.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
So, our division is made
up of three sections.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250
The Hebraic section, of
course, the African section,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.060
and the Near East section.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.780
We're responsible for materials
from 78 countries around the world,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.470
from the near east,
central Asia, the Caucasus,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.000
as well as from the
entire continent of Africa.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.220
And, of course, for Hebraic, we
collect from around the world.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.930
We're very active in acquiring
and developing our collections,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.640
greeting visitors coming from
countries from our regions,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.550
and organizing programs,
symposia, workshops.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:46.220 position:56%
We're also have exhibits and special
displays, and we had a big one,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.950
a big exhibit on the Hebrew
book a few years ago which was,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.940
which brought in hundreds of
thousands of people to see some

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.150
of the treasures that we hold here.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.620
We are particularly happy to have
Avner Moriah here with us today.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.490
Not only because we
like to invite scholars

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.910
to discuss their productions,
their creations, their books

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.950
and how they use the materials in
the collections, in our collection,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.410
other collections, to write their
works or to produce their books,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.880
but we are happy because
Avner Moriah's works,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.370
his illustrations,
focus on the Bible.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.580
And, the Hebraic section's holdings
are especially strong in the areas

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.330
of the Bibles, or the
Bible and rabbinic liturgy

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.000
and Hebrew language and literature.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.590
The section is also expanding its
collection of modern artist books

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.850
on the Bible, and so it is fitting
to have Avner Moriah come and talk

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.560
to us about his journey through
the Bible, and how he became

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.280
such an illustrious artist.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.610
We hold his beautifully
illustrated book of Genesis

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.030
and have just acquired
his most recent.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.860
&gt;&gt; Don't give it away.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.580
&gt;&gt; Okay. I won't.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.880
I'm stopping here.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.180
I've been stopped,
so I do not continue.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.900
Okay. So, we will surprise you.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.200
I think, put it this way.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.820
We will surprise you, okay,
with a display of his books,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.170
of his illustrated books and
also of some of our treasures,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.000
some of our older Bibles, some of
the unique Bibles that we hold.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.860
So, that will be a surprise
at the end of the program.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.040
And now, Dr. Ann Brener, the Hebrew
specialist in the Hebraic section,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.510
will introduce our
speaker for today.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.060
[ Inaudible Conversation
and Laughter ]

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.360
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: I'm sorry.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.660
That just kind of popped out.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.050
It is a surprise.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.970
[laughs] The Bible has been a
constant focus of creativity

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.800 position:56%
through the ages, inviting scholars,
poets, artists, and dreamers to fill

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.460
in the gaps, flesh out the details,
and delve into the meanings.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.260
Today's speaker is
one of those artists,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.700 position:56%
and today's display a tribute to his
unique vision of a biblical text.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.810
Avner Moriah is one
of the best known

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.200
and widely collected
artists in Israel today.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.320
He is what we call in
Hebrew a [Hebrew language].

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.720
He's a national treasure.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.140
He is a Jerusalem artist
who was born in Jerusalem.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.640 position:56%
He lives and works in Jerusalem, but
his works have reached every corner

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.860
of the globe and they grace
the finest of collections,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.450
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
the Israel Museum in Jerusalem,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.860
the Art Institute of
Boston, and many, many more.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.830
Here in the Library of
Congress, we also collect him,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.870
and indeed his illuminated book
of Genesis as Dr. Deeb just said,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.690
it has long been one of our
favorite showpieces here

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.280
in the Hebraic section.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.910
We have a special surprise
for you today.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.360
Now, I'll say it.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.630
As you know, there will be a
display following today's talk,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.920
and you will be able to see
some really gorgeous examples

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.940
of Avner's work together
with some rare editions

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.450
of the biblical texts
that have inspired him.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.310
But, what you don't know
because we didn't know

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.390
until yesterday ourselves, was
that we're also going to be able

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.090
to display, I think for the first
time in America, his new book,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.320
his next book in his biblical
journey, the book of Exodus.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.530
It is absolutely gorgeous, and
it's on display for you afterwards.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.870
So, we're so delighted
that worked out.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.770
It was due to the generosity
of the Coven Family Endowment

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.850
that we were able to make
this really extravagantly

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.050
beautiful purchase.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.560
And, I'm delighted to have
the opportunity to thank them.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.820
I also want to thank the Ms. Golina
Teverovski [assumed spelling]

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.060
in Acquisitions Division who
worked some kind of magic

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.980
in getting this book straight from
the binding and into the shelves

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.710
of the Library of Congress
in record time,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.310
just in time for today's display.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.610
So, thanks to Golina.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.970
Are you here, Golina?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.540
No? Well, she deserves our thanks.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.900 position:56%
All great stories seem to begin with
a quest, and today we are privileged

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.860
to welcome Avner Moriah into our
reading room and hear firsthand

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.670
about his own journey
through the Bible.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Avner Moriah.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:57.120
[ Applause ]

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.470
&gt;&gt; Avner Moriah: Thank
you for having me.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.200
It's a great honor to be here,
and going to put my watch here

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.510
so I make sure that we keep
the time schedule right.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.060
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.340
I'm going to take you through a
quick journey through my work,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.050
and then we will concentrate
on the project

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.680
that I'm working on right now.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.830
Actually, I've been working on it

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.310
for the last 15 years is
"Illuminating the Text".

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:38.660
I didn't start as an illustrator,
but I came about this project

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.300
from painting the Israeli
landscape and other things.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.620
So, I'm going to give you a quick
run of how I go to where I go.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.330
So, what you see here is
works of mine from '78.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.830
I was a student at Bazalel.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.590
I, I'm a graduate of
Bazalel Academy of Art,

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.400
and Yale University
MFA program there.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.590
These are landscapes that I
painted in the Judean hills.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:16.330
This is a series that I did on
Israeli soldiers in the landscape.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:25.290
With [inaudible] of camouflage
behind it that what got me to work

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.380
on the subsequent was
the idea of camouflage.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:36.300
This, I did a large
series on the holocaust,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.790
and what inspired me there
was the movie "Shoah".

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:46.650 position:56%
My dear, with this subject matter is
usually we paint either the victims

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:52.360
or the perpetrators, and
I chose to paint both

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.850
because by putting the perpetrators
and the victims together in one,

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.330
on one canvas extends the
horror that actually took place.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.740
I, whenever I do a
series of paintings,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.470
I tend to go and do
serious research.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:17.600 position:56%
I went to Germany to look at the
works, the German expressionist work

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.110
that was done before the war,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.310
and you can really sense
that the war is coming.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.900
So, this is my stadium.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.110
This is the dining hall.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.210
This is a series that I did on the
expulsion of the Jews from Spain.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.990
Again, I went to Spain and looked
at the art that was done in Spain,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.040
and what was interesting
that right around 1492,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.410
you see a tremendous
amount of search

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.650
in the churches that
were all renovated.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:56.800 position:56%
And so, when you come to think about
it, it was either from money or gold

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:05.920
that came from South America or
money that came from the Muslims

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.570
or the Jews where the
church said to them,

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.160
"Prove to us that you're good
members of the community."

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.970
So, this is looting the synagogue.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.300
For years, I've been painting
the Israeli landscape.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.370
This is the Mount Sinai.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.320
I actually went to paint
next to Mount Sinai,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.140
and I have a small
anecdote about it.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.790
It is but when I stood and painted
there, in order to get to the point

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.880
that I wanted to paint, you
had to pass an Egyptian post,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.810
and there was an officer
that was standing there.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.280
And, for five days, he let me go.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.500
After five days, he
wanted baksheesh.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.110
But the Bedouins came to him
and said, "He's a good painter.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.410
Let him paint."

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.560
So, I didn't have to pay anything.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.550
So, that's just like a
nice human interaction.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.710
These are all landscapes
that I paint on site.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.100
These are large canvases.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.890
They're 42 inches by 80 inches.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:17.830
This is a sunset over the Sea
of Galilee with a Khamsin winds.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.500
These are views of Jerusalem.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.400
I'll just go quickly
through it so we can get

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.970
to the point where I want to.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.700
This is a painting of my wife.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.800
She passed away five years ago.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.890
She was the inspiration
of my Bible project,

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.330
the one that I'm working on now.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:45.750
What got me into dealing with the
Jewish text was an opportunity

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.050
that I got from JPS.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.100
I did two large murals for them.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.200 position:56%
The first one that you see here is,
I did a big project on the gathering

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.170
at Mount Sinai, and when we
looked for a place to do my mural

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.700
at the JPS, they said,
"Find any place

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.000
that you want in the building."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.870
So, I chose the staircase
that leads to the library,

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:17.390
and I thought of places that
we go up and down in the bible.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.790
And, I thought of Mount
Sinai because at Mount Sinai,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.000
we got the written
word and the, also.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.350
So, and there are other cases
of going up and down the ladder,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.290
like Joseph in the
pit or Jacob's ladder.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.260
The number ten occurred
because we have the ten plagues

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.810
and the ten commandments.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.210 position:56%
I thought of the ten Rabbis that
were executed by the Romans and the,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.280
and I thought also of ten
[inaudible] that dealt

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.430
with the gathering at Mount Sinai.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.840 position:56%
So, the centerpiece is the different
times that we went, that Moses goes

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.140
up and down the mountain.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.500
I mean, there's more than one
story about getting the Torah.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.620
And, the other panels around
are the different points

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.330
that I just mentioned.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:17.560
And, after I finished these murals,
people came to me and said, "Oh,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.860
you should do a Haggadah.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.000
You should do a Haggadah,
now, so I just finished the.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.610
So, this actually worked,
coincided with the first round

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.690
of my wife battling cancer, and I
thought of the Passover Haggadah

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:36.090
because we all go in
and out of Egypt.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.980
And, this is one of the pages

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.230
that Jerusalem is the
center of the universe.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.900
Actually, here, it's
interesting because the image

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.060
that I used was a painting
from Piero della Francesca,

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.070
"Resurrection of Christ",

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.920
and the resurrection
also deals with Passover.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.760
This is, again, an image
from the Passover Haggadah.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.230
When I, when I did these series, I
worked, again, very methodically.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.560
I did the many, many
drawings, many, many studies,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.740
and then I sit together
with my calligrapher.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.480
I'm totally dyslexic, so I don't
even come close to writing text

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.210
because the letters
have their own life.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.320
So, we design page after
page with my images,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.620
and I do everything twice.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.500 position:56%
I first do the preliminary studies,
and then I sit with the calligrapher

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.300
and we design page after
page with text and image.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:41.730
These are images, after I finish
this, I have a friend in New York.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.570
She is a curator of a museum.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:55.350
She said, "Oh, you should
do something more cheerful.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:01.350
How about doing some work about
[Hebrew language]" Like, tales.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:07.450
So, so, I thought of the
scroll of Esther because it's,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.140
she thought more like
Hansel and Gretel

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.560 position:56%
than stories like that, but I chose.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.640
And so, again, I went
and I studied the tale

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.950
of Esther or the scroll of Esther.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:32.920
And, I created 76 images where
I paint the visual story.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.310
I think one of the gifts
that I've been given

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.200
from whoever gives those gifts is
my ability to, when I read a text,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.420
to come up with a set design.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.890
That's why I showed you my
other works to see how I create

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:54.210
like a set design from
something that is abstract,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.550 position:56%
but if you give me very few details,
I can come with my own design so,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.820
and I work, again,
here very methodically.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.810
I looked at Persian
miniatures, Indian miniatures,

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.580
and I always make a point
about making that I live

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.400
and work in the Middle East.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.270
So, although you could see
that there's a three dimension,

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.510
but I also use the two
dimension design even

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.780
in my holocaust paintings.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:29.200
When I did them, I, there
are three ideas that I had.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.850
One is called "The Dance of Death".

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:37.030
That's a Nordic theme that
deals with mass killings.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.980
And, it was during the 100 year war

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.030
between the Protestants
and the Catholics.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:48.540
Also, there's a theme in Italian
southern theme that is called

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.870
"The Massacre of the Innocents".

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.740
They actually painted the
destruction of the temple.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.100
And then, I paint, I
thought of Egyptian art

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.370
because they deal with
life after death.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.850
And, I combined all
these images together

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.760
to create my own interpretation
of the text.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.360
It didn't make sense at the time
to try and copy any of the visuals

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.650
that you know the horrific
photographs,

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:17.230
but to come up with my own, so
to speak, hell that described

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.410
that period of our people.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.570
And, when you think about it,
you know, we have horrors going

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:29.220
on right now around the world,
and yet, we keep on our life as,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.830
you know, wherever we live,
we keep our life as it is.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.110
So, these images are I took
from Persian miniatures,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.960
and I also looked at the, like the
guys at the bottom getting drunk,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.100
I thought of Bruegel and
his guys getting drunk.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:55.080
The dancers, I picked
from Indian miniatures.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:06.500 position:56%
Bringing Esther to the palace, I
thought of these carriages that were

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.890
in France in the 1600s where they
were carrying their princesses

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:17.130
or in China to the palace.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.740
So, these are the drunks
from Bruegel.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.040
These are the dancers.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.340
These are the horses.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.490
Can see the dancers again.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.880
The image I used, this is
from an Indian miniatures.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:40.820
I used the images of Susa,
the capital of Persia.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.970
And, these are Muslim
miniatures that I looked at.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.000
You'll see when I get to my
scroll of Esther, this is Vermeer.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.790
Vermeer always has a twist in his
painting that in the background,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.010
he says something about what else
was going on the lives of the map,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.890
and deals with a sailor
and this woman is waiting

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.150
for her husband to come back.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.570
This is my scroll, my scroll
of Esther that is actually

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.410
in the collection of
the Library here.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:31.560 position:56%
And, when I did this scroll, I, it's
interesting how the text developed

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.350
through the works that I work here.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:40.040
I used a scribe to do the
writing, and I surrounded it all

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.440
around with text, with images.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:52.060
Here, I used a woman scribe, but
you could see, like, in the window,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.370
in the panel to, I would
say that would be your left,

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.950
where you see King
Ahasuerus wakes up at night.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.930
And, the images around his room
are what actually took place.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:17.830
So, this is Haman there sitting and
listening to Bigthan and Teresh,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.460
and then [foreign language].

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.510
You have Haman leading
Mordecai on the horse.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:30.090
And, also there's the gallows in
the door between the two guards

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:35.220
as a sign to what is
going to happen next.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.020
This is from a different
scroll that I did.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.350
Like, my, the scribes
that write the text

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:49.870
to send the messages
out, I give them glasses.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:56.520
I mean, they didn't have
glasses at the time, but.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:05.960 position:56%
Here, this is like the scene where
Haman falls on the, on Esther's bed.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.840
She was a very wise woman.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.750
She had no power, no property,
but she understood men.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.630
And so, she made sure
when it came to Haman,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:23.070
when Haman gets drunk,
he gets into trouble.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:28.510 position:56%
And, that's when Ahasuerus walks
into the room and sees Haman falling

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.530
on her bed, and off he goes.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.740
This is really an interesting
painting.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.680
This is a painting that was done by
Paulo Coelho, and it's a painting

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:50.880
about a Jewish merchant during
the period where of Passover

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.670
that the stories with
the blood, the actually.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:00.110
So, I took this image, and if you
know in the scroll of Esther, too,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.800
it's the end of it
becomes very, very violent.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.280
So, I used the image at the bottom
to paint a scene of violence

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.170
where they are breaking
into the home.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.660
These are pages from the scroll
that I just completed now.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.020
It's the longest scroll
of Esther ever done.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.800
It's 54 feet long, and
I'm going to take it

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.390
to the Guinness Book of Records.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:36.400
And, these are some of
the images that I did.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.720
I painted the two characters of
Bigthan and Teresh being hung

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:47.000 position:56%
and gave them red outfits like ISIS.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:54.020
Here, this is when Ahasuerus wakes
up in the middle of the night,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.970
so I put my two doggies,
[inaudible],

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.570
lying next to Ahasuerus's bed.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.930
I gave them gold beds.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.910
At home, they have plastic
beds, but this way I made sure

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:13.350
that they will become, they
will stay with us forever.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:22.750
This is the image of Haman
leading Mordecai through the town.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:28.990
These, now, we're getting to
the subject that I was planning

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.470
to talk about, and these are
sources from my visual images.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:38.470
This is from Egyptian tombs, so
you can see the different animals

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.270
that are used, both in
Genesis and in Exodus.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:49.970
This is from a Syrian wall relief
that I used also for my visuals.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.090
Here, when I painted Noah's
ark, I looked at this image.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.840
It's a monsoon flood.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.060
Now, from an Indian manuscript.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:11.060
This is, now we're getting into
my preliminary studies of the book

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:20.270 position:56%
of Genesis, and the image on the top
is God asking Cain why did his face

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.090
fall down, meaning why did
he, why does he look upset.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.000
So, I dropped his face down.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.260
See on the top left corner.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.800
This is Enoch walking with God.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.130
This is my images, my
preliminary studies for Genesis,

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.860
the six days of creation.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.260
So, I did more than one version.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.110
Actually, this project that I
did, I started it as a result

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:55.840
of my wife's second round
with cancer where the doctor.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.600
She went to a bone
marrow transplant,

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.570
and the doctors they played God.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.120
So, I figured if they can play God

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.740
and God could play God,
so I can play God, too.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.040
So, I created.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.190
That's how I got myself involved
with illustrating the Bible.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.790 position:56%
And, my thought was, you know,
instead of feeling sorry for myself,

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.900
to do something productive.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.960
This is the expulsion
from the garden.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.580
And, that's what I thought you
seeing here the ark how I used the

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:32.710
same element of the water that I
took from the Indian miniature.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.440
Here, I compared, this is
also a preliminary study.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.030
I compared the two buildings
that are in the book of Genesis.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.420
One is God's, by God's
will is the ark,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.750
and against his will
is the Tower of Babel.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:53.960
So, I painted it like an antenna,
a communication center today.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:00.140
These are all the characters
from Shem, Ham, and Japheth that

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.440
and all the way to Abraham.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.910
So, I just made them
up as we went along.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:10.000
This is the covenant
between Abraham and God.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.830
This is the Akeda, the
sacrifice of Isaac.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.000
This is Jacob's ladder.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.460
This is Joseph in the pit,
and it's really interesting.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.630
When you look at the two motives
of the two tales of Joseph

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.220
in the pit and the Akeda.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.540
It's very interesting because
the motives are exactly the same.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.100
In both places, there's a lie.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.000
Here we have an animal.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.630
Jacob asks the sons how did Joseph
die, and they, then he asks them

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:53.560
if an animal killed him, and they
say yes, but they're lying to him.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.140
Here, Abraham lies to Isaac

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:02.990
when Isaac asks him they don't
have anything to sacrifice.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.130
"What are we going to sacrifice?"

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.840
And, Abraham knows he's
going to sacrifice him,

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.800
but he says, "God will provide."

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.320
So, that's the lie here.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:17.040
In both cases, we have another
animal that gives its sacrificed.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.340
Here's the ram.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.550
And, here is the goat that they use

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:30.250
for to cover the coat
of many colors.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.130
Here, we have the Midianites
that end

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.220
up buying Joseph, and
we have foreigners.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:45.440
And, here we have the youth
that came along sitting behind.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.990
Here, they go up the mountain,
and here Joseph is in the pit,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.060
and Jacob says to the
sons that he will go

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.760
to the underworld to look for him.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.210
So, it's really interesting.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:04.620
Both tales deal with breaking
basic rules, basic godly rules

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:11.960
that the firstborn gets the
birthright, and in both cases,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.420
both parents give it
to somebody else.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.040
And, the, and so it's real
interesting that the two tales are,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.570
have the same motifs in them.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:29.080
Here, I did a page of animals
in the book of Genesis.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.130
This is the pages from Genesis.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.630 position:56%
I just wanted to show you how I, so
I did all these preliminary studies,

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:41.590
and then I sit with my calligrapher
and we decide page after page.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.700
This is really an interesting
page because here there's a short,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.570
mythological tale about the sons
of God that come down and mate

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.220
with earthly women,
and God is worried

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.520
that they're going to live forever.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.820
So, he limits their
lives to 100 years.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.990
So, I give them a Canaanite burial.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.830
This is, you can see the
development of the flood

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.150
where here the ark
is coming towards us

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.980
where before it was
like going across.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.930
Here I made the page
again with characters,

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.330
and the one in the bottom
right is how they spread

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.880
around the Mediterranean Basin.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.250
This is, again, the image of
the ark and the tower of Babel.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.340
So, you see, I do do
everything twice.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.800
I'm not lazy.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.430
This is the covenant
between Abraham and God.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.150
This is the Akeda.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.100
This is when Rivka
falls off the camel.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.130
I want to say about my
images when I paint them.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.010
Because I painted for many, many
years the Israeli landscape,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:57.760
I have a nice sensibility and
use of colors, and to create,

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.040 position:56%
I bring them into the
contemporary paintings that I paint.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.680 position:56%
And, you know, through the
renaissance artists painted biblical

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.540
scenes, but they painted
the wrong landscape

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.740
and the wrong clothes
and their own setups.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.210
So, here, I brought the landscapes
of Israel into the story.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.230
This is Jacob's ladder.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:29.210
Here, I used, when Laban goes
after, when Jacob sees Laban,

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.300
he says to him, how
come your face is not

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.880
like yesterday and the day before?

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.560
So, I have his face, I
gave him three heads.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.930
Today, yesterday, and
the day before.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:49.260
Here, I made a page of all the
dreams in the book of Genesis.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.230
When we get to Joseph going down
to Egypt, I tried to paint it more

00:30:54.230 --> 00:31:00.920
like Egyptian hieroglyphs, and
in the bottom right corner,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.720
it says that before Jacob,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:09.830
Joseph went to see
pharaoh, he cleaned himself.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.130
So, I gave him a shower.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:18.820
This is the last page of Genesis,
and there's a development of God

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.210
because in the first book
of, in the first tale

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.750
of Genesis, God is not forgiving.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:27.240
Adam and Eve sinned, and he
kicks them out of the garden.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.770
In the last tale of Genesis,
Joseph and the brothers return

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.320 position:56%
from the land of Canaan, and they're
worried he's going to kill them.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.830
And, he turns to them and said,
"I was sent by God to save us all

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:47.480
and endure what I had to endure for
the sake of keeping us all alive."

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.050
This is the page.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.250
I also did it in English.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.260
In English, it's about
1/3 more in length

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.910
because of the amount of words.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.690
I also did some oil painting,
the result of my project.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:06.990
These are all canvases.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.290
Cain and Abel.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.180
This is the book of Exodus.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.880
So, this page, I thought
of Moses when he goes

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:29.320
and he sees the burning bush,
and my idea is that when we study

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.440
with a professor in the
university, they're not that smart.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.880
But, they usually they have one
or two ideas that they try to get

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.170
into our heads, and they keep on
repeating it over and over again.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.430
But, we don't hear it until
we're ready to hear it.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.840
So, that's my idea of the
burning bush, that Moses passed

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:53.410
that burning bush many, many times
for years when he was with Jethro,

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.640
but only when he was ready
to hear God, he saw him.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.300
And, that's when the
burning bush was on fire.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:07.250
This is the gathering
at Mount Sinai.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.140
Here, I took this image

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.460
by a [foreign language] the
heart of pharaoh hardened.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.170
But, in Hebrew [foreign language]
means also that it was heavy.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.500
So, I took an image from the
Book of the Dead where the heart,

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.040
if your heart was heavier
than a feather,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:31.130
you didn't go to the underworld.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.170
Here, I can, I took ideas.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.110
When God stops the Egyptians

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:41.720
from chasing the Israelites
he uses first fire.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.510
And so, fire is not a motif
in the Egyptian culture.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:52.730
It's a motif in the Assyrian
culture, in the east cultures.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:58.200 position:56%
So, I thought, and my idea about
all these tales that wherever we are

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.840
in the Middle East, in and
around the Mediterranean Basin,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.470
we all use the same tales.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:10.590
So, here, I have the Egyptians
dying in the, drowning in the sea.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.830
But, I also use the tale
about Marduk and Tiamat.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:21.940
Tiamat is going to kill all
the lesser gods and her son,

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:28.110
and the lesser gods come to
Marduk and ask him to save them.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.880
And, there's no way to save them

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.910
because nobody can kill her,
but she has seven heads.

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:35.080
So, he drowns one of
her heads in the lake.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.380
She opens her mouth.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.900
He puts a dagger in her
mouth and kills her.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:44.770
When we get out of the story of
the crossing the sea, we thank God,

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.210
and we're ready to build a temple.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.870
We haven't been to Jerusalem yet or
to Mount Sinai or any other place,

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.790
but we're ready to
build him a temple.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.910 position:56%
And, these guys, also, after they're
so pleased that they were saved,

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:58.540
they build the city of
Babel and bring humans

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.860
to worship [inaudible] there.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.690
So, it's not the same story,
but there's similarities,

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:09.200
so I compare the two tales.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:16.200
This is that we were
carried on eagle's wings.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.240
Here, the skinny cats, cats.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.460
The skinny cows eat the fat cows

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.900
but also Moses's crocodile eats
the crocodiles of the Egyptians.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.570
Here, I compared the ten
plagues to ten Egyptian gods

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:36.270
because every time Moses comes to
pharaoh, he says, "I want to go

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.040
and sacrifice to my God,"
and he doesn't allow them.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.960
So, if you can't feed, if
you won't let me feed my God,

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.330
I won't let you feed your gods.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.380
Here, I compared the angel of death
to the angel that saved Isaac.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:01.970 position:56%
So, these are some of the pages from
Exodus that you're going to see.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.810
These are pages from Leviticus.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.370
These are called the menu.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:32.700
These are all the animals we
can't eat, the non-kosher animals.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:40.990
So, here, with leprosy, I used
images from Bruegel's lepers.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.470
These are, I'm going to show you
one or two pages from the book

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.430
of Leviticus that I'm
working on right now.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.950
I painted it with black and gold.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.960
That's it.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.650
I did pass my allowance,
but not by much.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.950
But, I'm an Israeli, so.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: I know we all enjoyed
that wonderful talk by Avner Moriah.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.160
And, I'm sure a lot of you have
questions, but we were thinking

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.870 position:56%
that perhaps we just invite you back

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.820
into the conference
room for the display.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.790
And, Avner will be talking
about his paintings there

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.650
with the books right before you.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.480
So, you'll be able to ask him
any question that you like there.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.880
So, please, let's give him
another hand, and please let's come

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.180
into the conference room.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.060
[ Applause ]

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.340
Thank you very much.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.990
