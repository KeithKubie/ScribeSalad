00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.730
What's the answer? If B is the resigner,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.820
we don't really care about the other column anymore.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.610
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.690
&gt;&gt; Then what's going to happen is A is mixing between resigning and holding.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.934
&gt;&gt; Yap.

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.320
&gt;&gt; And probability P is a probability of being a holder,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.090
so whatever P, whenever that event happens it gets ten, and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.950
whenever one the opposite of it happens it gets minus five,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.710
so I want to say ten p plus one minus p five.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.190
is that your.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.950
&gt;&gt; Let me try that again.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.850
&gt;&gt; Is that your final answer?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.370
&gt;&gt; Ten p. Well I could simplify it.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well then say it to me again. I'll write it

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.281
out here so it's easy for you to see. Okay and that is.

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.130
&gt;&gt; My answer?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.500
&gt;&gt; That's fair. Do you want to simplify it? You don't have to.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.550
&gt;&gt; Sure, let me simplify it, so it's a minus minus

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.230
p five and a ten p so that's fifteen P minus one.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.110
&gt;&gt; Minus what?

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.010
&gt;&gt; One.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.890
&gt;&gt; Minus what?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.750
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.690
&gt;&gt; Uhun,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.010
there you go. Thank you.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.560
&gt;&gt; That's correct. We would obviously accept either

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.500
answer or any combination of those letters. That, [LAUGH]

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.530
&gt;&gt; No, I think I might have to do this quiz over actually.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.210
&gt;&gt; No, not the one. I'm talking about either 15 p minus

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.250
five or ten p minus one minus p times five. Or ten

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570
p plus one minus p times minus five. Or any other combination

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.370
that we can get push car to actually Bothered to, you know.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.610
&gt;&gt; Check.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.680
&gt;&gt; Im, Implement or check. Okay. Well, that was pretty good. And this,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.510
of course, is exactly the expected profit. As you put it, P

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.150
times A as a holder and P times or P percentage 1

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.070
minus P percentage A chooses to be a resigner. And so it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.720
just the weighted average between those two values. So, Kent, let me

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.720
just double check that. So, if P is 0, that means it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.800
never holds, it means it always resigns and it gets -5, so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.880
that's right and if P is 1, means it always holds, so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.560
it should get a +10. And 15 -5 is 10. So, boom!

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.570
it works. You used math there, very good. Okay, what about B?

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.660
&gt;&gt; B. So the same story, except on the seer side.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.231
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.280
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I might need that space again.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.620
So 5, oh I see, right, minus 5 times p.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.271
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.200
&gt;&gt; Plus 5 times 1 minus p.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. If we simplify that we get.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.840
&gt;&gt; There's a minus 5 and another minus 5. So we get minus 10 p.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.889
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Plus 1.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.800
&gt;&gt; Plus what?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.690
&gt;&gt; Plus 5.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.200
&gt;&gt; There you go. See you learned. Okay you want to check it?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.870
&gt;&gt; yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. So again if P is 1, then that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.950
means you're always which should be the minus 5 and if we put in a 1

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.990
there, we get 5 minus 10 is minus 5. And if P is 0, that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.090
means that we're always a resigner, and we should get a 5 for that. And yeah,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.530
so we zero out the negative 10 and we get the 5.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.140
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.940
&gt;&gt; Now, it's not clear to me why we're playing this game. Oh, it is clear to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.350
me why we're playing this game, because we

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.460
want to figure out something about. Strategy that is mixed.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.160
&gt;&gt; So this is how well a mixed strategy does, but

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.270
not against another mixed strategy.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.950
This is against two deterministic strategies.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.340
&gt;&gt; But is it, Michael? But is it? So

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.670
&gt;&gt; I'm going to, oh, okay.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.770
&gt;&gt; I'm going to notice something here, which is that you,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.930
as you astutely pointed out earlier, we have two functions. Of P or to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.200
equations of P, and by the way, do you know what they are? They're lines.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.720
&gt;&gt; Sure, because it's just a, it's linear in P, so that's what linear means.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.070
&gt;&gt; Right, so what would happen you, do you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.810
think if we were to actually draw these lines?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.480
&gt;&gt; I think we'd have two lines.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.730
&gt;&gt; Yes, and what would those two lines

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.350
look like? Let's take a look, shall we?

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.830
&gt;&gt; Sure.
