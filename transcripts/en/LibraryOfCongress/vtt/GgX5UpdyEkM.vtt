00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt;From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.303
&gt;&gt;It's my pleasure today to
introduce author, Thomas Mallon.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.216
He has written 14 books and
he has both an international

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.410
and national audience but I'm
happy to say he is a local writer.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.530
He lives in Washington and I was
told just before I came up here

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.250
that he is working on a
novel about Watergate.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.830
His previous novels include
<i>Henry and Clara</i>, <i>Two Moons</i>,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.416
and <i>Dewey Defeats
Truman</i> among others.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.716
They have been renowned especially
those with historical settings

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.333
for the detail, and the
research, and the nuance

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.753
with which they depict times
removed from the present.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.986
Thomas has also punched his
bureaucratic ticket in Washington.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.473
He worked for the NEH and served
as the deputy chairman of the NEH

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.236
and he is the recently
appointed director

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.500
of the Creative Writing Program
at George Washington University.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.970
He occasionally dabbles
in journalism and some

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.630
of you remember a recent
<i>New Yorker</i> article

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.256
in which he had the temerity

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.720
to question the reflexive respect
that's paid to an obscure novel know

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.326
as <i>TO Kill a Mockingbird</i>.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.343
He called it "moral Ritalin" I
think, a phrase that I rather like.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.630
His most recent book is <i>Yours
Ever: People and Their Letters</i>.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.576
And so here to tell you
about it is Thomas Mallon.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.180
[ Applause ]

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.313
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: Good afternoon.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.580
Thank you for coming.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.980
It's nice to be here again.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.306
I remember being here the
first time back in 2001,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.986
with my fiction hat
on I think that year.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.300
This time I've got
nonfiction hat on.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.213
I'm going to talk a little bit
about this book about letters

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.973
that I've written called
<i>Yours Ever</i>.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.440
When I was out doing the things
one does promoting a book,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.853
one radio interviewer asked me a
really good question about how --

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.060
if there was a fire in your house
and, you know, you could go in

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.540
and you save one thing,
what would save,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.286
the photographs or the letters?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.456
And it's kind of an impossible
question but I remember saying,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.913
I was thinking particularly about my
parents, both of them are gone now.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.540
And I thought the letters because
I would remember what they looked

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.993
but the letters are so evocative

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.863
of their personalities,
their handwriting.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.866
They both had kind of sad,
long, protracted, declines

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.466
and it's visible in the way
they would write letters.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.773
And, you know, the ones that they
sent me when I was a freshman

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.206
in college I still have them
with the six cents stamp

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.460
with Franklin Roosevelt on it and
they're evocative of the whole time.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.613
And so I wanted to write
this book about a genre

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.946
that there's no getting
around it is dying out.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.726
Letters are becoming a
kind of specialty genre.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.570
We reserve them now for special
occasions like sympathy letters.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.416
Most of us still think it's kind
of tacky to send a sympathy e-mail,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.203
you know, or a sympathy text
I think would be rock bottom

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.173
in terms of the human spirit.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.910
But the everydayness
of letters which is

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.120
to a great extent being
replaced by e-mail and so forth

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.530
which we're not really saving
despite our ability to archive it.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.896
We're not really holding
onto it all that much.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.976
This is something that we're
losing something we need

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.816
to really I think cope with.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.146
And I tried to make this
book, which explores some

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.280
of the great letter
writing of all time.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.146
It's not an anthology.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.736
As one person said, its anthology
told in the anthologist own words.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.486
There is a lot of quotation
from letters but it's a kind

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.796
of running commentary on collections
of letters that intrigue me,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.923
excited me, that I
liked, that annoyed me.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.953
It's very whimsical.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.233
It doesn't try to be
encyclopedic and inclusive.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.673
It tries to suggest the whole
terrain that's out there

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.093
without actually being
absolutely comprehensive.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.286
I started this book in 1994.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.620
It was 13 years overdue
at the publisher

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.660
by the time I handed it in.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.993
When I started writing
it a stamp cost 29 cents.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.990
I did not have an e-mail account.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.280
No one had any idea what texting
is or what Twittering might be.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.233
I still have half an idea of it.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.280
Somebody recently told me that
emailing is for old people.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.836
Somebody who lives her entire life
texting now and I generally bring

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.623
up the rear where technology
is concerned.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.890
I'm not a guide to the future.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.436
So I thought maybe I could have some
usefulness as a guide to the past.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.860
But when I started writing the book,
I really didn't know that we were

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.866
on the verge of this
enormous sea change.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.896
And the book was always intended
to be companion volume to a book

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
about diaries that I had
written 25 years ago.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.466
Same kind of approach,
opinionated, old fashion, whimsical,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.876
what interested me, what I
hoped might interest readers.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.403
And I thought I wanted to
suggest the same kind of landscape

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.003
about letter writing without
being kind of a scold.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.710
I mean the book is unquestionably
or implicitly nostalgic.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.866
I mean I do think we're on
the verge of losing something

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.473
with the disappearance of the letter
as an everyday form of activity.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.246
But, you know, I didn't
want to be hectoring

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.720
and I'm entering my kind of, you
know, Andy Rooney years anyway.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.550
I doubt miss this.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.216
Whenever -- I mean I
didn't want to do that.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.216
I eventually embraced
all of the technology.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.683
I e-mail, I text, I do not Twitter.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.476
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: But,
you know, I'm with it.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.736
Although I still think that the --

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.303
to me the absolute
perfect thing was the fax.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.156
To me it was the sweet spot.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.980
It had a very brief life, the
fax but it combined the best

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.933
of both worlds; it
was fast, efficient.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.790
Jessica Mitford, the great English
writer who got used to faxing

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.820
at the very end of her life
when she was in her 80s,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.200
she adapted all these letter
conventions to the fax.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.653
She would fax her sister back and
write yours of 9:54 p.m., received.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.213
And you had something to hold onto.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.266
And it just seemed to me my
preferred stopping point.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.546
But the fax had really
a very brief life.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.930
I think it was in the saddle
as a mode of communication

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.850
for probably five years before
everybody turned to e-mail.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.116
This book is organized around
the motives people have

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.313
for writing letters.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.913
Why they actually write them.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.580
The chief reason has
always been absence

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.363
and the letter is a
bridge over distances.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.446
You couldn't travel to
somebody you were separated

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.326
from so there's a chapter
about such things.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.280
Friendship, the way in which
there are certain friendships

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.110
that really exist not
on paper alongside

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.513
in person, but exist only on paper.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.656
One of them, my favorite ones is
the friendship between George Sand,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.980
the French kind of bestselling
writer of the 19th century,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.180
and Flaubert, the artistic
agonizer squeezing out the [

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.970


00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.776
indiscernible], torturing
himself over every word.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.653
And George Sand says, oh, you know,
my proofs of novel came today.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:48.820
I usually don't bother with them.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.486
I don't bother reading them.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.836
And, you know, Flaubert is
neurotic about everything.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.203
I think and yet she
understood his neuroses and she

00:07:59.470 --> 00:07:59.726
to him was this kind
of earth mother figure.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.680
I think if they saw one
another in person all the time,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.200
they would've driven one
another absolutely crazy

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.630
and yet it worked on paper.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.030
It was the right medium for that.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.230
And it think you may
have experienced

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:16.673
that in your own letter writing.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.406
I'm sure that you e-mail
with certain people

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.600
and much prefer e-mailing
with them than being

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.860
on the telephone with them.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.460
And I think we -- relationships
adapt

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.530
to whatever medium
we carry them out in.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.130
There's a chapter on advice,
letters particularly --

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.116
letters from parents to children
who frequently been full of advice.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.776
There's a whole collection
of Scott Fitzgerald's letters

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:43.630
to his daughter Scotty when she
was a young woman and Vassar.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.176
And his advice is very particular.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.706
But one day when he's in
a more generalizing mood,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.380
he says to herself, just do
everything completely differently

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.863
from what your mother and I did
and you should be all right.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.550


00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.223
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: There's
a chapter on complaint.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.360
Sometimes letters used for
serious reformist complaint.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.193
Florence Nightingale when
she arrives in the Crimea

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.693
and is horrified by the hospital
conditions sends back these

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.686
scathing, vivid letters to the
war office in England that lead

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.193
to a complete revolution in
the way medicine is practiced

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.726
on the battlefield.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.953
And the fact that she could sustain
these complaints day after day

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.233
and letter after letter had an
enormous effect on the world.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.800
That chapter includes that
it's outer stream, hate mail

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.816
and goes all the way
up to the Unabomber.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.070
Needless to say, there are
love letters in the book.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.530
The correspondence
between George Bernard Shaw

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.073
and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the
actress, a chased correspondence

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.370
but they had a kind of flirtation
without any physicality to it.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.326
They refer to themselves as
lusty lions at one point.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.310
And eventually when she's
down on her luck financially,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.120
she wants to sell his
letters to make some money.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.650
He resists and tries to explain
to her that there's a difference

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.520
between physical property, the
ownership of the actual paper letter

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:19.850
and intellectual property,
his words.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.350
You can't quote them
without violating copyright.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.490
She never can grasp this distinction
no matter how many times he explains

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.783
it to her and she finally with
hurt feelings says Dear Joey,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.066
which she called him
for unusual reasons,

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.463
my letters are worth two cents,
yours 50 quid so bother to answer.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.566
And she gave up on the idea.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.566
The worst set of love letters
of all time, the love letters

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.000
between the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.340
Sickening.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.340
Sickening.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.553
I mean yes we all say things in love
that we don't say in other context.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.193
We, yes, we talk baby talk
even on paper sometimes.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.713
But to listen to the man who was
supposed to be King of England go on

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.750
and in this infantile
manner letter after letter,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.860
after letter is kind of sick making.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.980
And they always sign themselves
"we" because it blended Wallace,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.650
Wallace Simpson and Edward
the Eighth and they --

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.136
each time they put it down, they
act as if it's the quaint age

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.620
of all time and are amazed by it.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.353
There's confessions.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.286
A whole chapter devoted to people
who write letters to say things

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.073
that they can't say or won't say to
their nearest and dearest in person.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.123
Lady Melbourne who was on
of Byron's acquaintances.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.636
She was the mother-in-law to his
onetime mistress, Caroline Lamb,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:56.936
the woman who famously
said that Byron was mad,

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.623
bad and dangerous to know.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:01.836
Her mother-in-law, Lady
Melbourne remained his confidant

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.216
after the affair and when he
disastrously married Annabella

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.470
Milbanke, he wrote to Lady
Melbourne, I got a wife and a cold

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.670
on the same day but have got
rid of the last pretty speedily.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.500


00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.930
And other chapters
on prison and war.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:21.553
I think the greatest war
letters of all time are the ones

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.673
that Wilfred Owen, the poet,
sent home from the front.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.263
Owen, nobody's idea of a soldier,
although he became quite a good one

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.573
but was the most kind of
delicate, sensitive personality,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.520
the last boy you would imagine
being sent to the front.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.833
There is no more vivid
documentary of the First World War

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:47.983
than the letters that Owen
sent home to his mother.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.103
One of the things that
he was in charge

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.970
of as a company officer was taking
care of the mail and making sure

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.563
that it got distributed
to the soldiers

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.963
when it arrived at the front.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.896
And one of this duties
was when that soldier

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.150
to whom the letter was addressed was
dead, to get the letter returned.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.970
And he writes to his mother
late in the war when he,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.410
this very sensitive fellow has
become hardened to everything.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:15.966
He says I now don't even take
the cigarette out of my mouth

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.120
when I write deceased
over the envelope.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.873
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: It's
a shattering picture

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.740
of what war is actually
like day-to-day.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.246
And I thought I would say since
we're in Washington, there are a lot

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.060
of presidents' letters in this book.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.300
They come and go in all
different kinds of chapters.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.650
Thomas Jefferson's letters to
his children and grandchildren,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.163
not letters that would
have made them rush

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.410
to open the envelopes
every time they saw one.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.733
My for all of his genius,
he could be difficult.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.550
He really tries to run
their lives impart wisdom.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.490
There's not exactly a light
touch to the Jefferson letters

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.470
but they're fascinating for
their intellectual content.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.896
Lincoln, for all that
we know about Lincoln,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.266
we only have about 400
of Lincoln's letters.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.353
They're masterly but they're
very different from the Lincoln

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.706
that we know of as a man.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.566
They're very short.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:21.536
The greatest storyteller ever
to occupy the White House.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.996
Lincoln always had time
for an illustrative story,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.786
the way Ronald Reagan always
like to stop the action.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.383
And let me -- it reminds
me of a story.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.230
Lincoln in his letters has
no time for storytelling.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.193
They're short, they're urgent

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.430
and Lincoln made during the
civil war an immediate adaptation

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.976
to the telegram.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.643
He communicated with him
battlefield generals by telegram

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.176
and was often extremely terse
and extremely pointed with them.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:56.906
He gets a letter from General
McClellan who's so slow

00:14:59.620 --> 00:14:59.686
and never getting anything done

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.063
and he just asks him would
you mind telling me what it is

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.043
that your horses have
done to become so fatigued

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.150
because you never seem
to move out of camp.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.416
Franklin Roosevelt, a master

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.410
of the short affectionate note
does not write long letters

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.823
but writes these cards that were --

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.873
I mean Winston Churchill said
meeting Franklin Roosevelt it was

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.306
like your first glass of champagne

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.440
and that's what Roosevelt's notes
were like, short, pick-me-ups,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.226
often encouraging, very
light, a kind of tonic.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.726
Teddy Roosevelt, an advice
giver, wrote many, many --

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.130
he's the champion of
presidential letter writers,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.903
wrote 150,000 of them and wrote
many of them to his children

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.106
that were full of advice about
how to live the strenuous life.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.923
They're often very tender, full
of nicknames, silliness, nonsense,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:56.660
and they're always
written on the fly

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.333
because he's always doing
something very strenuous.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:01.763
And Roosevelt to one of his children
writes my favorite postscript

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.610
of all time.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.343
After writing this very
affectionate letter to his child,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.810
"P.S. I have just killed a bear."

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.610


00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.856
If I were ask you to wind up here.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.853
If I were to ask you what president
you thought was the champion love

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.893
letter writer of all time in the
White House, who would answer?

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.753
Or let me put the question
differently,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.240
who would you say would be least
likely with the possible exception

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.906
of Richard Nixon because
that's the kind of gimme, like,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.636
take Nixon off the table.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.770
And he wrote actually
very charming letters

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.170
to Pat Nixon when he courted her.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.903
But who might be just
about the least likely?

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.590
[ Shouts from audience ]

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.446
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: Taft,
I'm that's, you know,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.080
I can't think of a
better answer than that.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.510
Maybe just on physical grounds but
my answer would've been at least

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.983
when I was writing this, Woodrow
Wilson, so pinched, so professorial,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.543
you know, with the severe little
glasses looking like he just come

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.650
from the Princeton Lecture Hall, the
most scholarly of our presidents.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.316
Well, in fact, Wilson arrived
at the White House married

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.346
to his first wife, Ellen who
died of Bright's disease in 1914,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.686
the second year that he was there.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.226
He went into a tremendous depression
afterwards, which his relatives

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.766
and friends tried to bring
him out of by introducing him

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.973
to a woman named Edith Galt who
was a very plump, lively widow.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.196
She was married to the man
who ran Galt's Jewelry Store,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.963
which was in Washington
for nearly 200 years.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.500
And they introduced the two

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.766
of them hoping it would divert
Wilson from his troubles.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.166
Well, they got more
than they bargained for.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.356
This famously professorial
figure was mad

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.290
for her from the first moment.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.730
They met and they begin
sending letters across town.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.283
She only lives blocks away but they
begin sending letters sometimes two,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.653
three times a day to each other.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.966
And though I would read you
just a couple of paragraphs.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.383
This is the way the book kind
of carries this combination

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.736
of commentary and quotation.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.170
Edith Galt was a less
cerebral companion

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.050
than Ellen, his first wife had been.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.356
In one decollate portrait, this
juicy corporeal presence looks

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.790
like Madame X as seen
through the eyes of Botero.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:42.770
And it not hard to
imagine how Wilson

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:49.043
who once said he was carrying a
volcano inside felt ready to blow.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.696
"If I ever again have to with
you for an hour and half",

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:55.836
he writes her on June 5th,
"with only two stolen glances

00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.550
to express my all but irresistible
desire to take you in my arms

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.790
and smother you with kisses, I
am sure I shall crack an artery."

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400


00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.753
Two weeks later while Edith has tea
at the White House with Helen Bones,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.660
his niece who was one of the
people who fixed him up with Edith,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.673
Wilson hides behind some lace
curtains in the Green Room.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.070
Taft could not have done that.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.336
He would not have fit behind them.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.190
And he writes to her afterwards
that he quote, "Feasted his eyes

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.853
on the loveliest person in the world
with oh, so such a longing to go

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.100
to her and take her in my arms
and cover her with kisses."

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:38.420
He more than once talks about
his competing personalities,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.386
"The boy that is in me who
has found a perfect playmate.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:45.796
The lover in me who has found love

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.930
like his own and the
man of affairs."

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.973
And in a summer of war fevers,
this is 1915, he turns Edith's love

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.733
for him into her patriotic duty.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.623
"I am absolutely dependent on
intimate love for the right

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.940
and free, and most
effective use of my powers.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.040
Consider what it costs my
work to do without it."

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.286
I would say that is a unique
of epistolary blackmail.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.390


00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.870
You have to do this
for your country.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.610


00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.410
The White House usher in those
days had the very strange name

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.270
of Ike Hoover.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.470
It almost sounds as if it
was an Republican plant

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.493
in the Wilson White
House with these names

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.573
of future Republican presidents.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.956
And Lincoln -- Wilson would send
him down to the old post office,

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.643
what's down on Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.110
where I used to work
when I was at the NEH.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.310
He would send him down in the
evening to see if the 9:30 mail

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:55.930
from New York had come in when
Edith was traveling and to see

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.730
if it had brought anything from her.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.496
He eventually suffered from writer's
cramp because he was writing

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:06.510
so many handwritten
letters and began

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.776
to type his love letters
on a Hammond portable.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.396
But these letters, I think, they
give a glimpse of a president

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:17.650
that we could not get any other way.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.300
And I'll just end with one
letter that he writes to her

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.200
on a Saturday night
in August of 1915

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.126
where he provides an unforgettable
glimpse of his presidential self.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.530
"I got back to the house before the
band concert on the south lawn was

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.696
over and heard I fancied the
greater part of the program

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.596
as I sat writing at my desk.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.446
At the end when they played
the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i>,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.480
I stood up all alone",
in his office.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.993
"I stood up all alone here
by my table at attention

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.433
and had unutterable thoughts
about my custody of the traditions

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.780
and the present honor
of that banner.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.733
I could hardly hold the tears
back and then the loneliness."

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.980
And I don't think this is
a glimpse you would get

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.023
of Woodrow Wilson in any other way.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.610
I don't think you would get
in any other form but a letter

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.326
and I don't think you would
get it in any other --

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.106
to any other recipient other

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.240
than this woman he was completely
mad for and unguarded with.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:21.683
Once they married, which
they did, in the White House,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.010
the letter stopped which is
the usual kind of ironic thing

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:30.780
about any collection of love letters
that ends a successful courtship,

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.580
there's no need for them anymore.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.263
The two are together and so
they cease writing letters

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:45.003
but together they must have been
thinking of those letters on the day

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.450
in 1918 when the two of
them together cut the ribbon

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.576
and inaugurated the
first airmail service

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.000
of the United States Post Office,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.733
a boon to lovers everywhere
for many decades.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.353
Thank you very much.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.520
[ Applause ]

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.596
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: If
there's time for a question

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:16.663
or two I'd be happy to take one.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.396
There are microphones there.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.463
Two fast questions the
pavilion man tells me.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.900
Anybody? This gentleman.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.136
&gt;&gt;Have you seen any of
Obama's love letters?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.666
&gt;&gt;No, I haven't but I would
not pass up the opportunity.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.850
You know one of the
things that is interesting

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.780
and I think a little bit sad
now is we have a President

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:47.810
in the White House who is
a very graceful writer.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.123
He is a book writer man

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.673
who can write his own
books when he wants to.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.543
But I don't think we
will know him from --

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.116
we won't know his presidency
from the letters he writes,

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.016
the personal letters and so forth.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:09.083
Since Richard Nixon, there's been
what commentators like to call a

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.210
"chilling effect" on
presidential correspondence,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.703
just as we will never have tapes
made again in the Oval Office.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.920
Presidents, I think, are much
more reserved about putting things

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.180
on paper than they used to be.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.026
When Hillary Clinton was the First
Lady, she said quite seriously

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:26.693
that she would like to be keeping a
diary of her time in the White House

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.176
but she knew that eventually
it would wind being subpoenaed

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.036
for something so she didn't.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:36.983
And I think we are
the poorer for that.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.876
I mean it'll be -- we'll know
the President through some

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.290
of his writings but
not through the kind

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.090
of personal writings
that Wilson had.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.803
And this last one, yes.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.270
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.320
I was just wondering whether
you have any point of view

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.753
about all the letters that were
destroyed by families and --

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.516
like I think of Jane
Austen's letters that were --

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.283
a lot of them burned by her sister.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.496
How do you account for
the letters that survive

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.246
and what do you think separates
these different circumstances?

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.916
&gt;&gt;Thomas Mallon: Well,
it's, you know,

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:13.650
it's a very interesting question.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.080
It's very difficult for somebody
who wants to get rid of a group

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.486
of letters because they are
going to recall some sad,

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.970
painful, private situation.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.813
It's very difficult to say to that
person, no, you have an obligation

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.500
to literary history, you have
an obligation to biographers

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.286
who may be coming after you.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.753
I mean many writers have done this.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.610
Dickens famously had his
bonfire on Gads Hill when he got,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.753
you know, rid of many things.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.540
I do thinks it's mostly a
question for the archivist

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.360
at the Library of Congress.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:46.840
The most urgent question at
the moment is how are we going

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.166
to save those letters
and communications and by

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.420
that I really mean, e-mail from
writers, famous people, so forth

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.896
and make them available
to scholars and writers

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:02.700
and just ordinary readers the
way we've had letters available

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.520
to us for so long.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.123
That is still so much influx now and
it's not really a settled question.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.346
So I think that's a real
challenge for the librarians

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.353
when they're not putting on
the festival to contend with.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.543
Okay. Thank you very much.
