00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.639
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:11.059
In the video today, we're looking at whether
or not it's actually possible to speed read.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.369
Approximately 95% of college educated individuals
read at a rate between 200-400 words per minute

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.420
according to extensive research done by University
of Massachusetts Amherst professor Dr. Keith

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.420
Rayner.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.960
However, there exists a small, but rather
vocal subset of people who insist that they

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.189
can read several times faster than this using
various speed reading techniques.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.680
With very little searching, you’ll also
find many-a-company claiming that after going

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.100
through their program or using their app regularly,
you can easily read even as many as 1,000

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.100
words per minute.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.350
Tim Ferriss of Four Hour Work Week fame offers
a method for increasing speed in reading for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.890
free on his website, claiming with this method,
you’ll see an average increase in reading

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.300
speed of about 386% in just three hours of
practice.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.320
So is any of this really possible?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.850
When it comes to reading, comprehension is
everything.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.829
Reading text twice as fast as someone else
isn’t often very helpful if, after you’re

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.240
done, you don’t understand or retain much
of what you read.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.420
And this is where most speed reading programs
break down.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.990
Studies have repeatedly shown that speed readers
almost universally score significantly worse

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.299
on reading comprehension tests than people
who consume the text at a more normal pace.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.800
Perhaps the most famous test concerning this
was conducted by Dr. Ronald Carver, author

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.759
of The Causes of High and Low Reading Achievement.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.909
Among many other studies he’s done over
the years looking at reading speed and comprehension,

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.560
in one notable one, he painstakingly sought
out the best speed readers he could find,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.880
first choosing his subjects via testing a
large group of college students for their

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.250
speed reading and comprehension abilities
and then selecting the top scorers; next selecting

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.920
people whose jobs required exceptional amounts
of daily reading, such as a writer from the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.189
New Yorker; and third selecting a few very
prominent individuals who’d built reputations

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.880
on their speed reading abilities.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.950
What Carver was hoping to do here was collect
the best of the best among individuals who’d

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.119
previously demonstrated great aptitude for
speed reading while maintaining high levels

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.780
of reading comprehension.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.500
He wanted to see if they really had abilities
much outside of a normal college educated

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.340
individual when tested in a scientifically
rigorous fashion.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.970
It turns out, not one of these elite readers
could achieve a 75% reading comprehension

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.200
level (C average) while reading above 600
words per minute.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.450
While this is decidedly faster than an average
college educated adult, it should be emphasized

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.670
again that Carver meticulously screened the
candidates in his study to find the best of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.500
the best in terms of speed readers.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.590
And the best from that group still could only
achieve about a C average in reading comprehension

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.570
at a maximum of 1/3 faster than what is generally
considered the normal ceiling of an average

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.890
college level reader.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.810
To quote the aforementioned Professor Keith
Raynor, author of Eye Movements and Information

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.310
Processing During Reading: 20 Years of Research,
“Very few people can read faster than 400

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.170
words per minute, and any gain would likely
come with an unacceptable loss of comprehension.”

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.420
Dr. Raynor goes on to state,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.700
"You can probably push yourself to get a little
over 500 words per minute, but you’re limited

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.870
by the eyes and the anatomy of the retina.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.130
To understand text you need to move your eyes
to put the fovea (the part of your eye responsible

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
for sharp, central vision) on the part of
the text you want to focus.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.890
Acuity drops off pretty markedly outside the
fovea and you can’t discriminate the words

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.230
and text far from the fovea.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.410
So, that’s the rate limited factor, as is
how fast the brain can process information."

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.340
An indeed, many speed reading techniques try
to focus on cutting down on eye movements

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.200
that on average take about a tenth of a second
each movement or “saccade”.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.840
These techniques claim you can reduce the
number of eye movements by doing things like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.370
reading two lines at once or taking in as
many words as possible before an eye movement.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.620
But, as Raynor notes,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.070
"The other claim is that you can take in more
information per eye fixation, but there’s

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.990
no evidence that says we can do that.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.870
What we know about the physiology of the retina
is against the notion that you can take in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990
two lines of text at the same time."

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.730
Another common speed reading method is to
try to eliminate subvocalization (saying words

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.150
in your head while reading).

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.760
Raynor notes that working towards this end
can help, but ultimately, “Research shows

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.300
that when you do that and the text is difficult,
comprehension goes to pieces.”

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.960
Essentially, your brain needs that time to
not just see the word, but understand its

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960
meaning.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.350
Take away that “pause” while you subvocalize
and while you might have looked at a lot of

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.160
words on a page, you’re not going to understand
or remember them later.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.560
Everyone has experienced something like this
at one point or another where they read a

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.090
page, but are either thinking of something
else or spacing out.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.870
You get to the end of the page and realize
you have no clue at all what you just read

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.850
even though your eyes looked at all the words.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.060
Further, both Carver and Raynor found that
completely eliminating subvocalization while

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.750
reading just isn’t possible, even for skimmers.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.620
This has been proven via hooking up electromagnetic
sensors to the throat.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.220
It turns out, when you’re saying the words
in your head, your brain also is sending nerve

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.760
impulses to your speech controlling muscles,
whether you notice or not, which can be picked

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.130
up via these electromagnetic sensors.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.760
Even the best of speed readers who claim to
have eliminated subvocalization have been

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.340
shown to have this happen.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.360
Your eyes can only focus on so much at one
time and your brain also has processing limitations.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.250
Once the words start getting streamed into
your brain too fast, your ability to comprehend

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.560
their meaning and retain anything from them
sharply declines.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.140
So while speed reading apps that do things
like flash words at you on a single point

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.590
so you can get rid of the time it takes to
actually move your eyes to focus on a new

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.500
point can potentially speed up your reading
a bit, there is still the problem of how fast

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.410
your brain can actually process a word.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.721
Apps that use this method tend to push the
upper limit and overload your brain’s ability

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:31.360
to comprehend, while also not letting you
glance back at any words your brain finds

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
tricky.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.370
Needless to say, comprehension levels tend
to be extremely poor using this speed reading

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.730
method because of this.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.780
As such, one real method for increasing your
abilities as a reader, not to astounding levels

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.450
claimed by many-a-speed reading course or
app, but at least getting to the upper part

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.030
of that 200-400 word per minute curve, is
to work on your recognition vocabulary- your

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.470
ability to see a word and comprehend its meaning.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.980
You can achieve this by simply reading a lot
and working at increasing your vocabulary.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.490
The increase in reading speed by broadening
your recognition vocabulary can even be measured

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.930
directly via monitoring the aforementioned
nerve impulses to the muscles in your throat

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.590
and tongue while you silently read.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.800
It has been found that when you encounter
a word you’re not very familiar with, you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.710
subvocalize it much slower than words your
brain recognizes more readily.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.500
The other advantage to a larger recognition
vocabulary is reducing the number of times

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.460
your eyes have to jump back to re-read a word
or sentence, something that happens a lot

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.890
when your brain encounters difficult or unfamiliar
words, whether you consciously register you're

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.890
doing it or not.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.730
This might all have you wondering if there
are any legitimate speed readers (as opposed

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.860
to advanced skimmers) out there?

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.530
The answer to that is Yes.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.980
Michael Jordans of the reading world exist.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.870
But unfortunately for us mere mortals, their
methods can’t be taught.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.800
For instance, Kim Peek, a so-called megasavant
or “human Google”, who served as the inspiration

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.490
for Rain Man, was one such well known example.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.240
While Peek’s mental prowess has been subjected
to significant embellishment over the years,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.560
it is quite well documented that he could
seemingly effortlessly absorb all of the information

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.920
on a given page with remarkable speed.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.490
While exactly how many words per minute he
could read with almost perfect comprehension

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.080
was never tested (at least that I could find
reliable documentation of), according to his

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.120
father who by necessity had to be his “shadow”
as Kim Peek called him, Kim generally averaged

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.470
about ten seconds a page and then could recall
it with almost perfect accuracy, even years

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.470
later.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.610
This was an ability Kim was more than happy
to demonstrate, including in front of over

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.700
two and a half million people over the years
in various lecture halls and libraries across

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.960
the United States.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.990
Once he came out of his shell a bit after
Rain Man, he’d even often walk up to strangers

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.360
on the street to demonstrate his astounding
memory and date-processing abilities.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.760
This was one of the few ways he knew how to
socially interact with others.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.750
However, Peek’s abilities were believed
to be the side effect of a serious congenital

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.450
birth defect known as agenesis of the corpus
callosum, in which the largest band of white

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.481
matter that connects the two hemispheres of
the brain doesn’t develop correctly; in

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:57.449
his case, it didn’t develop at all and his
brain compensated by making some rather unusual

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.500
connections, leaving him mentally and physically
handicapped in many ways, while also giving

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.740
him his truly remarkable memory.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.419
So in the end, if you count what most think
of as skimming as “speed reading”, it

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:12.750
is absolutely possible to speed read, and
there certainly are techniques that can help

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.750
there.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.820
For instance, a common, very simple one is
to only read the first sentence of each paragraph

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.820
in a book.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.580
You’ll get the general idea of the chapter
without needing to read all the nitty-gritty

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.580
details.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.530
But if you’re signing up to a course or
downloading an app that claims it will teach

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.330
you to read 1,000 words per minute with the
same reading comprehension levels as when

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.380
you read at your normal pace, you’re going
to be sorely disappointed at the actual results.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.390
Universally, these courses are either selling
snake-oil or are going to teach you advanced

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.669
skimming skills- learning to quickly recognize
what to ignore and what to pay attention to

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.050
in text on the fly.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.310
Being good at skimming can be an extremely
valuable skill in some circumstances, but

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.890
don’t expect to get anywhere close to the
level of reading comprehension you get when

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.900
reading at your normal pace.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.990
After a certain point, the faster you go,
the less you’ll understand or remember later.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.990
Bonus Fact:

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.380
While audiobooks, podcasts, and YouTube videos
can be very enjoyable to listen to, it turns

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.520
out it’s a slow way of getting information
compared to reading.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.950
Even the fastest of speakers can typically
only get up to about 250-300 words per minute,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.430
which on the latter end sounds a bit like
“auctioneer” talk.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:26.600
And in fact it turns out, most people’s
brains are capable of comprehending speech

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.990
as high as about 300 words per minute, or
about the same as we can comfortably read

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.990
at.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.890
For reference, a typical audiobook reader
will read at around 150-175 words per minute,

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:42.420
Simon's videos on this channel tend to ring
in around 175-190 words per minute and my

00:09:42.420 --> 00:10:01.490
tend to be spoken at about 185-200 words per
minute.
