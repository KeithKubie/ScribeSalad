00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And I said it would lengthen.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We can see that as we walk toward Syene,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it must get smaller, because, in the limiting case

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where we actually arrive at Syene,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have no shadow, so it seems reasonable

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that as we get further away, the shadow gets bigger.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now it's good to do these sort of qualitative

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
thought exercises, but, okay,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it gets bigger.  How much bigger?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Can we describe that mathematically?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And this is a perfect example of encountering

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a problem in physics where we don't have the tools

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just yet to solve it, so let's build up some of those tools.
