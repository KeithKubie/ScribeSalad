00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.471
So, before conditioning, the tone is a neutral stimulus. It elicits no specific

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:10.730
response other than perhaps an orienting response. After conditioning, the tone

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.573
is the condition stimulus. Prior to conditioning, the meat powder is an

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:20.668
unconditioned stimulus. It automatically elicits salivation, which brings us to

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:26.298
our unconditioned response. The dog salivating to the meat powder. Remember

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:30.345
after the conditioning, now we have our CS of the tone and the dog will

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:36.060
salivate the condition response to the tone. Great job if you got those right.
