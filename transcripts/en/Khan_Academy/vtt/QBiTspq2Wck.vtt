00:00:00.494 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.630
is look at pairs of figures,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.950
and see if they are scaled
copies of each other.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.054
For example, in this diagram,

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:11.471
is Figure B a scaled version of Figure A?

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:15.965
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.261
There's multiple ways that
you could approach this.

00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:19.125
One way is to say,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.774
"Well, let's see what the
scaling factor would be."

00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:23.926
We could look at the side lengths.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:27.479
This side right over here
has length three on Figure A.

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.455
This side length right over here

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:33.407
has length one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:37.358
This side length has length five as well.

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:39.286
This has length five.

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:40.966
This length, we could figure it out

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.494
with the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:44.734
but I won't even look
at that one just yet.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:46.552
But let's look at corresponding sides.

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.353
To go from this side.

00:00:48.353 --> 00:00:51.466
If we scale up, the
corresponding side to that

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.033
would be this side right over here.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.161
What is its length?

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.328
Well, its length, when you
scale it up, looks like five.

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:04.427
So to go from three to five

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:10.273
you would have to multiply by 5/3.

00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:11.984
5/3.

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:15.444
But let's look at this side now.

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:17.136
It's five in Figure A.

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.488
What length is it in Figure B?

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:21.696
Well, it is one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:24.856
It's still five, so to
go from five to five,

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.848
you have to multiply it by one,

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.656
and so you have a different scaling factor

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.760
for corresponding,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.224
or what could have been
corresponding sides.

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:36.072
This side right over here,
you're scaling up by 5/3,

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:38.344
while this bottom side,
this base right here,

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:39.728
you're not scaling at all.

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:43.608
So these actually are not
scaled versions of each other.

00:01:43.608 --> 00:01:45.691
Let's do another example.

00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:50.735
In this example, is Figure B
a scaled version of Figure A?

00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:54.912
Pause the video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:56.384
All right, well we're
gonna do the same exercise,

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:57.408
and here they've given us

00:01:57.408 --> 00:02:00.167
the measures of the different sides.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:02.144
This side has length two.

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:03.600
This side has length

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.664
the corresponding side,

00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:07.392
or what could be the
corresponding side has length six.

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:12.016
To go from two to six, you
have to multiply by three.

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:15.944
If we look at these two
potentially corresponding sides,

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:18.928
that side and that side, once again,

00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:22.744
to go from four to twelve,
you would multiply by three,

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:25.936
so that is looking good as well.

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:30.680
Now to go from this side down
here, this has length six.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.632
The potentially corresponding
side right over here

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:34.432
has the length 14.

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:36.704
Well here we're not multiplying by three.

00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:37.768
If these were scaled

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:40.064
If Figure B was a scaled-up
version of Figure A,

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:42.328
we would multiply by three,

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.888
but six times three is not 14, it's 18,

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:46.144
so these actually are not

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:50.120
Figure B is not a scaled
version of Figure A.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.080
Let's do one more example.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.640
Once again, pause this video

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.248
and see if Figure B is a
scaled version of Figure A.

00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:00.648
We're gonna do the same exercise.

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:02.904
Let's look at potentially
corresponding sides.

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:05.582
That side to that side,

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:08.134
to go from four to 12,

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:11.198
we would multiply by three,

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:15.782
and then we could look at
this side and this side,

00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:20.190
to go from four to 12, once
again you multiply by three,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.158
so that's looking good so far.

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:24.966
We could look at this side and this side,

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:26.998
potentially corresponding sides.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.273
Once again, we're going from four to 12,

00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:31.481
multiplying by three.

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.177
Looks good so far.

00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:37.969
And then we could look at
this side and this side.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.425
2.2 to 6.6, once again
multiplying by three.

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:43.721
Looking really good.

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.737
And then we only have
one last one to check.

00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:49.404
2.2 to 6.6, once again
multiplying by three,

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.577
so all of the side lengths
have been scaled up by three,

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:57.281
so we can feel pretty good that

00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.448
Figure B is indeed a scaled-up
representation of Figure A.
