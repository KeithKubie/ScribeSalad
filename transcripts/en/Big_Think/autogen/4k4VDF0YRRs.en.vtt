around schools in Canada and they try to

halls and these these walls inside the
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839
halls and these these walls inside the
school classrooms a whole lot of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
school classrooms a whole lot of
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880
school classrooms a whole lot of
different colors sometimes they painted

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

about which colors would work best and

to be karma the students were more
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799
to be karma the students were more
engaged and so they wanted to do more

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
engaged and so they wanted to do more
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450
engaged and so they wanted to do more
work with this if pink could do that to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
work with this if pink could do that to
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889

students in the classroom they started
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.029
students in the classroom they started
to wonder whether it might also be

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
to wonder whether it might also be
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400
to wonder whether it might also be

in Seattle said that they wanted to try
this so what they decided to do is to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
this so what they decided to do is to
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110
this so what they decided to do is to
bring this pink paint to their prison

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
bring this pink paint to their prison

and to paint the inside of one of the
jail cells bright pink and so since

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
jail cells bright pink and so since
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.600
jail cells bright pink and so since
people were calling jail cells drunk

tanks they called a drunk tank pink and
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.740
tanks they called a drunk tank pink and
what they found was that the prisoners

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
what they found was that the prisoners
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.910
what they found was that the prisoners
they put in there these were the worst

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
they put in there these were the worst
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.260
they put in there these were the worst
prisoners the most dangerous and the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
prisoners the most dangerous and the
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450
prisoners the most dangerous and the
most aggressive prisoners when they were

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
most aggressive prisoners when they were
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100
most aggressive prisoners when they were
badly behaved they would put them inside

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
badly behaved they would put them inside
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.800
badly behaved they would put them inside
this this drunk tank pink cell for about

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
this this drunk tank pink cell for about
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899
this this drunk tank pink cell for about
15 minutes and what they reported was

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
15 minutes and what they reported was
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789
15 minutes and what they reported was
that over a nine-month period there

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
that over a nine-month period there
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289
that over a nine-month period there
wasn't a single aggressive or violent

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
wasn't a single aggressive or violent
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.260
wasn't a single aggressive or violent
incident and this gained a lot of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
incident and this gained a lot of
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910
incident and this gained a lot of
currency people were very curious about

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
currency people were very curious about
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399
currency people were very curious about
it about its other applications football

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
it about its other applications football
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560

coaches from from Division one schools

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
coaches from from Division one schools
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.550
coaches from from Division one schools
started to wonder whether they could

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
started to wonder whether they could
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890
started to wonder whether they could
paint the visiting locker rooms the same

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
paint the visiting locker rooms the same
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620
paint the visiting locker rooms the same
color to pacify their opponents no one

had any idea that pink would have such a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
had any idea that pink would have such a
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670
had any idea that pink would have such a
striking effect on behavior there are a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
striking effect on behavior there are a
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.530
striking effect on behavior there are a
number of different explanations for the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
number of different explanations for the
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.910
number of different explanations for the
effect which is true of many of the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
effect which is true of many of the
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350
effect which is true of many of the
effects that I talked about in the book

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
effects that I talked about in the book
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359
effects that I talked about in the book
it could be because we associate pink

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
it could be because we associate pink
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.780
it could be because we associate pink
with perhaps femininity and therefore

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
with perhaps femininity and therefore
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280
with perhaps femininity and therefore
these aggressive males tended to be a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
these aggressive males tended to be a
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.569
these aggressive males tended to be a
little bit more reserved

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
little bit more reserved
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.550
little bit more reserved
it could be something about this color

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
it could be something about this color
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
it could be something about this color
and how it interacts with our physiology

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
and how it interacts with our physiology
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359
and how it interacts with our physiology
and that's one of the arguments that the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
and that's one of the arguments that the
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.740
and that's one of the arguments that the
founder of the color the guy who named

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
founder of the color the guy who named
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.990
founder of the color the guy who named
the color makes he suggests that there

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
the color makes he suggests that there
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370
the color makes he suggests that there
is something about the way this color

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
is something about the way this color
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990
is something about the way this color
hits our eyes and interacts with our

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
hits our eyes and interacts with our
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.350
hits our eyes and interacts with our
brains that leads us to become I'm not

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
brains that leads us to become I'm not
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.840
brains that leads us to become I'm not
sure that I buy that 100%

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
sure that I buy that 100%
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.490
sure that I buy that 100%
I think the the better explanation is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
I think the the better explanation is
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.410
I think the the better explanation is
probably about our expectations and our

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420
probably about our expectations and our
 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.180
probably about our expectations and our
associations when we see the color pink

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
associations when we see the color pink
 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.550
associations when we see the color pink
but that complexity I think is present

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
but that complexity I think is present
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.820
but that complexity I think is present
in a lot of the examples in the book
