00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:06.456
&gt;&gt;Steve: Guys, you ready?

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:07.616
&gt;&gt;Yeah!

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:09.916
&gt;&gt;All right, here we go!

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:11.950
&gt;&gt;Wow, oh, my goodness, whoa!

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.906
&gt;&gt;Christian: The first thing
that hit me when we walked

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:19.006
in the room this morning was just
how much light, how much space,

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.466
and how alive the room felt.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.756
&gt;&gt;What do you think, guys?

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:26.806
&gt;&gt;Whoo! [clapping and cheering]

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:28.716
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Very bright!

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.636
&gt;&gt;Michael: I was just going to
say, it looks brighter already!

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:32.276
I can see the light coming in.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.916
Wow! That's fantastic!

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.666
Looks like you've reset
up these tables.

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:38.866
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Yeah, well, you'll notice

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.076
that there's a lot more
room to walk around.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:44.736
And so one of the reasons we set
up the tables this way is just

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.836
that flow was a big thing
missing from the classroom,

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:49.356
and it's one of the
most important things

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.886
for collaboration and group work.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.406
&gt;&gt;Student: I like the way that
like everything looks kind

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:58.006
of like more organized, and there's
a lot more space in the room,

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.426
so it's easier for us to
like walk around the room.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:05.046
&gt;&gt;Christian: Are you saying your
teacher wasn't as organized before?

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:05.113
[laughter]

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:06.156
&gt;&gt;Student: No, I mean, well, maybe.

00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:08.646
&gt;&gt;Michael: That is a
fantastic whiteboard he's got.

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.446
&gt;&gt;Melanie: We noticed that when
he went to go set-up his work

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.976
that he was losing
a lot of efficiency,

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:16.476
and it was causing some
classroom management issues.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.986
So by making something that is
always ready, he's going to be

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.996
so much more efficient and
commanding of his class.

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:24.546
&gt;&gt;Student: We'll be able
to see things better,

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:25.946
because the projector's really big,

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:27.826
and then we still have a
whiteboard right there.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:29.916
&gt;&gt;Michael: The teaching station,

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.456
it feels like it's
been moved back a bit.

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:34.746
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Yes, it has, we wanted
him to be immersed in the class.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:40.696
Not only does it allow him to see all
of his students, but it allows him

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:42.926
to feel like he has
control over the room,

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:46.926
and kind of mix the materials he
needs to instruct on a daily basis.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:50.906
We wanted every tool he needed to
be instantly here and not distracted

00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:53.426
by other clutter, not
underneath something.

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:56.546
So what we did was we
took this reclaimed desk,

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:58.196
put it on top of this cart.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:02.366
Painted one side white, so it's
always a whiteboard, and took a piece

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.636
of reclaimed Plexiglas,
and screwed it to the top.

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:07.626
&gt;&gt;Michael: He can do the
equations right on here.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.496
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Yeah, and then just erase

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.306
like an overhead projector
for the 21st Century.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:13.636
&gt;&gt;Michael: That's a fantastic idea!

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.066
&gt;&gt;Melanie: This whole
wall is whiteboards.

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:20.206
So not only do we have teachable
space at the front of the room,

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.336
but we have space that anybody
can use to be a teacher,

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:25.326
or solve a problem in
the back of the room.

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:29.176
One thing that we wanted to play with
was not only providing them monitors

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:32.456
and technology at their height,
so that they could touch down,

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.596
but giving them analog tools as well.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.406
&gt;&gt;Michael: Actually do some
thinking on the wall together.

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:40.726
Quickly look something up online,
and then head back to their table.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:41.276
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Mm-hm.

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:44.376
This action not only did
it liberate this space,

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:48.136
but it created a new opportunity
for their collaboration in the room.

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.056
This is a work in progress.

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:52.946
We don't want to give
a teacher a classroom.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.306
we want to create it with them,

00:02:54.496 --> 00:02:56.616
so that they continue
to create it over time.

00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:56.683
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:01.026
&gt;&gt;Christian: What we hope we've done
over the last week is shift mindsets.

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:04.946
Maybe more importantly, what we hope
we've done is given Steve the set

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:08.726
of tools to be a designer
himself, and to literally imagine

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:13.106
that this space is a studio that
can do anything he needs it to do.

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:16.706
&gt;&gt;Steve: This entire
design project has molded me

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.456
into a more empowered teacher.

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.916
It's nice to know as a teacher
that we have support coming

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:24.786
from other people, and the kids
coming in on their day off,

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:27.656
and the parents-- and it's nice
to know that there are people

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:31.066
out there looking out for us,
and we don't just feel alone.

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:38.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In a single weekend,
one teacher, a few experts,

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:42.116
some community volunteers, and
a bunch of energetic students,

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:46.156
not only transformed their learning
space, they reminded themselves

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:48.116
of the power of their
own imaginations.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:51.486
What can you do to
remake your classroom?
