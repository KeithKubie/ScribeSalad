00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
All right.
Good morning.

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:08.395
Good morning.
So, we have some fun stuff for

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:13.738
today's lecture,
and as far as the final is

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:19.844
concerned and so on,
I'd like you to forget about

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.915
anything we do today,
absolutely.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:31.420
So, get your mind to become a
blank, and forget anything you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.435
hear in today's lecture.
So, what I'm going to show you

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:42.250
today will hopefully completely
blow your minds.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.228
And I'm not talking about
controlled substances or

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:49.476
anything.
So what I'm going to do is show

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:54.022
you a few things that behave
completely and spectacularly

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:58.000
differently than how you expect
them to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And, today's lecture is
appropriately called --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.282
OK.
So, we're going to violate the

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:22.602
abstraction barrier here,
and do some fun things.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:26.682
And, the important thing to
realize is that in all of 6.002,

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:29.933
we have, after all,
based on some assumptions we

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.599
made at the beginning of the
course like lumped matter

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.919
discipline and so on,
we have landed ourselves in

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:41.000
this playground called the
playground of 6.002.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.492
And, within that playground,
certain ground rules apply.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:47.920
OK, and our entire course
depended on those assumptions

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.634
being true.
So, for example,

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:53.317
the first assumption we made
that brought us from Maxwell's

00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:56.174
equations to the lumped matter
discipline was,

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:59.539
or rather the circuit
abstraction, was a lumped matter

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.021
discipline.
And there were three tenets of

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.995
the lumped matter discipline.
One is that the rate of change

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:10.229
of flux was going to be zero
within our circuits,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.328
not inside elements,
but in the circuit itself,

00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:17.101
and second, the dq by dt was
going to be zero outside the

00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.536
elements, and third,
something we did not dwell upon

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:23.433
in the course,
but it's certainly present in

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:27.273
the course notes is that the
speeds of signals that we are

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:31.450
going to consider are going to
be much slower than the speed of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.355
light.
OK, so we're going to be

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:45.165
working in a realm where we are
going to be well slower than the

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:50.898
speed of light.
OK, so starting with that,

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:58.728
let me walk you through some
examples and some fun stuff.

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:06.000
So, the first case is called
the Double Take.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.400
So, let me sketch out a small
little circuit for you,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.942
and take a look at the expected
behavior, and then show you what

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:22.823
really happens in real life.
So, the first case,

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:28.119
I have a voltage source,
and what I'm going to do is

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:33.000
make a transition from a zero to
a one.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.875
Think of it as a step input,
and through a Thevenin like

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:45.125
resistance, I want to feed it to
a circuit.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.375
The circuit will go to an
inverter.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:56.500
This node goes to an inverter,
and goes through some other

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.000
circuits within our own design
here.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.788
So, again, remember,
a step input here,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:11.173
and this input goes through a
Thevenin like resistance,

00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:15.560
or is applied to some other
circuit elements.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.146
So, if I apply a step here,
what do you expect?

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:24.035
You expect that,
so let me call that VI,

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:29.419
and let me call that Vo.
So, if I plot VI as a function

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.000
of time, and let's say this step
input happens at t=0.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.494
So let's say this is t=0 here,
and let's say this is a 5V

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:49.500
step.
So, I expect that this input

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.387
here is going to go to,
VI here, is going to go to 5V

00:04:57.387 --> 00:05:03.000
at t=0.
What do I expect at Vo?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.273
At Vo, based on our circuit
abstraction, I get a step input

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.631
here.
I should get a step of some

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:12.873
magnitude here,
depending on what's connected

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:16.042
in this direction.
And let's simply say that

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:19.873
what's connected here is an
inverter, and maybe other

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:23.042
inverters at the other side.
So essentially,

00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:26.873
as far as this node is
concerned, it's got some wires

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:30.115
connected to it.
And at the end of the wires,

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:32.989
it has an open circuit,
an open circuit,

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.863
for example,
like the gate input of this

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:41.267
inverter.
So what do you expect at V

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:44.409
nought?
A step input here,

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.060
and at V nought I see an open
circuit.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.715
OK, so I expect the same step
at V nought: 5V.

00:05:54.715 --> 00:06:01.000
So, that's what we've prepared
you for, OK?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.416
But, the fun thing that we're
going to see,

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:09.135
so this is what you expect,
and I'll show you a little demo

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:13.203
that is going to show you
something very different.

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:16.132
What you're going to see is not
this.

00:06:16.132 --> 00:06:19.223
OK, you're not going to be
seeing that.

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:25.000
Rather, I'm going to show you
something that looks like this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.990
So, at t=0, I do see Vo looking
like a step, and approximately

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.281
halfway through,
decides, ah,

00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:45.981
well never mind,
and flattens out,

00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.518
OK, then says,
oh, OK, and zoom,

00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:52.772
it goes back up to 5V.
So, it sort of does a bit of a

00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:57.190
double take up there saying,
hey, what's going on here?

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.281
And zoom, jumps up to 5V,
and then it's five as you

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:05.868
expect.
OK, so this is some finite

00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:09.729
amount of time that looks like
that.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.142
OK, so try to understand what's
going on.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:18.334
So let me show you a quick
little demo.

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:24.291
So that's the input VI.
OK, so that's the input VI that

00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:30.469
you expect, and I won't do
anything to my circuit at this

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:34.000
point.
And, go ahead.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.500
So, let's see what happens now.
There you go.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.079
So now, I'm showing you the
output here at Vo.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:44.818
So at VI, there's a nice little
step, and at Vo,

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:48.795
notice that I get something
that behaves like this.

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:52.693
OK, and I promise you,
nothing we've taught you in

00:07:52.693 --> 00:07:57.227
6.002 prepares you for this.
OK, and as I mentioned at the

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:01.681
beginning of this lecture,
it would behoove you to forget

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:06.534
about everything you learn in
today's lecture for the next two

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:11.083
weeks at least.
So what's going on here?

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:12.645
Any ideas?
Anybody?

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:16.203
Any thoughts?
So what's up with my circuit

00:08:16.203 --> 00:08:17.679
here?
It says, oh,

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:20.630
OK, a step.
It starts off and says,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.622
oh, never mind,
and then meanders along at 2.5V

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:28.007
and then says oh,
step, yes, I remember,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:32.000
and then boom,
it jumps up to 5V.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.148
So, any theories?
Any guesses?

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:40.360
Any wild guesses?
OK, so let me draw you a little

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.548
bit more of a detailed circuit,
and see if you can explain

00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:52.194
what's going on here.
So, the circuit that I've drawn

00:08:52.194 --> 00:08:58.708
there is not quite the circuit I
have at least in terms of my

00:08:58.708 --> 00:09:02.399
wires.
So, what I have is something

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:07.828
that looks like this,
VI, and this is going to step

00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:13.704
to 5V.
I do have a resistance,

00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:18.859
R.
This is Vo, this does go to an

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:24.979
inverter.
But what is also happening is

00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:34.000
that I have a long wire.
OK, you see this guy here?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.228
We had one of our union folks
stretch out along the floor

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:42.590
here.
We have a really long wire that

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.978
connects to the Vo node,
and there's also a long

00:09:46.978 --> 00:09:51.367
corresponding ground.
So, this wire is a coaxial

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:55.569
cable that is used for Ethernet
and such like.

00:09:55.569 --> 00:10:01.171
It's got a core that carries a
signal, and around the core is

00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:07.941
shielding that is the ground.
OK, so that goes a long way,

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.673
and at the end,
it is open.

00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:14.350
OK, it's an open circuit at the
end.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.813
I haven't connected anything
out there: open circuit.

00:10:19.813 --> 00:10:23.910
So, you know,
something's happening here

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.322
that's making the circuit behave
like this.

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:32.000
So, this is VI.
At Vo --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.146
So at Vo I'm getting this funny
behavior.

00:10:51.146 --> 00:10:55.471
OK, so does anybody want to
take the next piece of clues

00:10:55.471 --> 00:11:00.426
here, does anybody want to take
a stab at guessing what might be

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.399
going on here?
Yes?

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.399
Ah, we have a shill in the
audience here.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:11.799
So, the theory is that the step
here, think of it as an

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:16.700
electromagnetic pulse that goes
from zero to five,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.899
and things in real life don't
travel instantaneously.

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:26.799
So, there's something with a
wave that flies down,

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:32.399
and the wave goes to the end,
flips, and then comes back,

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:38.000
and then establishes the full
voltage here.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.914
So that is indeed at the root
of what's going on.

00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:46.482
And let me put it in layman's
terms and then describe the

00:11:46.482 --> 00:11:51.457
details of what's going on here.
OK, so the way to view what's

00:11:51.457 --> 00:11:54.556
going on is that I have this
long wire.

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:59.368
OK, in the very first lecture,
I started off by saying wires

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:03.118
are ideal.
OK, ideal wires are such that I

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:06.945
can transmit signals on them.
Wires are small so that the

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:11.113
propagation time of signals is
inconsequential compared to the

00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:14.667
rise times and fall times of the
signals of interest.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:18.220
By having this really long
cable here, I have clearly

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.979
violated that assumption,
which is the wires are really,

00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:25.054
really long here.
OK, and so I somehow need to

00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:29.223
model what the wire is doing to
my circuit when I don't have a

00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:33.500
small wire.
So what actually happens,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.000
the way to view it is the
following.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.799
So, although this is a wire,
to understand the mechanics of

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:47.399
what's going on,
I really have to model it much

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.299
more accurately,
OK?

00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:55.000
And, the way to model a wire
like this is that notice that

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.600
every small element of a wire
has associated with it some

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.997
inductance.
OK, so let's take a small

00:13:04.997 --> 00:13:09.870
segment of the coax cable here.
The coax cable is a small core

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.024
surrounded by a metallic shield.
OK, that's a ground.

00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:18.658
And so, when I have a wire
surrounded by a metallic shield,

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:23.531
that also has the capacitance,
OK, inductance and capacitance.

00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:27.765
So this small segment can be
modeled as a really small

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:32.000
inductance, and a really tiny
capacitance.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.815
Similarly, the next segment can
be modeled as a tiny inductance

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:40.233
and a capacitance.
There is also a resistance

00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:44.660
here, but let's assume that the
resistance is zero for our

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.009
model, and also the parallel
resistance is also infinity.

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:52.815
OK, so it's an inductor,
capacitor, and really the

00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:56.699
situation that I have is not a
pair of ideal wires,

00:13:56.699 --> 00:14:00.116
but really a really,
really small inductance,

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:04.000
and a small capacitance in
parallel.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.470
So, it's more of a set of
distributed elements that I have

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.215
here.
Notice that in my lump circuit

00:14:11.215 --> 00:14:15.843
abstraction, when we talked
about the RLC model for the wire

00:14:15.843 --> 00:14:18.588
between two inverters,
we lumped it.

00:14:18.588 --> 00:14:22.901
We lumped this thing into a
model that looked like this.

00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:27.058
OK, we lumped the resistance
into a source resistance.

00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:32.000
We lumped all the inductors
into a lumped inductor.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.317
We lumped all the capacitances
into a lumped capacitance.

00:14:36.317 --> 00:14:40.558
OK, but in this situation,
I can do this when the signal

00:14:40.558 --> 00:14:44.721
speeds of interest are much,
much, much slower than the

00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:48.114
speed of light than the
propagation speeds of

00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:50.967
electromagnetic signals.
In this case,

00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:54.128
that is not quite true.
And so, therefore,

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:56.981
we have to model it much more
exactly.

00:14:56.981 --> 00:15:01.530
We need to see what's going on.
So, what's happening here is

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:07.319
that at t=0, I get this step.
So, think of that as a pulse of

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:11.957
energy, and the instant it comes
here, and instantaneously this

00:15:11.957 --> 00:15:14.650
guy looks like a voltage
divider, OK?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.092
I've chosen my resistance,
R, here to match the

00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:21.907
instantaneous impedance looking
in, which is also R.

00:15:21.907 --> 00:15:24.226
I've arranged it to be that
way.

00:15:24.226 --> 00:15:27.817
So, instantaneously,
the point at which the pulse

00:15:27.817 --> 00:15:31.558
appears at this point,
looking down here looks like

00:15:31.558 --> 00:15:35.958
another resistor to this pulse.
OK, therefore,

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.767
when I start out,
I start out going up and

00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:41.369
pausing at 2.5 because
instantaneously,

00:15:41.369 --> 00:15:43.493
this looks like a resistance,
R.

00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:46.369
So instantaneously,
it's a voltage divider,

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:49.109
R, and so it's 2.5 here,
instantaneously.

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:52.191
OK, then what happens?
Then those little pulse

00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:55.273
propagates down.
What does it mean for a pulse

00:15:55.273 --> 00:15:58.904
of energy to propagate down?
Well, it begins sending a

00:15:58.904 --> 00:16:02.397
current through the inductor,
begins charging up the

00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:06.164
capacitor, current here,
so that's what I mean by saying

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:10.000
that the pulse of energy goes
down.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.431
OK, it's a step that sends
current to the inductor and

00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:19.030
charges of the capacitors,
and that wave front moves out

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.294
here and comes all the way here.
What happens there?

00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:27.140
Well, think about it.
Supposing you stand here,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.070
and you hold a long string in
your hand somehow,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.000
and just do this Gedanken
experiment.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.508
It's not easy to do.
And so, let's say you somehow

00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:41.730
have the long string that you're
holding onto,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.382
and the string on the other
side is not connected to

00:16:45.382 --> 00:16:47.530
anything.
OK, just imagine this

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.180
experiment.
OK, and what you do is you

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.190
suddenly raise the string up at
your end by about a foot.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.481
What are you going to see
happen?

00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:59.417
So instantaneously,
the string is up here,

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:04.000
but the rest of the string is
down a foot below.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.531
And then you see this wave
propagate down the string,

00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:09.229
right?
So here's a string.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:12.557
I lift this thing,
and you see this wave propagate

00:17:12.557 --> 00:17:15.817
all the way down,
the one foot wave propagate all

00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:17.990
the way down until you come
here.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.096
What happens here?
So, out here,

00:17:20.096 --> 00:17:23.627
the string is down here,
the wave propagates out here

00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:26.140
and pulls it up to one.
And then what?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.875
There's nothing connected
there, so the string is zipped

00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:34.444
up, but it's got the energy.
OK, where does energy go?

00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:37.332
Well, it continues going up,
and sends a wave back.

00:17:37.332 --> 00:17:40.741
OK, so just think of a string
that you pull up like this and

00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:43.109
propagates down,
boom, hits the other end,

00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:46.113
reverses, and comes back at me.
OK, you can look at a

00:17:46.113 --> 00:17:48.713
complementary situation,
not the same as this,

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:51.948
but complementary by taking a
string, tying it to a door,

00:17:51.948 --> 00:17:54.605
and lifting it up.
It's not the same situation.

00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:57.551
It's a complementary situation
where it's tied down.

00:17:57.551 --> 00:18:00.613
Tying down a string is
tantamount to shorting the ends

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:03.762
here.
OK, in that case what you'll

00:18:03.762 --> 00:18:07.225
see happen: as the wave goes
down, at the end the string

00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:11.002
can't move, so the wave goes and
flips around and comes back.

00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:13.961
Try it out at home.
Take a long piece of string,

00:18:13.961 --> 00:18:15.723
tie it up there,
do this, OK?

00:18:15.723 --> 00:18:19.375
And you'll see the wave go out,
flip, and then come back at

00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:21.326
you.
So, if your friends see you

00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:25.104
tying a long piece of string
doing this, hopefully they won't

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.651
think you're nuts or something.
OK, so the same way here:

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:33.152
this thing flies down,
OK, there's no way to dissipate

00:18:33.152 --> 00:18:35.992
the energy here,
so this thing continues up.

00:18:35.992 --> 00:18:39.955
And then, what I'm going to see
happen is the wave move back.

00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:43.721
OK, the wave begins to move
back, and that's another 2.5V,

00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:46.231
resulting in a net 5V at this
terminal.

00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:50.326
That wave begins to blast back,
OK, and then when it comes back

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:53.827
here, after some amount of time,
it raises this to 5V,

00:18:53.827 --> 00:18:56.139
and that's what you see happen
here.

00:18:56.139 --> 00:18:59.574
So, this is a wave going down,
and then after a time,

00:18:59.574 --> 00:19:04.000
2t, it goes back up to 5V.
That's a return wave.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.641
It's 2t because to get down
here is t seconds,

00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:12.173
and then t seconds to come
back, which is why we have 2t.

00:19:12.173 --> 00:19:15.491
OK, that is why you see that
pulse at 2.5.

00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:19.537
OK, so I'd like to show you a
few more things here.

00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:22.936
Clearly we don't want that in
our circuits.

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:27.144
Could someone tell me what
problem would happen if my

00:19:27.144 --> 00:19:32.000
signals looked like this in my
digital circuits?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.187
Instead of being nice little
steps, if there was a little

00:19:39.187 --> 00:19:46.759
thing in the middle and then a
step, what's the problem with

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:51.636
signals like this?
In digital circuits,

00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:54.844
what did it violate?
Yeah?

00:19:54.844 --> 00:19:59.208
Exactly.
This little sucker here is

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:05.882
meandering out in the forbidden
region for all of 2T.

00:20:05.882 --> 00:20:10.245
Can't do that.
OK, can't have that.

00:20:10.245 --> 00:20:17.304
Well, so we need to fix the
problem because this is real

00:20:17.304 --> 00:20:20.945
life.
OK, but what if you and your

00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:23.005
buddy were signaling each other
but using digital signals from

00:20:23.005 --> 00:20:24.829
one dorm room to another maybe a
few hundred feet down?

00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:26.787
Your circuit isn't going to
work because the signal's going

00:20:26.787 --> 00:20:28.645
to meander around in the
forbidden region for some time.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:29.692
So, any ideas what might you
do?

00:20:29.692 --> 00:20:30.739
Yeah?
Put a resistor on the end.

00:20:30.739 --> 00:20:32.157
OK, trick the circuit.
So, what you can do,

00:20:32.157 --> 00:20:33.643
and I'm going to show you a
little demo here,

00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:35.737
what you can do is the reason I
got this wave propagating back,

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:38.000
was that there was nothing to
absorb the energy.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.624
So instead, what if I put
another resistor here,

00:20:41.624 --> 00:20:44.168
R?
So, as far as a burst of energy

00:20:44.168 --> 00:20:46.096
is concerned,
it says, oh,

00:20:46.096 --> 00:20:50.722
yeah, it just looks the same.
It's R, and goes and dissipates

00:20:50.722 --> 00:20:53.421
in this resistor,
R, and guess what?

00:20:53.421 --> 00:20:56.968
I don't have any wave going
back, and I'm done.

00:20:56.968 --> 00:21:00.824
So, what I'm going to find,
then, is that out here,

00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:03.291
this goes up to 5V,
but out here,

00:21:03.291 --> 00:21:07.532
I will have a signal that
starts out and goes up to 2.5,

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:11.218
and that's it.
OK, I lift it up,

00:21:11.218 --> 00:21:14.228
it goes down,
it goes to 2.5 because in the

00:21:14.228 --> 00:21:17.237
lumped model that you've been
dealing with,

00:21:17.237 --> 00:21:20.175
it's a resistor R,
a resistor R to ground,

00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:23.400
and you're taking the
connection here or here.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.557
So, it's your standard lumped
model, your voltage resistive

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:29.921
divider, and it just simply
works.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:34.472
Yeah, that's it.
So, this is the end of the

00:21:34.472 --> 00:21:37.896
cable.
OK, if somehow you could watch

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:43.126
this and that at the same time,
so what I'm going to do,

00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:47.976
and this is a resistor,
R, I'm just going to plug it

00:21:47.976 --> 00:21:51.210
in.
OK, if the fates are smiling at

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.916
me, what should you see there?
What should happen is that the

00:21:56.916 --> 00:22:01.386
second jump from 2.5 to 5 should
simply go away.

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:06.994
It should just go to 2.5.
Let's try that.

00:22:06.994 --> 00:22:10.585
There you go.
I take it out,

00:22:10.585 --> 00:22:16.569
it jumps back up.
OK, so all I've done here is

00:22:16.569 --> 00:22:24.015
put in a resistor at the end,
and I'm still measuring the

00:22:24.015 --> 00:22:30.000
voltage here.
So, that's one solution.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.539
One solution is to put a
resistor here.

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:36.015
So, I absorb the energy,
and the resistance has to be

00:22:36.015 --> 00:22:39.156
equal to the instantaneous
impedance looking in.

00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:42.431
And the instantaneous
impedance, for many of these

00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:45.506
cables is 50 ohms.
It's called a characteristic

00:22:45.506 --> 00:22:47.979
impedance.
OK, you'll learn a lot more

00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:51.588
about it if you take 6.014.
That course starts out with

00:22:51.588 --> 00:22:56.000
assuming that things are
distributed in that matter.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.846
OK, so if you want to design
multi-gigahertz chips,

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:04.076
it turns out that if you have
signals that are traveling

00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:08.000
around at edge speeds in the
0.1-1 nanosecond range,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.076
remember, light travels roughly
one nanosecond a foot.

00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:16.846
And if the signals are roughly
of interest are 0.1 nanoseconds,

00:23:16.846 --> 00:23:20.769
then if the chips are one inch
in size, right there,

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:24.846
the propagation speed of a
signal across a chip is 0.1

00:23:24.846 --> 00:23:26.769
nanoseconds.
OK, so today,

00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:30.923
we have to deal with these
issues and try to figure out

00:23:30.923 --> 00:23:36.449
what to do about them.
OK, so that's one solution that

00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:40.243
somebody pointed out.
There is a second solution.

00:23:40.243 --> 00:23:43.562
Anybody else have a second
solution for me?

00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:46.565
And then there's a third
solution, too.

00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:49.489
So it's OK.
You can give me either the

00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:53.203
second or the third solution.
It doesn't matter.

00:23:53.203 --> 00:23:56.048
Anybody?
You have two to choose from,

00:23:56.048 --> 00:23:57.075
come on.
Yeah?

00:23:57.075 --> 00:24:00.000
You can do that,
yeah.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.045
So we could define the problem
away by saying this transition

00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:07.820
is such that my high is below
2.5.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.025
So, once it goes above 2.5,
who cares what it does?

00:24:12.025 --> 00:24:16.061
That's a good point.
That's solution number four,

00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:19.593
and that works.
OK, so I still need two and

00:24:19.593 --> 00:24:21.863
three.
Put a diode in there?

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:26.404
Yeah, I guess you could.
If the diode had the same kind

00:24:26.404 --> 00:24:30.104
of impedance looking in,
it kind of may work.

00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:34.309
That's solution 4.2.
I'm still waiting for solution

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:37.752
two and three.
Pardon?

00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:40.546
Cut off the cable?
Exactly.

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:45.920
So, the solution says,
work on a different problem.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.252
And that is solution number
two.

00:24:49.252 --> 00:24:53.551
OK, so the idea is,
the root of all evil,

00:24:53.551 --> 00:24:58.280
this long wire,
which is why I had this thing

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.363
here.
So instead, if I had short

00:25:02.363 --> 00:25:07.545
wires, then what will happen is
if it's a very small wire,

00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:12.000
it'll look like this.
And the wire's small enough.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.181
I will see an itty-bitty
thingamajig out there,

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:20.545
but not a whole lot.
By the way, the fun thing is

00:25:20.545 --> 00:25:25.090
that you can actually calculate
the speed of light,

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.000
the experiment I just showed
you.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Can we put that up again?
No, the big one.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.233
So, in the experiment that I
showed you, this distance was

00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:39.090
about 500 nanoseconds,
OK?

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.952
This distance was 500
nanoseconds this time interval.

00:25:42.952 --> 00:25:46.071
The length of this cable is
about 500 feet,

00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:50.305
somewhere around 500 feet.
So you can figure out the speed

00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:52.904
of light.
What's the speed of light?

00:25:52.904 --> 00:25:56.692
So, this is about 500
nanoseconds, and this cable is

00:25:56.692 --> 00:26:01.000
roughly 500 feet.
What's the speed of light?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.933
Roughly a foot per nanosecond.
So, would you believe that in

00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:08.599
6.002 we've figured out the
speed of light from a simple

00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:11.400
experiment?
All right, so let's do the next

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.400
experiment now.
Let's take out the long cable,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.599
and connect a short cable
instead.

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:20.133
So, what I'm going to do is
disconnect the long cable,

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.400
and instead,
connect a small cable.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.133
It's still relatively long,
but much shorter than the 500

00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:28.799
foot cable.
So what you should see happen

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:32.133
now is that the little step
should not be this big,

00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:37.185
but much, much smaller.
So, take a look up there.

00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:40.856
There you go.
OK, so with this thingamajig,

00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:43.916
the little blip there is very
small.

00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:47.412
And of course,
if I make it even smaller,

00:26:47.412 --> 00:26:52.744
then that can virtually vanish.
OK, so that is solution number

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:54.755
two.
So, we've done one,

00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:58.339
two, four, 4.2.
So, what's solution number

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:01.725
three?
One more solution.

00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:04.600
Pardon?
So, another solution we

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.242
mentioned is we change this
resistance.

00:27:08.242 --> 00:27:11.980
and that will work,
if I make this very,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.389
very low, then I'll get much
closer to 5V here.

00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:21.661
Yeah, that's a possibility.
That's solution six I guess.

00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:24.824
So what was solution number
three?

00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:30.000
And you all should be able to
solve this.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.611
You guys know the answer.
OK, you folks should be able to

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.847
solve this.
Yes?

00:27:35.847 --> 00:27:38.976
Ah, clock.
So, what I can do is just as

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:42.847
was pointed out,
that I leveraged my abstraction

00:27:42.847 --> 00:27:45.894
by changing my VOH and VIH
thresholds.

00:27:45.894 --> 00:27:49.764
So that'll work.
The alternative thing is to use

00:27:49.764 --> 00:27:52.564
a clock.
A clock is a distinguished

00:27:52.564 --> 00:27:56.435
signal that I send around in my
digital circuit,

00:27:56.435 --> 00:28:00.624
OK?
So all I do is if I arrange it

00:28:00.624 --> 00:28:04.997
such that my clock doesn't
happen in this vicinity,

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:10.070
but rather, my clock happens
late enough, then I'm going to

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.231
sample and look at my signals
only on the rising and falling

00:28:15.231 --> 00:28:18.992
edges of the clock,
in which case I won't be

00:28:18.992 --> 00:28:23.453
looking at the signal,
but the signal is doing weird

00:28:23.453 --> 00:28:26.427
things.
OK, so a decent clock would

00:28:26.427 --> 00:28:30.976
also solve the problem.
OK, any last minute questions

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:40.350
before we go onto the next one?
OK, the next problem that we're

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:47.426
going to look at is titled the
Double Dip.

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:56.918
OK, so what I'm going to do
here is our Vs power supply,

00:28:56.918 --> 00:29:06.238
and what I'm going to do is
feed the power supply to an

00:29:06.238 --> 00:29:12.167
inverter.
OK, so we've been doing this

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:16.352
all along; Vs,
I feed the supply to an

00:29:16.352 --> 00:29:20.651
inverter.
And what I'm also going to do

00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:26.307
is, so this is ground,
and I'm going to feed it to,

00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:31.850
so feed the power supply
connection to a couple of

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:39.732
inverters.
OK, and what I'm going to do is

00:29:39.732 --> 00:29:47.869
apply some sort of a signal to
this inverter,

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:57.856
and I'm going to observe,
and I'm going to look at this

00:29:57.856 --> 00:30:03.378
signal here.
So, the abstraction should tell

00:30:03.378 --> 00:30:07.828
you that here's a power supply.
This is 5V, or whatever the

00:30:07.828 --> 00:30:10.896
supply voltage is to these two
inverters.

00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:14.732
That should be fine,
and feed some sort of input to

00:30:14.732 --> 00:30:18.108
this inverter,
OK, and the output here should

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:20.716
be simply determined by this
input.

00:30:20.716 --> 00:30:25.089
This signal can have absolutely
no bearing on this output.

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:30.000
OK, and let's look at that and
actually confirm it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.707
So, I build a circuit like
this, and we look at this

00:30:35.707 --> 00:30:40.743
output, and initially there
should not be any,

00:30:40.743 --> 00:30:46.675
it should simply work fine.
OK, so it should work now,

00:30:46.675 --> 00:30:47.682
right?
OK.

00:30:47.682 --> 00:30:53.277
So what you have here,
this input here is the input

00:30:53.277 --> 00:30:56.971
that I'm feeding to this
inverter.

00:30:56.971 --> 00:31:02.861
That is a straight line.
Is that the power supply?

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.360
It doesn't matter?
OK, so I believe this is the,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.826
we'll check in a few minutes,
but I suspect this is the power

00:31:10.826 --> 00:31:14.698
supply, and this guy here is the
output looking here.

00:31:14.698 --> 00:31:17.601
So, the green one is the look
here part.

00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:21.621
So, there must have been a
one-to-zero transition here,

00:31:21.621 --> 00:31:24.599
and that's all fine.
So, so far, so good.

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:28.545
OK, no problem so far.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:32.267
going to do something to the
circuit that as far as

00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:35.989
abstraction is concerned,
it doesn't show up on the

00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:41.183
circuit.
OK, it's below the abstraction

00:31:41.183 --> 00:31:45.004
layer.
OK, I'm going to do something,

00:31:45.004 --> 00:31:48.930
and suddenly,
some things are going to

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.159
happen.
Look up there.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:56.359
The circuit hasn't changed.
It's the same circuit.

00:31:56.359 --> 00:31:59.755
I've done nothing to the
circuit.

00:31:59.755 --> 00:32:05.659
OK, look at the green output.
I've done nothing to the

00:32:05.659 --> 00:32:09.807
circuit that is visible here.
OK, it's below the radar screen

00:32:09.807 --> 00:32:11.950
here.
It's below the abstraction

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.646
barrier.
But, look at the disaster here.

00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:17.965
OK, in particular,
the spikes going up are not so

00:32:17.965 --> 00:32:20.661
much of a problem.
Because of the static

00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:23.634
discipline, if I am at five or
six or seven,

00:32:23.634 --> 00:32:27.022
it doesn't matter as long as I
am higher than VOH.

00:32:27.022 --> 00:32:32.000
So as long as I'm higher than
VOH I don't have a problem.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.790
But the problems are these
repeated dips.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.558
OK, the dips are a problem
here, which is why I labeled

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:42.883
this experiment the Double Dip.
OK, the dips are bad because if

00:32:42.883 --> 00:32:46.511
they are large enough,
they can then group the output

00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:49.581
down into the forbidden region,
or worse yet,

00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:53.418
make it look like a zero.
OK, so you're not prepared for

00:32:53.418 --> 00:32:55.930
this.
So what I'm going to do is tell

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.906
you what I did to the circuit,
and then ask you to help me

00:32:59.906 --> 00:33:08.065
figure it out.
So all I did was applied a load

00:33:08.065 --> 00:33:17.652
resistance to this,
I think of 50 ohms or some RL.

00:33:17.652 --> 00:33:28.217
I just applied a load resistor.
And this inverter here,

00:33:28.217 --> 00:33:38.000
I believe, is a CMOS inverter
that looks, OK?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.092
So I have this input applied to
this inverter,

00:33:41.092 --> 00:33:43.979
and all I did is I applied an
RL load here.

00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:48.103
And notice that the load here
should not really change what's

00:33:48.103 --> 00:33:50.989
happening if this is an ideal
inverter, OK,

00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:54.769
the load here should simply
draw some current but really

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:58.000
should not change any other
property.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.041
OK, so just remember,
what's the signal doing?

00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:05.364
The signal is high.
This guy turns on,

00:34:05.364 --> 00:34:10.483
and current flows like this.
So, let's say I had some sort

00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:14.344
of a capacitor here.
This charges like this,

00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:17.398
and when it's slow,
the PFET is on,

00:34:17.398 --> 00:34:20.990
and current flows through here
down here.

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:25.211
And then when this goes high,
this guy goes off,

00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:29.701
and this guy turns on.
OK, so the current flows out

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:35.000
this way and this charges
through this guy.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.563
When I turn it off,
the P fret turns on and draws

00:34:39.563 --> 00:34:44.411
current from the top.
OK, so do we have any theories

00:34:44.411 --> 00:34:50.401
as to why I'm getting that messy
stuff, the dips and the spikes,

00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:56.200
on the output of this inverter?
So why does this inverter care

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.338
what the load of this inverter
is?

00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:04.653
I mean, who cares?
So, put your thinking caps on.

00:35:04.653 --> 00:35:08.368
Any theories?
You guys did pretty well with

00:35:08.368 --> 00:35:11.995
the previous one.
And this is much easier,

00:35:11.995 --> 00:35:15.179
actually.
Need a better power supply;

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:20.486
OK, so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to replace the power

00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:24.909
supply, and instead,
use a much bigger power supply

00:35:24.909 --> 00:35:28.093
at 5V.
A big, mongo power supply that

00:35:28.093 --> 00:35:31.189
can supply 100 amps,
and guess what,

00:35:31.189 --> 00:35:34.461
I've made the changes,
but guess what,

00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:41.096
I still see the spikes.
Good try, but it didn't work

00:35:41.096 --> 00:35:43.640
out.
Good try, good try.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.958
What next?
Any other solutions?

00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:50.276
Yes?
So dips are because of the

00:35:50.276 --> 00:35:56.470
resistance, and the spikes are
because of the inductance?

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:02.000
You're half correct.
So, which one is it?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.099
So, dips are because of
resistances, and spikes are

00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:11.484
because of inductances.
You're half correct.

00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:17.603
It turns out that both the dips
and the spikes are because of

00:36:17.603 --> 00:36:21.478
inductances.
OK, but be that as it may,

00:36:21.478 --> 00:36:27.393
let me give you the next clue
here, and then see if you can

00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:33.206
come closer to the answer.
So, what I've done here is I've

00:36:33.206 --> 00:36:38.000
made this wire really,
really long.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.857
OK, it's a really long wire,
OK, but it's a thick wire,

00:36:41.857 --> 00:36:44.142
so it's a long,
long, thick wire.

00:36:44.142 --> 00:36:46.928
So it's not the resistance.
It's really,

00:36:46.928 --> 00:36:50.071
really thick and mongo,
and it's a long wire,

00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:54.500
so a signal wire above a ground
plane behaves like an inductor.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.214
And so here,
it has the capacitance to,

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:59.500
but in this case it's
inductance.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.802
It's inductance here.
So, I'll give you another ten

00:37:04.802 --> 00:37:10.022
seconds to think about it and
then tell you the answer.

00:37:10.022 --> 00:37:15.628
But despite the inductance
here, it turns out if I take out

00:37:15.628 --> 00:37:19.107
this resistor,
the problem goes away.

00:37:19.107 --> 00:37:24.133
Look, I take out the resistor,
the problem goes away.

00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:34.617
Yes, there is an inductor here.
OK, I take out this resistor,

00:37:34.617 --> 00:37:44.885
problem goes away.
I put the resistor back in,

00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:46.939
boom.
Yes?

00:37:46.939 --> 00:37:54.469
OK, pretty good.
That's 86 points.

00:37:54.469 --> 00:38:03.984
So here's what's going on.
There's an inductor here,

00:38:03.984 --> 00:38:06.920
and when I put a 50 ohm
resistor here,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.333
I put this resistor.
When the PFET turns on,

00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:13.746
it draws a current.
OK, it's going to draw a

00:38:13.746 --> 00:38:15.888
current.
It draws a current;

00:38:15.888 --> 00:38:19.619
remember that across an
inductor, I have a drop.

00:38:19.619 --> 00:38:22.238
And the drop relates to the
di/dt.

00:38:22.238 --> 00:38:26.047
Remember, for a capacitor,
the current is Cdv/dt.

00:38:26.047 --> 00:38:29.857
For the inductor,
the voltage across the inductor

00:38:29.857 --> 00:38:33.061
is Ldi/dt.
So, if di/dt,

00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:37.632
from switching a large current
through the inductor every

00:38:37.632 --> 00:38:40.571
cycle, OK, big di/dt,
di/dt is large.

00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:44.163
I've made it large by having a
very small RL,

00:38:44.163 --> 00:38:47.591
so, you know,
pulling a big current through

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:50.204
every few, whatever,
every cycle,

00:38:50.204 --> 00:38:53.306
and then stopping it.
And so therefore,

00:38:53.306 --> 00:38:58.122
I'm getting these big drops
across this inductor that relate

00:38:58.122 --> 00:39:00.163
to Ldi/dt.
In other words,

00:39:00.163 --> 00:39:05.968
the power supply here is fine.
While you guys were watching,

00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:08.819
I switched to the huge,
mongo power supply,

00:39:08.819 --> 00:39:12.825
and so this voltage is fine.
But then this voltage after the

00:39:12.825 --> 00:39:16.151
wire is the problem.
So, this voltage here doesn't

00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:19.681
look like this anymore.
Rather, it has spikes that go

00:39:19.681 --> 00:39:22.736
down, for example,
and when I switch the other

00:39:22.736 --> 00:39:24.976
way, they go up.
OK, so therefore,

00:39:24.976 --> 00:39:30.000
what I end up having here is
big spikes on this power supply.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.562
And when this guy's power
supply goes wacko,

00:39:33.562 --> 00:39:37.124
then I see the spikes on its
output as well.

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:40.272
OK, so what are the solutions
for that?

00:39:40.272 --> 00:39:43.834
Any solutions here?
What can I do to fix the

00:39:43.834 --> 00:39:45.076
problem?
Pardon?

00:39:45.076 --> 00:39:46.982
Stop using the,
exactly.

00:39:46.982 --> 00:39:49.633
When in doubt,
do something else.

00:39:49.633 --> 00:39:54.106
Build a different design.
So what I could do is this is

00:39:54.106 --> 00:39:59.962
pretty dumb, using a long wire.
And so, no, but trust me,

00:39:59.962 --> 00:40:04.516
oftentimes you go to the store
room and they give you a big

00:40:04.516 --> 00:40:07.735
roll of wire,
and you're too lazy to cut a

00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:10.012
piece out.
Use the whole roll,

00:40:10.012 --> 00:40:13.074
and use the two ends,
and connect it in,

00:40:13.074 --> 00:40:15.429
OK?
So, if I had a much shorter

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:18.962
piece of wire,
then that can solve my problem.

00:40:18.962 --> 00:40:22.888
But again, remember,
what's small to you may not be

00:40:22.888 --> 00:40:25.871
small to the circuit.
OK, so let's say,

00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:29.090
for example,
I'm Intel, and I'm building a

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:33.487
10 GHz Pentium 6 processor.
OK, it's 0.1 nanosecond is my

00:40:33.487 --> 00:40:37.488
cycle time.
There, even a small,

00:40:37.488 --> 00:40:40.241
itty bitty wire can be a real
problem.

00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:44.111
OK, and so therefore,
distributing power throughout a

00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:47.906
one inch chip that's clocking at
10 GHz is a really,

00:40:47.906 --> 00:40:51.479
really hard problem.
And our own David Perreault,

00:40:51.479 --> 00:40:55.497
who is doing one of our
sections, is one of the world's

00:40:55.497 --> 00:40:58.548
experts in this field.
Distributing power,

00:40:58.548 --> 00:41:02.269
something as simple as,
how do I get 1V in a stable

00:41:02.269 --> 00:41:05.246
manner to every single device on
my chip?

00:41:05.246 --> 00:41:10.814
It's a hard problem.
OK, so now, you have to begin

00:41:10.814 --> 00:41:15.569
feeding your power supply
connections much like RC

00:41:15.569 --> 00:41:19.839
circuits, OK,
and you have to solve some hard

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:25.080
problems to be able to simply
distribute power decently

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.641
throughout your circuit.
So, what else can I do?

00:41:29.641 --> 00:41:32.033
Yeah?
Say it again?

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:35.850
Ah, I can do that.
I could use different wires to

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:39.826
connect each of the inverters.
That's a good point.

00:41:39.826 --> 00:41:44.120
So here, the coupling happens
because I connect the two

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.255
inverters way out here.
So instead, I use a different

00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:50.720
cable.
I hadn't thought of that.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.060
That's a creative solution.
OK, so in fact,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.877
if you build a chip,
so we built this chip called

00:41:57.877 --> 00:42:01.534
RAW in our group,
and it has on the order of 10

00:42:01.534 --> 00:42:06.050
million gates.
And this chip we built with

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.696
IBM's technology,
and it turns out that you don't

00:42:09.696 --> 00:42:14.253
send power supply in through a
pin and then connect that 1.5V

00:42:14.253 --> 00:42:18.354
supply to all your gates.
What you do is from that pin,

00:42:18.354 --> 00:42:22.227
you then build special power
supply buffering trees.

00:42:22.227 --> 00:42:25.569
And each tree,
each leaf of the tree drives a

00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:27.544
subcircuit.
In other words,

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:31.265
if this is a chip,
you have lots and lots of gates

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:36.903
throughout your chip.
What you do not do is bring in

00:42:36.903 --> 00:42:40.967
a power supply like this,
and then connect.

00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:45.709
You don't do that.
That's the worst possible thing

00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:49.580
you can do.
It's an absolute disaster for

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.000
the reason just brought up.
OK, so instead what you do is

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.258
divide up the chip into,
say, four quadrants.

00:42:59.258 --> 00:43:04.000
OK, in our case,
we have 16 quadrants.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.216
And then what you do is from
this point, you take one wire

00:43:08.216 --> 00:43:12.063
that goes to this quadrant,
one wire that comes here,

00:43:12.063 --> 00:43:15.687
one here, and one here,
so that you're getting the

00:43:15.687 --> 00:43:20.126
power supply very close to the
source, and you have different

00:43:20.126 --> 00:43:24.120
connections going to each
quadrant so that switching in

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.967
this quadrant will not affect
this guy because of the

00:43:27.967 --> 00:43:33.006
inductance of this lead here.
OK, and if you hadn't taken

00:43:33.006 --> 00:43:37.612
6.002, you'd have been arguing
with IBM, I don't want 16 wires.

00:43:37.612 --> 00:43:40.807
I want just one wire.
OK, so there are other

00:43:40.807 --> 00:43:44.670
solutions, of course.
There's a couple more solution.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:49.277
One is that what you can do is
part of the problem here is that

00:43:49.277 --> 00:43:52.471
all my transitions are really,
really sharp.

00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:54.849
OK, so di/dt is very,
very large.

00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:58.787
So, there's a whole new
technique in design of digital

00:43:58.787 --> 00:44:01.610
and analog circuits,
which talks about,

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.102
maybe I should call it waveform
engineering, OK,

00:44:05.102 --> 00:44:09.773
or edge engineering.
OK, it's also called edge

00:44:09.773 --> 00:44:12.468
smoothing.
The idea is that rather than

00:44:12.468 --> 00:44:16.226
have very sharp edges in your
circuit, you try to have

00:44:16.226 --> 00:44:19.134
smoother edges.
And when you have smoother

00:44:19.134 --> 00:44:22.680
edges, OK, then your di/dt is
now going to be less.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.234
It's not going to be very,
very high.

00:44:25.234 --> 00:44:29.276
Rather, your delta I is spread
out over a longer period of

00:44:29.276 --> 00:44:31.404
time.
Of course, that means the

00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:34.241
circuits may have to run a
little slower,

00:44:34.241 --> 00:44:38.000
but that can also solve the
problem.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.261
And in fact,
that same smoothing of the

00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:46.068
waveforms was also the solution
you saw in the capacitive

00:44:46.068 --> 00:44:49.330
coupling we saw a month and a
half ago.

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.364
And let me show you the demo,
and then close up.

00:44:53.364 --> 00:44:55.596
Not working?
OK, that's OK.

00:44:55.596 --> 00:45:00.487
It doesn't matter.
So if you remember the demo

00:45:00.487 --> 00:45:05.923
from the lecture about a month
and a half ago in capacitors,

00:45:05.923 --> 00:45:10.898
I talked about a chip with two
pins, and there was this

00:45:10.898 --> 00:45:14.215
capacitive coupling between the
pins.

00:45:14.215 --> 00:45:18.822
And because of this,
if this waveform is switching,

00:45:18.822 --> 00:45:23.797
then because of this coupling,
you will end up getting,

00:45:23.797 --> 00:45:29.049
if this is the signal here,
you will end up getting spikes

00:45:29.049 --> 00:45:33.932
on this pin because of the
signaling of the other pin.

00:45:33.932 --> 00:45:39.000
And that's good old capacitive
coupling.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.471
OK, and to eliminate this,
what you can do is much like

00:45:42.471 --> 00:45:45.878
with the inductance system,
if you, rather than having

00:45:45.878 --> 00:45:49.735
sharp transitions on this pin,
if you have smooth transitions

00:45:49.735 --> 00:45:52.949
that look like this,
then what you can do is you'll

00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:56.678
now spread delta V from here to
here over a longer delta T.

00:45:56.678 --> 00:45:59.892
OK, delta T has become longer,
and because of that,

00:45:59.892 --> 00:46:03.750
you end up getting much better
behavior, and you don't end up

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.848
getting these spikes.
So therefore,

00:46:06.848 --> 00:46:10.045
if you want to build really,
really fast circuits,

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:13.829
you have to be really careful.
You can build fast circuits,

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:15.982
but watch out for them fast
edges.

00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:18.526
OK, fast edges are nasty.
They kill you.

00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:22.636
That's something to remember as
you build the next generation of

00:46:22.636 --> 00:46:24.528
circuits.
Well, thank you all.

00:46:24.528 --> 00:46:27.203
I had a blast,
and I hope you guys had fun

00:46:27.203 --> 00:46:28.203
too.
Thank you.
