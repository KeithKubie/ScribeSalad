in and also what are the kinds of things
that they may be struggling with so if

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740
that they may be struggling with so if
 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.740
that they may be struggling with so if
there's a child that is struggling with

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750
there's a child that is struggling with
 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.240
there's a child that is struggling with
a certain way of conceiving of complex

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250
a certain way of conceiving of complex
 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.710
a certain way of conceiving of complex
problems so maybe they're struggling in

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720
problems so maybe they're struggling in
 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.329
problems so maybe they're struggling in
math a little bit there's a lot of

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339
math a little bit there's a lot of

different kinds of games that give kids

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
different kinds of games that give kids
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.029
different kinds of games that give kids
practice in ordering certain kinds of

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039
practice in ordering certain kinds of
 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.920
practice in ordering certain kinds of
problems working through kinds of

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
problems working through kinds of
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.950
problems working through kinds of
certain sequences of logic maybe there's

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960
certain sequences of logic maybe there's
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.790

a kid that has a passion around sports

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
a kid that has a passion around sports
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.740
a kid that has a passion around sports
sports games are a great opportunity for

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750
sports games are a great opportunity for
 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.979
sports games are a great opportunity for
them to get in there and play with their

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989
them to get in there and play with their
 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.689
them to get in there and play with their
friends but also gain some facility

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699
friends but also gain some facility
 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.420
friends but also gain some facility
around the technology and so it mostly

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430
around the technology and so it mostly
 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.650
around the technology and so it mostly
has to do with trying to match an

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660
has to do with trying to match an
 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.599

interest that their child might have
with what a game might be offering not

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
with what a game might be offering not
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.479
with what a game might be offering not
just in terms of content but also in the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489
just in terms of content but also in the
 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.369
just in terms of content but also in the
type of game so if you have a kid that

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379
type of game so if you have a kid that

is let's say really interested in and
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.890
is let's say really interested in and
i'll go back to the math and engineering

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900
i'll go back to the math and engineering
 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.940

we have a program at the Institute of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520
we have a program at the Institute of
 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.430
we have a program at the Institute of
play called play force where we bring in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440
play called play force where we bring in
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.410
play called play force where we bring in
kids from third grade up until college

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420
kids from third grade up until college
 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.550
kids from third grade up until college
and they play test games for us and they

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
and they play test games for us and they
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.390
and they play test games for us and they
tell us what they think are valuable

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
tell us what they think are valuable
 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.430
tell us what they think are valuable
about the games and what we found is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440
about the games and what we found is
 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.810
about the games and what we found is
with some of the younger kids that the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820
with some of the younger kids that the
 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.000
with some of the younger kids that the
moms started coming in with the kids and

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010
moms started coming in with the kids and
 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.590
moms started coming in with the kids and
they would sit next to him and start to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600
they would sit next to him and start to
 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.890
they would sit next to him and start to
play and there was a radical change in

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
play and there was a radical change in
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.960
play and there was a radical change in
the relationship a between the parents

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970
the relationship a between the parents
 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.370
the relationship a between the parents
understanding of what their kids were

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
understanding of what their kids were
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.130
understanding of what their kids were
learning from these games and be just in

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140
learning from these games and be just in
 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.170
learning from these games and be just in
the relationship between that parent and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
the relationship between that parent and
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.420
the relationship between that parent and
child as the child became an expert in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430
child as the child became an expert in
 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.340
child as the child became an expert in
explaining to the mom what they were

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350
explaining to the mom what they were
 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.680
explaining to the mom what they were
doing what they were learning how to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690
doing what they were learning how to
 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.840
doing what they were learning how to
play the game and so that's a really

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850
play the game and so that's a really
 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.729
play the game and so that's a really
powerful role that you can put your

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
powerful role that you can put your
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.160
powerful role that you can put your
child in is letting them be the teacher

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
child in is letting them be the teacher
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.500
child in is letting them be the teacher
and letting them share with you what it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510
and letting them share with you what it
 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.910
and letting them share with you what it
is that they find so interesting about

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920
is that they find so interesting about
 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.470
is that they find so interesting about
this thing that they're doing and it has

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
this thing that they're doing and it has
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.900
this thing that they're doing and it has
consequences in terms of their potential

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
consequences in terms of their potential
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.480
consequences in terms of their potential
for future learning
