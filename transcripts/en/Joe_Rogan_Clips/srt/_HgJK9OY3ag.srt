1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,470
Travel is a little bit perhaps like
music or looking at art on the wall.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,500
You kind of have to have somebody teach
you how to do it a little bit. Yeah,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,000
it's like the fight
game, Yo, you know, you,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
somebody could sit with you and and
get really bored with technical boxing.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
It might be the best you've ever seen
and it's not a slug fest or a Braun.

6
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:25,260
You have to explain,
well see some jazz,

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,790
some jazz bitches,

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:34,791
brew Conor Mcgregor's bitches brew
arguably one of the smell several.

9
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,390
It's all over the place and let's say,

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,210
and some is very contained
like the disc jockeys voice.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,860
Yeah, yeah. There's some
people very mechanized.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,140
The jazz thing is a really good analogy
because you either into jazz are you not

13
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:53,700
into jazz and I've never,
I liked a lichen is background music,

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,391
but I have a good friend,

15
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:59,391
my friend Alonzo Boden is a jazz efficient
natto and he like host jazz tours and

16
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,160
stuff and he's a stand up comic.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,100
So he'll do like comedy on these
things and he just loves it.

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,290
I mean he like lives for it. Well, I,

19
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,490
she look on your face just because
nobody taught you how to taste beer.

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,230
Beer works in three parts and like
it says in the Pickwick papers,

21
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:20,600
you don't taste it with a ship.
Wait. Tastes, yeah. Gotta go up.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,730
You've got a quaff. You got something.
And when you describe, well,

23
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,030
there's the finish to the taste
of a Cuban cigar. They go,

24
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:31,170
you mean when it's finished
in the APP? No, the finish.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,770
Okay. Somebody explained
these things to me. All right.

26
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:38,340
What's the difference between Scotch
whiskey and Tennessee Bourbon? Well,

27
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:43,020
there's an e in the word,
Bourbon whiskey. There's an e in,

28
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:47,490
there is no EDD in the war. In
whiskey for Scotch. Okay. That simple,

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,860
short of starts it jazz music.

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,720
Somebody explains it to you
in very simple, digestible,

31
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,100
not lofty neck tie terms.
Okay?

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,470
You begin to understand a little bit
of what's going on. How do you get,

33
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,230
how do you explain it to them? Okay.
How would you explain jazz? I'm gonna,

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,850
I'll really tighten up for
you. Um, excuse me. Wow.

35
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,700
At least I've got my
health. Go for me. Huh? Um,

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,310
we'll do it in the Beatles style.

37
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:18,610
Here's the best way to go for somebody
new and interested the McCartney note and

38
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:22,710
that Lennon knew. Okay. The Mccartney
note is always kind of happy.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,020
I've actually bumped into Sir Paul over
at Henson Studios and he's really happy.

40
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay. And here's another, we'll go. Yeah.

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,520
Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,670
Here. How pretty that sounds. That
sounds pretty. I'll do it again. Yep.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Bada Bada Ba Lennon.

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,080
He's the salt and the caramel
baby. He's got, there's a darkness.

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,230
There's an edge. There's a shadow.
Listen to the last three notes.

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,590
Ah,
Donna.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,790
Ah.
Dropoff.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,180
And there's a little darkness.

49
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,860
It wasn't those last three notes
is where you'd get that little,

50
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,990
just a little bit of pepper
in the chocolate. Yo. Nada.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,970
MMM MM

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,730
hmm. And it's a little wistful, is a
little melancholy and eat life like that.

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,180
And when you put them together,
it doesn't sound like they do.

54
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,590
But if I could, I'd sing both parts
and it goes together and you go, wow.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,980
Bittersweet. Mm. Like my fucking career.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,140
Like my last three rules.
There we go.

57
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,350
So you kind of have to listen to jazz.
Like you would taste one ish,

58
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,580
k the best for this felonious
monk, you know, same thing.

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,460
The right hand is Paul left his
job and he's working these days.

60
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,720
You can't tell is it happy? The Shad,
right? I Dunno. How was dinner last night?

61
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,643
Same,

62
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
but yet it is a indicative of that's
what's around you because snatches dappy

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,240
that's Disney snatches sad.
You know, think of something,

64
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,770
somebody who's always
tuning his guitar to sad.

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,060
There are some folks who,
Leonard Cohen in his past as well,

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,860
that sounded more like Bowie,
but I know what you mean.
