00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:20.590
Today I found out UPS was started by two teenagers
with 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:33.180
one bicycle and $100 borrowed from a friend.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.300
The date was August 28, 1907 and the two kids
were 18 year old Claude Ryan and 19 year old

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.300
Jim Casey.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.570
The two had one bike between them and $100
(about $2400 today) borrowed from a friend

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.090
to found the “American Messenger Company”
in Seattle, Washington.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.149
The company was initially run in a hotel basement
at Second Avenue and Main Street in Seattle.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.270
At that time, most people didn’t own phones,
so sending telegrams was a frequent thing.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120
These had to be hand delivered.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.520
In the beginning, the company primarily delivered
these telegrams, but eventually expanded into

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.650
transporting pretty much anything that could
be transported on a bicycle or on foot.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.440
Casey and Ryan manned the phone while Casey’s
brother George and a handful of other teenagers

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.590
went out making deliveries.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.010
Fast-forward a few years and Casey and Ryan
had merged their company with rival Merchant’s

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.720
Parcel Delivery taking the latter’s name.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.370
In the process, they acquired a few motorcycles
and delivery cars with their first car being

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.670
a Ford Model T. At this time, more and more
people had telephones so Casey and Ryan switched

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:56.700
to working with retail stores to deliver customers
purchases to their homes.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.670
By the time Casey retired from UPS in 1962,
the company had grown to operating in 31 U.S.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.170
states with annual revenue around $550 million
and about 22,000 workers.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.750
Fast forward to 2013 and Casey and Ryan’s
company that started so humbly is now worth

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.530
approximately $80 billion with annual revenue
at over $50 billion; employing just under

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.840
half a million workers in 200 countries; delivering
over 3.8 billion packages and documents a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.840
year.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:55.810
Amazing what $100, some elbow grease, and
a bit of ingenuity can do.
