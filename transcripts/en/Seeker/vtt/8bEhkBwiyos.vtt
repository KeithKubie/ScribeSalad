00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.540
People who somehow in this day and age still
don’t believe in evolution like to argue

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.509
that we’re too complex to share a common
ancestor with single cell organisms.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.150
“Show me the evidence,” they cry.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.680
Ok, here it is.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.210
Hi there my fellow complex organisms, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.460
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Biology in Germany recently watched

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.210
organisms make the transition from independent
single cells to sustainable multicellular

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.870
life forms in real time.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.190
Pseudomonas fluorescens are bacteria that
usually grow independently from each other,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.510
but sometimes they mutate and produce a glue
that causes them to stick together.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.280
When they do they form mats at the surface
of the fluids they're grown in in the lab.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.150
This gives them better access to oxygen at
the surface and lets them thrive.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.340
But once they form a mat, they give the bacteria
that don't make the glue a platform.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.820
Because they aren't wasting energy, the non-sticky
Pseudomonas outcompete their brethren and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.329
eventually break the mat.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.930
Thanks to the cheats at the top that are hogging
all the energy without giving back, the whole

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.420
thing sinks, and they all die.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.750
And I can hear the flame wars starting in
the comments already, but there's no political

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.820
metaphor here, guys.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.010
It’s just some bacteria in a tube.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.880
Paul Rainey, who led the study, wanted to
see if there was a way the mats could become

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.320
self sustaining instead of just dying off
when they became overburdened.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
He allowed them to grow under 2 circumstances,
one where the cheats were removed, and one

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.750
where the cheats were allowed to stay and
became the genesis of the next wave of glue-making

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.750
bacteria.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.619
Both scenarios ended up causing a life cycle
of mat-forming P fluorescens, but the really

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.790
interesting thing is when they were examined
the mats in both cases, the individual cells

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.630
were working together and were more fit as
a whole than they would be individually, the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.380
same way you and your stomach only survive
when working together instead of being separate

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.280
cells.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.590
Even the dirty dirty cheats on top were contributing
to the fitness of the mat as a whole.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.170
This is the complete opposite of what happens
in group projects in school.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.080
It was the beginning of multicellular cooperative
life.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.700
It’s evolution, in real time, right in front
of your face.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.259
How cool is that?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.220
If you still need further proof that Darwin
is a boss, Laci and Catie Wayne have a video

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.130
on that right over here.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.150
Have you witnessed any scientific principles
come to life?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.760
Let us know in the comments, and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
