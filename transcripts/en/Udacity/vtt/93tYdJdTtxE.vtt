00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.430
We've covered a lot in this lesson, from a high level view of why

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.220
a file system is useful, down to

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.330
implementation details and optimizations used in today's

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.270
sophisticated systems. If you keep these ideas

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.330
in mind, you've become a better programmer,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.400
and appreciate the complexity behind the systems

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.480
we use every day. So long for now.
