00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.020
- [Sal] Let's study the
market for soda a little bit.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.200
And so, we're going to
draw our traditional axes,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.143
so that is price, and that is quantity.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.430
And we have seen our classic
supply and demand curves.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.770
So, this could be our
upward-sloping supply curve

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.860
at a low price.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.510
Not a lotta people wanna produce soda,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.540
but as price goes higher,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.130
more and more people
would wanna produce it.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.850
And we could also view that
as a marginal cost curve.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.430
That first unit might be
quite easy to produce,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.510
but then it gets a little
bit more and more expensive

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.560
or costly to produce as
you have to hire and train

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.220
more people and get real
estate for your factories.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.030
So, you could also view this
as a marginal cost curve.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.310
And then, on the demand side,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.230
we have our classic downward-sloping curve

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.063
at a high price.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:48.970
Not a lotta people are
gonna want the soda.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.300
But then, as price gets lower,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.960
a lot more people are gonna want the soda.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.470
So, this is our demand curve,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.230
which we could also view as
a marginal benefit curve.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.840
That first unit of soda,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.840
someone's going to get
a huge benefit for it,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170
and so they have a high
willingness to pay.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.330
And then every incremental unit,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.120
people might just get a
little bit less benefit,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.300
and so they have a little
bit less willingness to pay,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.010
which makes this downward sloping.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.610
And so, we have our,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.930
this, we could also view as
a marginal benefit curve.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.180
And we have, and this is all review,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.700
you would have your equilibrium quantity

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.660
that the market would produce
and the equilibrium price.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.850
But now, I'm going to introduce a new idea

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.670
because everything we talked about here,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.530
the marginal benefit and the cost,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
this was just the marginal private benefit

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810
and the marginal private cost.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.020
It's not factoring in
society's benefits and costs.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.110
And so, let me relabel this a little bit.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.860
Instead of just saying marginal benefit,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm gonna call this the
marginal private benefit.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080
And instead of marginal cost,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.900
I'm going to call this
the marginal private cost.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.210
And this is the equilibrium price

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.010
we would get to if we just factored

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.930
in the private the costs and benefits.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.850
And this is the equilibrium quantity

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.090
if we just factored in the
private costs and benefits.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670
And so, I know what you're thinking,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.840
so that's nice, Sal, but how do we

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.390
factor in the social benefits or costs?

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.650
Well, for something like soda,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.890
you could have some negative social costs.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.490
And when you have negative social costs,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.070
you would call that a
negative externality.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.470
So, there are some negative externalities

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.490
when you are thinking about soda.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.320
It could be that the cans cause pollution

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.300
that has to be cleaned up by society.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.460
It could be that all
that sugar or corn syrup

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.760
inside of people's bloodstream

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.720
gives 'em diabetes or decays their teeth.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.880
And society's going to
have to pay for it somehow.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.270
And so, another way to think about it is

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.380
we could add those negative externalities

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.330
to the marginal private cost,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.850
and we could get a
marginal social cost curve.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.940
And so, let me do that.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.800
So, if we add the negative externalities,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.780
we get a marginal social cost curve.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.630
So, this factors in the
negative externalities.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.270
So, I'll call this the
marginal social cost.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.830
And let's say, for a soda,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.770
the private benefit, just for simplicity,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.500
is equal to the social
benefit on the margin.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.220
So, I'll say this is the same thing

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.500
as the marginal social benefit curve.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.070
But now, if you think about it
form society's point of view,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.210
what is the optimal price and quantity?

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.560
Well, then you wanna think
about where marginal social cost

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.380
is equal to marginal social benefit,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.820
because if you produce,
you wanna keep producing

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.270
as long as the social benefit

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.130
is higher than the social cost.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.050
But then, when the social cost is higher

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.040
than the social benefit,
well, then that's not good.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.090
Then you're going to
create negative benefit,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.840
or harm, to society.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.740
So, it'd be rational to
produce up to this quantity,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.060
this quantity right over here.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.950
So, this is the optimal quantity

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.420
from a societal point of view.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.860
And this would be the optimal price

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.720
from a societal point of view.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.360
But if you just let the private markets

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.310
happen as they are, what happens?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.150
Well, then you're overproducing

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.090
from a societal point of view.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.030
And if you think about it
from a societal point of view,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.300
this is what is optimal,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.160
but you produce all this quantity

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.320
where the marginal social cost is higher

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.230
than the marginal social benefit.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.810
And so, all of this is going to take away

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.400
from society's benefit, from
the total surplus for society.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.080
And so, this is going to
create deadweight loss

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.740
because these quantities are different.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.660
Now, we could also think about a scenario

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.460
with positive externalities.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.463
Let's imagine the exercise,

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:43.610
let's say the, I don't know,
exercise equipment market,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.010
exercise equipment market.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.730
We could draw similar curves.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.010
So, here, we have quantity,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.533
we have price,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.420
we have our marginal
private benefit curve,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.020
which would be our demand curve,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.120
so marginal private benefit,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120
and we have our marginal
private cost curves,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.130
just like that, marginal private cost.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.910
And if we just let this market operate,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.380
just thinking about the
private cost and benefit,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.920
we would produce that quantity.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.640
And I'll say that's just considering

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.320
the private side of things.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.200
And we would be at that price.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.400
But let's say that there's
a positive externality here.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.370
So, there's a positive externality.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.203
What is it?

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.880
Well, the more exercise
equipment that's out there,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.660
the more people that are gonna exercise,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.110
it's going to make them happier,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.970
it's going to lower
their healthcare costs,

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.180
and so we would wanna add that benefit,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.350
that positive externality,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.210
to the marginal private benefit curve

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.190
to get the marginal social benefit curve.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.280
So, let's do that.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.820
So, we're gonna add to this,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.140
and we're going to get the
marginal social benefit curve,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.100
marginal social benefit.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.890
And let's say the marginal social cost

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.380
is the same thing as the
marginal private cost curve,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.920
marginal social cost right over here.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.520
So, if you think about
what's optimal for society,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.160
society should want more
and more exercise equipment

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.460
to be produced as long as
the marginal social benefit

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.130
is higher than the marginal social cost.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.990
But as soon as the marginal
social cost gets higher

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.230
than the marginal social benefit,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.660
then that makes no sense, that
would create negative value.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.580
And so, what's optimal for
society is to produce up to that.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.370
So, this is the quantity
that's optimal for society.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.860
This is the price that's
optimal for society.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.630
But if we just let the
private benefit and cost

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.700
be what decides the
equilibrium price and quantity,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.530
well, we're only going
to produce this far.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.790
So, from a society point of view,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.340
we lost out on all of this quantity

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.110
where the marginal social benefit

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.400
is higher than the marginal social cost.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.330
So, you have this deadweight
loss right over there.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
So, the big takeaway here is,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.360
when you factor in negative externalities

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.200
or positive externalities,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.440
you might discover
deadweight loss to society.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.490
And so, an interesting question

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.650
is to think about how
could society rectify that.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.250
And there are ways to start
to at least approach it.
