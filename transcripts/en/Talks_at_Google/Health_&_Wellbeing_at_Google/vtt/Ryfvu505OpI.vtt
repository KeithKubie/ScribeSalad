[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:07.420
SPEAKER: Hi, guys.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.990
Thank you everybody
so much for coming.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.740
We have two really exciting
guests with us today,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.530
and I think some
of their stories

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.260
are really going
to give all of us

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.290
a little extra something
to think about today.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.990
So, I have Coss Marte
and Shane Ennover.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.070
So before we really
get into everything

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.560
we're going to discuss today,
I want to actually play

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.490
a little clip for everybody.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.230
So Coss actually had an
experience with BuzzFeed,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
where they took a couple
guys that were not inmates

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.510
to a prison and actually had
them work out there for a week.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.730
And I think that'll really
frame up the conversation

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.147
and give everyone a sense
of what ConBody really is.

00:00:54.147 --> 00:00:55.230
Can you guys cue the tape?

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:01.614
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:03.405
- Start off with the
regular jumping jacks.

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:04.230
Don't pass out yet.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.080
Sideways, Rocco.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.670
Let's go.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.859
- So the guy who is training
us this week is Coss.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.650
Coss is relentless.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.941
- You know how to count to ten?

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:11.760
You're going to fuck up today.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
- He's so understated
when he's talking to you.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.430
As soon as class gets
started, he's a psycho.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.840
That's five laps, Rocco?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.500
No it ain't.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.370
Don't cheat me.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.640
You're going to do five laps.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.630
- I've seen him in
the men's fitness,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.892
and you know I
was like, Oh yeah,

00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:24.010
I'm going to start
doing this stuff.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.692
I've been doing it
before, but it really

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:26.900
encourages me when I see him.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.090
I was like, He did
it, I can do it too.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.950
- The ConBody workout is
insanity times 10 with a prison

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.890
kick into it.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.040
Within five days of this
workout they'll probably

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.560
lose five to 10 pounds.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.740
It's all body weight.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100
I actually developed this whole
routine in my prison cell.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.770
I started selling
drugs on a milk crate

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.750
and I grew it out to a
multimillion dollar drug

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.150
business, and I was sentenced
to seven years in prison.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.890
I came up with the
idea of ConBody

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.490
while I was in
solitary confinement.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.420
Now I have over 7,000 clients.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.758
- One, two, three.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.100
- God.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.270
Anything bad I ever ate,
I regret it right now.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.635
- You ain't even getting low.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:02.760
You ain't even getting low.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.090
- I'm just trying to
survive with my breathing.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.842
- Lets go all the way back.

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:08.550
All the way back.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.549
They're waiting for you.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.470
- My arms just couldn't do it.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.660
This is non-stop.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.050
- Bring it back, come on.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.730
Come on.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.170
Let's go, all the way back.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.350
All the way back.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.650
Let's go.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.581
Push it.

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:20.080
Push it.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.150
It's almost over,
it's almost over.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.871
One lap.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:23.678
Give him a hand.

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:24.344
Give him a hand.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:24.844
[CHEERING]

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:25.817
- Let's go.

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:27.781
Last one happened.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.254
Let's go.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.640
SPEAKER: So that's just
a little something,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060
I think, what people
can expect when

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.532
they go into ConBody studio.

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:37.240
COSS MARTE: Yeah.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.130
SPEAKER: But Coss, let's
talk a little bit more

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.760
about how this all started
and what actually landed you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.230
in prison.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.967
COSS MARTE: Yeah.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.550
I'm just going to
ask a quick question

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.020
to everybody in the audience.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.740
Who here has been so excited to
go on a job interview before?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.340
Nobody?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.120
You hate Google?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.980
Well.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.770
Fuck this shit.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.040
Now imagine yourself going
through a job interview

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.020
and now having that door
slammed in your face

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.780
when he came to Google.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.850
This happened to
me over 100 times

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.820
when I was released
in 2013, when

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.170
I was released from prison.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.920
And every time I went
to apply for a job

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.750
I had to check off the check
mark and say I had a felony.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280
And every time I went to any
convenience store, any clothing

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.160
store in midtown, they
said, you have a felony?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.354
And I'll see the
reaction in their face

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:31.770
or they'll look
at the application

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.500
and they'll just
put it to the side.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.840
And it was just discouraging and
frustrating for the most part.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.680
And that's where I came up with
ConBody, out of desperation.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.780
I had the idea when I was
in prison to start ConBody.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.835
This is all derived from my
whole experience growing up.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.460
I was born and raised
in the Lower East

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.040
Side of New York City.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.070
On Broome and Eldridge is where
I started selling drugs at,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.730
where ConBody is today.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.430
My mom immigrated from
the Dominican Republic

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.010
when she was six months
pregnant with me.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.674
And when she came
we had very little.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:14.840
We lived on my Aunt's couch.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.899
I would go to work
with her, because she

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.910
would sneak me under
her sewing machine

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.140
and just babysit me there.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.330
It was sad because
I wanted more.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.540
And I'd see the other kids
in school with other things

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.342
and when the teacher
asked us what

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.800
do you want to be
when you grow up,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.030
I always said I
wanted to be rich

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.490
because I felt like that was
the way I can escape poverty.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.550
And the first opportunity
that I became rich

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.800
was from the world of drugs.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.340
I'd seen all the guys on the
corner who were selling drugs

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.110
on my block and they had
cars and money and everything

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.430
I really wanted.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.700
And at 11 I started smoking
weed and started following

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.170
in their footsteps,
became somebody

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.420
that was looking out for them.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.890
And then I began
selling for them

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.880
at 13 and from there
it quickly escalated.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.380
And my good friend and
I, Joey [INAUDIBLE], we

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.515
changed the way we sold drugs.

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.640
I'm going to teach you how
to sell drugs right now,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.230
so take notes if you
want to quit Google

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.970
and hit the streets.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.450
But no, what we
did was we stopped

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.950
hanging around in the corner.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.050
We used to wear big jeans and
very stereotypical Jordans.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.320
A typical drug dealer that
was selling on the corner.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.690
And we would get stopped
every single day by cops

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.510
and they would harass
us and lock us up.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.530
I've been in and out about
10 times for BS charges

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.730
and so we came up with
an idea of wearing suits,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.690
going up to people
that started changing

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.940
the neighborhood because
it was like really getting

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.729
gentrified at the time.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:07.770
This was the early 2000s.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.610
And we made 10,000 business
cards and we went up

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.760
to everybody who
looked like they

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.160
used drugs and our pitch line
was like, Do you want blow?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.120
And they were like, What the
hell are you talking about?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.380
But it was pretty crazy.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.530
From there it started
escalating and by the age of 19

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.750
I was making over
$2 million a year.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.400
I had over 20 people
working for me.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.470
I had this whole operation
delivery service.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.140
It went down at 23
when federal agents

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.330
came knocking on my door.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.950
They found everything and they
took everything away from me.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.510
And that's when I was faced
with seven years in prison

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.370
At this point, I
went into a prison

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.420
and doctors told me that I
could die because of my health

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.920
issues.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.150
And this is the first
time I really found out

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.580
that I had any health issues.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.600
The doctors said that my
cholesterol levels were so high

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.050
that I probably could die from a
heart attack within five years.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.530
And they're saying being
sentenced to seven years

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.660
and having five years
to live in prison,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.610
I told myself I was not going
to die in this situation.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.030
Especially because I
had a two-year-old son

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.200
when I went in.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.230
Now he's nine years old.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.690
Yeah I went in there
and I basically

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.840
started moving as soon
as they told me that I

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.920
had all these health issues.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.160
So I went back to
my cell and started

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.495
doing dips and push-ups.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.550
It was crazy.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.580
I worked out for about five
minutes and then passed out.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.480
And then I just sat there
on my bed and I was like,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.540
I need to start doing
something with my life,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.730
start really taking
advantage of this time.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.470
I went out to the yard and
I started running the yard.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.220
And I was the only
person running the yard

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.260
and then going back to
my unit and working out.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.170
And I started working out
like two to three hours a day,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.440
and from there I
helped over 20 inmates

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.190
lose was over 1,000
pounds combined.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.300
So I took that same program that
I started in the prison yard

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.980
and I set out.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.300
This is what I really
wanted to duplicate.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.700
But I didn't think
about that while I

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.280
was doing it in the yard.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.390
It was towards the end
of my prison experience

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.660
where I had a
spiritual awakening.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.900
I was walking towards
the medical unit,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.039
I was in another
facility, and this officer

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.360
placed me on the wall.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.270
They do random
searches and Shane

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.110
knows they just really abuse
the way they search you.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.180
And they put you on
a wall leaning down,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.370
and this guy started touching
me in uncomfortable places.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.080
And I moved a little
bit and this officer

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.770
smacked me in the back of
my head really, really hard,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.910
and I dropped down
to the ground.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.450
And at the time I was wearing
glasses and they fell.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.850
And I went to pick them up
and as soon as I got up,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.220
I turned around on
him and he thought

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.610
I was going to charge him.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.440
So he quickly pressed this
button in his walkie talkie.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.635
As soon as they press that
button, it's called The Pen,

00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:25.940
you just need and
brace for impact

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.510
because dozens of
officers come to the scene

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.360
and they just beat
the crap out of you.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.940
And that's exactly
what they did.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.490
They just stomped on me and
they cuffed me and threw me

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.230
in the cell.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.750
And at this time
I was devastated

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.867
because I've told my son that I
was coming home in two months.

00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:48.950
I told my son that I was
coming home in two months

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.710
and I lied to him.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.350
I saw him in the
visiting room and I only

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.180
had a couple of months left.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.040
It was about that
weekend when I saw him.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.240
He was excited.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.970
And that situation
happened and now I'm

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.690
sitting in this
prison cell thinking

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.680
how am I going to get
out of this situation?

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.640
This guy said I charged him and
I was going to attempt assault

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.340
and was pressing all
these crazy charges that

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.420
were on untruthful.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.560
I broke down.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.330
I had nothing in
that prison cell

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.130
except for the tools that they
gave me, which were paper, pen

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.480
and an envelope.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.870
And I wrote out a letter.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.186
I sat down on the little table
there and I wrote out a letter.

00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:38.810
I was basically
explaining to my family

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.610
that I'm not coming
home, I fucked up again,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.580
forget about me.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.288
I'm probably going to
do about three more

00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:48.210
years behind the situation.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.550
And then I enclosed
the letter and then

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.180
I realized I didn't have a stamp
to send out this letter with.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.810
So at this moment I get
even more frustrated

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.911
and I want to just bang
my head in the cell.

00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.910
I don't know what to do.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.900
The cell is about 105 degrees,
there's no AC, no fan.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.621
And it was just a crazy
moment in my life.

00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:13.120
And

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.440
Then about a week later my
sister writes me a letter

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.550
and she tells me to
Psalm 91 from the Bible.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.470
My sister is like
Mother Teresa's child.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.630
She's like, hallelujah, amen.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.070
One of those people.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.197
Nothing against her, but she
told me to read Psalm 91.

00:11:34.197 --> 00:11:36.280
And I was like Hell no,
I'm not reading this shit.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.380
I don't believe in God.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.260
It's all a hoax.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.320
And all I had was this
Bible that she gave me

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.050
in the beginning of my
prison sentence and my cell.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.294
And I'm there, and
I took that letter

00:11:49.294 --> 00:11:51.710
that she wrote me and I threw
it in the corner of my cell.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.626
And I just laid back in
the corner of my cell.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.790
But after a couple of days,
probably about two or three

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.939
days, I decided to
open up the Bible

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:03.480
because there was
nothing else to do.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.850
I was in 24 hour lockdown.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.220
And I opened up the Bible
and I turned to the pages

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.350
that she told me
to read, Psalm 91.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.870
And as soon as I
started reading it,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.160
a stamp fell out of my Bible.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.750
And it was the
stamp that I needed

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.760
to send out this ten
page letter to my family

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.820
that I've written to tell
them that I'm in trouble

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.430
and to explain to them
the whole situation.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.736
And as soon as that stamp fell
out something came to body.

00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:31.360
There were chills
running down my spine

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.920
and I felt like there was
something bigger than myself.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.430
It really humbled me.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.980
And I began praying
for the first time.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.420
And I started feeling a lot of
regret for what I was doing.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.441
I began reading the
Bible from front to back.

00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:48.940
For the first time I started
believing that what I was doing

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.060
was wrong, selling
drugs in prison,

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.970
selling drugs in the streets
and affecting so many people.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.470
And then I started realizing
that these people have families

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:02.620
just like my family was
affected by the drug industry.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.580
I began praying.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.470
I started asking God like, How
can I give back to society?

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.490
And how can I repay for all
the wrongs that I've done?

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.070
And I just put two
and two together

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.080
and I came up with the
idea of ConBody there.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.590
I figured that the
guys that I was already

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.470
helping in the prison yard I was
actually doing something right

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.720
and I was giving back.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.400
And I said this is
what I wanted to do,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.970
so I wrote out using
a long sheet of paper

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.110
that they give you and the
side of the Bible as my ruler.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.220
I started making a spreadsheet
of like every work out,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.670
my whole calendar
when I came home.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.855
I had the time to do it,
so I put all that together.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.380
I came out of that cell and I
was partnered up with this guy,

00:13:53.380 --> 00:14:01.800
I had a bunky, and as soon as
I step up to my bunky's unit

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.240
I see him reading the Bible.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.530
And I was like, Oh, shit.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.747
I want to tell
this guy my story.

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:11.080
I tell him my story and he's
like, How much time did you

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.310
do in the box?

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.270
He just looked at
me like I was crazy.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.000
So I was like, I'm not telling
anyone this story ever again.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.110
But I'm here today.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.470
I'm at Google
telling you my story.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.260
I've been fortunate enough to
travel the world now and share

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.170
my testimonial, share my story.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.370
I finally served an extra
year behind the situation,

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.180
so I was released
one year after that.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:42.310
And I came home and I started
doing it in the local park.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.320
I was back in the
same neighborhood,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.530
my mom still lives in a tenement
apartment on Rivington Street,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.460
rent controlled.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.540
You must be jealous,
because you can't afford it.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.900
But yeah, I get back to
that, living on our couch.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.920
And every day I would wake up
and just go out to the park

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.750
and start working out.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.980
I take out this piece of pipe
and stuck it between gates

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.510
and started doing pull-up
bar training there.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.010
And from there it just
started escalating.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.280
From there I started
renting out ballet studios.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.390
The ballet studios started
getting really, really packed.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:26.020
And then we started working out
of a prison behind a preschool.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.420
And the whole idea
was that I really

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.315
wanted to build a gym
that looked like a prison.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.530
People asked me, why
did you want do that?

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.750
First of all it was a great
branding and marketing

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.770
opportunity.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.830
No, but seriously, the
reason why I did that

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:51.580
was because I came home
and I was looking for jobs.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.080
I finally found an
internship that I

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.000
was getting a minimum wage for.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.680
At this internship
we were helping

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.260
people that were on public
assistance find employment

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.020
and I was a resume writer.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.464
I didn't know how
to type for shit,

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.880
but I told them I knew how to
type 40, 50 words per minute

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.210
on my resume.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.620
And then eventually I was
like, [TICK TICK TICK].

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.620
So then I got there.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.420
I'm better now.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.060
So we started
working there and we

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.090
were working with people
that were formerly released.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.830
My employees were not
former convicts or ex-cons,

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.395
so behind the scenes
they were discriminating

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:29.020
against the people
that were coming in.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.930
They were always
saying, oh, this person

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.350
is going to come back.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.300
We're tired of
seeing this person.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.500
Blah, blah, blah.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.660
And behind my head I'm
getting so frustrated

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.730
because they don't know
my background story.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.580
I'm like, you don't even
know what we went through.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.030
I feel like I'm a real product
of the school to prison

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.800
pipeline.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.770
And then one day I
really got frustrated.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.580
And finally when I had
ConBody fully up and running

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.090
I told them my story.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.800
And they were like, what?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.420
You were in prison?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.849
And it really changed
their whole views.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.760
I told them what I was
doing and now they're

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.640
extremely receptive of the
fact that formerly incarcerated

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.614
people can change their lives
if we're given the right tools

00:17:18.614 --> 00:17:19.780
and the right opportunities.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.670
So I came home
and left that job.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.670
I started doing ConBody
and I was doing it

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.080
by myself for a while.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.590
Then I met another trainer and
then I bumped into this guy.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.580
We were both locked
up in the same unit.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.310
We were in Greene
Correctional Facility.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:49.130
What brought us together was
a phenomenon that God made.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.620
We call it [? Babashrugu, ?]
it was our code word

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.696
for marijuana.

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:55.070
So we were actually
smoking weed.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.030
SPEAKER: Where most
love stories begin.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.490
COSS MARTE: We're smoking weed
in the prison yard and showers

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.380
It was a crazy,
crazy connection.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:10.739
And when he came home we
connected through Facebook.

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:13.280
We connect and I told him, you
have to come out and check out

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.780
what I'm doing.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.690
And I think he already knew
what we were doing before.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.880
He had just seen the
Facebook posts and stuff.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.880
He came out and he was like,
I want to be a part of this.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.750
So it just became an
amazing opportunity

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.540
to reconnect people that
I've been incarcerated with

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.400
and people that been trying
to readapt back to society.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.490
And now today our
whole mission is

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.710
to hire as many formerly
incarcerated individuals

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.190
as possible to teach
our fitness classes.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.944
We're based on the
Lower East Side,

00:18:44.944 --> 00:18:47.360
like I said before, in the
same corner where I was selling

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.340
drugs at Broome and Eldridge.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.930
And it's just been an
amazing experience.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.360
With BuzzFeed, we went to a
California city-state prison

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.660
and I trained 60
inmates in there.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.940
And these inmates,
they were tatted up

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.460
and they look scary
and this and that.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.710
And when I walk in there
with the BuzzFeed employees

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.197
they quickly hid in the
closet, and they were like,

00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:13.280
oh we need to store stuff.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.390
I'm like, get the fuck
out of the closet.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.450
These people want to see you.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.630
They shook their hand and
it was just so intimidated.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.910
And I had to step
to the side, and I

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.430
was like, these people
are actually humans.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.470
You know, they made
a mistake and you

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.710
need to respect the fact
that they're still people.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.080
And that's what I'm
trying to do is break down

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.200
the stereotypes between formerly
incarcerated individuals

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.280
and young professionals.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.950
SPEAKER: I actually
think ConBody,

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.920
that that's one of
the reasons that I got

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.690
so excited about the studio.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.640
Something we were
talking about is

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.460
that there's a lot of boutique
fitness studios in New York

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.300
City.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.080
And when you walk in they're
all really expensive,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.600
and they're all very
exclusive, but you don't really

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.232
feel like you're part of it.

00:19:58.232 --> 00:19:58.940
COSS MARTE: Yeah.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.400
SPEAKER: And I do think
walking into ConBody,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.300
you guys make everybody
feel like they're

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.770
a part of the crew, like
we're all in this together.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.450
It just makes it
a family, and it

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.340
makes it a really good
workout experience.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.670
And I mean, apart from the fact
that you guys kick everyone's

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.020
asses who walk in there.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.330
SHANE ENNOVER: Well when
you, just in general,

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.980
when you're locked up with
someone like Coss and I were,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.230
you become very close to them.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.350
Because you and the person
with you are all you guys got.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.120
That's it.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.150
So you become very close people.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.860
You form these
good relationships.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:39.920
And you're not
actually locked up,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.410
but we kind of give
off that persona.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.994
So you actually still
get that intimacy,

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:46.910
I guess you would say.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.140
Whereas you wouldn't get it in
some big name gym or big name

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.920
studio.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.490
We always say hi
when people walk in.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.260
We try to start a conversation.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.968
How was your day?

00:20:54.968 --> 00:20:56.716
How did you get here?

00:20:56.716 --> 00:20:57.590
And you feel at home.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.910
I feel at home when I'm there.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.670
SPEAKER: And that's really
how you and I got to talking.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.430
because you walk up to every
single person after class

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.060
and you ask them
how they're doing

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.640
and you're very open
with your story.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.910
And I think your
story is interesting

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.830
because when you
first told me, I

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.650
thought it was something
out of a movie.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.510
So let's tell everybody
what your background is

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.544
and what got you
to where you are.

00:21:20.544 --> 00:21:22.460
SHANE ENNOVER: My story
is a little different.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.010
It's actually kind of
the complete opposite end

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.780
of the spectrum
as far as Coss's.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.840
Because I'm not from the
city, I'm from Long Island.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.350
And I didn't sell
drugs, I did drugs.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.700
And it pretty much started
when I was like 13 years old.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.070
My sister's ex-boyfriend
moved in with us at the time

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.921
and he smoked weed.

00:21:42.921 --> 00:21:45.170
So, of course, I thought he
was like the coolest thing

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.950
ever so we start
smoking weed together.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.690
And that was the
first time I ever

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.310
really got introduced to drugs.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.726
I never really had
a weed problem,

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.480
but eventually I
had broken my leg

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.610
and they gave me some Vicodin.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.740
And I liked the Vicodin.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.090
Who doesn't like Vicodin?

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.655
I'm sorry.

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.030
But I was very
young at the time.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.907
I was like 15, 16 years old
and very impressionable.

00:22:08.907 --> 00:22:11.240
Then I found out that all my
friends were doing Vicodin,

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.020
they're all doing really heavy
painkillers like Oxycontin

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.982
and things like that.

00:22:15.982 --> 00:22:17.690
And eventually I was
like, you know what?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.189
Why not?

00:22:18.189 --> 00:22:19.280
Let's just do it.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.080
Why not do it?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.770
It came to the point where
there was nothing available,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.812
and we all got very sick.

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:27.561
And we didn't understand
why we were sick,

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:28.580
but we were withdrawing.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.380
And we didn't
actually understand

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.080
what withdrawing meant until
we actually looked it up.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.340
We were like, oh, shit.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.450
This is what this is?

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.950
How long this going to last?

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.410
We couldn't just like
Google something back then.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.750
We didn't know
what was going on.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.890
So eventually we found out.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.750
We did our research, but
we didn't really even know

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.620
how long it was going on.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.340
All we cared about
was getting better,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.700
and that's all you care about
when you're doing drugs.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.130
So at this point I'm doing
Oxycontin and heroin.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.140
And probably like a year after
that I started doing cocaine.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.720
And I was doing a bunch of
other party drugs, like ecstasy.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.691
I did acid a whole
bunch of times.

00:23:02.691 --> 00:23:04.190
But it was just
drugs, drugs, drugs.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.023
That was what I did.

00:23:05.023 --> 00:23:06.020
It was a full time job.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.137
I woke up, if I didn't have
money, I had to get money.

00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:10.970
If I had the money, I
was getting the drugs.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.803
If I had the drugs and
the money I was good.

00:23:12.803 --> 00:23:13.950
I could live a normal life.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.194
But first things first,
I've got to get high.

00:23:17.194 --> 00:23:19.610
SPEAKER: So let's talk about
how you had to get the money.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.820
SHANE ENNOVER: The
first big thing

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.120
I used to do, I was
working at a bagel place.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.870
I was actually stealing like
$200, $300 a day from them.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.580
If I can get more,
I can get more but.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.260
That alone right
there plus my paycheck

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.010
would be enough to
support a good habit.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.600
But I quit that job to get
another job at another deli

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.090
and I got fired at that job.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.250
So now I have no money.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.010
I owe my drug dealer money.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.950
I am about to go through
withdrawal because I barely

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.120
have any drugs left.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.810
And he actually used
to give me little jobs,

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.930
and what I mean by
jobs is certain houses

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.630
to rob, people he knew.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.090
And he said, listen, I
want you to go in there.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.230
All I want is--

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.001
all I want are the
guns and the jewelry.

00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:09.500
Anything else in
there you can have.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.711
If you find money, if you
find a TV, appliances,

00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:13.460
anything like that,
you can have all that.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.126
All I want are the
guns and the jewelry.

00:24:15.126 --> 00:24:18.500
And I'd come out of houses
with these gigantic AK-47s

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.256
and shotguns and
the most fabulous

00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:23.630
looking jewelry
you'll ever find.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.520
That's all he wanted.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.120
OK.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.520
So I owed him some money at the
time and I'm like 17 years old.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.747
This was 2006.

00:24:32.747 --> 00:24:35.080
So he calls he's like, Shane,
I hadn't heard from me you

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.380
a while.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.270
I was like, yeah,
because I owe you money.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.610
I'm not going to call you up,
get more things on credit,

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.359
you know that's just stupid.

00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:41.900
I was like, you have
any work for me?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.999
He says, give me one second,
let me call you back.

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:46.540
So he calls me back, he says,
listen, I'm outside your house.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.812
Come get in the car.

00:24:47.812 --> 00:24:50.270
So I go in the car, and there
is a woman in the front seat.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.260
And she's like, Shane.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.730
He's like, all right, so.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.688
I was like, Well, what,
do you got work for me?

00:24:54.688 --> 00:24:58.060
He says, yeah, so you're
going to rob a bank.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.592
I was like, what?

00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:00.800
I'm not robbing a bank, dude.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.910
Turn this car right back around.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.880
Like, I'll get a job and
I'll get you your money.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.760
I'm not robing no fucking bank.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.050
Like, that's not happening.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.190
So they're like, oh,
no, listen, listen.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.648
So the girl was
actually telling me

00:25:08.648 --> 00:25:10.820
that she was a bank
teller at the time

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.070
and they get robbed
on a monthly basis.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.220
Like it was just a thing.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.650
OK, bank got robbed.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.650
So what?

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.450
And I know probably everybody's
thinking right now that I'm

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.394
going in there with
AK-47s and president masks

00:25:23.394 --> 00:25:25.310
and like, everybody get
the fuck on the floor.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.810
No.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.990
That's not how it went down.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.610
Like, at all.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.370
I was like 120 pounds
soaking wet, if that.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.230
A very skinny little
kid going in there

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.870
passing them a note
saying, this is a robbery.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.970
Give me the big bills first.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.730
That's how it went down.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.710
I passed them a
little piece of paper.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.540
I said, this is a robbery.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.956
Give me the big bills first,
because they'll start handing

00:25:46.956 --> 00:25:48.980
you singles and change rolls.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.510
Don't make any sudden movements.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.310
Don't call anybody over.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.300
And you have to say,
definitely say, no money wraps.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.970
Because the minute they put
the money in the drawer,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.040
they unwrap it.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.240
If it's wrapped that
means it's a dye pack.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.500
I've gotten a dye pack before.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.930
It's not fun.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.350
Actually, it's like those smoke
bombs, like you light them up?

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.090
It's like that but with ink.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.830
And I got it one time and it
was in my pocket and I heard it.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.830
It was actually ticking.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.860
Like, [TICKING NOISES].

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.670
And I heard it.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.860
I was like, that's weird.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.360
As soon as I took it out of my
pocket, it just starts going.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.026
I just threw it on
the ground, but there

00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:23.990
was somebody in there.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.780
So, yeah, it was a big scene.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.600
So I pass the teller the note
and they give me the money.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.360
So eventually I
agreed to do it and I

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.830
got hooked up with
a friend of mine

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.450
that had already did a bank.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:41.216
So now we're full fledged bank
robbers, as silly as it sounds.

00:26:41.216 --> 00:26:43.340
SPEAKER: Actually, you were
called "The Serial Bank

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:43.840
Robber."

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.180
SHANE ENNOVER: So
News 12 is like, what

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.910
this city would have, New
York 1, their a local thing.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.497
I was actually dubbed
"The Pleasant Bandit."

00:26:56.497 --> 00:26:58.580
Which is pretty funny,
because I guess I was nice.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.060
SPEAKER: Because
you said please.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.020
SHANE ENNOVER: I said,
please, I said thank you,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.019
because I wanted to make
it seem to anybody that

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:04.460
was right next to me that
nothing else was going

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.680
on but making a transaction.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.469
I would actually come in
there with open envelopes

00:27:08.469 --> 00:27:10.010
and I would take
the note out of that

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.100
just to make it look like,
if anybody else would see me,

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.815
all they would see
is, oh wait, he's just

00:27:14.815 --> 00:27:16.190
like looking at
a bank statement,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.356
or whatever the case may be.

00:27:17.356 --> 00:27:19.560
I tried to make it as
official as possible.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.490
So I did six banks.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:27.150
After the sixth one I realized
what the fuck I was doing,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.410
I guess, and I checked
myself into rehab.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.260
But two weeks
after that, the guy

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.480
that I was doing it with
it, he turned himself in.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.970
And in turning himself
in, he turned me in.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.767
Now I'm locked up.

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:38.850
I had never been arrested.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.250
I had never even seen
the cop car, nothing.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.320
I've never been arrested.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.880
So, I'm on what's called
"The Tiers" or cellblocks,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.730
and I'm getting beat
up a lot because that's

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.190
how the adolescent tiers are.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.430
They're just wild.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.350
Like two, three, four fights
a day on average, if that.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.950
It's just it's wild.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.570
Has anybody ever seen or read
the book "Lord of the Flies"?

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.710
It's like that.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.940
It's just madness, chaos.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.530
And the cops don't care.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.530
They can't control us because
we're just these kids.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.380
You can't stop those
fights, because there are so

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.730
many gangs.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.740
So I was just getting beat up
so much, because I'm so weak.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.950
I don't know how to fight.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:20.709
I was this hippie.

00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:22.000
Like, yeah man, whats up, dude?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.472
I'm from Long Island.

00:28:23.472 --> 00:28:24.430
I was from the suburbs.

00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:28.780
I didn't do those
kind of things.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.970
My family was well off.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.082
I was, I guess you could
call it, upper middle class.

00:28:34.082 --> 00:28:36.040
So I never had to deal
with this kind of stuff.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.890
Even though I was doing
drugs, I wasn't really like

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.510
in the streets, though.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.760
So I was getting
really tired of just

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.980
getting beat up all day long.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.477
Because you get picked on.

00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:49.060
They just see you, they know you
can't fight, they'll try you.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.204
And I was fighting,
that's not the problem.

00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:54.370
So eventually I was like,
something's got to change.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.160
So I asked someone
about working out.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.190
Maybe there's something I could
do, easy, to start me off.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.669
I remember I went
to my cell, and I

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:02.960
started doing dips, bench dips.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.690
Where you just put
your hands behind you,

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.110
so you go up and down
like that with the arms.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.110
As a matter of fact, no.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.865
I tried to do a set
of push-ups, first.

00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:12.281
I remember getting up off the
floor after doing like three

00:29:12.281 --> 00:29:14.664
and gasping, dying, for air.

00:29:14.664 --> 00:29:16.330
So I was like, Let
me try some of these.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.371
So I tried the dips and
I realized I could do it.

00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:19.510
Oh wow, this is cool.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.280
So then I keep doing
more and more dips

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.080
and I'm realizing I'm
getting a little stronger.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.163
I started to try to do
push-ups and I'm like, wow,

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:26.410
I can do push-ups now.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.620
Then I start asking people
for advice on how to fight,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.720
so now I'm actually
winning fights.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.380
Now my confidence
is through the roof.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.490
And I gained 40 pounds
in like two months,

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.330
so I'm a lot bigger, I'm a
lot stronger, I can fight now.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.980
I just felt really
good about myself.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.490
But then I'm realizing all
the working out I'm doing,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.470
I feel healthier.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.381
Has anybody ever-- how can I put
this-- gone on a real partying

00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:51.880
binge?

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.650
When you're younger you're just
drinking every single night,

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.270
nonstop.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.280
SPEAKER: I believe the
kids call it a "bender."

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.150
SHANE ENNOVER: Yes, exactly.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:58.649
"The kids."

00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:03.100
And then right after that
you're like, you know what?

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.430
Something's got to change,
and you stop drinking.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.150
And then you actually start
working out and eating healthy,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:07.490
and you're like, wow!

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.830
Yeah, I could do this.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.400
This is good.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.140
I'm going to live
like this from now on.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.360
That's how I felt. I was
like, wow, this is great.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.790
I can actually like,
live a good life.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.480
So I'm working--

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.980
SPEAKER: Just to
clarify, that's how

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.660
you were feeling
because that is what

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.755
was affecting your withdrawals.

00:30:20.755 --> 00:30:21.530
SHANE ENNOVER: Yes.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.404
SPEAKER: The fitness.

00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:26.190
SHANE ENNOVER: So I went through
the immediate withdrawals,

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.320
but that's the
physical portion of it.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.360
Then you have the
mental withdrawals.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.039
You feel better, but
if you do the drugs

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.330
you get that fresh high, and
there ain't nothing better

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.680
than that fresh high.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.150
You haven't done
drugs in a while.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.108
You're not withdrawing.

00:30:41.108 --> 00:30:45.700
It's not like you're doing the
drug as the job just to live,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.510
you're doing the drug
to get high again.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.120
And there's nothing
better than that.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.810
But to get that out of
my head I was working out

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.300
and it felt so good.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.570
I felt like a normal person.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.910
Fast forward, I ended
up getting sentenced

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.690
to one to three years.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.190
I did one year out of that.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.720
I made my first parole board.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.480
And my family was
there the whole time.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.990
They saw my progression,
how I got my GED

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.961
while I was there because I
had dropped out of high school.

00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:15.460
SPEAKER: And Coss
actually mentioned

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.460
you had really good grades
while you were there.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.820
SHANE ENNOVER: Eventually,
when I did go upstate,

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.156
we met in the college
program, I had a 3.8 GPA,

00:31:25.156 --> 00:31:27.780
which is pretty good for someone
who was a high school dropout.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:34.310
So, backtrack, I got
locked up for a year.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:39.312
And when I came home you
couldn't tell me anything.

00:31:39.312 --> 00:31:41.020
If anybody looked at
me I was like, well,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.430
you don't know where I've been.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.070
You don't know what I just had
to go through, fighting to eat.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.910
It's a strange feeling when you
have to fight to actually eat.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.970
Literally like a caveman.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.000
It's completely different.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.930
Plus, my dad got
me a job because he

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.070
was one of these big wigs
at a nursing home company

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.760
he was working at
and I play music.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.980
So my boy got me a
job teaching music.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.920
So at that time,
it wasn't like what

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.580
Coss had gone through where it
was hard for him to get a job,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.460
I had a job.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.080
Right away.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.060
You couldn't tell
anything, anything.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.270
I was home for about one month.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.920
I wasn't really working out.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.080
Not really doing anything.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.840
Just working, just
kind of doing my thing,

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.116
probably home for a month.

00:32:28.116 --> 00:32:31.950
Me and my friend, he has
a barn, and in the barn

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.880
there was a bathroom.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.070
I went in there because he
had cut himself or something.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.880
We went in the medicine
cabinet, and there

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.510
was a bottle of Percocet
just waiting for us.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.799
Take me, take me,
please, love me.

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.590
And we saw it and we
were like, oh, my god.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.170
What is this?

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.150
Let's do this.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.608
We thought it would be a good
idea to just do some Percocet

00:32:52.608 --> 00:32:53.870
and that we could control it.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.180
We know the consequences
of what could happen.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.290
Yeah, we were dead wrong.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.330
I'll probably say,
within a month

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.190
after that I was back
robbing banks again.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.957
Because that's how
you support a habit.

00:33:06.957 --> 00:33:08.540
Probably around that
time, actually, I

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.950
was doing cocaine again.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.860
So now I'm doing heroin
and cocaine full fledged.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.610
It was like a habit,
way worse than before.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:22.070
And within three months
of that I robbed 19 banks.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.950
And I thought I was going to do
it way better and way smarter.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.320
I had different wigs,
and fake beards,

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.820
I made my skin complexion
different colors,

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.919
and tattoos in the face.

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:35.960
I had a lot of fun with
it, I'm not going to lie.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.170
I was disguising myself with
all these weird different things

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.870
and I was getting away
with so many of them.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.310
But my ego was just so
high up there and intense.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.415
I would rob a bank, and
in a normal bank robbery

00:33:48.415 --> 00:33:50.540
you get between 3,000 and
8,000 because you're only

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.415
hitting the register.

00:33:51.415 --> 00:33:53.640
Like I said, I'm not
going in there with AK-47s

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.580
and hitting up the safe.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.400
You've got to picture a bank
as a store that sells money,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.510
so I'm getting
what's in the drawer.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.390
I'm getting between
3,000 and 8,000.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:08.239
I would take 3,000 or 5,000
and blow it all in one night.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.060
We would get a party
bus and whatever

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.580
was left over and drugs
and food and everything,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.620
and we would take a
party bus the city.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:20.510
And I'd wake up in some random
hotel with just a shirt and one

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.150
sock on, not knowing
how I got there.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.290
So it was crazy.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.690
It was just madness

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.159
Eventually, I got caught.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.489
And I got caught
fleeing the scene, which

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:32.565
never happens to anybody.

00:34:32.565 --> 00:34:34.190
You never get caught
fleeing the scene.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.469
But apparently someone
was following me outside

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.690
and saw the car I got into.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.159
So now I get locked up.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.679
And the last time
I got locked up--

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.830
I don't know if anybody's
ever heard of Suboxone?

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.800
Suboxone is like methadone,
but it's a better version of it

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.679
because you can't
actually do opiates

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.929
when you're on it,
whereas on methadone can.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:58.010
So I was in a suboxone
program before I

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.050
got locked up, so
when I got locked up

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.110
I went through withdrawals
but not as bad as this time.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.730
This time, like the
first week of it

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.850
I don't even remember
because I was so sick.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.824
It was a completely
different experience.

00:35:10.824 --> 00:35:12.740
I eventually get sentenced
to three and a half

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.507
to seven years, but
I owed parole time

00:35:14.507 --> 00:35:16.340
from the last time I
was locked up because I

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.705
was only home for five months.

00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:20.330
So I owe a year and 1/2 parole,
so now it's at three and a half

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.380
to nine years.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.350
I get upstate and in
my mind I'm thinking,

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.110
something's got to change.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.770
My family doesn't
want to talk to me.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.020
The only person who was
talking to me was my mom.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.000
She died in 2009,
about a year and a half

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.620
into me being upstate.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.840
And we knew it we
knew it was going

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.140
to happen because she had
cancer, but the cancer, that

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.780
just hit.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:53.720
She went in for an MRI, had an
x-ray or something like that

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.760
and they saw like a
small lump in her lung.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.710
It was lung cancer.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.994
She a cigarette smoker.

00:35:57.994 --> 00:35:59.660
They saw this little
thing they're like,

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.450
it's probably nothing, but
let's do an MRI just in case.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:03.810
It was lung cancer.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.200
And it progressed so fast
and within a year she died.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.060
It just happened.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.610
And I was there to see her,
but when she came to my visits

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.470
I just kept seeing her,
every visit, deteriorating,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.410
deteriorating.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:20.090
And when that happened that
was like the bad turning point.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.530
I was like, no, I gotta do--

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.000
like something has to change.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.677
I have to change
my life right now.

00:36:24.677 --> 00:36:26.760
And I had just completed,
it's a bullshit program,

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.410
but it's called ASET, Alcohol,
Substance Abuse Treatment.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.230
It's a drug program that
they put everybody who's ever

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.910
even looked at a drug upstate.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.900
It's a money thing,
but whatever.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.900
I had just completed that
so I could pretty much

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.100
do any program I wanted.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.440
So right after that
I joined college,

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.110
which is where I met my
buddy right here, Coss Marte.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.610
So we meet--

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.192
SPEAKER: Shane, real quick just
so we have time for the Q&amp;A.

00:36:49.192 --> 00:36:50.900
I'm sure the audience
has some questions.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.691
SHANE ENNOVER: Yes.

00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:54.920
SPEAKER: Let's talk
about your association

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.150
and how the second
stint in prison

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.920
really geared you
up to understanding

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.985
how fitness is a recovery
tool for addicts.

00:37:03.985 --> 00:37:05.630
Because I think
that's a huge point.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.090
SHANE ENNOVER: Yes.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.040
After I realized that
something had changed,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.470
I started working
out a lot more.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.752
I'm was actually trying to break
world records for pull-ups,

00:37:16.752 --> 00:37:17.460
things like that.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.690
I was really trying my
hardest to be a better person.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.960
But now I'm going back to the
first time I got locked up,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.610
I was realizing that
fitness is really

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.980
what was keeping me sober.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.870
And I haven't heroin or cocaine
since the day I got locked up,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.410
February 1, 2008.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:41.660
So when I came home I
knew I wanted to give back

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.610
to the community somehow.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.030
There was something,
just like how ConBody

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:52.670
is geared towards giving back
to the community of prisoners

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.390
and ex-convicts and
we only hire people,

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.420
what I did was started something
called Addicts Athletics.

00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:03.620
And what Addicts
Athletics does is

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.180
we bring fitness
classes to people

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.220
recovering from drug addiction.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.160
So I go into rehab centers,
I sponsor people much

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.700
like AA, Addicts Anonymous
or Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.690
they sponsor people.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.780
I sponsor people by giving
them free training sessions,

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.880
free nutritional
plans, things like

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.930
that because I know fitness
is what's ultimately

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.470
going to keep someone sober.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:29.840
It's purely physiological.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.770
Our neurotransmitters
just fire up naturally.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.550
It just does, that just happens.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.920
Your dopamine, you
serotonin, things like that.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.440
Now when you do drugs it's
making them fire up a lot more,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.880
that's what's getting you high.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.640
The minute you take that
away your body doesn't

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.910
know how to naturally make your
neural transmitters connect.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.740
But when you start
working out, now they're

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.450
connecting a lot
more, a lot better,

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.430
to a much greater
degree than before.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:54.680
So you'll feel better.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.080
You won't feel like you need
to do the drugs anymore.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.360
So this is what I started
because I really want

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.340
to give back to the community.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:05.622
And we've held events like
fundraisers, things like that.

00:39:05.622 --> 00:39:07.580
Real soon, we're trying
to finalize everything,

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.538
this place in the Lowe
East Side called Sucasa.

00:39:09.538 --> 00:39:12.332
They're a part of Lower
East Side Service Center.

00:39:12.332 --> 00:39:13.790
It's a residential
center, and I'll

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.420
be going in there training
the residents there, give them

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.540
free fitness classes for yoga,
working breathing techniques,

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.070
just all around counseling.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.400
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.390
SPEAKER: Awesome, thank you.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.520
So I'm going to open
it up to the floor.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.200
If anyone has any
questions, feel

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.060
free to line up at
the mics located

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.810
on either side of the stage.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.980
So, anyone have any
questions at this point?

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.055
AUDIENCE: I don't need a mic.

00:39:43.055 --> 00:39:45.660
Great story, great program.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.600
I'm an engineer, so I'm going
to ask the engineering question.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.200
How do you scale it?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.052
You're in the Lower East
Side, I live in the suburbs.

00:39:53.052 --> 00:39:53.760
SHANE ENNOVER: OK

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.270
AUDIENCE: I want to
participate in the program.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.770
So are you thinking about
franchising or something

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.170
like that, you know?

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:09.070
SHANE ENNOVER: We just started
this in November of last year,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.480
so I'm still trying to figure
out an optimal business plan.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.960
But for someone, just as
an individual that, say,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.920
you live on Long Island, I
would try to figure out some way

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.080
that I can maybe come to you.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.650
Or let's say, this place
I'm working at right now,

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.510
maybe I could work
a deal out with them

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.910
where you could come in there
and I would train there.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:35.100
Or sometimes I would use
ConBody's facility in order

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.620
to train someone there.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.380
And I would pay, Addicts
Athletics pays, for everything.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.640
We pay for travel, we
pay if you need something

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.390
to eat afterwards
because you don't really

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.348
have too much money
because you're a recovering

00:40:48.348 --> 00:40:49.500
addict, things like that.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.030
We pay for pretty
much everything.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.549
So if you needed some sort
of transportation or for me

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:55.340
to get out there,
whatever the case may be,

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.470
we would accommodate it.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.886
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking more
like the ConBody piece, right?

00:40:58.886 --> 00:41:02.360
You have a studio, you
get people in there,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.069
you're associated with
it too, right yes?

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:05.693
SHANE ENNOVER: Yes,
yes, I'm a trainer.

00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:06.346
Yeah

00:41:06.346 --> 00:41:07.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.640
COSS MARTE: Yeah
so, lot of people

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.410
asked me, how am I
going to scale this?

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.110
How am I going to take
this to the next level?

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.410
We're actually opening up
three more locations this year.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.120
In Midtown, we
actually landed a deal

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.880
with Saks Fifth Avenue,
where we're going to be,

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.120
opening up their wellness
center on May 1st.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.960
And we're expanding to
Pittsburgh and in the Chelsea

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.430
area as well.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.860
But a lot of people said,
just brick and mortar spaces,

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.650
that's a high overhead.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.350
How is this going to
be really scalable?

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.620
So we came up with the idea
of doing ConBody live, which

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.730
is On Demand workout videos.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:50.580
So you basically use
your own body weight,

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.160
we don't use any equipment,
you get a little nine

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.550
by six prison cell space
in your living room

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.910
and then you choose your
favorite ex-convict,

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.200
draw a platform to get
that prison body you always

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.427
desired for $5 a month.

00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:06.260
AUDIENCE: Streaming?

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.120
Or is like the time when
you're all sort of--

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.520
COSS MARTE: It's On Demand now.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:18.330
We launched it about, right now
it's almost been four months,

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.970
and we've had over 4,000 users.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:23.636
4,000 subscribers
on our platform now.

00:42:23.636 --> 00:42:26.824
They're from 22
different countries.

00:42:26.824 --> 00:42:28.240
SHANE ENNOVER: You
said as an app?

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.312
We're working on something
like that right now, yeah.

00:42:30.312 --> 00:42:32.280
AUDIENCE: Then I could
bring it to the gym with me

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.405
because I never know what
to do when I'm by myself.

00:42:34.405 --> 00:42:37.740
COSS MARTE: Or, you could just
go to the browser on Google

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.005
and put ConBody.com.

00:42:39.005 --> 00:42:40.560
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.720
COSS MARTE: Yeah, I know.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.190
We're actually planning
to do a Kickstarter

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.180
in a couple of months.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.480
We want to build a better
platform, and an app behind it.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.905
So we're going to be launching
that probably in two months.

00:42:52.905 --> 00:42:55.700
AUDIENCE: Then you can
help me [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.550
SPEAKER: We can.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.352
You guys can be
our newest client.

00:42:58.352 --> 00:42:59.060
COSS MARTE: Yeah.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.930
Let's do it.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.665
Let's do it.

00:43:03.665 --> 00:43:07.210
Don't be scared we
only did seven years.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.950
SPEAKER: And in solitary
confinement, only a couple.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:10.790
SHANE ENNOVER: Yeah.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.970
AUDIENCE: I just want to
say I know about you guys.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.122
I've been working with Back
On My Feet, I'm a volunteer.

00:43:17.122 --> 00:43:18.580
I know Marnie, and
I know Drescher.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.390
Yeah.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.806
I mean, what you
guys were saying.

00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:26.190
I work with people uptown
that are transitioning out

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.260
of incarceration
and they're people,

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.970
to your point, Shane's point.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:36.670
And also that substituting
exercise for addiction,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.300
I mean I woke up from a
bender like 30 years ago,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.312
started running and
haven't stopped.

00:43:43.312 --> 00:43:44.520
And that gets to my question.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.230
That was 30 years ago,
I'm in my mid 50s now.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.040
Your program looks
really intense.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.900
Is there ever any sense
of how you moderate that?

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.660
Like, burn out, to keep
doing this over time.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.680
Have you seen that
with your program?

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.740
COSS MARTE: So it's a
multilevel workout program.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.370
I was telling them,
my mom is 62 years old

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.370
and she works out four
times a week in my studio.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.710
So it was made for everybody's
level, everybody sizes.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.800
What we basically
do is tell people,

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.840
just try to keep up
with the trainer.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.570
We push it to the next limit,
but you need to take a break,

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.910
you take a break
and get back in it.

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:34.300
So people really
progress themselves.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.700
Burning out, what do you mean?

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.860
Burning out from the
trainer's point of view?

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:43.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, long term
burning out, like fatigue.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.360
COSS MARTE: I mean, everybody
is going to burn out.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.280
I think people need to take a
break and really understand.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.220
We do work outs
seven days a week,

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.350
but I personally take a break.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.090
I do take a two day break and
work out five days a week,

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.510
just letting your
body recuperate.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.837
In the studio we
basically work out

00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:10.920
different parts of the
body every day of the week.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.470
So we have Manic Monday,
which is a cardio day.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.560
Tough Love Tuesday is isometric.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.290
Lockdown Wednesdays,
which is lower body.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.480
Workouts like Hardcore
Thursday, where we do

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.460
a lot of abs and core workouts.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.360
And Full Body Friday
and Upper Body Saturday.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.670
We change them every day of the
week so one part of the body

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.690
will feel better and
recuperate while you're

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.830
working on the other part.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.650
SHANE ENNOVER: And also, just
piggybacking off all of that,

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.610
so we have ConBody and we have
a ConBody themed work out,

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.079
but each trainer kind of
brings their own style to it.

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:47.120
What you won't get from
Coss, you'll get from me.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.620
What you won't get from me,
you'll get from [? Soldon. ?]

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.661
What you don't get from
[? Soldon ?] you get from

00:45:50.661 --> 00:45:53.370
[? Ray. ?] Every trainer you'll
get some type of different

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.752
style from.

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:57.710
A lot of gyms don't have
that, a lot of studios

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:58.918
don't have that, which we do.

00:45:58.918 --> 00:46:01.710
Which is really, really good.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.717
AUDIENCE: So I haven't
yet been to your website

00:46:03.717 --> 00:46:05.800
since this is my first
time learning about ConBody

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.950
and Addicts Athletics,
but do you have formerly

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:14.060
incarcerated individuals come
to work out you guys often?

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.960
Do they get special pricing?

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.852
Do you see that most of
your attendees are not?

00:46:19.852 --> 00:46:22.200
What does that look like?

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.910
COSS MARTE: Our
customer base is mostly

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.780
females, 80%, young
professionals just like you.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.720
So take out your
phone right now.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.840
I was just kidding.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.020
SPEAKER: I actually think
that's a funny point,

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:38.160
because something you
did with your business

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.950
when you were selling drugs is
you kind of located your target

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.990
market and that's
how you scaled.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.500
And with ConBody you had
mentioned in a talk you did,

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.190
you came out and you
saw all of these women

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.560
in New York wearing yoga pants.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.140
And that's how you also located
your target market, which

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.140
is a lot of what we in the
Google media department

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.970
really focus on.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.030
So I think that is kind
of a funny focal point

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.220
of your business
and how you guys

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.640
changed the game doing that.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.830
COSS MARTE: Yeah.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.670
But formerly incarcerated
people come in and work out.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.300
We do give them a discount.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.140
We started this
scholarship program idea.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.540
We've had people lose a
lot of weight from it.

00:47:23.899 --> 00:47:26.190
Because I started getting
people around my neighborhood

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.140
that couldn't really afford it.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:32.244
They'll go to Planet Fitness
for $20, $30 a month.

00:47:32.244 --> 00:47:33.660
SHANE ENNOVER:
Which does nothing.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.379
COSS MARTE: Which
they don't utilize

00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:36.420
for the rest of the year.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.990
But what we started
doing, I said,

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.900
give me your $30 and
I'll find a sponsor who's

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.860
going to pay $100.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.890
Our unlimited classes
are $125 a month.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.090
So we'll have somebody just
cover the rest of the cost,

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:54.800
and we'll send monthly updates
on that person's progression

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.960
and if they're losing weight,
if they're gaining more muscle.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:04.980
So it's affordable and
accessible to anyone.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.540
But to get that scholarship
we have a application

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.420
on our website and then
we screen the person

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.920
because a lot of
people hit us up

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.420
and they're trying
to save a dollar.

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.630
And I'm like, man, you live
on the Upper West Side.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.308
You could afford
some of this shit.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.570
Yeah.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.820
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
ClassPass user, obviously.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.640
So I'm always interested
in the ClassPass gym's

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.210
I go to, how you work with
ClassPass and other say,

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.530
Groupon, or services
that are providing deals.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.470
$125 sounds like that's
what ClassPass also

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.290
used to have as their
unlimited option.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.610
How do balance
pleasing the users

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.290
who might not be total full
time members of the gym,

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.440
but also want to be part
of it in some capacity.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.350
How does that work out
as a ClassPass user?

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.310
Beneficial user for
you, or is it just

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.330
a way to acquire a customer
and then convert them into--

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.980
COSS MARTE: Both.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.810
So ClassPass is a
great platform just

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:03.045
to get the word out there
and bring these people that

00:49:03.045 --> 00:49:06.392
have never heard about
us and bring them down

00:49:06.392 --> 00:49:07.350
to the Lower East Side.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.930
Because a lot of people don't
come down there to work out.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:14.460
Most of them stay in the
[? Flat Iron, ?] Chelsea area.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.380
But we've had probably 100
people come through ClassPass

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.950
and convert as monthly members.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.620
Which is a good conversion rate.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.340
And ClassPass told us this
it was one of the biggest

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.450
conversion rates.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:34.680
And financially, if
you want to fill up

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.100
a spot that's missing
from your personal studio

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.260
and there is a ClassPass
member coming in,

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.600
it's an extra dollar and a seat.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.200
So why not fill that
space with any type

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.990
of money, currency coming in.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:55.140
They don't give us a big
revenue cut behind each user,

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.610
but it's new people.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:01.800
And even the people that
come through ClassPass

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.460
have a great relationship,
and some of them

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.460
are still using us
through ClassPass

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.110
and come on their own
time and help us out,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:14.700
working side projects
like Addicts Athletics

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.940
and help them on the side like.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.857
It's just a win-win situation.

00:50:19.857 --> 00:50:20.690
SHANE ENNOVER: Yeah.

00:50:23.618 --> 00:50:26.480
AUDIENCE: I'm in Bellmore.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.786
I don't know what houses in Long
Island have AK-47s and jewelry,

00:50:29.786 --> 00:50:33.520
but how is the neighborhood,
the Lower East Side

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.635
now, compared to
when you were there?

00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:39.474
Do you think being there
now kind of wards off anyone

00:50:39.474 --> 00:50:42.188
that is dealing to kids now
and they see a positive change?

00:50:42.188 --> 00:50:43.180
From you?

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.170
I don't know how i was then.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.740
COSS MARTE: Yeah, now it's
like completely gentrified.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.480
It's probably one of the
hippest neighborhoods.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.836
It's the best
neighborhood in the city.

00:50:53.836 --> 00:50:58.140
AUDIENCE: Long
Island is pretty hip.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:04.620
COSS MARTE: Before it
was a crazy neighborhood.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.160
Like growing up,
every 10 steps that I

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.350
took I'd see a heroin needle.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:13.410
In the building
that I grew up in

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.230
there used to be
drug lines going up

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.040
the building and buckets
coming down from the roof.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.540
It was just a crazy, crazy
switch from what it is right

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.040
now.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.010
Right now, you have
like a coffee shop

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.790
and hipsters all over the place.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.070
But going back to
that neighborhood,

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:41.630
I've been approached by guys
who still are on the streets

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.280
when I first came home.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.110
They were trying to get
me back into that world

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:50.100
and I told them, I don't even
know where to find a cigarette.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.310
I was just completely
convinced that I was not

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.690
going back to that lifestyle.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.100
I mean, a lot of people looked
at me crazy when I came home.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.227
From making all this
money in the street

00:52:03.227 --> 00:52:05.060
and then working out
in the park, and people

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.190
were like, yo, what the
hell is this guy doing?

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.790
And I was like, I'm building a
movement, do you want to join?

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.330
They were like, hell no.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.210
And now when they see the gym
on the block they're like,

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.410
damn, you did it.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.555
It's crazy.

00:52:17.555 --> 00:52:22.010
It just gives people
hope and inspires people.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:25.010
It makes people believers
that if you have an idea

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.345
it could be a reality.

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:30.470
SHANE ENNOVER: So, I'm
actually from Central Islip.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.938
So a little further up.

00:52:31.938 --> 00:52:34.400
SHANE ENNOVER: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.530
My drug dealer
lived in Amityville,

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.510
but on the [INAUDIBLE] border.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.680
AUDIENCE: I don't
see this in Bellmore.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.370
SHANE ENNOVER:
[INAUDIBLE], you do.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.830
Pretty crazy out there.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:45.621
SPEAKER: At this point,
we've taught people

00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:48.120
how to deal drugs,
rob banks, and where

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.225
to find all your local dealers.

00:52:50.225 --> 00:52:53.500
COSS MARTE: And quit Google.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.500
SPEAKER: Well thank you
guys so much for coming.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.790
I love your story and I hope
that we as a community can

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.070
continue sharing
it with everybody,

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.470
because it's just a
great way to make people

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:04.492
believe that you can.

00:53:04.492 --> 00:53:06.200
COSS MARTE: Can I
mention one more thing?

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:06.820
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.600
COSS MARTE: As a
hustler, I want everybody

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.480
to take out their phones
right now, come on.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.150
You've got a phone,
you work at Google,

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.460
you can afford this shit.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.710
Let's go, take out your phone.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:20.940
I just want you to click on
that app called Instagram

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.300
and just follow me.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:27.290

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.751
on your stream that you'll be
inspired one day to come by.

00:53:29.751 --> 00:53:31.250
There you go, you
know how to spell.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:32.651 --> 00:53:34.692
SHANE ENNOVER: And follow
Addicts Athletics, too.

00:53:34.692 --> 00:53:35.476
COSS MARTE: I got you.

00:53:35.476 --> 00:53:35.990
SPEAKER: To go all
the way down there--

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.860
COSS MARTE: I know.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.155
I'll pay for your Uber.

00:53:38.155 --> 00:53:41.030
I've got Uber pool.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.600
No.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.620
SPEAKER: I thought
you were actually

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:45.450
going to make everyone get up
and start doing the work out.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.990
SHANE ENNOVER:
Well, that's next.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.165
COSS MARTE: No, they've had a
long walk from the cafeteria.

00:53:51.165 --> 00:53:51.790
SPEAKER: It is.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:52.620
It's a big building.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.370
COSS MARTE: We'll
give them a break.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.560
SHANE ENNOVER: This
is a big building.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.430
COSS MARTE: But thank you.

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.720
SPEAKER: Well,
thank you so much.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.130
This is great and thank
you guys for coming.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:59.380
