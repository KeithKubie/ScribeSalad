actually one of the hardest words

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
actually one of the hardest words

action is a show where we look at

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259
action is a show where we look at
 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.400
action is a show where we look at
different elements of Android design we

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
different elements of Android design we
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.140
different elements of Android design we
usually take a look at specific

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
usually take a look at specific
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.820
usually take a look at specific
applications and how their user

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
applications and how their user
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.580

interfaces can be improved using you
know the elements of Android design

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
know the elements of Android design
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730
know the elements of Android design
which are very well documented on the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
which are very well documented on the
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.550
which are very well documented on the
Android design site but today we're

going to be looking at rich

we get started we should probably

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
we get started we should probably
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400
we get started we should probably
introduce ourselves as always uh my name

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
introduce ourselves as always uh my name
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.840

let's get started with Android design in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
let's get started with Android design in

um what we did today was we didn't look

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
um what we did today was we didn't look
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.119
um what we did today was we didn't look
at any specific local video players you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
at any specific local video players you
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.440
at any specific local video players you
know that were previously reviewed on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
know that were previously reviewed on
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.609
know that were previously reviewed on
the App clinic I believe they're

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
the App clinic I believe they're
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469
the App clinic I believe they're
actually doing that because of some sort

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
actually doing that because of some sort
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660
actually doing that because of some sort
of technical difficulties but what we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
of technical difficulties but what we
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340
of technical difficulties but what we
what we did today was instead of looking

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
what we did today was instead of looking
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460
what we did today was instead of looking
at specific apps we came up with an

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
at specific apps we came up with an
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.730
at specific apps we came up with an
example app that you know did some of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
example app that you know did some of
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920
example app that you know did some of
the simple some similar things but it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
the simple some similar things but it
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020
the simple some similar things but it
wasn't branded in any way it's not kind

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
wasn't branded in any way it's not kind
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609
wasn't branded in any way it's not kind
of like a published app and we have no

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
of like a published app and we have no
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.320
of like a published app and we have no
intentions of publishing it it's really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
intentions of publishing it it's really
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780
intentions of publishing it it's really
just kind of a what if you know what if

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
just kind of a what if you know what if
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210
just kind of a what if you know what if
we were to design a local video player

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
we were to design a local video player
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.010
we were to design a local video player
from scratch and we didn't do all the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
from scratch and we didn't do all the
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499
from scratch and we didn't do all the
screens and we only did just a few of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
screens and we only did just a few of
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749
screens and we only did just a few of
the screens primarily around the Browse

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
the screens primarily around the Browse
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.359
the screens primarily around the Browse
experience we won't be talking too much

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
experience we won't be talking too much
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.850
experience we won't be talking too much
about video playback because you know

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
about video playback because you know
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289
about video playback because you know
while you're playing the video you know

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
while you're playing the video you know
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.399
while you're playing the video you know
there's a lot of things that you can

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
there's a lot of things that you can
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.760
there's a lot of things that you can
really do and we have some examples of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
really do and we have some examples of
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460
really do and we have some examples of
apps that do it really well for example

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
apps that do it really well for example
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080
apps that do it really well for example
the YouTube app does a fairly good job

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
the YouTube app does a fairly good job
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789
the YouTube app does a fairly good job
with that so if you're already starting

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
with that so if you're already starting
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160
with that so if you're already starting
to create a local video player or a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
to create a local video player or a
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.510
to create a local video player or a
video player in general you should

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
video player in general you should
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.429
video player in general you should
probably model your playback screen

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
probably model your playback screen
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.789
probably model your playback screen
after something like YouTube um but what

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
after something like YouTube um but what
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.130
after something like YouTube um but what
we did do is look at browse screens and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
we did do is look at browse screens and
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290
we did do is look at browse screens and
things like that before we get started

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
things like that before we get started
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300
things like that before we get started
anybody else have any things to add to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
anybody else have any things to add to
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.600
anybody else have any things to add to
the exposition for the show

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
the exposition for the show
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.310
the exposition for the show
just say a bit of the show that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320
just say a bit of the show that
 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.230
just say a bit of the show that
unfortunately don't have a fancy studio

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240
unfortunately don't have a fancy studio
 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.720
unfortunately don't have a fancy studio
set up this week so while the stream

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
set up this week so while the stream
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.100
set up this week so while the stream
quality might be a little bit lower you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
quality might be a little bit lower you
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.400
quality might be a little bit lower you
can and get the slides downloads later

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
can and get the slides downloads later
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140
can and get the slides downloads later
so if you're watching this look at the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150
so if you're watching this look at the
 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.610
so if you're watching this look at the
description in the YouTube video and it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
description in the YouTube video and it
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.410
description in the YouTube video and it
should be a link to get high quality

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
should be a link to get high quality
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.120
should be a link to get high quality
slides if you can't quite make out all

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130
slides if you can't quite make out all
 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.740
slides if you can't quite make out all
the visuals and then click through to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
the visuals and then click through to
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.500
the visuals and then click through to
that link yeah and we're gonna post the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510
that link yeah and we're gonna post the
 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.370
that link yeah and we're gonna post the
slides and I think like 2560 x 1440 you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380
slides and I think like 2560 x 1440 you
 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.990
slides and I think like 2560 x 1440 you
something resolution so you get all the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
something resolution so you get all the
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.410
something resolution so you get all the
little super HD something super super

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
little super HD something super super
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.980
little super HD something super super
super HD 4d four dimensions okay anyway

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990
super HD 4d four dimensions okay anyway
 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.470
super HD 4d four dimensions okay anyway
so let's jump into the to the screens so

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
so let's jump into the to the screens so
 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.550
so let's jump into the to the screens so
this is our example local video player

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
this is our example local video player
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.680
this is our example local video player
and well I probably could have taken up

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690
and well I probably could have taken up
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.540
and well I probably could have taken up
more space on the screen and just I

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550
more space on the screen and just I
 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.030
more space on the screen and just I
think you're fun but this is our example

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
think you're fun but this is our example
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.510
think you're fun but this is our example
video yeah yeah this is an example a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520
video yeah yeah this is an example a
 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.940
video yeah yeah this is an example a
video player that just again local

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950
video player that just again local
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.300
video player that just again local
content and it shows you you know a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
content and it shows you you know a
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.979
content and it shows you you know a
couple of things and basically this is

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
couple of things and basically this is
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.870
couple of things and basically this is
the rough structure of this app is that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
the rough structure of this app is that
 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.370
the rough structure of this app is that
you know you could imagine that you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380
you know you could imagine that you
 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.680
you know you could imagine that you
categorize your local videos into

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690
categorize your local videos into
 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.900
categorize your local videos into
different groups or categories will show

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
different groups or categories will show
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.910
different groups or categories will show
there in a second and then you know you

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
there in a second and then you know you
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.470
there in a second and then you know you
might have a queue of like you know

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
might have a queue of like you know
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.320
might have a queue of like you know
local videos that you plan on watching

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330
local videos that you plan on watching
 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.259
local videos that you plan on watching
and then you probably want to have you

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269
and then you probably want to have you
 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.150
and then you probably want to have you
know some sort of sense of what has been

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160
know some sort of sense of what has been
 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.280

category that would be updated
 

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.980
category that would be updated
constantly and then you could categorize

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:51.990
constantly and then you could categorize
 

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.530

you're working on things like that and
 

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.450
you're working on things like that and
then this would be custom

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:08.460
then this would be custom
 

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.460
then this would be custom
sizable by you right so maybe this is

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:10.470
sizable by you right so maybe this is
 

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.200
sizable by you right so maybe this is
depending on what app you're building

going so if you have you know a ton of

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160
going so if you have you know a ton of
 

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.949
going so if you have you know a ton of
different videos maybe baby videos or

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959
different videos maybe baby videos or
 

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:35.470

wedding video

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480

or else you could quickly skip up and

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:38.510
or else you could quickly skip up and
 

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.850
or else you could quickly skip up and
down and look at all of this from videos

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:39.860
down and look at all of this from videos
 

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.009
down and look at all of this from videos
yeah and then if you have maybe TED

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:42.019
yeah and then if you have maybe TED
 

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:43.509
yeah and then if you have maybe TED
talks and you sort of trying to look at

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519
talks and you sort of trying to look at
 

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.129
talks and you sort of trying to look at
something by title you could switch the

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:45.139
something by title you could switch the
 

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:47.319
something by title you could switch the
title and do the same thing so sort of

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:47.329
title and do the same thing so sort of
 

00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:49.329
title and do the same thing so sort of
it's a lot of power here being up can

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:49.339
it's a lot of power here being up can
 

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:51.430
it's a lot of power here being up can
navigate through a pretty broad array of

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440
navigate through a pretty broad array of
 

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.160
navigate through a pretty broad array of
different video types yeah and I think

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.170
different video types yeah and I think
 

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.870
different video types yeah and I think
for Ted videos like one of the things

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880
for Ted videos like one of the things
 

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.460
for Ted videos like one of the things
that I would probably filter on is you

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:57.470
that I would probably filter on is you
 

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.860
that I would probably filter on is you
know duration or percent viewed so like

00:15:59.860 --> 00:15:59.870
know duration or percent viewed so like
 

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.210
know duration or percent viewed so like
you know I have I'm gonna go on the

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:01.220
you know I have I'm gonna go on the
 

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.790
you know I have I'm gonna go on the
train right now I have 10 minutes right

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.220

what can i watch from Ted that's 10

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.230
what can i watch from Ted that's 10
 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.750
what can i watch from Ted that's 10
minutes long like this is something that

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:07.760
minutes long like this is something that
 

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.800
minutes long like this is something that
that's really important to me in general

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:08.810
that's really important to me in general
 

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.439
that's really important to me in general
is time so like not only for local video

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:11.449
is time so like not only for local video
 

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:13.569
is time so like not only for local video
but reading right for articles you

00:16:13.569 --> 00:16:13.579
but reading right for articles you
 

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:15.400
but reading right for articles you
should always show the rough amount of

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
should always show the rough amount of
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.689
should always show the rough amount of
time that this will take you to read

00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:16.699
time that this will take you to read
 

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:18.340
time that this will take you to read
because i know that i'm on the train i

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:18.350
because i know that i'm on the train i
 

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.650
because i know that i'm on the train i
have five minutes rhyme on i'm walking

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.660
have five minutes rhyme on i'm walking
 

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.819
have five minutes rhyme on i'm walking
to the train i probably shouldn't you

00:16:21.819 --> 00:16:21.829
to the train i probably shouldn't you
 

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:24.040
to the train i probably shouldn't you
reading my phone but you know i have and

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.050
reading my phone but you know i have and
 

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.720
reading my phone but you know i have and
you know exactly this amount of time

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:25.730
you know exactly this amount of time
 

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.730
you know exactly this amount of time
what can i do in that time and i think

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:27.740
what can i do in that time and i think
 

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.290
what can i do in that time and i think
that you know giving you the option to

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:29.300
that you know giving you the option to
 

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.019
that you know giving you the option to
filter by size or length or duration or

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:32.029
filter by size or length or duration or
 

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:33.939
filter by size or length or duration or
you know i guess in the case of percent

00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:33.949
you know i guess in the case of percent
 

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:35.980
you know i guess in the case of percent
viewed how much you have left like three

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:35.990
viewed how much you have left like three
 

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.840
viewed how much you have left like three
minutes left in this video and that's a

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:37.850
minutes left in this video and that's a
 

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.960
minutes left in this video and that's a
fairly powerful way of organizing the

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:40.970
fairly powerful way of organizing the
 

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.220
fairly powerful way of organizing the
last thing I point out is that you

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.230
last thing I point out is that you
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.750
last thing I point out is that you
probably make it sticky right so for

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:43.760
probably make it sticky right so for
 

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.240
probably make it sticky right so for
family videos you'd always you know do

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.250

the sort of technical implementation
side is that the support library has a

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:39.869
