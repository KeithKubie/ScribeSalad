00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.180
CHANTAL BERMAN: My research
is about how states respond to social protest

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.290
movements in contemporary North Africa.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.550

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.840
CHANTAL BERMAN: This is the first protest
that I attended in Morocco.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.910
This is a protest of teacher trainees.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.910
So they're these people.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.699
You can see, they're wearing their white coats.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.980
And they are protesting against these privatization
measures that have been moving forward in

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310
Morocco and the education system.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.619
People have come from all over the country
to protest in the capital.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
Morocco, as of right now, is not a political
democracy.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.760
But nonetheless, people are able to organize
and to actually affect policy in line with

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.590
their interests, by doing these big marches
in the symbolic space of the capital area

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.690
and the parliamentary area.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.269
AMANEY JAMAL: She took it upon herself to
design one of the most comprehensive event

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.980
data sets of protest movements and protest
activity in the five years before the Arab

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.410
Spring in two countries, Morocco and Tunisia.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.170
And in the five years after the Arab Spring
in both countries, as well.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.810
CHANTAL BERMAN: So we really have to do a
lot of our own data collection.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.840
So I've started a process where I have a great
team of RAs who are working with me to source

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.510
event data from local newspapers, all of which
are in paper copy, not digitized, out of these

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.300
local libraries and archives.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.610
It's exciting to be able to turn something
that sort of non-digitized and sort of rotting

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.450
away somewhere in an archive basement, into
a resource that hopefully I, and other scholars,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.640
can use to learn more about mobilization.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.140
And learn more about tactics and strategies
that activists can use to achieve their rights.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.650
AMANEY JAMAL: She's out there.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.650
She's in the protests.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080
She's watching what's happening.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.380
She's listening to their demands.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.700
She's listening to their slogans in ways that
is just remarkable for a young researcher.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.380
CHANTAL BERMAN: I am super glad that I came
to Princeton.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.090
And I think the number one reason is my advisers
and my faculty.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.370
My advisers are incredible intellectuals,
and they're also fantastic mentors.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.530
And they've been really, I think, generous
with me, in terms of supporting this somewhat

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.150
kind of crazy sounding project and have also
been really giving of their time to sort of

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.150
nurture young scholars.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.860
And that's really inspiring for me, as, hopefully,
a future professor.
