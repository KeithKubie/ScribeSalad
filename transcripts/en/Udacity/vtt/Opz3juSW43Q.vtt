00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:03.420
Okay, so thus far, we have a button with an image of a microphone.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.140
But when I click on it, nothing happens.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.800
So let's change that.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.180
Notice that we are currently in the standard editor.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.760
How do I know that, you ask?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.610
Well, because this button, which is labeled Standard editor, is selected.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.360
The button right next to it is called the Assistant editor.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.130
If I click on it, Xcode continues to show me the storyboard, but in addition to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.420
that, it shows me another file which is logically related to the storyboard.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.910
This file is called ViewController.swift.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.969
Let me slide out the Navigator so we can see this a little bit better.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.300
There.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.330
Now, the way these two are related is that when we click on the record button,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.260
some code will get executed.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.480
And that code will go right here in the ViewController.swift.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.455
By the way, this file,

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:56.680
ViewController.swift, was created by Xcode when we made our project.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.380
Now, I can almost hear some of you say, how are these two files related?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.440
Here's how.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.860
Let me select this phone frame in the storyboard such that there is

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.640
a blue outline around it.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.860
And now, if I slide out the utility area and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.910
then click on this little icon right here, which is labeled Identity Inspector,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.870
I can see that this frame is connected to a class called ViewController.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.280
By the way, all of this work was done by Xcode where we actually made our app.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.130
Okay, let me slide out the utility area for a bit.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.170
All right, let's scan the code inside this file, ViewController.swift.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.710
Now, it's okay if you do not understand everything in this file.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.070
For now, I just want to highlight that the name of this file

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.750
is the exact same as the name of the class inside the file.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.840
And this class has two functions, viewDidLoad and didReceiveMemoryWarning.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, these are functions that allow us to manage or

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.300
control certain events with the app.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.720
For instance, if we wanted our app to do something special in case our

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.210
app received a memory warning, that code would go right in here.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.070
All right.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.340
Now I'm going to write code that will execute when we hit this button.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.010
I will press and hold Control down on my keyboard, click on the button, and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040
then drag towards my code.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.420
And once I'm there, I'll let go.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.670
You will be presented with a pop-up that will try and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.200
make a connection between the storyboard and this code.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.090
And because we are trying to do something when we click on this button,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.430
the type of this connection is Action.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.795
Let's call the name of this connection recordAudio.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.200
The type of the button is UIButton.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.000
UI stands for user interface.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.440
Under Event, I will select Touch Up Inside.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.540
What that means is that this event will be triggered when my

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.842
finger is within the bounds of the button, and then I'll hit Connect.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:01.500
All right, I now have a skeleton function which will be called when I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110
hit the record button.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.810
Let's examine this function.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.330
Its name is recordAudio, which seems about right.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.870
Also, the center of this action, or

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.920
the thing that actually triggers this function, is our UI button.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.380
We also see something new, something called IBAction.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.210
IB stands for interface builder, and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.150
this thing tells developers that this is not an ordinary function, but

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.610
is instead linked to the storyboard or the interface builder somehow.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.479
Okay, so I want to do two things when this function is called.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.370
The first is that I want to show some text that says, recording in progress.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.560
And then the other thing I want to do is actually record the user's voice.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.900
By the way, when you start to add TODOs in this way,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.170
they start to show up really clearly in this drop-down at the top.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.270
This way, you can easily keep track of the things you need to do.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.830
For now, I'm going to add a print statement to this function and

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.410
see if this function is in fact executed when I click on this button.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.220
I'm going to run this project.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.600
Now when I click on the button, I will see the output of

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.850
the print statement in the debug area at the bottom of Xcode.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.290
Let me do that one more time.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.510
There it is.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.460
All right, I'm going to go back to my Xcode, slide out the debug area from here,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.100
and the next thing I'm going to do is show some text that reads,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.280
recording in progress.
