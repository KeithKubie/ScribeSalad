00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
They may have started the market on animated
movies, bringing classic fairy tales to children

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.860
around the world.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.500
But when Walt Disney called on old stories
for new audiences, the filmmakers made sure

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.000
to lighten up most of the material, making
sure that evil stepmothers or ugly witches

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.410
were as dark as they got.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.060
But in the last two decades, people’s tastes
turned to computer-generated animation - over

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.720
Disney’s hand-drawn style.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.221
That all changed when the studio made the
leap, returning to their roots for a story

00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:37.170
that was undeniably dark – but cute and
fun enough to win over fans.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.510
The movie was Tangled, the blockbuster adventure
starring a young girl who’d been held prisoner

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.190
her entire life, only freed when the first
man she met – and would soon marry - cut

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.730
off all her hair - and her kidnapper fell
to her death.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.120
You see what we’re getting at.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.730
There may have been a time when Disney had
to clean up their storytelling, but in the

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.940
years since the studio returned to the top
of the movie world, things have changed.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.940
The films send a good message, sure – but
take a closer look at what’s actually going

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.790
on, and parents may not realize just how much
their kids are seeing in between the laughs.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.790
Tangled

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.750
We’ve already mentioned how disturbing a
story Disney’s take on Rapunzel really is,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.710
even if the film jumps over the years the
young girl spent locked away in a tower.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.860
Her positive attitude helps audiences of all
ages forget that it’s one of the darkest

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.490
beginnings to a story Disney has ever told,
but unlike the ones that followed, it actually

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.120
does have a happy ending.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.250
With Rapunzel returned to her parents, and
Flynn Rider sticking by her side, it’s as

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.690
much a fairy tale ending as you can hope for.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.140
Again, teaching kids that an upbeat attitude
and love can heal even decades-long kidnappings

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.840
may not be the most healthy lesson, but the
moral of the story is still a good one.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.729
Don’t be afraid to take risks, and you’ll
do just fine.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.570
Which is more than we can say about Disney’s
next hit.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.120
Wreck-It Ralph

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.590
The world of this video game movie is one
that any kid can understand: people are told

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.510
where they can and can’t go, and breaking
the rules gets them nothing but trouble – basically,

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.600
the life of a child.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.950
But even though Ralph is supposed to be the
bad guy, it is him who gets bullied and left

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.560
out by the rest of his game’s inhabitants.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.980
Since he knows it’s not fair, and he’s
destined to be more than just a ‘bad guy,’

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.129
he sets out – just like Rapunzel – to
find something better.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.019
The adventure that follows sees him make new
friends, right old wrongs, and learn what

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.959
it really means to be a hero.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.029
When all is said and done, he accepts that
his place is where he was to start, and heads

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.029
home.

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.980
Which… is actually a pretty messed up message
when you stop and think about it.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.110
The issue with Ralph’s game-jumping is simple:
if he doesn’t play the role assigned to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.919
him, then the game won’t work, and everyone
depending on him will be killed.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.200
That’s about as dystopic a story as you
can get, with entire movies, TV shows and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.620
novels like 1984 based on the same idea: play
your role, or order turns to chaos.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.609
No matter how much Disney prettied up the
ending, Ralph doesn’t get a happy life because

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.139
he becomes his own hero, or unites all the
citizens of the video game arcade into one

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.499
society where they can be what they choose.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.000
His fellow characters tell him he’s a hero,
and that’s all.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.200
Even Ralph’s mantra, that “I’m bad,
and that’s good.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.760
I will never be good, and that’s not bad”
is about the opposite thing kids should be

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.049
told, since parents usually look to inspire
their children to have ambition, and be able

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.080
to define themselves on their own.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.819
Since Ralph is accepting that he’ll never
be a hero, just embracing his role as the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.290
bad guy, order is restored.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.969
Considering that Disney movies are usually
thought of as urging kids to dream big, it’s

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.340
sad to realize the moral of Wreck-It Ralph
is surprisingly dark, telling kids to be what

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.389
the world assigns them, and if they want to
be happy, learn to be okay with it.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.190
But considering that even Rapunzel only found
happiness when she returned to her family

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.730
– the castle where she belonged – we suppose
it’s not a totally different message.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.510
Just one that’s easier to spot.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.510
Frozen

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.549
It may have become a blockbuster hit for its
message of true love being between sisters,

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.069
and embracing what makes you special, but
the journey getting to that point wasn’t

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.069
as squeaky clean.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.079
For starters, the movie begins with Anna and
Elsa as best friends, with the older sister’s

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.930
talent for ice magic making their world a
fun one.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.590
But when Anna gets hurt playing, the King
and Queen take drastic measures.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.280
They tell Elsa to hide her gifts, to “conceal,
don’t feel” who she really is inside.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.970
Again, we would like to think that parents
are better off taking the opposite approach

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.280
and mental health professionals might argue
this is the start of an unhappy story – especially

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.789
as Elsa struggles with her identity in adulthood.

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.030
If it weren’t bad enough that her parents
force her to see gifts as a curse, the movie

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.350
also implies that Anna and Elsa’s relationship
ends as a result, with the two seeing eachother

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.500
rarely, if ever.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.050
It’s only when their parents are killed
that the sisters come together as a family.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.340
Whoops, we mean they grow even farther apart,
abandoning eachother for another two years.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.440
That story seems particularly dark.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.080
Kids don’t need to worry about witches,
evil stepmothers or ancient curses – but

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.810
getting along with your siblings, and trusting
that your parents actually want what’s best

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.879
for you, are the real concerns.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.800
But in doing what her parents said was right,
lying to everyone around her, Elsa is exiled,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.759
sentenced to death, almost kills her sister,
and is seconds away from being murdered.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.379
True love might win the day here, but everything
before it seems like a dark story of terrible

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.120
parents and pain, not exactly a Disney classic.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.620
Maybe we should just take Elsa’s advice
here and… let it go?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.699
Zootopia

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.949
With Disney’s dream of a world where animals
are as evolved as people, living in harmony

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.000
in one massive city, the messages get even
more ambitious, tackling more relevant conflicts

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.090
and social issues than any Disney film in
years.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.009
As much as some people try to claim it’s
one specific issue or ideological divide being

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.110
referenced, Zootopia’s main story is one
that anyone, in any country, can see clearly:

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.460
while predator species and prey live together
happily, they’re all ready to start seeing

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.460
the worst in eachother.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.500
The most obvious adult message of the movie
marks the latest installment in Disney’s

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.909
reliance on drug sequences, hallucinations
caused by chemicals, or alcohol – take your

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:01.909
pick.

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.549
In Zootopia, it’s a plant called ‘Night
Howler’ that sends any animal who eats it

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:10.490
– predator or prey – into a wild rage,
turning them into mindless… well, animals.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.349
The police investigating good people who have
gone missing, after messing with this strange

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.940
substance, is already a pretty dark real world
issue for kids to learn about, no matter how

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.390
the story is resolved.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.569
Happy ending or not, parents may have a hard
time explaining to their kids why plants – picked,

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.080
processed, and distributed by the bad guys
– can make good people leave their families

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
behind.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.439
And it’s not the kind of question they usually
expect a Disney movie to raise.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.860
But when the drug is turned against predators
– the minority of the population in Zootopia

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.490
– the prey react in ways that reflect the
very worst, most prejudiced parts of everyday

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.490
people.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.960
Judging entire groups of people based on their
ancestors or diet is as wrong in the movie

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.600
as it is in today’s world, but even though
Zootopia makes that point by the end, it can’t

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.830
undo the amount of ugliness and hate displayed
by the movie’s villain.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.470
A villain who claims that “fear” is the
most important weapon someone can use when

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.050
turning cultures or people against eachother.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.389
The message is an important one, but is such
a clear analogy to the very real, but very

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:13.550
worst parts of today’s world, post-viewing
conversations become requirement.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.780
Instead of evil witches or monsters, it’s
angry, suspicious citizens sticking with their

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.780
own kind.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.499
It’s a different kind of message, and a
different kind of dark for Disney.

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:27.169
It says more about today’s world, and today’s
monsters than any fairy tale or nursery rhyme

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.919
ever could – but it also shows a reality
that would, perhaps hopefully for some, go

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.330
over children’s heads completely.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.330
So what do you think?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.550
Is Disney’s future in animated movies that
teach kids about life’s toughest realities

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.590
and lessons in terms they can actually see
in the world, or is it a slightly lighter

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.449
touch better - teaching lessons while entertaining
them with fantasy and magic?

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.169
There’s no right answer, but it’s hard
to ignore that the kind of ‘adult’ messages

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:57.020
or tone Disney is tackling require closer
attention than many of their classics.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.999
For some, that’s a good thing and, no doubt,
Disney deserves credit for tackling tough

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:03.169
subjects – but will parents agree?
