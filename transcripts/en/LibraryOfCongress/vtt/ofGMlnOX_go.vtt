&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: OK, folks.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.160
If everyone wants to sit down
and we'll continue our show.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.580
And our big introducer
is Mandalit del Barco,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.760
and you're with NPR out in LA.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.010
So that's -- welcome,
by the way.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.310
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.180
And Luis. All right.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.780
Go ahead. Thank you.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.080
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
Thank you so much.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.380
Can you hear me?

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.690
Yes, OK. Thank you so much
for inviting me to talk

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.090
with this amazing author.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.880
As he explained, I'm with NPR.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.480
I'm an arts correspondent.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.650
And so I get to read
a lot of books.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.550
And it's such a pleasure
to read books by an author

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.240
that I really love that
we're going to talk to today.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.750
And if there's time,
we're going to open

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.280
up to questions from you, too.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.670
So just to get started, you
know, NPR has called our guest,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.520
Luis Alberto Urrea,
a literary badass.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.830
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh, God.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.830
[ Laughter ]

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.130
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Do
you get that all the time?

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.430
[ Laughter ]

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.730
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
I've been hearing it, yeah.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.030
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah,
that's pretty cool, I think.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.330
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Alan Cheuse.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.640
You can't argue with him.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.950
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: So
he is an English professor

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.130
at the University of
Illinois in Chicago.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.010
And he's written in
many, many genres.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.250
Fiction and nonfiction, poetry,
short stories, and five novels

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.850
that include Into the Beautiful
North, The Devil's Highway --

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.620
which was nominated for a
Pulitzer, congratulations --

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.750
the Hummingbird's Daughter,
the Tijuana Book of the Dead,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.840
and his latest is
House of Broken Angels,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.880
which we'll be hearing
about more today.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.540
Now this book is a sprawling
family saga that takes place

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.360
in San Diego where
you grew up, right?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.370
And I understand it started off
as a tribute to your brother --

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.670
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Right.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.970
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: -- Juan.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.270
He died three years ago?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.570
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Three years ago.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.870
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.170
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.470
But it has inspired
this amazing book.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.460
And in this book, as you
write -- well, in the book,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.660
the character, Big Angel
-- or do you say Big Angel?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.960
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
No, Big Angel.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.260
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
Big Angel.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.560
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Big Angel.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.860
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
Aha, yeah.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.160
[ Laughter ]

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.460
Chicano.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.760
[Speaking Spanish]

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.060
[ Laughter ]

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.360
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Well, in
the book, he's dying of cancer,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.940
and his mother died
at the same time --

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.240
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Right.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.540
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: -- or
almost around the same time.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.600
Can you start off by
describing Big Angel

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.940
and Juan, your brother?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.470
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Juan.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.700
How do I put -- I
was born in Tijuana.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.790
We come from Colonia in
the pendenza in Tijuana.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.930
Spanish was my first language.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.370
My dad was Mexican,
my mom was American

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.910
from Staten Island, a socialite.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.210
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Ah.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.510
[ Laughter ]

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.810
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.430
My dad was the first
Mexican she ever met.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.740
[ Laughter ]

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.440
But he was a guerito.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.740
He was the white one.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.730
I mean, she was obviously
a white woman,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.860
but my dad was red-haired,
blue-eyed,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.200
looked like Errol
Flynn, you know.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.500
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.800
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Or thought he did.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.100
[ Laughter ]

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.510
And [speaking Spanish], my dad.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.410
So he had other families, right?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.710
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Hm.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.010
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
I had siblings,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.530
but they weren't,
you know, in my home.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.190
And so Juan was the big
brother of that crew.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.350
And they were still in Tijuana,
and we left Tijuana and moved

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.190
to San Diego because my mom
wanted to be back in the USA.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.950
I was quite ill.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.770
Our barrio was annihilated
by tuberculosis, so --

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.660
and my dad, he had a green card.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.290
Don't be thinking
bad thoughts, now.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.540
But he had a green card.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.100
And Juan was in Tijuana, and he
never let go of his grip on me,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.510
even though I was gone.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.830
He believed in me.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.250
And I don't know that I
believed there was any hope

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.550
for me whatsoever.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.010
I came out of this
hopeless world, right?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.780
But Juan loved to read, and
he loved to read English.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.950
And one thing that -- I put it
in the book, but it's true --

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.700
my dad instigated
learning Ingles

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.350
by memorizing the dictionary.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.740
So he memorized five pages
of dictionary a week.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.040
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.340
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.690
And he used to have these
contests with Juan, right?

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.990
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.290
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
And they would sit there

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.670
and battle out English.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.680
And my task was to give
my father English lessons,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.080
which is not really fun

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.010
if you have a grouchy
Mexican dad, right?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.930
And he was always
smoking Pall Malls.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.990
And I talk in the book about
how old Mexican folks love

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.290
instant coffee.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.680
My dad was an instant
coffee addict,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.060
so I grew up with the sound of
the spoon: tinky-de, tinky-de,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.360
tinky-de, tinky-de, tinky.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.090
So he'd make one, and he'd say,
andale, [speaking Spanish].

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.480
And I'd say, ay, Papa.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.010
What do you want to know?

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.510
Ask me any question
about English, go on!

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.310
In the As.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.340
[ Laughter ]

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.350
And I'd be like, OK,
Dad, what's an aardvark?

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.070
And he'd be like, jeez!

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.120
[ Laughter ]

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.420
You know, with that cigarette.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.720
And he'd say, un aardvark --

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.880
un aardvark is an animal with
a big, long nose, he eats ants.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.180
I'd say, good, Dad,
you passed, right?

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.980
So he and Juan would
do this combat.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.940
And Juan felt that it was a
great triumph for a Mexican

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.850
to read books in English.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.150
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Hm.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.550
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: And
he loved science fiction.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.850
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Me, too.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.150
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Right?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.450
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Oh, yeah.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.750
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh, yeah?

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.050
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.350
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: That
was my thing when I was a kid.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.490
So he would send with
my dad books to me.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.180
And that's how I discovered
Ray Bradbury, through Juan.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.220
So in some ways, you could
draw a direct line maybe

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.120
through Ray Bradbury to
me because of these books.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.420
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.360
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
So Juan got ill.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.250
My father had been long dead.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.360
Juan got ill, and he had
this impending death.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.520
It was fairly clear
he was going to die.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.050
And his mother -- not
my mom, but his mom,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.910
was about to have
her 100th birthday.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.240
And so the family thought, what
if -- because her birthday was,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.590
like, a week before -- or
a couple weeks before his.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.480
But they were like, what if
we get all the family together

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.680
to give him a farewell
birthday party,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.550
knowing it was going
to be adios, right?

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.560
And my brother, what you
need to know about him,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.320
he was a very willful
man and pretty sure

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.410
of his own impressive nature;
in other words, an egomaniac.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.210
So when he heard
that they were going

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.520
to throw him a goodbye
birthday party, he was like, oh,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.010
I can have my own
wake and attend it?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.760
[ Laughter ]

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.190
Right? I can plan my own wake
and then receive all the --

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.820
you know, before I die,
told how great I am.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.350
So that was in play, and his
mother died the week before

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.650
his party.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.010
And, boy, was he mad.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.310
[ Laughter ]

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.960
He was, like, ay, ma.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.420
You know, of all
the times to die.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.720
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Upstaged.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.020
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yeah!

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.320
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Ah.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.620
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
It's like,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.920
I was going to have a party.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.570
So he being the patriarch
took over her funeral.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.920
And she had her funeral
on Saturday,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.800
and then he had his
goodbye party on Sunday.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.210
And my wife and I, of course,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.020
and our daughter
went to this thing.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.610
And I had never seen
anything like it.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.970
I often say this -- you'll
know this with LA experience.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.540
But every kind of
Mexican you ever imagined

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.820
and some you didn't
were all there at once.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.670
Every generation.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.740
There were the abuelitas,
you know,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.150
and there were gang
bangers, you know,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.100
there were vatos,
all the cholos.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.850
There were the PhD crew
and the professionals.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.660
And then all the sudden this
group of Samoans went through.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.960
I was like --

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.260
[ Laughter ]

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.560
-- I said, who's the Samoans?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.860
They're like, that's
your cousins!

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.160
I was like, oh, primos!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.460
[ Laughter ]

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.760
It was neat.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.470
And there was this
mad thing going on.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.450
And I'm watching my
brother, who's clearly dying,

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.070
and that was what inspired
the book, just realizing --

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.670
I didn't know really --

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.950
we called it the
Mexican-Finnegans Wake.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.630
We didn't really know -- I
didn't know that it was a book,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.180
but Cindy, my wife, kept saying,
you've got to write about this.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.050
And I said, what's there to
write about burying an old guy?

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.350
There's no story.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.650
And she'd say, really [laughs]?

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.950
[ Laughter ]

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.280
And I realized, you
know, the story was

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.750
in the layers and
the generations.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.390
And I thought, I've written
so many border books.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.980
And I thought, in some ways this
is my farewell to the border.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.280
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.580
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
You know, I've done it --

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.500
I've done it 25 years
preaching the same gospel,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.990
and it's still bad.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.320
There's still 500 children
stuck in a cage somewhere.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.390
And I just thought, I don't
know how much I can say this.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.800
But I thought maybe I can talk
about the depth of the soul

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.400
of this family, people who are
Americans by any definition --

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.740
even the current
definitions, maybe.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.080
They've been here 70 years --

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.380
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.290
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: -- gone
to school, vote, paid taxes.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.300
But they're Mexicanos.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.600
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Exactly.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.900
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
And how do you then deal

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.270
with being an American and
trying to bury your dad

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.980
and having somebody
come up to you and say,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.810
the president's going to
throw you out of this country.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.710
And I thought, if I can drop
those shocks in the book,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.920
maybe my readers will
understand what it feels

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.750
like when somebody goes after
you out of the blue, right?

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.290
So there were all
those things going on.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.260
And I wanted to show readers I
had finally become, you know,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.700
a mature adult and
wasn't doctoring error,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.130
so I made Big Angel
a Republican.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.010
I thought, it isn't my first
Republican hero, you know.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.390
[ Laughter ]

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.090

being too liberal or whatever.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.620
we are now in Washington, D.C.

And I don't know what --

and with this book and even
just here on this stage,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.220
what would you like to
tell President Trump

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.520
and the politicians here...

It's an invitation
to say what you feel.

You know, honestly,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.730
I don't even know what to say.

&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.710
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: When
we were driving in yesterday,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.680
you know, I do stuff
with the NEA,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.470
and we went by the
old post office.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.260
And I thought, you know,
we authors used to sit

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.690
on the steps in front of there.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:58.470
And it just was so weird what --
you know, it's a foolish thing

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.340
to say, I wish you'd
read my book.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.830
I did a pretty good
audiobook, just listen to it

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.290
and maybe it'll soften
your heart a little bit.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.050
But I'm not sure the hearts
right now can be softened.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.360

don't really understand it.

I don't know why us.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.630
One of the tings I do with the
NEA is talk to lots of kids.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.400
And I can't tell you how
hurt and afraid and wounded

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.180
and self-loathing a lot
of our children are now.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.920
And I keep trying to tell them,
it's going to be OK, you know.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.220
Kids like to laugh, right?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.950
So I tell them, look,
this whole thing,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.190
it's like a lighthouse
that's casting a beam

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.390
of hating somebody else around.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.630
And it used to be Irish people,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.670
it used to be Chinese
people, it was Germans.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.490
Sometimes I read them what Ben
Franklin said about Germans.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.980
It sounds just like what's
being said about us now.

just got to believe me.

you, and they're going

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.350
to get really pissed off

of writing about the border.

up right along the border.

it's very different places.

there since then,

but it's -- starting in 1990.

side, it was like a carnival.

was so different.

a hole in the fence.

actually once for a story.

But that's another story.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.870
But growing up in that back in
the day, can you talk about how

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.380
that border was before and how
it changed, and what it was

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.100
like for you growing up with
that border symbolically

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.740
and physically with the borders?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.040

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.450
it was never laugh riot
necessarily, the border.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.450
But back when I was a kid,

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.830
the border was certainly
not what it is now [laughs].

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.840

basically.

couldn't care less.

back to the US,

car pulling up,

best tortillas were.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.510
That's where all the dogs were
running around, and my grandma,

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.020
my aunts and my cousins,
and the music everywhere.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.440
And I loved Christmas
in Tijuana.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.740
And then we moved.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.470
And then we were in the barrio
right on, you know, the US side.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.660
And that was really odd
because it was instant race war.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.960
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.260
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.600
Brown versus white
versus black, right?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.300
And there were not
a lot of white folks

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.570
in that neighborhood,
but there it went.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.690
And I was talking Tijuana, man.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.480
I had this accent when
I came out of Tijuana

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.470
because I was still
learning English, Chavez!

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.940
And I was talking
Spanglish, right?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.470
So how a bike was una
bika [phonetic], right?

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.090
Somebody's wife was
la wifa [phonetic].

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.170
And then cake was
cakee [phonetic].

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.740
Except it was an old lady,
and she'd put a diminutive,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.040
so she'd say un cakeecito
[phonetic].

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.350
[ Laughter ]

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.650
That's how I was talking.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.000
So you could imagine me walking

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.460
through the race
war neighborhood.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.740
Irish looking dude
talking all Tijuana.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.780
And it was like,
you know, all --

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.010
it was like, peace right
through the barrio.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.510
Because everybody's like,
gentlemen, let us kick his ass.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.280
[ Laughter ]

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280
And then in fifth grade, I moved

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.180
up to a little working-class
suburb to the north.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.330
My mom was in heaven,
right, because she was back

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.830
to white folks and heaven.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.410
And I found out in fifth
grade that they hated us.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.440
I had never been more
shocked in my life.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.410
And, you know, I lost my Mexican
accent [snaps] like that.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.470
I think -- I didn't
mean to, but I thought,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.360
I'm not going to survive here.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.440
All these nice kids, you know.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.110
I've talked about
this on stage before,

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.990
but I thought I'd
gone to heaven.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.460
These guys had lawns,
green lawns.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.160
I thought, wow.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.880
And they had the Boy Scouts.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.680
I was like, well, that's the
coolest thing I ever heard of,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.980
right?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.300
We'd dress up in little
uniforms and go camping.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.070
But my dad had been a
Mexican military man --

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.280
macho -- and he hated it.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.580
He hated it.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.830
He didn't approve of
the Boy Scouts at all.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.260
And I remember coming home
one day after a campout,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.620
and I was in my little
uniform, and he's like, mijo,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.520
you're wearing shorts.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.880
I said, yeah, it's our uniform.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.920
He said, it's got knee socks.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.580
I said, yeah, it's
our uniform, Dad.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.580
And he said, mijo, if you want
to be a man, join the Army.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.880
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Whoa.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.270
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: I was
like, I'm in fifth grade, Dad!

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.350
[ Laughter ]

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.020
You know...like...and
that's when it hit,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.840
like, during that period.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.050
That's when -- you know, you
hang out with your homeboys

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.270
and you're in the
bathroom, fifth grade.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.790
All my new white boy
friends, you know?

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.280
And they didn't know
how to say my name,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.160
so they thought my
name was diarrhea.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.460
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
Oh, my God.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.080
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Urine.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.040
Urethra. And unreal.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.680
And unreal, I thought
that was pretty cool.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.980
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
That's cool, yeah.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.280
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
And we're in the bathroom,

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.040
and one of the boys from my Boy
Scout troop says, hey, Unreal,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.340
you know what you are?

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.730
And I said, no what am I?

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.320
And he said, you're a
greaser wetback, man.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.550
And they all started
laughing at me and yelling,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.490
greaser, greaser, greaser!

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.080
And I remember just
standing there thinking,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.630
que que, what is that?

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.960
And they all left, and they
left me in the bathroom alone.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.480
And I started looking
for the grease.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.130
Like, in that moment,
I thought we have --

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.490
we are drooling grease
and don't know it and all

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.600
of you all are looking at us
saying [scoffing], disgusting.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.900
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.200
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
And that's when it turned.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.980
That's when I started
hearing things against us

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.680
and that -- it was filthy.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.160
And that, you know, people

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.310
in Mexico smoke horse
dung cigarettes,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.360
and all the women
are prostitutes,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.450
and they eat cat tacos.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.250
I thought, what?

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.550
So I was lost.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.850
I didn't know what to do.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.240
And that was kind of
my journey into the US.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.540
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Well,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.840
and a lot of this you have
put in your books, too.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.140
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh, yeah!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.440
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.740
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
It's revenge!

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.040
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: That
is a great revenge, yeah.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.340
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: No.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.640
But, you know, people
are going through this.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.940
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.240
Still.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.540
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Still.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.020
And it's not just Latino people.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.750
People are going
through this stuff.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.450
Asian people, African
American people.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.310
It doesn't cease, and so
you just want it to cease.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.860
I never understood what
is the problem of looking

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.970
at somebody and loving them.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.290
It's really hard, right?

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.590
They're just a person.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.940
They have babies, they
have dreams, they're tired

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.240
at the end of the day.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.570
Their feet hurt.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.220
What's the problem?

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.520
I've never gotten it.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.210
And I really didn't get
it in that neighborhood,

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.510
and then I didn't get it

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.510
in my [laughs] later,
better neighborhood.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.730
And so I've always sort
of insisted on trying

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.970
to represent that culture.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.220
And I've got to say, the
border -- you know, the border,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.990
to me, it's just a metaphor.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.070
It's a physical metaphor.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.130
Because the border's
running right

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.980
through every audience
I ever see.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.950
Things separate us
from each other.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.440
You know, being a teacher, you
see a group of young women come

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.370
into class wearing the hijab.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.440
Other students move
away from them.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.740
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.870
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: So my job
is to make the other students...

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.810
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
What do you say to them?

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.110
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
It doesn't take long

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.720
because they're very
smart young women.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.530
So we come early, and I
always start the class saying,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.680
as-salamu alaykum, they
say, alaykumu as-salam.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.620
I say, hey, how's your dad?

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.940
Oh, my dad's hilarious,
my dad --

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.660
because everybody in the
class is thinking, oh,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.380
their dad's...terrible men.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.520
No, I love -- my dad's so funny,
blah, blah, blah, you know.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.820
How's your boyfriend?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.440
Oh...you see that movie?

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.680
Just to watch other kids watch
us interact and start to think,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.680
well, this is interesting,
I've made a discovery,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.070
these folks are human [laughs].

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.810
I think we're all just
waiting to discover

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.810
that everybody else is human.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.290
So that works.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.590
It's a really wonderful thing.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.830
You can see the class
come together.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.070
You know, last year, I had
some of my favorite students

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.750
of all time, Muslim students,
that were in my class.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.430
And we were studying things
like Hunter S. Thompson.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.870
And I told them -- I would
give them a heads up each book,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.250
Jack Kerouac, what he's like.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.930
But when Hunter S. Thompson
came up, Fear and Loathing

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.860
in Las Vegas, I said, this book,

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.340
100 percent harem,
bad, bad, bad.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.640
I just want you to know.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.940
They're like, we can take
it, you know, we can take it.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.240
[ Laughter ]

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.540
So they read it.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.840
And spring break was coming.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.140
And then young man -- I said,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.440
what are you doing
for spring break?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.050
He said, I'm going
to Cabo San Lucas.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.690
And I said, wait a minute, that
is also 100 percent harem, man.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.890
I said, what are you going
to do about drinking?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.820
He said, I am not
going to drink.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.270
And I said, what about
all the naked people?

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.070
He said, I'm going to look.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.900
[ Laughter ]

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.280
You know, if -- I don't know.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.050
If people can see you laughing
with somebody or crying

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.000
with somebody, what
are they going to do?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.880
How can they possibly walk
away from that table and say,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.230
psh, those people, right?

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.530
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Right.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.830
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: So
that's what I try to do.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.130
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: So do
you think that you're going

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.300
to continue writing
about the border?

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.840
You said you've done
it for so long,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.140
are you just going
to -- is it --

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
I can't stop.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.740
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.040
[ Laughter ]

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.340
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
I can't stop.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.640
And when this book came
out, I mean, this --

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.500
there were so many
transformative things

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.800
for me in doing this book.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.640
I've never suffered
so much for a book.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.710
I just cried and cried,
you know, writing it,

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.080
envisioning my brother in his
demise and those tender moments

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.830
between us at the end.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.710
But I was really afraid because
I thought, oh, man, you know,

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.100
I've written this
picturesque novel

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.470
and clearly some characters
are based on family members,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.150
and they are going to
give me such a rough time,

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.830
and they're going to be
offended and all this stuff.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.580
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
And did they?

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.880
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Well...

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.180
[ Laughter ]

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.040
The book tour -- this is the
first time I've had a book

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.530
that's hit, like, an
avalanche in my life, you know.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.830
And we were on tour.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.730
I always go with my wife because
I just can't take it anymore,

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.390
so we do it together.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.950
But yeah, we went
back to San Diego,

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.560
and there were 300 people jammed
in the book store [laughs].

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.640
And there were people outside
looking through the windows.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.240
And my family was there.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.000
And they all go their
old suits, you know,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.350
and they sat in the front row.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.990
And it was really cute
because as I was reading,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.290
they were holding my book up,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.090
like I didn't know
I'd written it.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.240
[ Laughter ]

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.520
Right? And my brother named
Octavio [assumed spelling],

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.930
he's another kind of a Lothario,
you know, another playboy,

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.150
and he always has
new girlfriends.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.450
And he was sitting there

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.030
with this really
befuddled looking woman.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.770
And my whole reading, he's
pointing to her saying,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.570
my girlfriend, that's
my girlfriend.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.140
So after it was done,
the family came up to me.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.640
And I have a nephew who
is very much the model

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.530
for Lalo [assumed spelling]
in the book, the crazy boy.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.290
And I thought, oh,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.590
what's Juanito [assumed
spelling] going

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.890
to think, you know.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.550
And he came up to me and he
was looking around the store

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.900
and he said, Tio,
you've made thousands

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.160
of people love my family.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.460
Oh! Right?

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.870
Next thing he says
[snaps] this quick is,

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.670
so who's playing me
in the movie, dog?

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.300
[ Laughter ]

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.600
And I said, that's not you.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.400
And he said, yeah, it is.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.080
[ Laughter ]

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.090
So it's really cool that you can
do that and fear their response

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.370
but have it be a gift to them.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.670
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
So would you --

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.970
so who would play in the movie?

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.270
[ Laughter ]

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.570
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
I don't know.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.870
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
Who would you cast?

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.170
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: It's got
to be a wild man to play Lalo.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.470
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.770
That'd be fun.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.070
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
We've sold it, you know.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.370
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah?

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.670
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
We've sold it to Hollywood.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.970
Yeah, I think it
may be a series.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.270
We don't know yet.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.570
It'd be better as a series --

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.870
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.170
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: --
like, on Netflix or something

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.470
so that -- you know,
the producer wants

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.770
to do ten episodes so that
he can get deeply into all

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.270
of the stories and not rush
it through a two-hour film.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.620
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Would
you want to be involved in,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.670
like, all those decisions?

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.970
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh, yeah.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.450
[ Laughter ]

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.290
Yeah, I think I might get
a hand in writing some

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.590
of them, so that's good.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.870
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: And what
about -- who would play you?

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.170
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Me?

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.470
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Yeah.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
It ain't me.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.070
That's Little Angel.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.370
[ Laughter ]

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.670
But my experience
informs his experience.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.140
But, you know, who
would play me?

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.440
I don't know.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.740
Oh, you know, Lin Manuel,
somebody like that.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.040
[ Laughter ]

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.380
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Ah.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.870
There you go.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.840
You know, in the book,
Big Angel has a notebook

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.830
and he writes all the things
that he's grateful for.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.130
Do you have a notebook, or do --

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.010
what are some of the
things you're grateful for?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.710
[ Laughter ]

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.320
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Look!

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.630
[ Laughter ]

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.840
I mean, every time I see an
audience, especially like this,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:54.610
I think, dude, you were
up at 3 a.m. on the floor

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:58.140
of your bedroom in
your boxers listening

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.550
to Leonard Cohen writing
really bad poems in a notebook.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.850
And now look!

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.150
[ Laughter ]

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.450
So I'm really grateful.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.440
You know, I'm grateful
for a lot of things.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.920
I can't believe that I've
been given this blessing.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:17.020
I can't believe that
somebody like me

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.470
who can't write a good
plot and can't figure

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.920
out a good commercial book
[laughs] has kept publishing

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.310
books and had so many
people read them.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.970
You know, after so many
disastrous relationships

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.510
in my family to have a,
you know, a great marriage

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.920
and happy, healthy kids.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.310
Our last daughter just
went off to college.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.240
I can't believe that.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.920
So I'm grateful for
so many things, yeah.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.720
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
I'm wondering,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.230
I heard that Ursula Le
Guin helped you out.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.530
What did she do?

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.190
How did she -- in
your writing career?

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.280
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
How're we doing for time?

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.580
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
We have...

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.880
[laughs].

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.180
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Ursula Le Guin.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.370
I was the first -- I think I
mentioned, I think, earlier --

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:10.040
the first one in the
family to go to college.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.460
And though my mother and father
were separated by then --

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.780
because he could not
control his player ways.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.140
He got caught, you know,
was sent packing by my mom.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:28.520
But he was so proud that I was
going to college that he went

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.210
to Mexico to get money.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.180
He'd been sending --
we know this story.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.980
He'd been sending money home
from his jobs for years.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:41.550
And he went back to Sinaloa, 27
hours, and he got $1,000 for me.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.500
And he drove back alone
27 hours and then crashed.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.660
And there's a lot
of implications

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.330
that really evil border
Mexican cops were involved

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.630
in that crash.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:57.480
And they had him, and he died
in their care after eight hours.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.520
And they sold me the corpse.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.810
They wouldn't let me bury
him, they made me buy him.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.000
And I was, you know, 19, 20,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.050
something like that,
and -- maybe 21.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.350
And I wasn't prepared.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.640
I didn't -- and I
was in college,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.670
and it was my senior year.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.900
And I had already
wanted to be a writer

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.890
and I was doing writing
workshops.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.530
And they had brought Le Guin
in as a visiting scholar.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.110
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Mm-hmm.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.940
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: And my
favorite English professor --

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.430
all I knew how to do
was write about it.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.120
And I wrote a piece about
it, and he took it to her.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.320
And she immediately accepted
me into her workshop,

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.460
which was a big surprise to me.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.540
And then she took
it for publication.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.110
It was my first sale.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:49.190
And she took on the
job of coaching me

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.490
in how to be a writer.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.040
She taught me manuscript format.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.340
I didn't know anything.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.950
You know, she told me --

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.970
you know, she used to call me
Luisito [assumed spelling].

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.600
You know, Luisito, you have
to actually type these things.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.150
You can't just print
them out on blind paper.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.640
But I didn't have a
typewriter, I was too poor.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.060
You know, and she guided
me through so many things.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.440
She was so cool.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.780
This was long enough ago
that I got to take her

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.360
to the first time
she saw Star Wars.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.660
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.210
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: How
cool -- and she was tiny.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.030
And back then, she
used to smoke a pipe,

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.330
which I thought was really hip.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.630
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Oh.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.930
[ Laughter ]

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.230
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: And she
drank whiskey in a square glass.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.790
I thought, this woman's,
like, the coolest person.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.050
[ Laughter ]

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.320
And she would sit
sideways in the seat.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.090
Like, if you went to the
movies, she was so small,

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.030
she could sit sideways
in the seat.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.330
And she was leaning over

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.510
and explaining the science
errors in the movie.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.040
[ Laughter ]

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.340
Which I didn't know
at the time was going

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.520
to be a cherished thing.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.940
And she was the one who was
like, you're very much a boy.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.520
You know, it's time for you
to get into some feminism.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.870
I'd say, OK, whatever you say.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.680
You know, she guided
me and scolded me.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.220
And she used to call herself my
Tia Osa, my Aunt the She Bear.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.220
You know, so she
was always around,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.850
and she taught me
a lot of stuff.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.090
She once said to me that, you
know, writers are the raw nerve

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.790
of the universe; that everybody

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.900
out there's forgotten
what it means to be human,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.310
so we have to go out there, feel
it for them, and then come back

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.160
and tell them what it felt like.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.660
And that really stuck with me.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.960
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Wow.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.260
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
That was amazing.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.560
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
That is amazing.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.860
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yeah.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.160
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: That is.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.460
I wanted to -- should
we open it?

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.760
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Sure.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.060
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Because
I'm sure there's some folks --

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.360
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yeah.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.660
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco:
-- that might want to --

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.960
anybody want to ask a question?

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.980
There's some microphones
up here.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.280
Is there somebody?

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.580
I can't see.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.880
It's so bright.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.510
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.880
I just want to say that I felt
it was a privilege to read this

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.760
because it felt so much like you
were telling your true story.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.060
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Oh, thank you.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.110
&gt;&gt; And I absolutely loved it.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.990
So I'm glad I could
come and hear you today.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.290
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Thank you so much.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.670
I appreciate it.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.860
Yeah, it's kind of
funny because, you know,

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.420
I have to find the
things I made up.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.440
Because people ask me, you know,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.200
is there really a kid
named Ookie [phonetic]?

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.360
I say no, no, I made him up.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.070
And then I seem like
a genius to them.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.370
They go, wow.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.660
But almost everything
in that book is inspired

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:33.480
by something I saw or heard
about or actually knew.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.200
For example, my favorite
passages in the book are

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.890
when the brothers are lying
in bed together talking.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.370
As Juan is sort of
-- Juan -- see --

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.880
as Big Angel is sort of dying.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.130
And that was my brother and me.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.840
At that farewell party,
he was very tired,

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.590
and they put him in bed.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.430
And then he'd call
me to come back,

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.300
get my brother, get my brother.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.590
And when I first went back
there -- he was always a --

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.050
not a standoffish man,
but a very contained man;

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:07.330
not a hugger, not a kisser,
never said I love you.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.100
And he said, get in bed.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.400
And I said, what?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.700
He said, come on, get in bed.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.420
And I thought, oh my
-- get in bed with you?

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.720
So I was lying there in bed

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.020
and we were both looking
at each other like...

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.320
[ Laughter ]

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.690
And he was tiny.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.780
You know, hadn't been tiny.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.100
And we had these
beautiful conversations.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.190
And I think the conversation
that kicked off the book I put

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.860
in the book when he said to me,
hey [speaking Spanish], he said,

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.900
I'm lying here thinking
about things.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.990
And I just realized
if you turn 74,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.760
you've only seen
Christmas 73 times.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.060
He said, that's not enough.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.160
And he said, so I
got a question.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.460
I said, what?

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.040
And he said, do gringos
kiss each other?

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.940
And I said, gringos
kiss each other?

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.240
You mean, like, in the movies?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.150
He said, no, in families,
do Americanos kiss?

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.090
And I said, sure.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.170
[ Laughter ]

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.990
I said, yeah, I'm sure -- yeah!

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.290
I mean, kiss your mom, right?

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.500
And he said, no,
moms don't count.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.270
If you don't kiss your
mom, you go to hell.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.520
[ Laughter ]

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.140
I said, oh.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:17.660
Yes, I've seen dads kiss their
sons, of course, yeah, sure.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.000
So we were just lying
there, and he's looking

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.300
at me and looking at me.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.600
And I said, what, you
want me to kiss you?

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.400
[ Laughter ]

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.510
And he said, no, psh, no...yeah.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.120
[ Laughter ]

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.660
So I kissed him on the
forehead, you know.

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.730
We're like, that wasn't so
bad, that was OK, that was OK.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.460
And that was the first and
last time I ever kissed him.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.980
So that, I think aside from
just the tumult of the party,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.210
that moment, I think, really
kicked off the book for me.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.030
And I wanted people
to feel it, you know.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.920
I wanted my brother
to be their brother.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.410
Especially perhaps
in this era we're in.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.510
You know, try to do
some subversive work.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.340
[ Laughter ]

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.780
Hi.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.080
&gt;&gt; Hola, Luis.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.540
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Hola.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:13.830
&gt;&gt; Hola. You have written and
won awards for being a poet

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.430
and an essayist and
fiction and nonfiction,

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:25.480
and now you may be entering in
the TV, Netflix, Hulu universe.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.110
And I always have a
million questions for you.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:32.670
But the one I really wonder
right now is how you can be

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:37.100
subversive in a new context,
how you make those shifts

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.520
from writing poetry to
writing prose to writing memoir

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.510
and being the raw
nerve of the universe.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:51.640
How can you spread that
love and hope in Netflix?

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.220
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Wow.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.020
Well, I'm a genius, you know.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.110
[ Laughter ]

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.410
I don't know.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.190
Eudora Welty said something
along these lines that out

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.310
of love you can write or
speak with sheer fury.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.180
And, you know, I thought either
I'm consumed by the rage I feel

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:17.420
or I try to deal with
love in the work.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.840
So that was a motivating factor.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.600
But also, because I came from,
you know, working-class roots.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.080
I mean, my mother would
be appalled to hear me say

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.380
such a thing, but it's true.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.270
I mean, my dad worked
in bowling alleys.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.670
I spent my boyhood in the back
of bowling alleys climbing

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.330
around Brunswick pin
tending machines,

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.300
running on the catwalks.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.540
I had a little plastic
gun playing James Bond.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.420
I was, like, shooting bad guys
in my mind and they were falling

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.830
to be killed by flying
bowling pins

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.960
in the...and I watched
my father build things

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.650
and I watched my
father repair things.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.380
And I thought, well, I want
to be a writer, so you know,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.540
it may be like being a
carpenter or something, right?

00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.930
You've got to learn everything.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.860
And I loved all of it.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.160
I loved poems.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.200
I loved songs.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.770
You know, when I realized
Leonard Cohen actually typed

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.300
books of poems and
novels, too --

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.020
you know, and Jim
Morrison typed out poems,

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.070
I started experimenting
with all that.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.400
But I thought one had to,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.190
like a good carpenter,
learn all the tools.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.750
And I did not realize
until college that people,

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.050
you know, specialized.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.350
And I thought, you posers.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.070
[ Laughter ]

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.370
Especially in the
'70s in San Diego.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:36.900
The poets, all of them wore
black turtlenecks, you know,

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.260
held their cigarettes like this.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.320
[ Laughter ]

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.620
That wasn't for me.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.570
So I wanted to write everything.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.680
And I think the other
part of it is, you know,

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:54.820
the flippant answer is if you
imagine the melancholy beauty

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.670
of dew on a sunflower --
it's probably a haiku,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.950
not an 800-paged
novel, so it tells you.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.280
And a lot of times, things
tell you what they want to be.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.110
Hummingbird's Daughter started
out to be a history book.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.500
And then I realized at a
certain point that I had --

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.740
you can't footnote dreams.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.800
And the dreams were truer than
the actual written histories.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.080
So each book kind of
tells you what it wants,

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.110
sooner or later, if
you stick with it.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.070
And that's all I can tell you

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.400
because I don't have
any technique.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.640
I just hang on for dear
life, see what happens.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.940
&gt;&gt; Gracias.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.240
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Thank you.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.540
Hi.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.840
&gt;&gt; Hi, Luis.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.970
I read the Hummingbird's
Daughter and the Queen

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.140
of America, and I
love those two books.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Thank you.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.050
&gt;&gt; And I remember where
your [inaudible] told you

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.640
when you were doing your
research that you're a healer

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.050
because you write
about all these things.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.910
I would like to know if
you will write any more

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.670
about [speaking Spanish].

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:05.070
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
That's a good question.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.680
It was optioned a long time ago
for a film and they ran out --

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.930
you know, when they option
a book or a couple of books,

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.590
they option them for five
years and then have to re-up.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:22.180
But I think the issue became
-- so in these two books,

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.750
you take her from
birth to death.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.830
So what if it became a
series, how are we supposed

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.110
to continue a series
after she died?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.940
And being about the medicine
world and Yaqui mysticism,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.260
I was like, well, we
could write whole books

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.630
about her in the afterlife.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.030
And they were like, no.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.040
[ Laughter ]

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.340
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: Aw.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.640
&gt;&gt; But you could
write about her.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.060
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Well,
so much material, you know,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.200
came that I couldn't
put in the book.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.560
But there were no
bibliographies about her,

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.430
and I've got a gigantic
bibliography

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.140
after 25 years working
on that thing.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.440
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.740
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: So
I've often thought it would be

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.380
interesting to go back and
to tell some stories maybe

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.140
about my experience
of writing the book.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.940
Because once I entered
into her world,

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.720
really crazy things
happened to me.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.140
And, you know, I've been telling
writing students a lot --

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.890
because people are doing,
like, PhD things on it,

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.630
which I can't believe.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.440
But I tell them, you know, a
lot of the book was designed

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.590
as a handbook of initiation.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.360
And there's a lot of
hidden material in that book

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.930
about what it was to be
initiated on that path.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:31.030
And for example, the dreams
in the book are all dreams

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.160
that the medicine people
gave me in the series.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.940
And they actually formed kind
of the spine of that narrative.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.240
And the last dream
in the book --

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.510
which I won't tell in case
people haven't read it yet --

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.240
that came to me, and
I woke up sobbing.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.540
And I woke Cindy up and told
her, my studies are done,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.310
I've got to write it now.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.830
They took me all
the way to the end

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.430
of what they wanted me to know.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.660
And that's a really
amazing experience to have.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.570
But it was difficult.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.890
It took a lot of impossible
experiences to write it.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.520
And I don't think I have
the energy or the strength

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.180
to enter that world again.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.680
Though again, telling
a narrative

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.710
about the experience might
be interesting for readers.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.310
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Thank you.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.040
&gt;&gt; Mandalit del Barco: We just
have, like, two minutes left.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.340
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Oh, let's make it fast!

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.640
Hi.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.180
&gt;&gt; Hi. Just a very
short question, then.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.500
What inspired you to be a
writer in the first place?

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.190
And I know, you know, lots
of sons see their fathers

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.500
as role models and they follow
them in their profession.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.800
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
What inspired me to write?

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.380
&gt;&gt; But you in particular,
like, yeah.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.160
Was there a beloved teacher when
you were growing up or...yeah.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.000
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh,
it was just love of stories,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.490
you know, love of stories.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:46.330
And partially, you know, that
little experience I told you

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.740
about before of seeing
people that I loved

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.000
and worshipped being reduced.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.440
It was like watching
butter melt in a pan.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:00.120
These people just disappearing
into this clear fluid

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.540
in the heat of disdain.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.950
And so I was pretty
sure that, a,

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:10.040
I wanted to be a
Rockstar [laughs], but, b,

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.780
I wanted to tell those stories
before they disappeared.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.780
And, you know, like
all poor boys,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.640
I wanted to be rich and famous.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.550
And it took a while to realize
I just wanted to bear witness.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.200
So I think a lot of it came
from madness over books --

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.110
still crazy for books -- and
wanting to tell the story

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.620
of people who don't get
their story told...I guess,

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.920
including me.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.220
&gt;&gt; One quick follow-up.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.870
Like, what gave you the
confidence to write like that

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.580
and to know that you should
be a writer and to do it?

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.880
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Confidence?

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.180
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.150
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: It's
just more madness, I think.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.200
You know, you just have to
decide you've got to do it.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.500
You've got to do it.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.130
I always tell my students,
you know, I'm a bad professor

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.340
for you because I don't
care about your grade.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.690
I don't care if you get a PhD.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.940
I want you to get a
blackbelt in writing.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.510
Because it's a lifeway.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.680
It's my pathway to the sacred.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.500
And so I want you to walk
the road, whatever happens.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.800
And that was just -- you know,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.730
I couldn't -- I couldn't
not do it.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.200
I can't not go to the bookstore.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.950
I can't not get any new Mary
Oliver that comes out, you know?

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:21.250
Or -- right?

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.610
Oh, my God.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:27.590
And so it was that --
just passion, just love.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.940
I always wanted to be a
guitarist, but I had no talent;

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.330
and thank God, or I'd be in one

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.620
of those dad bands playing
bowling alleys instead

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.980
of writing books.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.040

thank you so much for --
