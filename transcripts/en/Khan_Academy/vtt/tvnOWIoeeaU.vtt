00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.890
Factor x squared
minus 49y squared.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.920
So what's interesting
here is that well x

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.620
squared is clearly
a perfect square.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.820
It's the square of x.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.150
And 49y squared is
also a perfect square.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.880
It's the square of 7y.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.090
So it looks like we might
have a special form here.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.590
And to remind
ourselves, let's think

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.200
about what happens if we take
a plus b times a minus b.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.780
I'm just doing it
in the general case

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.580
so we can see a pattern here.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.640
So over here, this
would be a times a,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.980
which would be a squared
plus a times negative b,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.210
which would be negative ab plus
b times a or a times b again,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940
which would be ab.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.010
And then you have
b times negative b,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.410
so it would b minus b squared.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.010
Now these middle two
terms cancel out.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
Negative ab plus
ab, they cancel out

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.030
and you're left with just
a squared minus b squared.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.780
And that's the exact
pattern we have here.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.300
We have an a squared
minus a b squared.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.890
So in this case, a is equal
to x and b is equal to 7y.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.570
So we have x squared minus
7y, the whole thing squared.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.607
So we can expand this as
the difference of squares,

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:18.190
or actually this
thing right over here

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.398
is the difference of squares.

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:21.090
So we expand this like this.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.514
So this will be equal to x
plus 7y times x minus 7y.

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:30.930
And once again,
we're just pattern

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.280
matching based on this
realization right here.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.345
If I take a plus
b times a minus b,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.270
I get a difference of squares.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.990
This is a difference of squares.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.570
So when I factor
it, it must come out

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.111
to the result of
something that looks

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:47.866
like a plus b times a minus b
or x plus 7y times x minus 7y.
