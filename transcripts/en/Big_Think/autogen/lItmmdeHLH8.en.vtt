yes I have begun several projects which
were never completed not necessarily

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860
were never completed not necessarily
 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.530
were never completed not necessarily
because they failed but because I got

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540

for example I began a project on the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140
for example I began a project on the
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.630
for example I began a project on the

did it really have to have that
 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.000
did it really have to have that
particular pattern and if the answer was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010
particular pattern and if the answer was
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.710
particular pattern and if the answer was
probably yes because it was unique to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720
probably yes because it was unique to
 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.140
probably yes because it was unique to

and then I devised a method for
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.469
and then I devised a method for
measuring the attractiveness of these

measuring the attractiveness of these

very light balsa wood and at each end of
the seesaw was a loudspeaker which could

the seesaw was a loudspeaker which could

the seesaw was a loudspeaker which could
be made to play artificial cricket song

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
be made to play artificial cricket song

towards the song the seesaw tilted and
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.809
towards the song the seesaw tilted and
made an electrical contact which was

shortly afterwards the computer would

shortly afterwards the computer would
change to making the song come out of

the other lot loudspeaker whereupon the
 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.680
the other lot loudspeaker whereupon the
cricket would turn around and walk the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
cricket would turn around and walk the
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.570
cricket would turn around and walk the
other way and then the seesaw were tilt

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
other way and then the seesaw were tilt
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.000
other way and then the seesaw were tilt
the other way so the number of tilts of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
the other way so the number of tilts of
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.130
the other way so the number of tilts of
the seesaw was a measure of the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140
the seesaw was a measure of the
 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.160
the seesaw was a measure of the
attractiveness of the song so I had it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
attractiveness of the song so I had it
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.750
attractiveness of the song so I had it
all set up to measure the rival

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
all set up to measure the rival
 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.339
all set up to measure the rival
attractiveness of different kinds of

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349
attractiveness of different kinds of
 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.080
attractiveness of different kinds of
song but then I can't remember what

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
song but then I can't remember what
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.509
song but then I can't remember what
happened and I switched to some other

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519
happened and I switched to some other
 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.430
happened and I switched to some other
piece of piece of research so that piece

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
piece of piece of research so that piece
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.979
piece of piece of research so that piece
of research was never actually done but

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989
of research was never actually done but
 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.979
of research was never actually done but
the apparatus that I developed and the

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
the apparatus that I developed and the
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.349
the apparatus that I developed and the
and the computer program as I wrote to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359
and the computer program as I wrote to
 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.690
and the computer program as I wrote to
sing like a cricket was all working now

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700
sing like a cricket was all working now

sing like a cricket was all working now
it's lost forever because it was done on

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859
it's lost forever because it was done on
 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.880
it's lost forever because it was done on
now outdated computers you can't get

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890
now outdated computers you can't get
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.800
now outdated computers you can't get
that kind of computer anymore and so

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
that kind of computer anymore and so
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.220
that kind of computer anymore and so
that's that's gone
