00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; There''s one last thing I want
to demonstrate with operators, and

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.350
that's how the increment and
decrement operators effect assignment.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.830
We'll start by creating a few variables.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.870
And we'll also create a variable
that adds all of these together.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.550
So, right now our total
pounds is equal to 4.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.920
Now, if I use the increment or decrement
operator in front of a variable,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.080
then it's applied before any other
operators in this expression.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.870
And that includes
the assignment operator.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.120
So, if we do plus, plus pounds of flour,
then our total pounds is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.790
now 5 because the increment
is applied before assignment.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.744
And we can check to see the new
value of pounds of flour,

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.810
which is 2 after being incremented.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.520
Now, if instead I move the increment or
decrement operator after the variable it

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.950
modifies, then it's applied after
the other operators in this expression.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380
And that, again, includes assignment.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.840
So, in this case, we've put the
increment operator after poundsOfflour

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.025
and our totalPounds is still
the original 4 pounds.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:01:00.305
But we can see that pounds of
flour has been incremented to 2.

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:04.105
It just happened after
the assignment of total pounds.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.755
So, you'll want to be extra careful
when you use these increment and

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.635
decrement operators
because of this nuance.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.465
So, I'd encourage you
to take some time and

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.905
play around with them on a playground
until you feel really comfortable.
