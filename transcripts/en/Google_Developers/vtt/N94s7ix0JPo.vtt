Hi, I'm Mendel,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.801
Product Marketing Manager
for Google Friend Connect.

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.067
With Google Friend Connect,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.834
you can easily add social
features to your site.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:10.133
This means your visitors
can engage more deeply

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.667
with your content
and with each other.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.534
Once you start
using Google Friend Connect,

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:17.400
your visitors will
be able to join your site.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.501
Instead of having to create

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.167
a new account
with a new password,

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.901
they're given
the option of signing in

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.901
with their existing Google,
Yahoo, AIM or OpenID account.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.634
This wall gadget
lets your visitors

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:32.467
post comments and start
a discussion on your site.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:33.901
With this rate
and review gadget,

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.868
your visitors
can leave a rating.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:39.501
New gadgets are constantly
being created by Google

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.667
and the OpenSocial
developer community,

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.834
so there's an endless number
of other social gadgets

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:45.667
you'll soon be able to add.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:49.133
Visitors can also engage
with other members of your site.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.334
They can find out
more about them

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:54.467
or choose
to make new friends.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:55.834
They can even
invite their friends

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:58.434
to come check out your site.

00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.567
And the best part is that

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.100
adding Friend Connect
to your site

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.334
takes no programming
whatsoever.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.434
Choose the gadgets
you want from our gallery,

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:08.868
copy and paste
a few snippets of code,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.334
and Friend Connect
does the rest.

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:14.200
So whether you run a blog,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
a fan site,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.133
a merchant site,

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.801
or a mashup,

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.801
your visitors can now
engage more deeply

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.434
with your content
and with each other.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.167
