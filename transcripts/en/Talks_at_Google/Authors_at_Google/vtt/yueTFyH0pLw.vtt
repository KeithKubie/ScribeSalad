00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.109
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.010
Thank you for your patience today.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.930
Today's guest at Authors at Google New York
is Caleb Scharf, who is the director of Columbia

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.480
Astrobiology Center.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.699
He writes “Life, Unbounded” Blog for Scientific
American and has written for New Scientist,

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.880
Science and Nature among other publications.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.689
Let's see, he is, has served as a keynote
speaker for the American Museum of Natural

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.730
History and the Rubin Museum of Art and is
the author of 'Extrasolar Planets and Astrobiology'

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.070
and the winner of the 2011 Chambliss Astronomical
Writing Award.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.010
Ladies and gentlemen, Caleb Scharf.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.010
[Applause]

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Thank you very much.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
Oooh.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
Wow.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.190
[Laughs]

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.429
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: I guess it's loud enough.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.929
Thanks.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:00.170
So I'm gonna talk to you a little bit today
about a story.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.830
And it's a story related in this book and
I'm gonna give you a little piece of that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.290
story today.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.650
And it's really a story about strange things
in astrophysics and the universe around us.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.010
And, in particular, it's about how some of
the most bizarre and fantastical phenomena

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.530
in the universe turn out to be surprisingly
important.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.300
Turn out to be things that matter, conceivably
to us.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.640
They turn out to have a strong influence on
the particular cosmic environment that we

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.530
find ourselves in.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.080
And I think it's, this story in particular
is somewhat unusual.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.870
Oh, there's two mics, that's why it's louder
here.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: And as much as, this all begins

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.210
with a theoretical conception that happened
more than 200 years ago.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.900
It was a pretty outlandish theoretical conception
200 years ago and it remained so until really,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.739
very recently.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.230
So let me tell you a little bit about this
today and I'll try to keep this to the 45

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.890
minutes and then if anyone has extra questions
I have some extra slides at the end.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.190
The story begins here.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.750
Not really the place you'd expect a story
of astrophysics and cosmology to begin.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.410
This is a Michael's Parish Church in West
Yorkshire in England and the reason the story

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.460
begins here is because of this guy, [clears
throat] Reverend John Mitchell.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.510
So John Mitchell was a very interesting character.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.510
We know a certain amount about him but not
as many details as we should for someone of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.960
his stature.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.569
Because before John Mitchell was the Reverend
John Mitchell running this little church in

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.810
England he was actually a renowned scientist
at the University of Cambridge in England.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.220
And this is back in the 1700s.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.069
He was one of the people who founded modern
seismology, for example.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.959
He's also someone who, together with Henry
Cavendish, created a special type of balance

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.090
that enabled them to make the first accurate
measurement of the Earth's gravitational field,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.790
gravitational acceleration at the surface
of the earth and, therefore, deduce the mass

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.490
of the earth or the weight of the earth.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.709
Why he ended up as a Reverend, we don't actually
really know.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.880
Perhaps this was a more stable, better paying
job than being an academic at Cambridge.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.490
[chuckles] That's true, a lot of human history
to be in the church you were probably better

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.380
off than doing other things.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.459
Now Mitchell, while he was Reverend of this
church, got interested in other things.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.950
He got interested in astronomy.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.540
And one of the things he became particularly
fascinated with, was the idea that objects

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.769
like stars could imprint something about themselves
on the light that came to us from them.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.770
Now this sound, if you are at all familiar
with modern astronomy that sounds trivial,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.400
of course that's true.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.120
But at the time this was quite a revolutionary
concept.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.360
And he gave a presentation in 1783 at the
Royal Society in England where he discussed

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360
these ideas.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.539
And, in particular, he discussed the idea
that he had based on Newton's physics which

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.949
was that if a star has gravity and if light,
as this is the way people thought about light

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.809
at the time, if light is slowed down by the
effect of gravity, in other words people were

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:57.809
thinking about light just as you think about
throwing tennis balls or baseballs, particles

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.810
of light would get slowed down by gravity.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.990
I know this isn't the case but at the time
they didn't know this.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.409
He made the suggestion that well, stars are
big, that gravity ought to slow light down.

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.089
[Clears throat]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: So, if we could measure the

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.219
velocity of light that was being emitted by
stars towards us we would have a measurement

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.249
of the star's mass.

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.779
It was a very clever idea.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.900
It wasn't quite right but it was very clever.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.300
What was really brilliant was that he took
this to the extreme.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.300
He said, "Well, what happens if you have a
star so massive, so enormous that it slows

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.069
light all the way down to a stop?"

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:45.559
So Mitchell actually came up with an idea
that was later called "the dark star."

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:55.110
So he suggested, and this is a small quote
from what he said at this meeting in 1783,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.009
a truly enormous star, perhaps 500 times the
size of the sun, would be so big that it could

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:06.300
slow down light altogether to a stop and you
would never actually see that star.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.259
It would drop out of view.

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:15.550
Now, this was very, very interesting except
nobody paid any attention for another 100

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.789
plus years.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.069
What happened then was Einstein.

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.650
And this is a very crude overview of Einstein's
general relativity.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.050
I'm sure some of you are much more familiar
with this than I am.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.839
Einstein came along and, in 1915, he produced
his general theory of relativity.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:49.719
So what Einstein realized was that what we
had thought of as gravity wasn't quite right.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:56.009
Gravity is really a consequence of what mass
does to space around it.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.779
Mass distorts space and time around it.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:04.090
A very common way of thinking about this,
and it's not a bad analogy, is to think of

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.189
a rubber sheet, and I'm sure you've heard
this, this is a very, you know, I couldn't

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:14.689
think of a more exciting analogy that worked
as well so I'll use it, it's a very old analogy.

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:20.919
Think of a rubber sheet representing space,
three dimensions of space collapsed to two

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:21.919
dimensions.

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.119
If you put a weight in that rubber sheet it
will distort, it will bend down.

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:32.749
And Einstein realized that this was a more
accurate description of what mass does to

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:37.270
space around it and that gravity is simply
a consequence of objects trying to follow

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.120
the shortest path in this distorted space
in time.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.539
The mass pulls space around it.

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:49.419
It bunches it up around itself and it stretches
it down towards itself.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.960
This is just a silly little illustration to
show that.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.779
Now with space it's stiff but flexible.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:03.279
It actually takes an awful lot of mass concentrated
into a very small region to make an appreciable

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:06.080
distortion in space.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.789
And at the same time Einstein produced his
theory of general relativity, almost immediately

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:15.179
it came out, people started applying it.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:20.770
And one of the first applications was made
by someone called Karl Schwarzschild, he actually

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.919
did this from the Russian front, he was in
the German army in World War One and I guess

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:29.119
this was a good distraction.

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:38.360
He used Einstein's relativity to produce equations
describing what would happen around the simplest

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.810
sort of object you could imagine, a sphere
of mass.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:49.060
And Schwarzschild sent these solutions to
Einstein and it became apparent in these solutions

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.740
that you could have extreme versions of space
distortion.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.380
If you pack enough mass into a small enough
volume, if you make it dense enough, it will

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:09.199
pull space inwards, distort it to such an
extent that ultimately, that object can create

00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:11.959
what we call an event horizon around itself.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:18.740
An event horizon is simply a place where the
curvature of space, the distortion of space,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.800
is so extreme that light itself can't escape
from there.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.490
Now, this stage, everyone knew that light
had the same velocity no matter what.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.300
So the event horizon is all about stretching.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.889
If you try to have, or if light tries to escape
from within this event horizon it is stretched

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:42.829
to such an extent that you never see it in
the external universe.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:48.601
Now there are all sorts of other fascinating
aspects to this but I'm gonna skip most of

00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.300
those and focus on something very particular.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.509
So here was Mitchell's idea again but there
could be objects that were so massive, in

00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:02.130
this case so massive and so dense, that they
would essentially vanish from view.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.850
They would drop out of normal existence.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:10.269
'Cause light is the ultimate measuring tool
and, so, if light can't escape nothing else

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:11.269
can either.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:15.500
Also other things happen when event horizon
time slows down, for external observers and

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.500
so on.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.259
So it's a very interesting concept and it
was a very theoretical concept.

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:23.670
Einstein hated it; in fact, Einstein did not
like this idea.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.640
He felt like it was nonsensical.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.180
The universe couldn't conceivably, actually
make such objects.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.459
Yes, the equation said you could but there
was no way the universe could do this.

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:41.699
Let me just show you a little movie just to
illustrate this most simple of all event horizons,

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:44.040
what became known as black holes.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.040
Mitchell's dark stars transformed into black
holes.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.720
That's a whole other story as well but involves
a great deal of scientific work to convince

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.490
everyone these things could be real.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.430
So here's a little movie just for fun and
it's, it's, it's accurate, scientifically

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.430
accurate.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.860
What you'll see is a small journey into a
black hole and you'll see the event horizon

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.370
as a dark object and there's a red grid on
it.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:18.300
That red grid is purely for artistic effect
just to show you the distortion of light.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.830
Because what a black hole does more than anything
else in the universe is distort light around

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.830
it.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.399
It acts a bit like a lens.

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:29.990
So you'll see light in all sorts of peculiar
circular patterns around this object and it's

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.949
because the light is being wrapped around
and around close to the event horizon before

00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:34.949
it gets to you.

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:37.840
So you actually see multiple images of what's
behind us.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.819
Let me just set that in motion.

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.339
And it's really just to give you a feeling
for this.

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:47.170
What you'll see, you'll begin to see this
grid black hole.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.440
And you'll notice, you can see both North
and South Poles of the event horizons cause

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.589
the light is bent around.

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:56.040
So there's no place to hide around a black
hole.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.160
You will be seen no matter where you are cause
the light coming from you will get bent around.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:07.589
Now, pretty soon it's gonna hit, it's actually
gonna go in to, it's getting toward the photosphere

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:10.060
where light can actually orbit the black hole.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.759
Now it's gonna hit the event horizon in a
moment.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:18.519
Boom, there it goes into the event horizon
and the universe becomes extremely distorted

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:21.290
if you are looking out from that position.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.750
Okay, that's fun.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.750
This is good stuff.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.120
This is, sort of, you know, what you'd see
in science fiction and so on and there have

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.180
been many things written about the peculiar
way in which your perception of the world

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.180
would change if you dropped into a black hole.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.980
These objects are extremely compact.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.379
These objects would have to be extremely compact
to distort space and time as much.

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:50.560
I just show you three, a couple of quick slides
just to illustrate that cause it's important

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.980
for what I'm gonna show you next about the
real universe.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:00.990
The size of black hole event horizons, so
I picked this for a personal reason but it's

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.690
a small island off the coast of Europe.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: And what is interesting is

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:13.589
that the event horizon that the object creates
around itself is actually extremely small

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:19.120
and it's because space time gets distorted
to such an extent.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.930
So a black hole, an object containing ten
times the mass of our sun, squeezed inside

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.310
its event horizon, would only be 37 miles
across, so it'd actually just block out London

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:35.949
and the main road, the main highway that goes
around London which is called the M25 and

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:41.439
if you've ever been on the M25 the idea of
time slowing down at the event horizon is

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:42.439
writ large.

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:45.551
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Maybe some of you have or

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:49.230
it could be the beltway around D.C. as well.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:57.610
So a ten solar mass black hole is an astrophysically
plausible object but it would only be 37 miles

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.629
across, event horizon would only be 37 miles
across.

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:01.070
Let me just show you a couple more examples.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.579
And, again, this is relevant to what I'll
show you next.

00:14:03.579 --> 00:14:08.292
Let's go a bit bigger, what about 100,000
suns, I mean I haven't told you that these

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:10.560
things exist but let's just do it anyway.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.000
Well, 100,000 suns packed into an event horizon
would fit easily inside our sun.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.380
These are extraordinarily compact and dense
objects.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.129
If we go up in scale a little bit it's not
a particularly pretty picture.

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:29.819
Something 4 million times the mass of the
sun, there's a reason I'm using 4 million

00:14:29.819 --> 00:14:33.150
times mass the sun as you'll see momentarily.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.800
Something that size, the event horizon would
fit easily inside the orbit of Mercury.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.899
So on an astrophysical scale these things
are tiny given the amount of matter.

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:48.040
One last one, what about a billion times the
mass of the sun?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.980
Well we, oops, sorry, an object a billion
times mass of the sun would have an event

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.519
horizon that fits readily within the orbit
of Neptune in our solar system.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:06.579
Again, extraordinarily compact and that's
an important thing to remember.

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:15.699
So, we now know these things are real, at
least we're 99.9, maybe 9, percent certainty.

00:15:15.699 --> 00:15:22.269
And, in fact, the best example is the most
convincing examples are, indeed, these things

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:27.990
that are millions to billions of times the
mass of our sun.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.939
Let me show you one of the clearest pieces
of evidence.

00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:37.240
So what I'm gonna play for you is a tiny little
movie, a time lapse movie over a number of

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.880
years, of the motion of stars at the very
center of our galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.990
Now this is being cleaned up but what you
see is an accurate representation of the motion

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.389
of these stars and their relative brightnesses.

00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:54.930
So let me just run that, runs a little bit
then it zooms in.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:16:00.209
And you'll see things are kind of wiggling
around in the middle and you'll see one thing

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.569
gets a little bit of a kick.

00:16:01.569 --> 00:16:02.569
There it goes.

00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:03.810
Okay, lets zoom in on that.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.629
You can see the scale here; we're looking
at a region of space, maybe 10 to 15 light

00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:10.670
days across.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:19.610
Now there's a star in the middle of our galaxy
that has this rather dramatic orbit.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:25.190
It's dramatic because the point where it is
closest to something in the middle, can't

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.399
really see what's there, in fact it's very
hard to see what's there even with the best

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:33.730
telescopes, there isn't much light coming
from that apparent center point for these

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.380
orbits.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.559
The closest point to that center, this star
at its fastest motion in the orbit is moving

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:44.320
at about 3,700 kilometers a second.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.740
Just for comparison Mercury goes around the
sun at about 60 kilometers a second.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:54.750
What this tells us is that there is an enormous
mass packed into a tiny region from the very

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.750
center of our galaxy.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:02.420
If you do the numbers you find that it's about
4 million times the mass of our sun.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:09.010
We now think that this is a super massive
black hole living in the center of our galaxy

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:15.330
which is interesting and we'll come back to
that.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.850
That's not the only way we can spot these
things now.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:24.850
In fact, the most common way that we see signs
of black holes in the universe is because

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:32.210
they're not black at all or at least what's
going on around them is not black.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:38.010
When you drop matter into a black hole, it
gets torn apart, it gets shredded and it gets

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:43.250
accelerated and you can do it in all sorts
of different ways and you get the same outcome.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.150
Dropping something into a black hole means
it will accelerate eventually to close to

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.470
the speed of light.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.260
That's before it reaches the event horizon.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.720
So if anything happens to it along the way,
if it collides with something else, energy

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.910
can be released.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:03.550
The analogy I like to use is water going down
the plug hole in your bathtub and often it

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.920
makes noise, it gurgles, right?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.490
It's essentially the same process.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.470
The gurgling is the energy of motion that
the water, as it swirls around, being converted

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.480
into sound waves that bounce back out into
the room, okay.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.130
It's kind of the same thing that happens around
black holes, right, but on a much, much grander

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.130
scale.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.880
So matter falling into black holes doesn't
go quietly.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.270
That energy that it can produce in the form
of light, in the form of subatomic particles

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:40.560
cause you're tearing stuff apart and accelerating
it, spews back out into the universe.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.130
So a more realistic look at what happens as
you fall towards a black hole is represented

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.470
in this short movie.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:54.080
And I should say one other thing, most black
holes have spin.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.480
Okay, just like anything else, like a planet,
like a star, black holes spin.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.250
Now it's a very weird thing because you can't
really see the black hole, you just have this

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.820
event horizon.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.990
But because they have distorted space so much
they actually drag it around with them as

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.530
they spin.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:15.620
Like having a thick rug and you're pulling
it around, so the very geometry of space gets

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:21.060
pulled around with the spin of a black hole
and that means it is impossible to stand still

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.800
around a spinning black hole.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.620
So this just ramps up the acceleration of
matter that falls into a black hole.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:34.410
Black holes can actually have an electrical
charge and this gets very complex, one of

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:40.150
the most complex aspects of black holes but
it means that you can have additional mechanisms

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.580
that can accelerate matter.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.420
It's like having the large Hadron Collider
in a natural form except stuff doesn't just

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.790
go around in a ring, it can jet out.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.990
So let me just show you this movie and this
was, again, reasonably, as far as we know,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.800
a quite accurate representation.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.690
Now we're falling into a spinning charged
black hole that has matter around it, matter

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:09.930
that is, itself, falling in, getting accelerated,
getting torn apart and some of that energy

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.220
of motion is being converted to other forms
as the matter sort of gurgles down the drain.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.940
So, you can see the spinning black hole, you
see matter spinning around and it's also there

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:29.690
are jets or streams of accelerated particles
leaving from just outside the event horizon

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.110
and shooting back out into the universe.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.840
They're so accelerated that even gravity of
the black hole, outside the event horizon,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960
doesn't really slow them down very much.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.520
So that's a theoretical picture, I'll just
let it run a little bit, though all it does

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:48.000
is get very, very bright and then it stops.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.520
In the real universe we see this all over
the place.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.190
Let me put up a few images here.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:04.650
This is just a small selection of maps made
using radio telescopes that had targeted precisely

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.110
this sort of situation.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.410
You can probably see in some of these images,
and I'll show you more in a moment, that they're

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.840
tiny little bright specs and then there are
these red like streams or jets coming out

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:22.660
of them that then seemingly crash into something
in the intergalactic space and turn into these

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.550
great lobes of particles.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:31.050
What we're looking at is the cooling of electrons
that have been accelerated around super massive

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.020
black holes, just like a particle accelerator.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.270
As they cool down they emit radio waves and
radio admission.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:43.260
The size of these structures, again I'll illustrate
this a little bit more, but they're between

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.720
a few 10s of thousands of light years across
hundreds of thousands of light years across.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.810
They're absolutely enormous.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:58.840
To cut a very long story short, we now realize
that black holes that have matter falling

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.070
into them are actually capable of the most
efficient conversion of matter to energy in

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.420
the universe.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.850
You can produce energy this way even better
than nuclear fusion.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.790
In fact, in optimal cases it can be 50 times
more efficient at getting energy out of a

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.940
certain amount of matter than the equivalent
nuclear fusion.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.001
It's just gravity.

00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:27.980
Gravity is really potent and black holes,
because of their nature, are like a turbo

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.750
charged version of a normal gravity well.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.200
So this raises all sorts of interesting questions
Where's all this energy being produced by

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.200
black holes.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.790
They're not hiding away at all.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.361
Now they don't, not all black holes are in
this situation but a large number of them

00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:49.120
are and across cosmic time, across the last
13.8 billion years, this kind of thing has

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.170
gone on a lot.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.190
To show you a couple more examples, this is
particularly beautiful example, this is the

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:59.000
galaxy called M87, it's not too far away from
us.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.510
Now what you see here is this great yellowish,
greenish haze, or actually the stars of the

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.510
galaxy.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.790
You can't distinguish individual stars because
there are probably a few hundred billion stars

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:15.710
there and in the very center of this galaxy,
there is supermassive black hole eating matter,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:20.710
eating gas, eating stars, eating stuff and
it's generating one of these streams, one

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.120
of these jets of accelerated particles and
you can see it glowing.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:32.480
And it's glowing in ultraviolet light, and
again, it's these electrons being accelerated

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.650
and being shot across intergalactic space
going to stellar space and this structure

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.350
is a few 10s of thousands of light years across.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.510
They're really quite remarkable cause it looks
kind of tiny, right?

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.610
It looks like the sort of thing you might
see under a microscope but it's not that at

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.610
all.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.740
There's another example and it's just to show
you some pretty pictures.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.520
It's always one of the beauties of astronomy
as you have pretty pictures to show.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.010
This is a galaxy called Centaurus A and not
too far from us, it's kind of a messy galaxy

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:07.440
but I think you can see that on top and bottom
there's sort of strange plumes coming out

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.770
and there are two, there's a supermassive
black hole deep inside this galaxy, And, in

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.861
fact, we've discovered, the Milky Way is not
alone in having a supermassive black hole

00:24:16.861 --> 00:24:18.320
in its center.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.220
Pretty much every galaxy in the universe has
some kind of supermassive black hole in the

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.960
center, some of them even have more than one
which is another story but that's just to

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.450
tell you.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.470
Just to get back to this notion of scale,
cause I think it's very interesting and it's

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.600
quite astonishing, here's another galaxy.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:48.220
It doesn't look very interesting, it's about
600, yes, it's about 600 million light years

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:53.990
from us, it's called Cygnus A, this is a Hubble
space telescope image of it in visible light.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.940
It's kind of, it's a little distorted, mucky
looking thing.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:06.730
But let's put it in context, shrink it down,
now let's put that map of the stuff coming

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.790
from the black hole up.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:15.040
So I think you can see the black hole in the
center is producing a pretty big structure.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.760
That structure, end to end, is about 500,000
light years across.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:28.050
It vastly outreaches the size of the stars
and the galaxy, the visible part of the galaxy.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.900
And remember the black hole itself, this one
is about a billion or so solar masses would

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.870
fit readily inside our solar system.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:42.400
This galaxy probably has a hundred billion
solar systems in it so it's a tiny, tiny thing,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.760
it's like a bacterium suddenly inflating a
balloon the size of Manhattan.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:58.730
So, as we've learned more about this it's
raised a number of questions and a very interesting

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:04.350
question has been does this energy do anything
other than just make these extraordinary and

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.240
beautiful and majestic structures in the universe?

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.760
And this is something that we've really learned
a great deal about in the last 10 to 15 years.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:21.290
And what we've learned is starting to revolutionize
our vision of, not just black holes, but how

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:27.030
our whole universe comes to be the way it
is, how it evolves, how it changes with time.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:32.040
Let me just say a little bit about that.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.540
This is another galaxy and I'm showing you
this because it's one of those places every

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.560
so often something comes a long and it's like
finding that rare species that suddenly illuminates

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.470
the whole tree of life.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:49.660
You go, "Ah, that's what it is."

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.690
We've had this question, "How does energy
relate to everything that we see?

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.260
What does it do?

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.560
Okay, black holes are spewing energy out of
the universe, what does it do?"

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.410
Well, this is one great example that really,
for many people in this field, pinned it down

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.990
a number of years ago.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:13.890
This is another galaxy, this is a galaxy called
Perseus A; it's about 250 million light years

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.570
from us.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:24.581
Doesn't look too unusual, looked a little
messy, Perseus A is, like many galaxies, part

00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:27.420
of a greater collection of galaxies.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.490
Galaxies tend to come in what we call clusters.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:35.380
So Perseus A is actually in a system of a
few hundred to a few thousand other galaxies

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:41.100
that are all sort of gathered together across
a ten million light year region.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:47.130
And in these situations, these are kind of
the mountains in the distribution of stuff

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.360
in our universe.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:57.470
In these places the galaxies are typically
surrounded by very hot gas, gas between the

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.090
galaxies, it's like an atmosphere surrounding
them.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:05.640
It's very, very tenuous, to us it would be
like vacuum but on these large scales it's

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.880
quite substantial.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.810
And this gas is very, very hot and you can
see it because it cools down by admitting

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.810
x-rays.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:21.730
It's just a hot version of things, it's hotter
than your typical incandescent lamp and so

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:27.760
the energy admitted by the atoms in it tends
to be in the x-ray part of the spectrum.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:33.020
We can make a map with that x-ray light and
kind of see the atmosphere surrounding all

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.310
of these galaxies at once.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.790
It's a really neat trick to be able to do.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:40.910
Luckily, we now have instruments that can
do this.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:46.240
So let me show you that x-ray map, okay, it
may look a little odd to start with so I'm

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.150
gonna explain what's going on here cause this
is, I hesitate to call it a Rosetta Stone

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:58.120
but it definitely was something when we saw
it, it kind of changed everyone's view.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.040
So the galaxy is in the middle here, you can't
really see it because we're looking at x-ray

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.340
light.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:13.480
What you can see is that this hot atmosphere
surrounding these galaxies is far from uniform,

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.740
there's all sorts of interesting structure
in here.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:22.690
There is a supermassive black hole in the
center of that galaxy, Perseus A, and it's

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.650
doing what all the others tend to do when
they get fed, it's shooting out jets of material

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.390
and great clouds of subatomic particles.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.650
Except in this case cause it's inside the
structure.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:40.220
You see these darker regions, there are a
few dark patches some of them even far out,

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.920
those are bubbles.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:50.320
Those are literally bubbles inflating these
holes inside this atmosphere just as if you've

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.950
taken a straw and put it in a milkshake, right,
like annoying people do, well, my children

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:05.460
do and the highly energetic material coming
from around the black hole literally inflates

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.020
bubbles in this atmosphere and the bubbles
are buoyant.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.330
This is a gravitational system so it's just
like a bubble in a milkshake or a bubble in

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.230
the ocean floats up.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:23.120
And you can see that there are darker patches,
there's one in the upper right hand side there

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.430
that's floating up through this atmosphere.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:32.170
It's on a scale of hundreds of thousands of
light years and the time scale of which the

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.280
black hole burps these things out is on a
similar scale, a hundred thousand years, maybe

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.870
a million years.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.760
Every time it gets fed it does this.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.490
You may be able to see something else in here
and I should say this gas, okay, what this

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:54.480
gas really wants to do is cool down and make
new galaxies and make new stars.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.750
It's trying to do that but the black hole
is disrupting it.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:05.250
You may be able to see, it's always hard with
this image, I try not to manipulate it too

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.870
much but there are sort of ripples in this
image, concentric ripples coming from the

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.260
center, very subtle features.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.930
Those ripples are sound waves that are set
in motion by these bubbles.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.600
The sound waves spread out across the whole
system.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.240
The sound waves, peak to peak, are maybe a
hundred thousand light years.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.110
So the pitch of these sound waves is about
57 octaves below human hearing.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:41.420
A very deep note being played by a black hole
and the power being output in the sound wave,

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.430
the power being converted into these sound
waves, a trillion, trillion, trillion watts

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.770
roughly, 10 to the 37 watts.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:55.720
Okay, and that's being propagated out across
about a million years, light years, of space.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:03.820
That energy is helping moderate what this
atmosphere does; it's actually helping prevent

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.170
this gas from turning into new stars and galaxies.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:13.840
What this means is that, and this happens,
actually, in more than 70 percent of structures

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840
like this.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.730
You can find a cluster of galaxies anywhere
in the universe you'll see this happening

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.500
more often than not.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:28.470
So this really convinced many of us that supermassive
black holes are playing a very important role

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:35.670
in regulating the way in which the universe
makes stars and makes galaxies.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:44.780
But this is still relatively nearby so the
question was, "Is this happening early on?"

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.570
If it's happening early on then it means that
black holes and the galaxies and stars have

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.810
this intimate relationship that we hadn't
previously understood.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.612
Well, it turns out that it does.

00:32:55.612 --> 00:32:59.580
And I have to show you this cause it's one
of my favorite things.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:06.640
This is the work I did so I have to show you,
I'm very proud of it cause it really, for

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.630
me at least, convinced me, it doesn't look
very impressive but it maybe it will be once

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.480
I tell you what it is.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.170
So here's a sort of murky looking thing in
the center here, you can ignore the bright

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:23.140
thing in the upper right hand side that's
just an annoying star that got in the way.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.650
What we're looking at is a teenage galaxy.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:34.970
This is an object, this image was made using
one of the giant Keck telescopes in Hawaii,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.090
it's a seven hour exposure time.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.240
If you think when you take your digital camera,
right, that's a tiny fraction of a second

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.410
to get full exposure, it's seven hours worth
of exposure time.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:54.160
What we're looking at is the ultraviolet light
coming from a baby galaxy or teenage galaxy

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.760
that light has been traveling towards for
12 billion years.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.020
So it's way, way back pretty much at the dawn
of formation of evolution of galaxies.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:09.720
Our question was, "Okay, that's fabulous but
is there a supermassive black hole there 12

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720
billion years ago?

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.560
Was it there, was it doing anything?

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.960
Could it have played a role in the late evolution
of this system? Cause this system will end

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.030
up looking like the things we see today.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:28.040
So, what we did was we used an x-ray telescope,
in fact we used NASA's great observatory called

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.379
Chandra which is an orbiting x-ray telescope
to do x-ray astronomy from space cause the

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:41.810
atmosphere blocks most x-rays, so we looked
for high energy phenomena, we looked for signs

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:50.440
of these sort of subatomic particle acceleration
black holes are so good at and we saw this.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.990
We saw a great mess of stuff.

00:34:54.990 --> 00:35:01.030
This image, actually I should confess, this
image contains 150 photons of light.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:06.630
So it's not a particularly impressive image
but it took 40 hours to get those 150 photons

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:13.430
and each one of those 150 photons took 12
billion years to get to us.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:21.070
What it shows is a super matter black hole
doing exactly what it does in today's universe.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:27.300
it's spewing out these jets, these streams
of energetic particles which is why this blue

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.620
thing is sort of elongated.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.700
Now there are many technical aspects of this
but it turns out that because the universe

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:40.810
itself was smaller 12 billion years ago, more
compact, the universe is expanding, right,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.160
if you go back in time it was smaller.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:50.200
It turns out that shrunken scale of the universe
means that the way in which the energy pouring

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.050
out from around the black hole is converted
into other things was different than it is

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.050
today.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:01.060
In fact, we think that difference means the
black hole had even greater power over what

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.520
was going on in these teenage galaxies and
probably stunted their growth.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:12.530
Without this sort of phenomena, these galaxies
would grow to be vast enormous things, the

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:18.240
likes of which we don't see in the real universe,
so black holes turn out to be a critical component

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.350
kind of keeping things in line.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:24.410
They're like the ultimate gate keeper; you
can't make more stars, I'm sorry.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:28.010
It's finished and that's the role they play.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:37.820
So let me, I'm almost done with this piece
of the talk, I know questions would be fun.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.150
What we have learned, I've shown you a little
bit of some of the evidence and many other

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:48.680
aspects of this and many other extremely interesting
pieces of research.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:54.190
We now understand that super massive black
holes, now why they exist in the center of

00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:00.060
every galaxy I've skirted over cause we don't
entirely know the origin.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:05.340
We suspect that maybe the merger of black
holes, you take two small black holes you

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:10.670
make a bigger black hole and that keeps going
on, we're not totally sure about how they

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:18.110
grow but what we do know is that they are
intimately linked to properties of pretty

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.290
much all the galaxies we see around us.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:28.180
So, for example, these sorts of galaxies in
today's universe we find this remarkable relationship.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:34.130
If you measure the mass of the stars in the
middle of these galaxies which you could do

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:39.570
with various telescopic techniques and then
make an estimate of the mass of the black

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.940
hole in the middle, you find the black hole
is always about one thousandth the mass of

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.750
the stars, Now, no matter which galaxy it
is, it is a universal rule.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:56.640
I wish I knew why it was that [chuckles],
none of us do but it points towards a very

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.870
intimate relationship.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.460
But then there are places that don't follow
this relationship.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:09.400
Galaxies like these, and our galaxy is one
of these, you don't see this relationship

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.610
so it's very interesting.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.340
We're not sure what that means, yet.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:18.070
I have a few more questions, I have a few
more slides after that I can show you.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.920
Let me just finish up this piece.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:31.830
So to kind of wrap this up into a bigger vision,
where does it lead us, what does this mean?

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:37.120
Well, let's just think about the observable
universe for a moment.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.030
The observable universe by which I mean the
universe that we can see because light has

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:47.730
had time to get to us from its, from objects,
right, so it's about 13.8 billion years back

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.170
in time that we can see.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.240
The observable universe contains more than
a hundred billion galaxies.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.120
This is actually a rendering based on a real
survey of galaxies.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.960
So the positions and sort of general size
and shape of the galaxies is accurate.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:09.510
This is the universe around us, about 400,000
galaxies around us.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:14.850
The observable universe contains over 100
billion galaxies, maybe it's 300 billion,

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.480
maybe it's 400 billion but it's probably not
many more than that.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.310
So it's a finite number.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:29.150
These galaxies contain a finite number of
stars, maybe about 10 to the 22 stars, over

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.380
10 sextillion.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:39.830
I tried to work this out in Google numbers
but it didn't match up the entire time.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:49.310
It's a finite number, it's an enormous number
and it's a number, just a nice quote Carl

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.380
Sagan once said, "There are more stars in
the universe than all the grains of sand in

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.690
all the beaches on planet earth."

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.990
He's absolutely right.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.070
That's a finite number of grains which is
interesting.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.340
Why is it this number?

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.690
It's particularly interesting to me at least
because stars and the galaxies in them, but

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:15.560
the stars in particular, the stars are the
places that produce all the elements heavier

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.340
than hydrogen and helium.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:24.940
This is an old almost cliché thing to say,
the atoms of the carbon and oxygen and nitrogen

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.940
in our bodies were once millions of miles
down in the center of stars that are now long

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.940
gone.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.890
That's just how it was.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.600
It's true.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.300
Stars produce all the heavy elements.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:44.430
They produce things like planets, they produce
the chemistry of the universe and eventually

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.300
things like life, at least here on earth.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:55.990
So there is a connection between the actual
number of stars that the universe has produced,

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:03.360
has ever produced over its existence and the
richness of elements and the possibilities

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.380
for chemistry and for the environments of
life.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.630
So I'll stop with this slide, I have a few
more things I could say if anyone wants to

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.790
see it they can ask questions about that,
it'll take 5 more minutes and a couple more

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.340
slides, if not we can just go to other questions.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:25.340
But I think one of the most fascinating things
for me, and this is a particular topic in

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:32.369
the book, it's very speculative but it's very
interesting because these numbers of stars,

00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:37.750
numbers of galaxies, are clearly intimately
tied to the evolution of galaxies and super

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.750
massive black holes.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:43.350
Who would've thought, I know John Mitchell
didn't think this in the 1700s and I'm pretty

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:48.310
sure when Schwarzschild and Einstein were
fighting it out over whether black holes could

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:54.040
actually exist or not, anyone could conceive
that any such fantastical and bizarre objects

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:59.450
could have any real relevance to the nature
of the universe around us.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:05.770
But it seems that they do on some level and
our own environment, our own cosmic environment

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:06.910
is a product of all this.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:12.500
So it's a very interesting question, "What
is our link to black holes?"

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.380
So I can stop there, I have a few more slides
available if anyone is interested or we can

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.950
just go for general questions.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.390
Thank you.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.830
[Applause]
[Laughs]

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.480
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Questions?

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.140
Or shall I tell you the next little bit of
the story?

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Oh.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.790
&gt;&gt;male #1: One thing you were talking about
these particles of energy that were actually

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:46.890
streaming out of the black hole and you said
they were moving so fast that the black hole

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.990
couldn't trap them, does that mean they're
moving faster than light?

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.150
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: No but it's a good question.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:59.520
So I what I mean is that they are being, that
they're all leaving before they get to the

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520
event horizon.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:07.650
So all of this is happening close to but not
at the event horizon so anything that does

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:16.240
make it to the event horizon is gone, absolutely,
this is stuff that's going on maybe 2, 3,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:26.369
4 event horizons out, okay, and because of
that, yes, these particles they can be accelerated

00:43:26.369 --> 00:43:31.610
very close to the speed of light but obviously
nothing can travel faster than light and certainly

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.980
nothing with mass can be accelerated even
to the speed of light.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.060
It gets very close but not quite exactly.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:46.050
So, yeah, so again it's the analogy of stuff
going down the drain, you know, you hear the

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.590
sound, not from necessarily deep in the drain
but on the edge, on stuff where it's turbulent,

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.290
where it's getting mixed up.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:54.370
But yeah, that's a good question.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:44:01.080
&gt;&gt;male #1: So my other question was does the
rotation of the black hole have an impact

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.220
on the sort of flat spiral shape of the galaxy?

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.630
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: [chuckles] Yeah, so good question.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.940
I, you know, I think the answer is no.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.310
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: And the reason is that it's

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:19.550
on such a small scale compared to the grand
spiral structure of the galaxy.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:25.630
So our galaxy is about 100,000 light years
across and the spiral structures you see are

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:31.130
on a similar scale, they stretch for maybe
50,000 light years.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:37.120
The motion of the central supermassive black
hole is all happening, as I've shown, on a

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.550
scale of a few times the radius of our solar
system.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.480
So it's a tiny, tiny scale.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.869
Now, what is interesting is that people have
started to look to see whether, in cases where

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:54.530
we can observe the properties of the matter
swirling around the black hole, right, which

00:44:54.530 --> 00:45:01.150
is a kind of giveaway to the orientation of
the black hole, right, if it's spinning.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:05.310
People started to try to look to see whether
the orientation of the stuff swirling closest

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:10.990
to the black hole is the same as the orientation,
if it's a, if it's the galaxy like ours, a

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:16.830
spiral galaxy that has a definite plane of
motion, if that orientation is the same.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.950
And it looks like it's often close but not
always perfectly aligned and we don't quite

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:22.950
know why.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:28.350
Maybe sometimes in the formation process of
the super massive black holes they end up

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:33.320
being tilted and it's like a gyroscope, it's
very hard to untilt it.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:41.340
So, yeah, I mean it's, again, it's a very
good question cause you might readily feel

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.140
that there should be some sort of connection.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:48.520
It doesn't seem to be that there's a direct
physical connection because of the sheer difference

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.860
in scale and the scale in which the black
hole is dragging space around with it, that

00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:01.810
most extreme effect is also very small, it's
a few event horizons away from the black hole.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:07.930
Now the earth drags space around with it but
it's at a tiny level, people put up satellites

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:13.880
to measure this but it's a minute effect,
it's much greater around black holes but still

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880
kind of restricted.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880
Sorry.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thanks for coming.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.740
I'd read a theory that was speculating that
the event horizons of black holes could potentially

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.433
be like a big bang event, possibly creating
kind of a new universe in another dimension

00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:32.150
and I was just wondering your thoughts on
that and is there any way that we can eventually

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.010
prove or disprove that at this point?

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.010
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Right.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:43.090
Well, I'll confess that I'm not an expert
on the more esoteric aspects of this.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:50.420
People have long played around with equations
for objects like black holes and the interesting

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:56.150
thing about, you know, Einstein's description
of the distortion space in time is we have

00:46:56.150 --> 00:47:04.190
a mass, whether it's spinning or not, there
are, you can often find different mathematical

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.640
solutions for different bits, for different
regimes.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:14.230
So, for example, you find mathematical solutions
that you extrapolate easily across the event

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.369
horizon.

00:47:16.369 --> 00:47:22.670
I think it's true some of these solutions
indicate that maybe there's a sort of worm

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:27.900
hole, you go through the event horizon and
rather than end up in the middle of the black

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:34.450
hole there's actually a tunnel through space
or somewhere else or some other time or other

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.030
dimension or whatever.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:41.030
My understanding is that now people feel that
all those solutions are unstable, they're

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.030
inherently unstable.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.119
As soon as you put anything there it all collapses.

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:47.930
So there's no way you can, you know, go to
another universe.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:55.050
All the black hole can itself can be the progenitor
of the universe in some other parallel reality.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:48:02.119
So my feeling, my personal feeling is, cause
the other question that comes up is where

00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:03.650
does all that matter go?

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.540
Inside the black hole, what is it?

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:13.420
We know that, well, as far as we know there
is nothing that can support matter once it

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:18.460
enters inside its own event horizon because
particles would have to be moving faster than

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:25.160
light in order to provide the pressure needed
to stop something from just collapsing into

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160
nothingness.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.920
The thing about, people then say well, there's
a singularity at the center of the black hole,

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.670
point infinite density.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.530
That's what the general relativity equations
tell us.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:39.080
The trouble with the general relativity will
not work on a quantum scale.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.180
It's incomplete.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.160
It's a good description on large scales but
not a very small scale.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:49.740
At a small scale, space is granulate, at least
this is what we now believe it's because of

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:54.420
the quantum scale things are uncertain.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:59.640
So one picture that people have come up with
and certainly it comes out of string theory,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:06.270
is the idea that the center of the black hole
is effectively a very exotic and energetic

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:11.700
type of subatomic particle, that's what it
all comes down to, it's a string that's so

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:15.750
excited that its mass is 10 billion times
the mass of the sun.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:21.430
What's neat about that idea is that, and again
this is getting a little technical, but this

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.290
notion of Hawking Radiation.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:29.530
So, Steven Hawking purposed that black holes
can actually evaporate and, again, it's because

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.710
of quantum things going on close to the event
horizon.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.970
I won't go into it deeper but the short is
the black hole, if given enough time, will

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:38.850
eventually evaporate away.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.640
Just leave, it emits radiation, particles,
whatever.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.040
But then that begs the question what happens
if it evaporates all the way down to nothing?

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.090
What are you left with?

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.130
Cause everything happens in this event horizon.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:58.530
String theory kind of gives a sort of elegant
answer to that which is eventually you're

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.670
just left with a normal subatomic particle.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.369
Black hole evaporates, evaporates, evaporates,
it gets smaller and smaller and becomes microscopic

00:50:08.369 --> 00:50:13.240
and then it becomes some sort of exotic particle,
maybe a Higgs Boson, although it wouldn't

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:19.470
be a Higgs Boson, it would be and then eventually
it would just end up as a boring old electron

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.470
and that's it, it's gone.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:24.160
It just evaporated back to constituent subatomic
bits.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.490
Anyway, sorry, I'm not sure that really answers
your question.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:30.490
[Laughter]

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:35.660
&gt;&gt;male #3: So my question is that you were
speaking about how at the beginning of the

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:42.260
universe creation that there were these black
holes in the teenage galaxy you showed.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:47.869
So, I just previously thought that black holes
were formed because so much time passed that

00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:49.870
matter kind of collected.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:54.850
Is it more so that black holes were created
in the big bang and these supermassive black

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:58.150
holes especially or are they created just
with a lot of time passing?

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:03.350
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Right, it's a great question.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:08.660
We think that the majority of black holes,
I didn't really get into this cause I put

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:13.170
the emphasis on the supermassive version,
the majority of black holes actually are about

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:17.260
10 times the mass of our sun and there should
be thousands of those in our galaxy.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:22.770
They're produced all the time by the collapse
of very old stars.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:28.450
Stars burn through the nuclear fuel, once
they burn through that nuclear fuel they burn

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:33.860
elements, they fuse elements up to about iron
and that point it's a break even prospect

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:40.350
for generating energy and, so, fusion kind
of stops and the core of these stars tends

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.990
to collapse and we think, in many cases, can
make a small black hole, small meaning maybe

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:49.200
10 times the mass of our sun and that's been
going on forever.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:55.020
These giant things in the middle of galaxies,
I think, most people would say, are not related

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:59.600
to anything that might of happened in the
very, very early universe, right, in the exotic

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.150
mix of particles and quantum fields in the
very early universe.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:10.390
These are probably produced because the conditions
in the young universe before you had many

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:13.030
stars, were rather different than today.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:18.980
As soon as you begin to make heavy elements,
you change the way in which gas can accumulate.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:25.359
It has to do with, kind of esoteric physics
about cooling.

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:28.000
Heavy elements act like a coolant of gas.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.590
And the cooler gas can get the quicker it
can cool down and the more efficiently you

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.119
can make stars and galaxies.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:39.520
We think in the earlier universe things were
different because you didn't have all these

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.660
heavy elements so it might be possible to
get a single cloud of gas under its own gravity

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:53.280
could collapse to make a supermassive black
hole in a pretty short time, relatively short

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.180
time, 10s of thousands, 100s of thousands
of years.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.630
So one idea from where these super massive
black holes come from is the part of the kind

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.670
of seeding material for galaxies.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:09.710
They're not a necessary seed for a galaxy
but they're just part of the whole initial

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.260
process of making any of the structures we
see in the universe.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:20.840
So it's, yeah, so it, you know, it's kind
of probably not anything as exotic as some

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:26.440
remnant of, you know, quantum fields in the
early universe and probably more to do with

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.470
complex gas physics.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:39.700
If that answers the question.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.700
Any other questions?

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.460
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, you kind of mentioned these

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.280
plumes that these different black holes will
admit from galaxies.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.200
I was just wondering about our own galaxy,
if we can see any sort of a plume or anything

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.300
coming off?

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.520
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Ah, thank-you.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.620
Good question.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.590
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Let me show you, so I'll skip

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.910
through a couple slides to show you.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:06.010
So this has been an interesting question,
"What about our own galaxy?"

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.890
Now we had thought, until very recently, that
the super massive black hole at the center

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:16.330
of our galaxy was pretty quiet, it wasn't
getting fed much matter, it wasn't doing a

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.940
great deal.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.830
And that's been kind of interesting cause
it turns out we think our galaxy, and I'll

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:30.160
just go through this a little fast, our galaxy
belongs to a special category of galaxies,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.970
it's a Green Valley galaxy and that's a galaxy
that's in transition.

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:40.330
We're no longer making as many stars on a
given year as we used to.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.850
We make maybe two or three stars a year, are
formed in our galaxy.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.700
Remember our galaxy has 200 billion stars,
so, you know, it's a small fraction.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:53.610
It used to do a lot more and there are other
galaxies, redder galaxies that don't do this

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:54.970
at all anymore.

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:59.040
What's interesting is there seems to be a
relationship between a galaxy being a Green

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:04.430
Valley galaxy and what's happening with supermassive
black holes middle.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:10.090
Most Green Valley galaxies that we see out
in the universe have black holes that are

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.470
much more active in their center.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:16.050
They actually are producing these plumes and
objects and so on.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.210
We hadn't thought that our galaxy was doing
this.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.021
What's interesting is we're now seeing evidence
that it is.

00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:28.200
So this, very briefly, this is a map of Gamma
Ray emission coming from our galaxies, this

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.590
is really, you're looking at the plane of
our galaxy across the center of this map.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:37.400
And you can see, though, these two structures,
this was discovered about two years ago, these

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.520
two structures, these great regions of Gamma
Ray Emission coming from above and below the

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.040
center of our galaxy.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:53.619
What we think is going on is this, that in
fact our galaxy does have these bubbles around

00:55:53.619 --> 00:55:59.630
it but they were produced maybe sometime in
the last 100,000 years, maybe sometime in

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:03.870
the last million years by a supermassive black
hole in the middle.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:08.330
So it's one of these interesting things of
cosmic coincidence, right, where we happen

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:14.950
to exist in a time when our black hole is
not currently actively eating matter and producing

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:17.790
energy but it did awhile back.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:22.490
So it may actually be that our galaxy is much
more active, our black hole is doing a lot

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.160
more than we had given it credit for.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:32.760
Let's see, oh, and the interesting thing is
next year, in the next few months, we now

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.790
know there is a blob of stuff heading, this
is obviously an animation, blob of stuff,

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:41.099
that red thing, heading for the black hole
center of our galaxy.

00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:46.400
Astronomists spotted this a few years ago,
it's on track, depending on what it is it,

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:52.870
may get shredded and we may get a small version
of this black hole eating happening right

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:59.230
in our backyard and that will help inform
us whether or not this is really true that

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:03.920
our black hole, on a cosmic time scales, are
actually an awful lot noisier than we had

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.050
given it credit for.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.860
So, yeah, I don't know if that answers your
question but it was a good excuse for me to

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.680
show the rest of the slides.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.680
[Laughter]

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.980
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Thank you very much.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.180
&gt;&gt;Caleb Scharf: Thank you.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.730
[Applause]
