MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.830
My name is Martin
Omander, and I welcome you

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.110
to Google Root Access, the show
featuring actionable startup

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.135
advice.

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:12.510
My guest today is
Nelson Pereira,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.580
co-founder of the
start-up TOPdocs.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.140
Thanks for coming
in today, Nelson.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.540
And could you tell us a
bit about your start-up?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.039
NELSON PEREIRA: First, thank
you for having me here, Martin.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.330
TOPdocs is a cross-format
and cross-cloud-platform word

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.400
processor for mobile
and web, allowing people

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.390
from different clouds
to collaborate together

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.554
on Microsoft Office documents,
Open Office, and Google Docs.

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:38.470
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.020
So how come you got
started, or noticed

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.370
that this was a problem?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.244
NELSON PEREIRA: Yeah.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.080
It started three
years ago when I

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.970
was teaching UI and
UX design in college.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.210
And I started my PhD in
digital media back then.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.880
And I wanted to use
these all-new devices,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.530
the tablet madness, to
work outside the office,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.600
leaving the laptop
at home, finally.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.310
But I start to face
all kinds of problems.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.370
Compatibility of the
software wasn't there yet.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.360
So after are a lot of research
and trying to find apps,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.950
I decided to build my own tools.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.770
And then I went to Miguel,
and I challenged with him

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.830
to join to the project.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.370
He jumped in right away.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.110
He liked it.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.010
He liked the idea.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.509
Well, yes.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.010
Let's build this.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.820
So we started researching
for technology,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820
how to fix a problem,
where to start.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.520
And on that search, we
found [? Flochan ?],

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.950
which is the third team
member, which was also

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.440
working on this kind of problem.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.080
So we team up together,
we start building,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.512
and we are very proud of
what we achieve right now.

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:44.720
MARTIN OMANDER: Great, great.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.650
So I think, Nelson, right
now, many of our viewers

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.140
are thinking, what are
these guys thinking,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.470
going into such a crowded
market space, online document

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.790
collaboration?

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.320
We have the Microsofts,
and Googles, and Apples,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.100
and Dropboxes of
the world already

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.210
in there building solutions.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.180
How do you think about
entering such a market?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.990
And where do you see your niche?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.990
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.960
There is a lot of
good tools out there.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.260
All these big players are
creating amazing products,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.800
but all of them are
for their platforms.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.759
And that's where
the big problem is.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.800
And that's the problem
that we are trying to fix.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.310
Because if you use your
Google Drive as a cloud space

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.700
to sync all your
files and devices,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.830
and you're happy with it,
and then you go to mobile

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.030
and you start to try to edit
those with Microsoft Office,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.350
and that's not possible, because
Office is locked to OneDrive.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.450
And that's why we have a
niche and an opportunity

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.850
to work on this very
high-competition field of text

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.877
collaboration documents.

00:02:45.877 --> 00:02:48.460
MARTIN OMANDER: So you're saying
your strategic opportunity is

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.810
then that these cloud providers
don't support each other very

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.400
well.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.180
But you can be that layer
to support everybody.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.010
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly, because
we are creating a solution that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.620
will help people from
Dropbox or Google Drive

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.860
to collaborate together
on a Microsoft Office

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.580
document, which,
right now, is nearly

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.210
impossible in the mobile space.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.130
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.340
Are there other strategic
opportunities like that,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.520
features that you see
the big players are

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.137
lacking in or lagging in?

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:18.970
NELSON PEREIRA: Yes.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.630
One of the most critical is
interoperability problems,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.800
because all these
big players have

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.880
their own format
for collaboration.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.020
And they are not
very likely to push

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.890
for supporting each
other's formats.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.630
So when you try to edit on
mobile, example for Google

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.000
Docs, trying to edit a Microsoft
Office document on mobile,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.850
you end up with a
very hard moment.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.560
The document destroyed.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.435
Loss of information,
footnotes, objects,

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:49.810
when you go back
to the computer.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.670
So you need to trust your mobile
tool to perform those editings.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.620
And that's the
other place where we

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.430
think there's an opportunity
and a problem to fix,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.844
because the big players won't
try to push each other formats.

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:03.760
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.280
So what if Microsoft
or Google or Apple

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.530
comes out the next biggest
developer conference

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.220
and announces a new feature
that duplicates something

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.990
that you've built?

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.820
Isn't that a big risk?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.459
We are very aware
of this situation,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.990
because every summer,
every major tech company,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.590
like Google I/O conferences,
they announce new features,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.194
a bunch of start-ups just die.

00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:27.110
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.568
NELSON PEREIRA: Because they
are very tied to the ecosystem

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:31.960
and to a specific problem.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.170
So what we're doing
is we are trying

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.980
to be as platform-agnostic
as possible,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.460
trying to be independent,
and try to fix problems

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.870
that these big players
are not likely to fix

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.182
in the next coming times.

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:49.140
MARTIN OMANDER: Got it.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.280
So many start-ups
are, like you, working

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.650
within existing app ecosystems.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.435
What advice would
you give to them?

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:58.310
NELSON PEREIRA: Well,
first, find your niche.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.380
Find a specific problem
that those big players

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.540
won't fix for the coming times--
because they don't want it not,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.410
because they don't have
the resources to do it,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.440
because they have.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.700
And also try to be as
independent as possible

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.960
from these platforms.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.200
Try to find your business
and your way of working,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.270
and not being tied to
just one app ecosystem.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, so
span multiple systems.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.480
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.740
As many cloud platforms and
mobile operating systems

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.670
as possible.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.620
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.800
So that sounds great, in theory.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.280
And I'm sure a lot of start-ups
would love to do that.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.549
But isn't that awfully hard?

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:37.840
NELSON PEREIRA: Yes, it's hard.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.130
And that's why we
started it, because it

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.970
was a great challenge, too.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.290
But if you go to try
to fix the hardest

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.260
problems, but real problems
that people really have,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.520
you'll end up in
a space that also

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.160
is less crowded, like
start-up competition.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.164
And you may have higher
possibilities to succeed.

00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:57.080
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.580
I see.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.829
Well, thank you very much
for sharing your experiences

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.010
with us today, Nelson.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.600
NELSON PEREIRA: Thank you,
Martin, for having me.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.099
MARTIN OMANDER:
That's it for today.

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.120
I hope you found
something useful that you

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.450
can use in your start-up.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.930
