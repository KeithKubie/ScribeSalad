TAKAKO AIKAWA: So I
believe language teaching

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.450
needs to take place
together with that culture

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.310
of that language.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.830
And whenever we teach some,
like linguistics, patterns--

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.360
for instance, even
like greetings, OK?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.920
The linguistics forms
are very simple,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
but Japanese people always bow.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.800
So whenever we teach
some grammar patterns,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.150
we also teach,
say, body language.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.670
And also like whenever
we introduce honorific,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.940
we have to introduce
the society,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.370
I mean the hierarchical
kind of structure

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.170
of the Japanese society.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
We need to introduce
students the concept that we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.280
have to show respect
toward the elderly.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.090
So every linguistic
aspect involves

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.110
a cultural understanding.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.300
So whenever possible, we
introduce culture together

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.760
with language.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.450
Also textbook has
so-called culture note.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.500
So each lesson has culture
note to introduce one aspect

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
of the Japanese culture.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.830
For instance, Japanese
housing, Japanese food,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.520
how to take off shoes,
something like this.
