00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730
last week with ujaval in in QGIS they're
 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.790
last week with ujaval in in QGIS they're
also available to view here inside of

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800
also available to view here inside of
 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.830
also available to view here inside of
our jeaious so I'm going to click on the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840
our jeaious so I'm going to click on the
 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.300
our jeaious so I'm going to click on the
earth at night map that he showed last

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310
earth at night map that he showed last
 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.630
earth at night map that he showed last
week and the Archaea connector

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640
week and the Archaea connector
 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.860
week and the Archaea connector
communicates with Google Maps engine and

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870
communicates with Google Maps engine and
 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.760
communicates with Google Maps engine and
automatically adds a WMS layer of all

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770
automatically adds a WMS layer of all
 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.500
automatically adds a WMS layer of all
the layers inside of your published map

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510
the layers inside of your published map
 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.909
the layers inside of your published map
so if you have a Google Maps engine map

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919
so if you have a Google Maps engine map
 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.760
so if you have a Google Maps engine map
with vector data or raster data those

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770
with vector data or raster data those
 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.790
with vector data or raster data those
layers are available in one single click

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
layers are available in one single click
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.020
layers are available in one single click
so I'm going to turn on these WMS layers

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030
so I'm going to turn on these WMS layers
 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.250
so I'm going to turn on these WMS layers
and you can see this is the world at

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260
and you can see this is the world at
 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.120
and you can see this is the world at
night as published by NASA and there is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130
night as published by NASA and there is
 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.060
night as published by NASA and there is
a secondary layer that's added with kind

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070
a secondary layer that's added with kind
 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.670
a secondary layer that's added with kind
of ancillary metadata about your Google

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680
of ancillary metadata about your Google
 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.150
of ancillary metadata about your Google
Maps engine map so let me add a Google

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160
Maps engine map so let me add a Google
 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.680
Maps engine map so let me add a Google
Maps engine map that contains vector

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690
Maps engine map that contains vector
 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.490
Maps engine map that contains vector
data as well

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500
data as well
 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.860
data as well
so to do that I'm going to change the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870
so to do that I'm going to change the
 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.400
so to do that I'm going to change the
projection of my map to web Mercator to

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410
projection of my map to web Mercator to
 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.840
projection of my map to web Mercator to
align with the Google Maps engine

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850
 
 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.210
 
projections and if I go back to the

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220
projections and if I go back to the
 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.190
projections and if I go back to the
search dialog I published some census

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200
search dialog I published some census
 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.380
search dialog I published some census
data as well so there are some census

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390
data as well so there are some census
 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.159
data as well so there are some census
data for San Francisco so if I add this

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169
data for San Francisco so if I add this
 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.800
data for San Francisco so if I add this
census map

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810
 
 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.110
 
and I turn on the census WMS layers

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120
and I turn on the census WMS layers
 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.020
and I turn on the census WMS layers
you'll see that in the san francisco

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
you'll see that in the san francisco
 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.790
you'll see that in the san francisco
area there is some road data as well as

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800
area there is some road data as well as
 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.470
area there is some road data as well as
some con congressional boundaries as

you have Google Maps engine maps with
 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.600
you have Google Maps engine maps with
one too many layers that were just fine

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610
one too many layers that were just fine
 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.930
one too many layers that were just fine
as well so let me demonstrate the next

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940
as well so let me demonstrate the next
 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.030
as well so let me demonstrate the next
piece of functionality in the map so

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040
piece of functionality in the map so
 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.990
piece of functionality in the map so
that's all searched in kind of

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000
that's all searched in kind of
 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.520
that's all searched in kind of
visualization of your Maps but if I have

we will ask arcmap to convert it to

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:10.950
we will ask arcmap to convert it to
 

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.510
we will ask arcmap to convert it to
something that is supported and once

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:14.520
something that is supported and once

creation endpoint exactly yep so the

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320
creation endpoint exactly yep so the
 

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.950
creation endpoint exactly yep so the
first step was just to request through

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:39.960
first step was just to request through
 

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.310
first step was just to request through
the Maps engine API a new asset and then

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320
the Maps engine API a new asset and then
 

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.160
the Maps engine API a new asset and then
posting each file to the Maps engine API

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.170
posting each file to the Maps engine API
 

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.290
posting each file to the Maps engine API
and the last step is it opens it up in

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300
and the last step is it opens it up in
 

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.080
and the last step is it opens it up in
