00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.394
So let’s look at a more complicated case. Say we

00:00:02.394 --> 00:00:05.631
have a three-sided die and it can come up with

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.852
the outcomes 0, 1 or 2. And again I just want

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:11.415
to count, I don’t want to work in probabilities

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.679
just like before, I’m going to help you a little bit.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.532
First, I’d like to know what’s the possible

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:19.374
largest sum, the largest number I put over here

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:21.636
for anything that’s four tosses if each

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:25.129
outcome can be between 0, 1 and 2. Just write

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:26.793
in the box over here.
