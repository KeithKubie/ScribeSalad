00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.130
Here’s a riddle, my Hobbitses: What’s
something we all experience, all the time,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.830
that we can’t really measure, and barely
have words to define?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.200
You can’t hold it in your hand, or take
a bite out of it.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.400
It isn’t something you learn or practice;
it just IS.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.450
Consciousness.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.940
Every science has certain concepts that are
so fundamental, yet abstract, that we have

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
a hard time finding the appropriate words
to describe them.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.580
Ask a physicist and they’ll tell you energy
and space defy simple definitions.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.500
Biologists know if something is alive, but
have a harder time explaining what life actually

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.590
is.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.250
Ask a psychologist what consciousness is,
and you’ll get…you’ll get a slippery

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.250
answer.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.350
For the purposes of this conversation, we’re
going to actually loosely define consciousness

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.679
as our awareness of ourselves and our environment.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.640
It’s this awareness that allows us to take
in and organize information from many sources

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.550
and senses, at once.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.440
American psychologist William James thought
of consciousness as a continuously moving,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.249
shifting, and unbroken stream, hence the term
“stream of consciousness.”

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.120
Others think of it as the brain’s roving
flashlight, shining down an unbroken beam

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.620
of light that highlights one thing, and then
moves on to the next.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.620
The point is, your conscious experience is
forever shifting--for example, right now hopefully

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.330
you’re focused on the words coming out of
my mouth, but with a little shift - your mind

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.040
might wander to how you really should shower
today, and your chair is uncomfortable, and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.900
you suddenly have to pee, and can you believe
what Bernice said?!

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
Do I smell pizza?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
HEY!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
EYES HERE!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
WE’RE LEARNING!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.270
Beyond that moment-to-moment shifting, consciousness
allows us to contemplate life, think about

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.670
infinity, and ride a unicycle across a tightrope
while juggling melons, at least in theory.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.310
Our consciousness helps us plan our futures,
consider consequences, and reflect on the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.310
past.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.710
It is both the most familiar, and the most
mysterious part of our lives.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.390
It’s kind of like The Force -- but for the
little universes inside our heads.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.320
[INTRO]
Throughout our daily lives we flit back and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.140
forth between various states of consciousness,
including waking, sleeping, and various altered

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.140
states.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.280
These can occur spontaneously, like dreaming,
or be physiologically sparked, like a drug-induced

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.080
hallucination, or be triggered psychologically,
through meditation or hypnosis, for example.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.370
We’re going to take the next three episodes
to look closely at these different states

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.860
of consciousness, but let’s start with what
it really means to be awake.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.780
For centuries, scientists learned what they
could about the brain solely through clinical

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.780
observation.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.300
And they learned a lot, for sure, but with
today’s technology, we’re actually able

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.090
to see some of the structures and activity
inside a living, working brain - its electrical,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.430
metabolic, and magnetic signatures displayed
on screens for our wonder and amusement.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.420
The field of cognitive neuroscience is the
study of how brain activity is linked with

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.890
our mental processes, including thinking,
perception, memory, and language.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.740
Like other kinds of neuroscience, it uses
neuroimaging technologies to consider links

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.330
between specific brain states and conscious
experiences.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.290
And there’s more than one way to scan a
brain.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.070
Structural imaging shows the brain’s anatomy,
and is useful in identifying large-scale tumors,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.720
diseases, and injuries.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.170
In contrast, functional imaging shows us electromagnetic
or metabolic activity in the brain, like blood

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.040
flow, to let us observe correlations between
specific mental functions and activity in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.520
particular brain areas.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.950
So, yes, neuroimaging has been revolutionizing
the field of psychology, much like telescopes

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.670
and microscopes did for astronomy and biology.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.560
But on the other hand, some of this technology
is very new, and there’s plenty of disagreement

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.150
about how to interpret neuroimaging findings.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.510
Remember, correlation does not equal causation.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.060
So, activity in a certain brain region while
having certain kinds of thoughts might be

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.650
useful to know, but it’s not the end of
the conversation.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.410
We’ve already talked a lot about how function
is often localized in the brain and how everything

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.489
psychological is simultaneously biological--so
it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.930
could in part be illustrated by a bright flare
on a dark screen.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.660
We’ve also collected a fair amount of evidence
that we don’t just have one layer of consciousness

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.380
- a single tape playing various tunes - but
rather, something more like two layers, each

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.600
supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social
pit crew.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.860
I’m talking about one of the dual process
models of consciousness--the idea that our

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940
conscious, deliberate mind could be saying,
look! a squirrel! while our implicit, automatic

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.260
mind is simultaneously subprocessing like
a computer: color: brown, tail: bushy, movement:

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.280
climbing, distance: 20 meters, association:
my sister had a squirrel phobia as a child,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.530
implicit bias: I think that squirrels are
ruining America.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.100
All of which might weigh upon my behavior
upon seeing the little guy.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.180
By some estimates, all your senses are scooping
up nearly 11 million bits of information,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.180
EVERY SECOND.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.030
And yet, you consciously register only about
40 at time.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.200
So how do we keep focused and filter out all
the chatter to actually get stuff done?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.139
With selective attention, of course!

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.820
Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness
on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.110
effectively tuning out the rest.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.930
Your consciousness is like a spotlight on
a busy stage.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.470
There are other things going on around you
that your automatic, subprocessor brain is

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.010
covertly registering.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.950
But for those moments when you shine your
spotlight, most of the other stimuli fall

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.950
away.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.950
Try it at home!

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.420
Right now, you’re consciously watching this
lesson on consciousness.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.850
You probably don’t notice the feel of your
socks on your feet, or the tongue that’s

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.389
inside your mouth, always filling up your
mouth with tongue!

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.720
But as soon as I mention it, the spotlight
of your attention turns to them, you feel

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.030
those socks on your feet, and you’re like
wow!

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.669
It’s weird that there’s a tongue in my
mouth!

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.180
The classic auditory example of selective
attention is the cocktail party effect.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.919
You could be in a room with 47 people jabbering
away, and yet be able to concentrate your

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.979
hearing on one conversation, tuning out the
rest of the voices and background music.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.639
But, if the couple next to you were to speak
your name, suddenly your cognitive radar would

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.650
light up and your attention would whip around
to the sound of your name, probably trying

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.669
to figure out if Bernice was talking behind
your back again.

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:47.669
Bernice!!

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.330
This roving spotlight of selective attention
is pretty handy most of the time, for spies

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.610
and laypeople alike.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.410
But it can also be dangerous, if you’re
being dumb, and say, texting and driving.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.800
When you shift your primary selective attention
from driving to OMG, LOLOLOLOLOL, you also

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.370
unwittingly activate your selective inattention,
which means that you failed to see that cyclist

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.790
who you almost ran over, which would not only
have ruined her life but also yours so DON’T

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.790
TEXT AND DRIVE!

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.949
In fact, when your full attention is directed
elsewhere, you’d be astounded by the scope

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.240
of obvious things you fail to notice.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.440
It’s called inattentional blindness.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.139
You may have even already been subject to
one of the most famous experiments of inattentional

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.190
blindness...the Invisible Gorilla or, sometimes,
the Moonwalking bear.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.500
Just google either of those things if you
want to be tested on your awareness and then

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.759
come back.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.259
Pretty great, right?!

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.350
Given the prompt to count the number of passes
one team makes, your consciousness is focused

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.850
on following the players and the ball, nothing
else.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.260
You don’t see the players in black, they’re
the distraction... also you certainly don’t

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.410
see the dancing gorilla...or bear...whichever
one.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.631
The original version of this experiment found
that about 50% of people didn’t notice that

00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:02.870
there was A GORILLA WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM!

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.180
THAT is how powerfully selective our attention
can be.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.990
Something to remember next time you’re behind
the wheel.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.990
But you know who understands and exploits
inattentional blindness better than anyone?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.990
Magicians!

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.740
Except they call it misdirection.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.610
Famous modern magician Teller, of Penn and
Teller, says “Every time you perform a magic

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.850
trick you’re engaging in a experimental
psychology.”

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.889
And we can’t help but be rubes.

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.509
Magicians also prey on our change blindness,
the psychological phenomenon in which we fail

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:29.180
to notice changes in our environment.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.240
And no, I don’t mean climate change.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.390
I mean the failure to recognize the difference
between what was there a moment ago, versus

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.390
what is there now.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.139
For example, I have changed shirts several
times since this lesson started.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:44.130
In a well-known and often-copied experiment,
sometimes called the “person swap,” an

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.110
experimenter will stop someone in a park and
ask for directions.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.010
And then, during some staged interruption,
the original experimenter will leave and be

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.889
replaced with a totally different person.

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:56.610
Half the time, the subject doesn’t even
notice.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.610
Fun!

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.169
One of the many perks of studying psychology
with me is you learn all kinds of new ways

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:01.169
to mess with people!

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:04.699
But while change blindness makes for some
really cool parlor tricks, this failure to

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:09.630
notice certain things can be dangerous -- say,
faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.550
in court, or when friends get deadlocked in
a he-said, she-said disagreement.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.069
So, my friends, use The Force.

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:17.130
But use it wisely.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.669
As one of my favorite psychologists once advised:
“A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:23.449
defense, never for attack.”

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:24.970
Actually, that was Yoda.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.889
Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less
aware of what’s going on around us than

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:29.889
we think we are.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.100
And that’s just when we’re awake!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.700
Imagine what might slip your notice when you’re
half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized, or hallucinating!

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.890
That’s what we’re gonna talk about next
time.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.600
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course, if you were selectively conscious

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.660
of my words, you got introduced the our constant
struggle to define consciousness, learned

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.100
a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing
role in psychological science, how our consciousness

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.990
is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic,
and how the brain can be selectively attentive,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.350
selectively inattentive, and blind to changes
in some surprisingly major ways.
