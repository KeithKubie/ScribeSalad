stuff for ourselves and we recognize
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979
stuff for ourselves and we recognize
that if we need it other people probably

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
that if we need it other people probably
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660
that if we need it other people probably
need it too and so since then we've

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

realizing that we're not special other

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
realizing that we're not special other
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.750
realizing that we're not special other
people would like it to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.759
a virtual company and a physical company

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769
a virtual company and a physical company
 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.979
a virtual company and a physical company
so we're 20 people half in Chicago and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
so we're 20 people half in Chicago and
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020
so we're 20 people half in Chicago and
then half elsewhere and ten other cities

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
then half elsewhere and ten other cities
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030
then half elsewhere and ten other cities
around the world so we're a little bit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
around the world so we're a little bit
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.730
around the world so we're a little bit
of a mix of the traditional and the sort

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
of a mix of the traditional and the sort
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830
of a mix of the traditional and the sort
of next generation new wave virtual sort

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
of next generation new wave virtual sort
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.649
of next generation new wave virtual sort
of company our general feeling though is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
of company our general feeling though is
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.969
of company our general feeling though is
that it's best if people stay away from

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
that it's best if people stay away from
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010
that it's best if people stay away from
each other as much as possible because

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
each other as much as possible because
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480
each other as much as possible because
when people are all together all the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
when people are all together all the
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.740
when people are all together all the
time it's really easy to interrupt each

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
time it's really easy to interrupt each
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.330
time it's really easy to interrupt each
other and we found that that's kind of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
other and we found that that's kind of
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.740
other and we found that that's kind of
biggest problem with the traditional

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
biggest problem with the traditional
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.600
biggest problem with the traditional
workplace is interruption so we're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
workplace is interruption so we're
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.550
workplace is interruption so we're
trying to avoid that at all costs

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560
 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.840
well it kind of happened because

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850
well it kind of happened because
 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.670
well it kind of happened because
originally my partner in the business I

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
originally my partner in the business I
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920
originally my partner in the business I
got named David Hanson hand Meyer Hanson

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930
got named David Hanson hand Meyer Hanson
 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.929
got named David Hanson hand Meyer Hanson
actually it's his full name um he was

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939
actually it's his full name um he was
 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.460
actually it's his full name um he was
working in Denmark now I was working in

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470
working in Denmark now I was working in
 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.529
working in Denmark now I was working in
Chicago and we got a lot of stuff done

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539
Chicago and we got a lot of stuff done
 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.210
Chicago and we got a lot of stuff done
working together to seven time zones

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220
working together to seven time zones
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.279
working together to seven time zones
apart and then eventually he moved to

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289
apart and then eventually he moved to
 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.779
apart and then eventually he moved to
Chicago and were like man he's in

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789
Chicago and were like man he's in
 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.219
Chicago and were like man he's in
Chicago this is going to be great or get

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229
Chicago this is going to be great or get
 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.320
Chicago this is going to be great or get
more work done together and he comes to

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330
more work done together and he comes to
 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.700
more work done together and he comes to
Chicago we get less work done together

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710
Chicago we get less work done together
 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.679
Chicago we get less work done together
and we start to realize it because we're

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689
and we start to realize it because we're
 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.060
and we start to realize it because we're
both in the same physical place in the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070
both in the same physical place in the
 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.109
both in the same physical place in the
same physical office were just

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
same physical office were just
 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.789
same physical office were just
interrupting each other all the time by

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799
interrupting each other all the time by
 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.410
interrupting each other all the time by
talking and there's something good about

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420
talking and there's something good about
 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080
talking and there's something good about
talking and FaceTime you know but too

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090
talking and FaceTime you know but too
 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.449
talking and FaceTime you know but too
much of it is a bad thing so we decided

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459
much of it is a bad thing so we decided
 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.440
much of it is a bad thing so we decided
that we're going to kind of try and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
that we're going to kind of try and
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.120
that we're going to kind of try and
simulate the old way of working which

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130
simulate the old way of working which
 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.350
simulate the old way of working which
was he was in Denmark and I was in

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
was he was in Denmark and I was in
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.120
was he was in Denmark and I was in
Chicago so we wouldn't see each other

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130
Chicago so we wouldn't see each other
 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.559
Chicago so we wouldn't see each other
very often so he worked at home and I

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
very often so he worked at home and I
 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.910
very often so he worked at home and I
worked at home and if we came into the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
worked at home and if we came into the
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.530
worked at home and if we came into the
office we came in and off times often

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
office we came in and off times often
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.720
office we came in and off times often
and we found out that we started getting

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730
and we found out that we started getting
 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.160
and we found out that we started getting
more work done again when we were split

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
more work done again when we were split
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.050
more work done again when we were split
up and so we sort of carried that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
up and so we sort of carried that
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.229
up and so we sort of carried that
through throughout the business now that

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239
through throughout the business now that
 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.370
through throughout the business now that
you know we try and stay away from each

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
you know we try and stay away from each
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.600
you know we try and stay away from each

other as much as we can we have a
 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.920
other as much as we can we have a
physical office we just built a new

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
physical office we just built a new
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.240
physical office we just built a new

office and I can talk about that a
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.830
office and I can talk about that a
little bit because we try to take this

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840
little bit because we try to take this
 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.330
little bit because we try to take this
philosophy and build it into a physical

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
philosophy and build it into a physical
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.170
philosophy and build it into a physical
