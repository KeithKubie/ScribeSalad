00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.790
&gt;&gt; Hi, guys.
Thank you so much for coming to today's author

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.330
talk.
Today, we have Emily Nagle Green, who is the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.630
president and CEO of the
Yankee group.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.970
And she wrote this great book called "Anywhere",
about global

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.109
connectivity and business initiatives that
can really draw a lot of

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.991
value from that increased connectivity in
our world.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.110
So please welcome Emily Nagle Green to Google
Boston.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.160
Emily Nagle Green: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.579
I don't need this, I think.
But if anybody wants to talk.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.780
Oh, you're going to hold on to that.
Okay, cool.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.660
Hi, Google Boston, and hi, Google anywhere.
My name's Emily Green and I'm delighted to

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.640
be here.
I have Steve Vinter of Google Boston, Google

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.410
Cambridge to thank for
that.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.059
Steve and I met about a year ago.
We're both on a committee that the governor

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.800
of Massachusetts formed to
get technology leaders in the Boston and greater

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.240
Massachusetts area to
help create more energy and enthusiasm around

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.590
a very vibrant tech
sector in the Massachusetts area.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.540
And Steve has exhibited all the great qualities
I have come to know

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.640
about Google as an organization.
And he's also an awesome dodgeball player,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.770
it turns out.
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.600
Yeah, he hit my husband with a dodgeball but
with incredible accuracy.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.899
So this is an author talk, and I thought maybe
the easiest way to do it

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.990
-- I have some experience with this now because
the book's been out for

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.770
a few weeks.
I thought I would offer to interview myself

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.960
to make it easy for you.
I know this is supposed to be casual, and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.149
it's Friday, we here in
Boston, we have hot chocolate.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.369
So I thought I would interview myself so that
you can just sort of sit

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.840
back and enjoy the interview.
And you don't have to do any work, really.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.909
You can eat your croissants and enjoy your
hot chocolate.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.890
Yes, so I'm told.
The chef says it's his specialty.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.399
So the first thing I thought I would start
with was, who am I?

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.170
I'm a researcher and Yankee Group is a 40,
4-0, 40-year old research

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.870
firm that is based here in Boston but is focused
on the global

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.230
revolution in connectivity that is underway.
I'm a former engineer.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.050
I started my life as a software developer,
but it was so long ago that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.950
I would be homeless if I had to go back to
that profession right now.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.500
But I am proud to say that as a software developer,
I spent some time

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.690
working in the entertainment industry.
And I am one of the very first generation

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.230
of software developers that
can claim movie credits.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.580
Back in the early 80s, I worked on some really
fun movies and TV shows

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.200
doing special effects.
But my software development days are long

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.069
behind me.
And I'm a researcher and I spent the last

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.300
year with other analysts at
Yankee Group and a lot of other experts in

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.530
the industry looking at the
changes that are under way in connectivity.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.380
And it was my view that while a lot of us,
including probably everyone

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.040
in this room and everybody on the DVR, is
quite fluent with more

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.130
immediate issues that are underway in the
communications revolution.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.610
There's a much larger audience for that news
out there in the world

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.550
that hasn't yet put some of these changes
into context and doesn't yet

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.280
see the tremendous implications that are ahead.
So let's start with the first question on

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.459
my interview list after who
am I.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.830
And that is what, in fact, is anywhere?
What definition do I give to that word?

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.370
I sort of co-opted that term.
That's what industry analysts do, we either

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.000
make up words or we borrow
words and use them for our own purposes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.360
So apologies for that.
But I think it really works.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.080
Anywhere is the term that I've given to the
emergence of ubiquitous

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.019
connectivity, how it will connect all of us
on the planet, and

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.049
ultimately -- hi -- all the things that we
care about.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.650
And I call it anywhere because for my money,
it is completely changing

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.440
the meaning of location in two kind of interesting
ways that are

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.370
contradictory.
In one sense, as the world is connected by

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.700
a pervasive, capable,
extremely cool digital fabric, it doesn't

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.900
so much matter where we are.
So location becomes less significant, but

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.910
the information associated
with location becomes much more significant

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.851
and much more useful to us
because it can be embroidered and embedded

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:40.700
in a lot of our activities.
So that's the anywhere revolution and it's

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.070
coming about because of what
I call the anywhere network.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.060
That's my vision and the vision of Yankee
Group for a seamless --

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.721
hardly at that stage today -- intelligent,
sort of headed in the right

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:59.440
direction; ubiquitous, that is, everywhere;
and abundant network.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.970
We're actually going towards that future.
And in recent years we're accelerating towards

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.450
that future even faster
than we might have imagined.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.500
I like the word abundant for network capacity
and I think it's

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.430
particularly relevant within the last -- what
is it?

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.220
Twenty four hours since the announcement about
Google's ultra-high speed

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.600
contribution to the network.
So thanks for that.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.440
I'm a big believer in abundance in the network.
One of the people I interviewed for this book

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.060
was Bob Metcalfe, who if
you don't know him, is a seminal thinker and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.181
inventor and leader in the
history of network technology and the phrase

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:36.750
he uses -- which I have
completely stolen -- is squanderable abundance

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.400
of the network.
And I think it's when the network is abundant

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.340
to a degree that we can
actually waste it, that's when we're struck

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.560
with really compelling
ideas for how to take advantage of it in brand

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.350
new ways.
And you know, the best, most recent example

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.710
of the last few years would
be YouTube, of course.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.710
So why is this important?
Well, it's important for a lot of us in this

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.780
room and on this DVR
because it's creating really interesting work

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.600
for us and fun work, but
in the larger question, remember I said I

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.370
wrote the book for the larger
audience that needs to understand how impactful

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.370
this transition towards
a global network with squanderable abundance

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.320
is going to be, is that
the changes in this revolution will make it

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.800
the largest technology
revolution of all of our lifetimes, even for

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.180
those of you who are among
the -- on the younger end in this room as

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.710
opposed to on the older
end -- this is going to be a transformation

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.880
that will dwarf anything
that we've previously seen.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.860
I like to compare it to the largest tech revolution
that I think we've

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.000
all been through in some form or another in
our lifetime so far, and

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.080
that's the emergence of the commercial Internet,
which happened

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.420
starting in '95 to 2005.
And when you think about that revolution and

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.900
how it emerged, the
locations where it was relevant to us was

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.850
where we worked or in our homes or at schools,
but not in a lot of other places.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.710
Even so, it brought a billion people together
in the first ten years of

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:21.300
its commercial maturity.
And the value added from an economic perspective

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.430
by this brand new
infrastructure that a billion people were

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.750
able to use in essentially
three places was in the billions of dollars.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.470
Because it allowed companies and services
and activities to emerge that

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.330
could not have existed without the Internet.
Hard for the younger people in this audience

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.530
today to even imagine,
right?

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.360
And then that's what happens with any kind
of pervasive infrastructure.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.270
Highway systems created the hotel industry
in the 50s.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.740
The maturation of the professional commercial
television industry

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.080
created really what's the modern advertising
industry.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.980
Anywhere is a revolution that will connect
not only work, home, and

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.890
school but plazas and subways and jungles.
And if you read the story in the New York

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.700
Times this morning about
school buses now starting to experiment with

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.660
adding mobile routers to
school buses so kids can recapture that lost

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.130
productivity of commute
time to and from school with wireless routers.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.600
In the next five years alone, this will mean
that over five billion

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.330
people are connected.
And the real thing that's driving that, of

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.860
course, is wireless
technology, because wireless networks are

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.760
now coming to parts of the
world that would never have seen connectivity

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.150
if it was dependent on
running fixed-line networks with telephone

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.490
poles and fiberoptic and
copper cables.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.940
So five billion people will be connected,
at the very least, through

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.550
mobile phone technology which will be for
many of them the only way

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.000
that they actually ever touch this digital
network.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.250
But more importantly, and I'll come back to
this in a moment, we're

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.660
going to start connecting things in a really
serious way, and that's

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.430
where some of the biggest transformation that's
ahead is.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.830
So as a result of that, the economic value
from this revolution

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.590
compared to the emergence of the Internet
in the first ten years, will

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.660
be in the trillions of dollars rather than
in the billions of dollars.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.300
And I know that's true because I'm an expert.
You know what an expert is, right?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.260
"X" is the unknown quantity and "spurt" is
a drip under pressure.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:27.070
So an expert is an unknown drip under pressure.
It's an old joke.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.590
But at Yankee Group, we measure the economic
value of the emergence of

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.530
the broadband network infrastructure around
the world, and this is our

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.090
forecast most recently of the total value
of revenues in the network,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.170
just providing broadband services to consumers
and businesses.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.560
So by 2013, about a billion dollars in value.
But that's the platform itself.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.660
So if we were talking about the highway system,
that would be revenues

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.590
from tolls on the highway.
But when you think about the Googles, the

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.910
YouTubes, the Amazons, all
the experiences that we're going to be able

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.520
to layer on top with assets
like Android, then we're talking about trillions

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.080
of dollars of
incremental value on top of that digital global

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.280
platform.
So the book is about the emergence of that.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.730
It is not a tech book at all.
I wrote it for my mother, your aunts and uncles,

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.230
your friends who don't
understand what it is you do.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.600
It's about how this transformation is inevitable.
It's really not stoppable.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.510
But there's a lot of explanation about why
that's true.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.290
It's about the consequences of ubiquitous
connectivity.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.580
And it's about the tremendous commercial opportunities
associated with

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.780
ubiquitous connectivity.
And it does that through some things that

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.830
I hope are friendly and not
intimidating.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:54.490
As I said, it's not a deep dive into the technology.
I like to tell people I'm a recovering engineer,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.090
you know.
I have a -- belong to a 12-step program.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.810
I have a number I call if I'm tempted to engineer
anything because I'm

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.490
not allowed to do it anymore.
So we do support it with a little data, so

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:09.060
that we're credible.
But it does involve a lot of anecdotal explanations

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.940
and experience from
over 50 leaders in connectivity.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.390
I'm proud to say, that because I'm part of
a very vibrant community of

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.970
technology entrepreneurialism in the Boston
area, that over ten of those

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.560
people were based in the Boston area.
People like Bob Metcalfe, Nicholas Negroponte,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.300
Hamish Fraser, who's the
director of tele-medicine at Partners in Health,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.800
one of the
organizations that's doing tremendous work

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.760
in Haiti right now.
But beyond that, we created some personas

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.410
to make it easy for people to
visualize in five and ten years time how experiences

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.410
would be
different.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.800
There's some case studies, there is even some
Cosmo quiz style things

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.390
that make it more engaging. So the goal was
to make it very accessible

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.580
and fun, but also compelling.
One of the ways in which we do that we tried

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.760
to help people to understand how this
revolution is emerging around the world is

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.090
by means of something
called the anywhere index.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.810
And very simply put, it's a brute-force instrument
to help people

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.790
understand the pace at which broadband that
is emerging around the

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.920
world.
We look at the number of broadband lines in

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.830
the world, wired or wireless
lines, and we compare that to population in

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.020
a region.
And when there are fewer broadband lines than

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.400
people, that's one state
of play in the network.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.830
And as broadband lines start to increase beyond
the population in a

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.000
region, that's what we call the anywhere tipping
point.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.380
Because the pervasiveness of the cape -- of
a capable network with

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.730
squanderable abundance starts to allow innovation
and adoption of

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:45.420
entirely new behaviors and activities.
Um, so this is unfolding before us.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.510
And these are some, some figures that we update
at Yankee Group on a

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.550
regular basis.
Right now, to use the terms that I just laid

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:57.340
out, regions that have
more than one broadband line per person -- and

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.620
if you think about the
number of things in your life that might ultimately

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.230
have broadband
connections, we have very few countries in

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.230
the world that actually meet
that definition.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.920
And it's a little bit hard to see here in
Boston today, but you can see

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.660
Sweden, and you can see Japan and Korea perhaps,
and Australia are colored as anywhere countries.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.660
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.290
Emily Nagle Green: Yes, yes.
Yes.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:26.610
The bar, you know, full disclosure, the bar
for our wireless broadband line,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.540
the bar is pretty low in our definition, because
we're not really at

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.660
the infrastructure and the mobile space that,
you know, 4G broadband,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.660
that's what we would all like to have.
Maybe 6G.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.130
But over the next five years, a number of
countries because of the

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.670
build out of wireless networks and upgrades
to 3G as AT&amp;T tries to fix

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.270
it's map relative to Verizon, and as countries
around the world pull

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.960
more fiber from stimulus packages from government,
we see most of

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.210
Western Europe and all of North America in
five years time having a

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.589
total number of broadband lines that will
surpass the population.

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:10.920
And it's, I think, a good indicator that we're
accelerating into a very

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.700
different environment in the next five to
ten years.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.870
How will it change us as individuals?
That's some of what we talk about in the book

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.390
in what I think is an
engaging way, that's some of the feedback

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.350
I've had so far.
Just to give you a bit of a taste, a couple

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.990
of personas drawn from the
book, you'd learn more about them as when

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.040
you read it Fatuma is a
coffee farmer in Kenya.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.980
She has tuberculosis, which is extraordinarily
common in emerging

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.060
countries, unfortunately, cause we know how
to cure it.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.200
But at this time a chronic disease that requires
ongoing maintenance

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.000
from a health care worker.
She also doesn't have access to information

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.140
resources that would tell
her how she could price her coffee beans to

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.330
get the best price.
She -- somebody comes up and offers her a

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.580
price for her crop and that's
what she sells it for.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.201
And one of the challenges in compiling assets,
economic assets, in

00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:11.529
Third World markets is she has no access to
banks.

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:15.970
There are no ATMs and no easy-to-reach banking
resources.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.440
That's her life today.
In India, where wireless networks are already

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.220
more common, in
particular in urban areas like Mumbai, we

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.270
have Habib who's a street
cart merchant.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:32.370
He's 15-years old, so he has the basic education
that a lot of lower

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.230
middle class Indians get.
He operates a cart but he has to buy his groceries

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:42.029
at retail.
He competes for his space on the sidewalk

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:45.930
every day, so he's worried
about getting the best price for his groceries,

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.470
but he's compelled to
pay whatever he has to so that he can get

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.350
to his spot on the sidewalk.
He has a lot of tourists come by, but they

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:57.089
haven't changed their money
yet, so he doesn't have a means to do business

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:01.241
with them because they
have dollars or euros and he only deals in

00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:04.770
rupees.
And because he has cash, he's a very easy

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.279
target for petty thieves.
Finally, in emerging parts of the world, the

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:15.790
state of the network today
allows people like Allen to do a knowledge

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.380
worker's job, but what he's
really working with is secondhand data.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.870
He's working with data that has been stale
and processed through many

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.180
sources.
And the sources of information he has are

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.649
quite siloed.
You see here that he's looking at multiple

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:34.170
screens.
And it's the gray matter between his ears

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.570
that's attempting to
integrate the information that's been presented

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.470
to him, and it's mostly
text.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.240
The work schedule -- he has to work when the
markets are open and he's

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.820
basically chained to this desk.
But as the network becomes more pervasive

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.980
around the world and as the
capacity of the network grows and its intelligence

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.620
grows, everybody's
experience changes in some way.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.540
For Fatuma, she gets better health care because
organizations like

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.630
Partners in Health can develop medical records
systems that depend on

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.390
network access.
And so, the community health care workers

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.390
in Kenya and in Haiti and
Rwanda can find Fatuma, let her know when

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.770
the medications for her
tuberculosis are available, and they can track

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.740
where she lives.
She also can get information about market

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.380
pricing for her crop on a
mobile phone, and she can do banking through

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.240
her mobile phone.
So she's able to build assets and that's a

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.260
life-changing set of
opportunities.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.410
And that will move her, in the next ten years,
and people like her into

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.410
a burgeoning lower middle class in places
like Kenya, which is just now

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:47.430
being touched by fiberoptic cable undersea.
For Habib, and other citizens like him, he

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.520
will be able to use netbooks
and other low cost computing devices that

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.180
will be subsidized or
sponsored by a retailer.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.760
And he can order product, and so he pick it
up efficiently without

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.900
missing his spot on the street corner.
He can earn points from offering mobile couponing

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.320
and mobile banking
services, so that he doesn't have to handle

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.090
money, and that reduces his
vulnerability to thieves.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.390
And it's been shown that the introduction
of connected devices like

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.300
laptops, actually dramatically raises the
literacy levels of family

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.300
members around individuals, and that was something
that come out in

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:26.220
conversations with Negroponte with his one
laptop per child movement.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.390
But in more mature parts of the world that
already have an abundant

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.010
network but which is going to continue to
grow in capacity and

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.080
intelligence, what we're headed towards is
knowledge workers like Allen

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.620
who will be able to use integrated highly
visual displays that follow

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.740
him from place to place.
So that he can appear in a new location in

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.929
his back porch or in another
venue and work almost in different to his

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:54.320
location.
But he'll be working with real time data because

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.890
the abundant global
network will be able to bring censor-based

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.470
information to him on crops,
so rather than relying on secondhand informations

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.850
about the maturity of
Fatuma's coffee beans, he'll ultimately be

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.410
able to understand the
maturity of coffee beans from the field-based

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.880
networks themselves.
And he'll be unchained from his desk, and

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.500
we'll see a marvelous
flowering -- as we are already starting to

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.240
do in the tech sector --
we'll see a marvelous flowering outside of

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.280
the tech sector of workers
whose jobs are changing, their connections

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.420
to the workplace changing,
so that they may be freed and have less conventional

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.410
work hours and
then maybe a less conventional relationship

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:40.580
with their employers.
So I said I was going to interview myself.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.430
I told you who I am.
I told you a little bit about Anywhere, the

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.780
emergence of ubiquitous
connectivity; I told you why you should care

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.890
because it's the largest
technology revolution of our lifetimes.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.840
I told you a little bit about what that change
in pervasive abundant

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.700
intelligent network will help people do.
And I talked a little bit about what we hope

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.950
the book will do.
So that means I really only have one question

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.780
left which I think I'm
more or less on schedule.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.460
And that is my own initial impression on what
it might mean for

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.820
Googlers?
So I thought I'd take a few moments on that

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:20.270
before we maybe talk a
little bit about the book, if you like.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.179
You guys are an interesting group of people
because you have a

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:26.990
fascinating organization.
And this book, frankly, many of you may not

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.550
learn much that you don't
already feel you know about the pace at which

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.780
the network's evolving
and the capabilities of the network.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.059
Remember, we're talking to a much larger audience
about the evolution

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:42.309
of connectivity.
And this book is an optimistic, encouraging

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:47.510
future vision of the world
that I hope will enroll more believers in

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.550
what you're doing.
So hopefully, it will enlarge the appetite

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:57.420
of the world for Google's
incredibly exciting products and expertise.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.309
But I think more than that, I do think Google
is a company that thinks

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:05.990
big, tremendously big.
And that's inspiring, but I think it's fair

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.640
to ask given what we saw on
our research about the rate at which the network's

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.740
expanding and its
capacities and future intelligence -- the

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.760
question might be are you
sure you're thinking big enough?

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.850
Because I think not only are we connecting
more people, we're going to

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.120
have more connected consumers from a billion
to five or six billion.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:33.750
But we're going to have new kinds of consumers.
I saw once in a design philosophy statement

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:39.010
about Google user
interfaces or user experiences that you seek

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.680
to meet unarticulated
needs, which I liked, because I often talk

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.340
about the latent appetites
of consumers.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.330
We are a mobile species.
We were born on our feet.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.270
We learned to walk early on.
And we respond to things that allow us to

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.580
be mobile.
And we love the portability of devices and

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.490
experiences.
And what I see emerging is a new kind of consumer,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.160
an Anywhere consumer
who has a innate, eventually an innate expectation

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.740
that experiences
should be portable.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.620
And you're starting to make that happen, but
I think there are many

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.000
more experiences that aren't yet quite as
portable as we might like

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.760
them to be.
This Anywhere consumer is an Anywhere worker

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.860
as well.
And again, in the tech sector we see it is,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.299
I think, well-established
early signs of new behaviors in relationship

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:34.610
to a workplace.
But over the long term, I think companies

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.840
everywhere will be
transformed by the expectations we -- sorry

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.070
 -- we have as consumers and
employees for state-of-the-art technology

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.000
that keeps pace with the
evolution of consumer technologies.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.730
Why should our workplace platforms be any
less sophisticated and easy

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.900
to use and fun and flexible as the things
that we can buy for

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.910
ourselves?
And that will change companies as we move

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.520
proprietary hardware and
software out of big IT operations and move

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.530
those things into the
clouds.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:12.670
I think anywhere enterprises can be become
more nimble and more

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.220
exciting and a more contemporary workplace,
virtual workplace, for

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.650
employees.
But I just wanted to leave on one final note,

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.330
one of the most
interesting things to me personally about

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:28.840
the emergence of ubiquitous
connectivity is the emergence of new kinds

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.740
of connected devices.
I do see within the tech sector -- and I have

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:44.000
been in technology for
35 years, I started, I was just a baby when

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.960
I started.
But I do see a little bit of myopia from time

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.020
to time.
We get so focused on computers, laptops and

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.940
phones, what's really
happening is connectivity becomes ubiquitous.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:00.080
And at the cost of adding connectivity to
things continues to fall,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.220
we're seeing a lot more connected things.
And there's where Google really needs to make

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.550
sure it's thinking big.
Maybe you've seen some of these -- these are

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.850
all real devices.
This is a connected pill bottle made by a

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:18.110
company here in Cambridge called Vitality.
And when you take the cap off, it can let

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.640
your friends, your health
care professionals know if you're taking your

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.320
medication.
So it can help maintain a health regimen.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.350
It doesn't do anything else, but it does a
better job of being a pill

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:36.990
bottle because it's connected.
This is also invented by the same guy, David

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.620
Rose, this is a connected
umbrella.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.450
It doesn't tell you what the weather is, but
twice a day it can get an

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.390
update on the possibility of precipitation
where you are, and it turns

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.630
that light on in the bottom of the handle
if it's going to rain.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.530
So it doesn't tell you the weather but it
does a better job of being an

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.799
umbrella.
It is more "umbrella-ish" because it knows

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:03.380
when you need it.
You're more likely to have it with you.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.100
This is an active RFID tag, not a very sexy-looking
thing, but the tip

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.100
of the iceberg in terms of something that
I think is very sexy, which is

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.049
equipping assets and businesses and environments
around the world with

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:22.580
connectivity so they can report on their location,
whether they're wet or dry or broken or complete

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:28.910
or ready or unready or in some sort of danger.
And as that technology becomes more pervasive

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.960
in our ambient
environment that world is -- that's going

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.990
to flood our world with some
rich data.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.860
And that's part of the opportunity for an
enterprise like Google to

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.130
organize that.
This is a Bluetooth ring.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:47.429
It's a piece of jewelry.
It was just debuted in January at the Consumer

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:52.510
Electronics Show.
It has an E-ink display, so it can accept

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.710
little text messages and
things.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.299
And so it can connect to your phone.
And there have been a lot of attempts on connected

00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:01.130
clothing and things.
I think there will be many more experimentations

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:08.860
ahead with connected
things, some of which will be tragically weird.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.220
And some of us, maybe even some of us in this
room, will be sporting

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.470
those at various events and being reviled
by our friends and family for

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:22.480
how extremely nerdy they are making us look.
Nonetheless, there are huge transformations

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.880
ahead in the meaningfulness
and the functionality of very common devices

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:30.380
in our lives.
I think, if you think back to the emergence

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.250
of a standard electrical
grid in our parents' lives and our grandparents'

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.740
lives, and what that
did, it transformed coffee pots that sat on

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.520
a stovetop into
percolators.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.450
It transformed brooms into vacuum cleaners
that we could push.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:55.450
It transformed wind-up clocks into wristwatches.
The world was completely transformed by the

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.530
availability of pervasive,
inexpensive electricity.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.700
And the tools of the our lives were transformed
because electricity

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.150
came to the device in the form of a motor
and made that thing more

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:10.070
useful to us.
So there is a connected piano, Yamaha makes

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.140
it.
It's a Wi-Fi enabled, and it can download

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.280
music.
What I want is the model that has a Kindle-type

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.540
display where the music
stand is so that I can get sheet music to

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.799
appear in real time for me to
play.

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:28.140
Why not, right?
That would make the piano more "piano-ish.",

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.539
right?
That doesn't mean that I necessarily want

00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:34.350
to scan Bloomberg headlines while I'm sitting
at the keyboard but I would like to have all

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.440
of my music available in the same format that
I may soon consume my books.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.510
Finally, one of the coolest new connected
devices that I have because I

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.570
think it's an important milestone for us to
think about, and I leave

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:54.190
you with this thought as Googlers is this
is a Chumby.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:28:02.420
It's a $99 device that has now replaced the
clock radio on my bedside

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.250
nightstand.
And it's not a browser interface.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:11.080
It's a passive device that can be programmed
from a browser on your

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.900
computer to have widgets, and it can stream
my Flickr photos, and my

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.190
Twitter feed.
And it can be an alarm clock, and I can wake

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.210
up to Pandora channels that
I've designed.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:29.480
And it has -- not a computer experience; it's
not a browser mindset

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.080
for -- for it's utility.
But it's bringing the Internet to me in a

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.610
brand new way.
All of these devices, I think, are examples

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.140
of ways in which our world
will become more intelligent with pervasive

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.880
connectivity and the
opportunities that you have as Googlers to

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.049
organize that information
and to deal with the new paths to consumers,

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:53.929
and the new devices in our
lives is just tremendous.

00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:57.600
So I was delighted to have the invitation
to tell you a little bit

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.789
about the book.
I hope you read it.

00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:04.580
If you read it and you like it, I'd be so
flattered if you'd put some

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.450
comments on Amazon or elsewhere, so other
people can see it.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.600
If you don't like it, you can do that, too,
but my mother won't like

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.530
you nearly as much.
So I appreciate your time.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:20.400
And happy to field some questions if you have
time and appetite.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.520
Comments?

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.630
Questions?

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.840
&gt;&gt; Well, a comment first brought up by the
piano reference.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:33.179
There are two ways that a company like Google
can advance things. And

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:38.970
one is to spill into a solutions base that
is vacant and another one is

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.820
to batter down the very thick, very high walls
of copyright, is one of

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.830
those very thick, very high walls standing
in the way of things like

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.970
what you describe because --

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.380
Emily Nagle Green: Yeah, I know I'd like to
have --

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very hard to deal with an industry
that's used to paper

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.861
reproduction and get the deals with all of
the enormous number of

00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:02.910
different copyright owners to be able to do
something like that.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:08.470
And while Google has taken on very big challenges
like that, when

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.650
you're talking about a huge explosion of opportunities,
really the

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.510
spilling into the open spaces is probably
where -- where we have to

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.850
start before we can start trying to adjust
copyright law to -- to deal

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.850
better with sheet music.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:23.880
Emily Nagle Green: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.309
I completely take your point, and I'm sure
you're right about -- about

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:32.429
that.
What I think over the long term is, I think

00:30:32.429 --> 00:30:36.710
maybe our kids or maybe
some of you, will ultimately look back and

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:42.020
the -- what seems now like
the conventional outlook on intellectual property,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.450
I think will
ultimately look quite quaint.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.900
And I think it will look like a blip in the
long path of human

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.039
civilization that for, you know, maybe half
a century, we thought that

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:58.690
there had to be a choke hold on people's creations,
their words, their

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.740
music.
Because it wasn't the case in the Middle Ages.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.740
You know, there was no sense of ownership
of things.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:07.581
And I think we're moving to a new model that's
going to look more like

00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:10.679
that.
But you're right, in the meantime, there is

00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:16.990
a transition because
there's an incredible intransigence of the

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.330
established economy around
ownership and the revenues associated with

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.000
that.
But nonetheless, it's definitely going to

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.809
change.
Just how long it's going to take, and aren't

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:24.740
there really interesting
things for Google to do in the meantime is

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.740
probably the question.
Yeah?

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.740
You should take the mic.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had a question.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:36.690
Emily Nagle Green: Yeah, okay.
Go for it.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:49.440
&gt;&gt; So I had a quick question about the map
that put up earlier, and the

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:58.380
different kind of Anywhere countries that
you thought would materialize

00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.780
by 2013, and they were like clearly all developed
and already very

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.070
wealthy countries.
And what do you think this kind of explosion

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.070
of technology and
connectivity within these already wealthy

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.289
and like very privileged
countries, like what kind of bearing would

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:04.570
that have in like the
relative development of developing countries?

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.910
Because I think this will provide a great
amount of opportunity for

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.190
people who are already connected but for countries
who are not even --

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.520
not even close to that like how will that
match up?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:20.450
Like, do you have like a sense of what that
will be?

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.890
Emily Nagle Green: I understand what you're
asking, I think.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.340
I actually think that it -- at the end of
the day, if we would be able

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.210
to measure the individual benefits that come
from the explosion of a

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.450
ubiquitous global network, it will be greater
for individuals,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.770
ultimately, outside what we now think of as
the developed regions.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.250
And the reason is that while they may not
have in ten-years time, they

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:49.270
may not have a network, a sense of abundance
that's as squanderable as

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.049
we will have.
They may not have been fiber to the home,

00:32:52.049 --> 00:32:57.120
and they may not have 4G or
5G or 6G, they will have the first digital

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.460
infrastructure they've ever had.
And where the digital infrastructure that

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.280
we have here is evolving, it
supplements existing infrastructure.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.250
I could still get a newspaper on my doorstep
every day until the Boston

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.330
Globe gives up the ghost, right?
And I still have banks that I can go to, I

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.140
have brick and mortar stores
that I can go to.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.361
So if the Internet melted down tomorrow, I
would be very sad but I

00:33:21.361 --> 00:33:25.990
wouldn't be unable to get on with my life.
I could go to stores and do my banking and

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:30.320
get my news.
But where the network is emerging, even in

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.480
a more limited form, and
wireless networks through very limited feature

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.159
phones or maybe the very
cheap smartphones, I hope, that's the first

00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:44.320
time people are having
access to information, banking, connecting

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320
them to the health care
environment.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.620
So their experience might not be something
that's going to support the

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.890
evolution of four dimensional smell-o-vision
or whatever you guys

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.840
invent next.
It's going to be more life-changing for them

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.250
cause it's going to give
them their first ever opportunity to participate

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:04.030
in a larger economy.
So I think ultimately the innovations that

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:08.339
will come from getting the
next, you know, 3 or 4 billion people connected

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:12.200
to the network those
innovations might be more meaningful to all

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.809
of us in society.
And I think the sources of innovation may

00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:20.819
shift from thinking of them
as Silicon Valley and Cambridge and Western

00:34:20.819 --> 00:34:23.940
Europe, and the sources of
innovation might actually be those places

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.559
that are desperate to have
the advantages that they don't have today

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:31.099
like India, where incredibly
creative things are getting done right now

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:34.409
with very cheap phones and very limited wireless
networks.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.359
I don't know if that answers your question.

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:43.210
&gt;&gt; So I'd be interested to find out, like,
what you see is happening

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.129
with the transfer-open Internet, cause I feel
like a lot of these

00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:48.719
forecasts assume that the network will stay
open and it's not going to

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:54.960
be throttled and cross-associated with -- so
as a prognosticator, what

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.809
do you see happening in the next couple years
with that?

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:00.339
Emily Nagle Green: It's a good question, and
I will say that there's

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:03.569
an entire chapter in the book that deals with
what I would call black

00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:07.589
swans, which are things that could threaten
the assumptions that we

00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:14.890
make at Yankee Group about this happy future.
There's no question that regulation and other

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:22.640
legislative constraints
could threaten some of the assumptions we

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640
make.
And one of which is that the Internet will

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640
 -- or that the larger
network will be an open place.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.749
So we do go into some detail to acknowledge
those, because while it's a

00:35:28.749 --> 00:35:29.749
convenience to make certain assumptions, it's
not fair to go forward

00:35:29.749 --> 00:35:34.869
without saying, gee, there are some substantial
threats.

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:38.980
Net neutrality in the US and elsewhere is
a really, really big issue.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.230
I'm very concerned that it plays out in a
way that's fair to the people

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.650
that build networks and fair to the people
that want to use networks.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.920
It's on a better path right now, today, than
it was 6 months ago,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.710
maybe, or two years ago.
But that's a threat.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.220
Maybe not getting enough of the network built
out is a threat, if

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.390
mobile operators don't make swift and steady
moves toward 4G

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.219
technologies, that drag their feet for whatever
reason.

00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:10.559
That's a threat.
There are a lot of things that could make

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:17.009
our picture a little less
happy in the future than I what I described.

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:19.230
Do you have a comment?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.609
&gt;&gt; I have a question.
So most of us are here today not because we

00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:25.829
don't have computers with
network access at home, but in order to have

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:28.400
in-person interactions
with the other people here, right?

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.099
And people are kind of fundamentally social
in an in-person way, and I

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:36.200
wanted to ask how you see that interacting
with the increased data

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200
access anywhere?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.329
Emily Nagle Green: Yeah, well I think back
to my concept,

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:44.290
I'm waiting for somebody to invent four dimensional
smell-o-vision.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.979
I mean, that's my standard joke that, you
know, as long as there's

00:36:47.979 --> 00:36:51.029
squanderable abundance in the network, someone
will come up with

00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:55.760
something cool to do whether it's shipping
x-rays to India so they can

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.420
be examined by less expensive medical staff
overnight, or, you know,

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.970
creating something like YouTube.
I had a very, very early video conferencing

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:07.599
system years ago when I
lived abroad and I led a group of people in

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.839
Europe.
And we had one of those very early systems,

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:15.470
and I was absolutely dogged
in my insistence that the company use it and

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.339
that everybody be trained
on it.

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:20.439
And it was stunningly difficult and painful
experience for all of us.

00:37:20.439 --> 00:37:24.564
And when I finally relented over my insistence
that we use it,

00:37:24.564 --> 00:37:28.229
everybody in the company took a huge sigh
of relief.

00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:31.829
Okay, Emily is not going to be a, you know,
video conferencing-manic

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:37.059
person anymore.
But tele-presence experiences through things

00:37:37.059 --> 00:37:41.769
like the Cisco system that
a lot of people have experience with now are

00:37:41.769 --> 00:37:45.029
already dramatically
different than those early experiences.

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:48.450
You can read the notes that people are taking
on another site.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:54.999
You can see the sweat on somebody's brow.
So even for things as important as face-to-face

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:59.961
job interviews, they
are proving to be reasonable substitute, a

00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:02.940
substitute.
I think you look at what's happening there,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.640
and you look at what's
happening in my old field, which is special

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.440
effects in the
entertainment business, and you look at the

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.809
maturation of that
technology as evidenced by Avatar, you know,

00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:16.869
3-D and motion capture,
that makes the things that I worked on 20

00:38:16.869 --> 00:38:17.930
years ago look
extraordinarily primitive.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.799
So that's a long way of saying that while
none of those experiences are

00:38:22.799 --> 00:38:28.279
really a substitute for being in this room
 -- and apologies to the DVR

00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:32.880
participants -- I do think the substitutes
for being in face-to-face

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:41.910
experience are going to gradually get better.
I don't know if that -- do you agree?

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:46.970
&gt;&gt; I certainly agree they're getting better.
I remain undecided as to whether I think they

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.509
will ever become good
enough that they're seen as an essentially

00:38:49.509 --> 00:38:51.869
perfect substitute or
whether there's something about being there

00:38:51.869 --> 00:38:54.200
in person some, some
ineffable something that people will always

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200
value.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200
Emily Nagle Green: Yeah.
You might be right.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.960
You might be right.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.160
Comment?

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a question about when you talk
about the squanderable

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.460
resource, I'm reminded of a comment that the,
you know, the high honcho

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.960
at AT&amp;T made and then immediately regretted
about how, you know, 80

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.910
percent of their network bandwidth was being
used by like one or two

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.589
percent of their users and maybe we'll have
to go by pay by the

00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:30.450
megabyte pricing.
And certainly, at certain places, we take

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:34.519
for granted that Wi-Fi is
available everywhere but you step outside

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:39.599
of the high tech arena, and
you know, it's not.

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:42.880
And I'm sort of curious, you know, especially
we do something like 4-D

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.469
smell-o-vision, it's going to take a lot of
bandwidth.

00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:49.370
And there seems to be this hidden assumption
that a lot of us make, that

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.759
eventually, we don't have to worry about bandwidth
or availability

00:39:53.759 --> 00:40:00.589
everywhere, that the model is pay 40 to 100
bucks a month, and you get

00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:03.960
all you can drink.
And do you believe that's a fair assumption,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.369
and if not, what might
have to change?

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:10.250
Emily Nagle Green: Well, the electrical industry
has been through

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:15.630
this, right?
And we don't -- none of us believe that electricity

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:20.960
should be free to
everyone, I don't think, if we took a poll.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.569
However, we do expect it to be everywhere,
and we do expect its cost to

00:40:24.569 --> 00:40:29.880
be minimal, and we expect other people to
bear the cost for us in

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:35.660
places like airports and what not.
We don't expect to have to pay directly for

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.140
electricity.
And as much as the network operators who make

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:42.519
up, to be honest, a large
portion of my client base, so it's tough to

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:45.190
 -- it's tough to say this
-- but, you know, one of the jobs of being

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.529
an analyst is to speak truth
to power.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.749
It's tough for them to hear that analogy because
they don't like the

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:57.690
idea that they will be as uninteresting and
as un-central to our future

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:03.460
as a utility provider is, because that's just
not really a sexy

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.799
business to be in.
And they want to be, you know, a much more

00:41:04.799 --> 00:41:07.369
central player in that
world.

00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:11.779
But I think we are moving towards a world
where connectivity, in order

00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:15.079
to be pervasive and in order to do all the
things we want it to do we

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:18.870
will really demand economy in the provision
of that.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.229
But the problem that we have in the -- in
the progression towards that

00:41:23.229 --> 00:41:27.330
future is that we have a bunch of businesses
who are used to having a

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.789
subscription relationship with you.
And so they, they're having to let go of the

00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:38.250
idea that every device
that you add isn't an opportunity for another

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:44.019
bill to your house.
And they're having trouble thinking about

00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:48.329
how their business models can
shift to be very different than what they

00:41:48.329 --> 00:41:51.170
are today.
And the -- the near term thing that frustrates

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.959
me the most some days is
that they're having a hard time moving towards

00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:58.640
different ways of
charging you for providing the service.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.989
I think a lot of us would be okay with the
more of something you

00:42:01.989 --> 00:42:05.780
consume, the more you should pay.
I don't think any of us think that's an unfair

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.700
economic principle, but
one of the problems with implementing it is

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.769
that a lot of consumers
don't understand what is a megabyte or a gigabyte.

00:42:14.769 --> 00:42:20.739
That's a bewildering unit of measurement.
So, you know, why shouldn't they be charging

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:26.259
me for, you know downloading 20 songs or you
know what I song is.

00:42:26.259 --> 00:42:31.209
I have a sense of that entity.
And their move towards charging models that

00:42:31.209 --> 00:42:36.210
are simple for consumers to
understand and would allow them to feel less

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.690
victimized by our
consumption.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:43.670
They're moving in that direction very slowly.
And I think that's a problem for them.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:43:08.750
And they may suffer the consequences of that
slow move.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:09.750
But it's in their hands.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:10.750
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.750
Emily Nagle Green: Oh, I would love to.
I thank you for the invitation.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:15.640
I was going to say one thing that, in closing.
The very last page of the book -- I think,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.770
I'm going to grab a copy and
read it.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:23.285
As I recall, it's the last or the next to
the last page of the book,

00:43:23.285 --> 00:43:28.900
there's a line in here.
I told you I met Steve Vinter last year, and

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.229
I was almost finished with
the writing of the book.

00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:35.749
And on page 250, on the bottom it says, "I
met an executive recently

00:43:35.749 --> 00:43:39.400
who happened to mention that he left his old
job for a new position at

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.869
Google because it offered him a chance to
change the world."

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:49.049
That was Steve, and it stuck in my mind.
And I thought what a marvelous source of inspiration.

00:43:49.049 --> 00:43:52.089
And so I applaud you for all of you trying
to change the world, and I

00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:55.059
think the network that's emerging is going
to help a lot of other

00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:58.680
people to change the world as well.
Thanks for your attention.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680
Thanks.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:43:59.681
[applause]
