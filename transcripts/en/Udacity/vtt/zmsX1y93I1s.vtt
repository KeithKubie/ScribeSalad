There are ways you may have over thought this question, but I wasn't trying to

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:05.932
be tricky here. The truth is that to go from San Jose all the way to San

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:09.388
Francisco, we have to pass through every single one of these stations listed

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:14.440
here, since their all along the path. That makes perfect sense. They're in

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.127
between the starting point and the ending point. So to go from here to here, we

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:20.453
have to pass through what's in between.
