00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.200
All right, and if you know, if you were paying attention as

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.980
we were going through this, these are all very common, and realistic

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.060
things. So, you know these are all true, these are all sources

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.300
of error. And this is why we really need to be careful when

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.940
we fit our data. We don't want to fit the error itself,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.250
we want to just fit the underlying signal. So let's talk about how

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.847
we might be able to figure that out. How can we, how

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.587
can we get a handle on what the underlying function really is apart

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:28.780
from the errors and the noise that are, that are in it.
