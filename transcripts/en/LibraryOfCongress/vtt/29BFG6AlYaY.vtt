00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.066
&gt;&gt; Kate Julian: Hello and welcome!

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.933
My name is Kate Julian
and I'm the deputy editor

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.296
of the Sunday Outlook section
of the Washington Post.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.530
The post is very proud
to be a charter sponsor

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.010
of this festival again this year.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.023
Before I move onto my remarks
I want to remind all of you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.666
that the pavilions presentations
are being filmed for the Library

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.556
of Congress' website
and for their archives.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.926
Please be mindful of this as
you enjoy the presentation.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.636
In addition, please do not sit on
the camera risers that are located

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.936
in the back of the pavilion.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.070
Thank you.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.593
It's my great pleasure
to be here today

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.716
to introduce Newbery medal award
winning author Rebecca Stead.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.510
[ applause ]

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.333
&gt;&gt; Kate Julian: Rebecca has been
writing since she was a child,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.420
but until relatively recently she
worked as a lawyer, not as a writer.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.560
She did some writing on this side
but it was always writing for adults

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.053
until as she puts it
the universe intervened.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.103
One of her sons when he was 3

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.680
or 4 accidentally pulled her
laptop off the dining room table

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.116
with it went all the very
serious grown up stories

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.403
that she had been working on.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.003
Rebecca said this about
what came next,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.846
it was time to write something new,
something joyful to cheer me up,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.286
I was pretty grouchy
about the loss of stories.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.720
I went to a bookstore, bought an arm
load of books that I remember loving

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.600
as a kid, I read them, I went back
to the store and bought more books.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.706
I read them and then
I began to write.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.693
We are so lucky that she did.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.693
Rebecca's first novel, First Light,
tells the story of a boy named Peter

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.553
who joins his parents on
an expedition to Greenland

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.853
where they are studying
global warming.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.000
While on the ice cap he encounters
a 14 year old girl named Thea

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.306
who has never seen
the sun because she

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.936
and her people long ago retreated
to a secret world beneath the ice.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.746
First Light was greeted by
reviewers as an exciting, engaging,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.706
mix of science fiction, mystery and
adventure and as an intriguing look

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.353
at how global warming is
affecting the Arctic regions,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.260
deftly woven into a
coming of age story.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.103
Her second novel When You Reach Me,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.826
the recipient of this year's Newbery
medal is that much closer to home,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.106
on the upper west side of
Manhattan during the 1970s.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.896
This is the neighborhood
in which Stead grew up

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.286
and it is the same
neighborhood in which she

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.026
and her children live today.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.513
When You Reach Me revolves
around Miranda,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.893
a 6th grader whose
world starts to unravel

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.906
when her best friend
Sal is punched by a kid

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.350
on the street for no obvious reason.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.726
Then starts to shut
Miranda out of his life.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.336
Meanwhile the apartment she shares
with her mother is broken into

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.636
and she starts receiving
a mysterious series

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.370
of anonymous notes, which
correctly predict the future.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.530
When You Reach Me has already
attracted a very devoted following

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.830
of readers for hailing
it as a future classic,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.106
one in the tradition of, tradition

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.506
of Madeline L'Engle's,
A Wrinkle in Time.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.463
Please join me in welcoming
Rebecca Stead.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.510
[ applause ]

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.380
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Hi!

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.980
Wow! It is a great, great
pleasure to be here.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.900
In the past few months you know I've
gotten invited to some bigger things

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.500
and this is no doubt
the biggest so far.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.153
So I'm going to begin if you
can't hear me, can you please wave

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.410
and I'll try to project
a little bit better

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.283
because I really think
it's frustrating

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.616
to sit and just hear muffle.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.993
So please do wave at me if
you can't understand me.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.140
I'm going to start by reading you
an excerpt of the instructions

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.690
to the authors appearing at
the National Book Festival.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.103
Presentation guidelines: We
ask for personal thoughts.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.953
These are excerpts,
so I'm skipping words.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.676
Not traditional readings.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.963
Another way of looking at it,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.290
we want to feature the
author's personal perspective

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.236
and personality.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.783
Some authors spend part of their
presentation talking about how

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.343
and why they became a writer.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.050
Poets may read complete poems, but
should not read very long poems.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.060
Okay, I'm not going to read
you a very long poem and I,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.640
I was trying to think you know
how I could tell you a little bit

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.110
about my personality.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.510
It's not that easy, but you
know I think a pretty good way

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.156
to start might be telling you
about a dream I have last night.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.483
So last night there was this swank
author's party and it was fabulous

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.663
and there were really good cup
cakes and it was you know one

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.190
of the fancier things I've
been invited to and I went back

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.696
to my hotel room early so I would be
rested for today and fresh for you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.563
and I had you know
demented stress dreams.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.060
So here's the dream
I had last night.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.466
I dreamed that I was going to be
filming a short scene in a movie

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.973
and so the next day I was going
to have to get up and say some,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.426
I had some lines I had memorized,
so I, I, I got to the filming spot

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.890
and I, I had my lines perfectly
memorized, I like to be in control,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.090
and they said okay great,
so we'll take care of that

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.526
and then we're going to
do the second scene and I,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.200
I had no idea what
the second scene was.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.943
So I said what, what, what's
the second, what's the story

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.716
in the second scene, so
the second scene turned

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.050
out to be a long wordless story
about a dog who falls in love

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.583
with another dog and I was to
play the dog who falls in love

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.853
and I was going to, you know be
expected to go around on all fours

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.493
and you know fall in love as a dog.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.530
And you know I think these dreams
are helpful to us as people

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.083
because we wake up and instead
of thinking oh boy I have to get

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.293
up in front of a lot of
people today, you get up

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.500
and you think thank god I don't have

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.240
to do what my sick brain
was just coming up with.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.186
So I do want to tell you a little
bit about how I became a writer

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.920
and I want to save at least
half of our time for questions

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.630
because you know what's really
special about me here is

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.266
that this is an, a blog you know
it's not twitter, it's not facebook

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.686
where you know and I love those
things, I, I like feeling sometimes.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.820
I like being in touch with
the people that, that way

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.176
but this is something special, I
mean we're all here in this time

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.023
in place together, we're looking
at each other face to face and I,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.186
I would love to answer
questions, that's,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.463
that feels like a conversation
and it feels natural

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.990
and it is what I like best.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.790
So okay here is my brief
story about becoming a writer.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.453
I am born not too long after
that my parents split up,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.073
so I grew up in New York City
as an only child of divorce

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.706
and I have really terrific
truly wonderful parents

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.743
and I had a very happy childhood,
which included a lot of time alone.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.773
And I spent a lot of time
reading, and when I finally hit

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.250
that sweet spot where
books could take me places,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.636
where I wasn't working to read,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.076
but I was just sort
of writing the story.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.900
I, I, I became really
emotionally entangled with books.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.676
I, I felt incredibly strongly
about them to the point

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:17.426
where I didn't even
really liked talking about,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.080
about books with people because
those felt like my, my places

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.776
and they were personal to me and
if you have been there that's great

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.016
for you, but I don't really want
to think about it because they felt

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.416
like private special worlds.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.656
And Solbelo, who for some
young people here is a writer,

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:47.256
said that a writer is a reader who
is moved to emulation and I think

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.150
for many, many people
at least that is true

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.363
and it is absolutely true of me.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.990
The only thing is there is a lot
of fear mixed in with my desire

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.313
to write and you know I don't
even know if it's a bad thing,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.706
but that fear stopped from
trying to write for a long time.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.503
I started writing in my head, but
I wouldn't put things down on paper

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.990
and I think the reason was that I
was afraid of being disappointed.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.526
I was afraid that what was
on the paper wouldn't live

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.980
up to my own fantasy really
of what my book would be

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.553
and you know I've talked to a
lot of people who seem to feel

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.410
that this is really a major obstacle
to, to writing, a lot of people walk

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.220
around wanting to write and I
have a theory that you know every,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.653
every kid knows ten people or couple
of people who write all the time

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.213
and who have big stacks of
stories and I think for every kid

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.163
who is compelled to write and who
has stacks of, of you know stuff

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.916
to show for it, there's a kid who
has a, a, like a burning desire

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.526
to write, but who isn't putting
down any words at all and I think

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.970
that both of those kids
can become writers.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.910
It's probably going to take
the second one a lot longer

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.123
than it's going to take the first
one, but they can both get there

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.630
and I was that kid who was
writing in my head but I never,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.130
I didn't get many things down
unless I was specifically assigned

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.710
to do so.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.243
Okay, so I, I think I can
really describe my childhood

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.190
as stepping toward writing
and then away from it.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.343
So in high school I worked in the
program office of my high school

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.716
so that specifically so
that I could get myself

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.070
into a creative writing
class which was taught

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.950
by a great writer named
Frank McCourt

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.476
and everybody wanted yes he's,
was wonderful and everybody wanted

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.790
to get into this class and you
know your chances just weren't

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.426
that great, there were a lot of
people in my high school class

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.730
and you really couldn't
take it till you're a senior

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:11.860
and then even then your
chances were pretty slim.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.736
And so I decided that I would
work in the program office

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.863
because this was back in the
day where someone just wrote

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:20.246
down your program on your card
and I figured that I could just

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.493
if I didn't get it I would just
change it, which I actually didn't

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.673
so I spent you know my lunch period
for about three months working

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.290
in this office filing so that
I would have the opportunity

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.230
to do that.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.566
But then with all of that passion
and, and need to be in this class,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.026
the way he taught was to encourage
us to write and then to have a stand

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.143
up and share and read and
that was how it worked

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.786
and I could never stand up, I
mean the entire class went by

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.360
and I could never get up on my feet.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.270
And you know that was
a lost opportunity

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.710
because that's how the class worked.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.860
After college okay there is that,
this big moment college I skipped

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.993
because I, I mostly
studies psychology,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.830
I did take a college write, I did
take a creative writing class,

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.436
but again I dropped it, it's
that stepping away you know

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.943
which I think was about fear.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.653
So after college there's that big
moment you know you're deciding,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.003
everyone's asking you what
you're going to do with your life

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:28.863
and I decided that I would go to
law school which is what I did

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.463
and the reason I went
to law school was

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.970
because I had taken a practice LSAT
test and done pretty well on it

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:41.816
and I thought oh well
here is something I'm,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.043
I'm good at so that's
what I should do.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.910
And instead of sort of facing the
unknown and some you know writing

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.943
which is what I think
was the closest subject

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.390
to my heart I thought you know
what it, it would be easier

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.820
to do something that I know
I'm going to be pretty good at

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:04.986
and so there are these
you know years and years

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.393
of tiny steps forward and back and
it was during my years as a lawyer

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.173
that I finally started moving
toward writing in a more serious way

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.526
and I think it must have been
because I finally got old enough

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.793
to see that I really was at the
point where I was going to have

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.410
to start you know working
harder toward my dream.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.183
And you know I have one other, I'm
at my point where I really want

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.886
to take questions but I want to say
one other thing, which is that even

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.940
after I decided I'm going to write
this is what I'm going to do,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.146
this is what I care about most.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.650
I, I wouldn't, I didn't tell
people and again it was that desire

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.473
to protect myself from
disappointment I think

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.626
and then I got an encouraging
letter from my editor Wendy Lamb

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.980
after I sent her a manuscript
from my first novel First Light

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.676
and her letter basically said
there's something here but it needs

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.253
to be honed, it needs to
be stronger and tighter

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.283
and she helped me create a writing
community which is something

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.723
that is essential I
think to every writer.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.063
We really need each other
even though we work alone

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.146
and she helped me create a
community of writers and even

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.106
when I was working with
these writers on this book

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.686
which I then actually had
hopes of getting published,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:43.970
at this point I was forced to
admit to a few you know friends

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.663
that I was trying to write

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.506
and you know I constantly
put down my own work.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.913
I would say I'm working on my
stupid book and you know again I,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.950
I was trying to protect myself
from disappointment by putting

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.976
down my work I think before
somebody else could do that for me

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.916
and so what I want to tell you
is that doesn't work at all.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.903
It doesn't first of all it doesn't
feel good to call your work stupid

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.010
and I'm assuming that I'm talking to
at least a few aspiring writers here

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.933
and second it doesn't protect
you from the disappointment

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.480
because there is no protecting
yourself when you're doing something

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.263
that is meaningful to you.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.756
So there you have my personality
and my path to being a writer

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.286
and what I would love to do, I'm
really hoping you have questions

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.640
if you want to just say them
from your seat I can repeat them

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.893
or there is also two microphones
that anybody can come up to

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.060
and ask a question about writing
or New York, life, oh I had it,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:58.620
I could, oh good someone's
going to a microphone,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.633
it's going to say could read,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.466
but I for actually one thing Frank
McCourt did if nobody would stand

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.466
up to read their creative work,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.000
we had this grammar book
called Warrener's I don't know

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:13.506
if it's still around, but if
nobody stood up he would just sit

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.243
on his desk in the front of the
room and he would sing Warrener's,

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.876
Warrener's, Warrener's,
except he sang

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:23.570
in this wonderful Irish [inaudible]
so it was great and that was

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.183
like the threat you know,
either get up and start talking

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.643
about your fiction or
we're going to do grammar.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.293
So I don't want to
resort to that, yes.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, in your book When You Reach
Me why didn't you start each chapter

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.993
with things that [inaudible].

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.660
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Okay, so in
When You Reach Me one thing I want

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.660
to say is let's avoid spoilers

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:48.890
because When You Reach Me
has a big surprise at the end

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.306
and if you could form your
question and that this,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.953
this is not a spoiler,
it's a great question,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.336
but if everyone could form questions
that don't reveal the ending

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.236
of the book that will be terrific.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.170
So in When You Reach Me, Miranda,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.013
the main character a 12-year-old
New Yorker living in the 1970s

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.756
with her single mom and
her mom has just gotten

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.210
on to the $20,000 pyramid right
and she's going to compete

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.073
and they're finally going to have
it made because money is a struggle

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.546
and Miranda helps prepare her
mom for the game and a lot

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.736
of what the game is, is
guessing categories and so

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.473
as Miranda is trying to
untangle a very complex,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.443
weird story in her mind,
right, which is sort of a lot

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.326
of what the book is, she
is stinking in categories

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.406
because at the same time she's
trying to untangle this mystery

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.300
of these anonymous
notes she's receiving

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.140
and various other mysteries
in her life.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.563
She's helping her mom
practice and the big money

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.576
around in the $20,000 pyramid
involves seeing a list of things

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.330
and then understanding
what unites them,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:04.486
what is the common denominator.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.420
So she is framing her
own story in categories.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600
Yes?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.266
&gt;&gt; When You Reach Me was little more
dark and serious than First Light,

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.400
you know I was wondering the
next book you're going to write,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.820
if you're going to write
another one will be more

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:24.786
like When You Reach
Me or First Light?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.640
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: That's
an interesting question,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.906
will the next book be more like
When You Reach Me or First Light.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.040
The main characters at this
point in my next book is a boy

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.933
and First Light is told partly
from the point of view of a boy,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.863
there's two characters, one the
boy, one the girl and I have

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.360
to say it's going to be
more like When You Reach Me,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.216
not in terms of the plot but
in term, but in its attempt

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.640
to acknowledge some of the
harder, darker sides of childhood.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.660
Yes.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:04.670
&gt;&gt; I have a question about Frank,
your class with Frank McCourt.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:09.263
Didn't he make you stand
up and read at some point?

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:11.836
I think you said you never did.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.170
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: No.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.836
He never made us stand up, he
didn't force you to stand up.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.413
Frank McCourt did not force you
stand up, he didn't call on you

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.060
and you know may be he
should have, I don't know,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.800
I might have just collapsed
on the spot.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200
Yes.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.143
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
write When You Reach Me?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.190
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Ah,
the plot was inspired

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.650
by a newspaper article I read
about a man with amnesia.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.263
It was a story in the
times about a guy

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.816
in North West part of the country.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.353
He was walking around and he
realized he had no idea who he was

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.110
or where he's from and he
started going up to people

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.706
on the street and asking for help.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.163
He eventually, they all
ran away from him of course

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.396
and he eventually found a
police officer who brought him

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.376
to a hospital and under hypnosis
he remembered things that,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.673
he remembered a terrible accident
and when, when they finally figured

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.793
out who this guy was, this
accident had not yet happened.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.803
So it, this whole story just gave
me the idea about people walking

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.603
around with memories of their
futures and that was the inspiration

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.166
for the plot and then a lot
of the story was inspired

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.430
by my own childhood in New
York City, it's set in the time

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.156
and the place of my growing up
and one the main characters,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:45.030
the laughing man is someone who, who
we called the laughing man who stood

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.270
on my corner pretty much all
the time and I was afraid of him

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.696
and I would run by him, you know
at a full sprint everyday on my way

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.673
to school and that character became
woven into the story and along

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.143
with a lot of other
memories of childhood.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080
Yes.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.333
&gt;&gt; What book do you think
you enjoyed more and why?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.293
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Enjoy writing.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.893
&gt;&gt; No, what, yeah writing.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.210
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: You know I
actually think that my first novel,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.910
First Light, was an attempt
to create the kind of story

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.870
that I loved reading as a kid.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.853
I was a big fantasy and science
fiction fan and I loved secrets

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.323
and mysteries and secret
worlds and I think that a,

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.360
I drew a lot of inspiration from my
own love of reading and so it kind

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:44.730
of led me toward the kinds of
books I loved reading as a kid.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.163
The second book is much, a much
more of a delving into the kind

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.890
of person I was as a kid and
the kind of weird thoughts I had

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.530
as a kid and it is a little darker
in a way and, and truer probably

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.043
to who I am and who I
was you know at 11, 12,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.913
13 and they're completely different
types of pleasure you know.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.393
I loved writing both of them.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.070
I think the second one was
probably a little bit more organic

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.983
because I was just pulling stuff

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.583
out of my brain and,
and out of my memory.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.406
So I, I guess I'm avoiding
your question.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.366
I'm sorry, it's so hard to say, but
I, I think if I had to lean one way

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.330
or the other I would say
When You Reach Me had some,

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.696
some moments of intense
like pleasure,

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.526
like I'm finally expressing
what I feel about somethings

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.493
and what I think about childhood
and that was pretty wonderful.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.510
Yes.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.976
&gt;&gt; I'm a children's librarian and
read in the school library journal

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:08.526
that the reason you said the story

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.993
in the 60s was having
you contemporary was

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.256
because in the story as a
[inaudible] devices helpful

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:16.840
for Miranda to have
more freedom and I know

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.360
if my own child we were much
less supervised at that time,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.413
which do you think is better
for children developmentally

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.686
to be given the freedom or freedom
or having your more supervision now.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.846
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Wow!

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.580
I'm not an expert.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.346
I do think that kids at age 11 and
12 really benefit from the knowledge

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.836
that we see them as capable people
and we don't think that they need

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.930
to be completely protected.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.700
I mean I like every parent think
it's important to protect children

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.020
and like every person
parent or non-parent,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.133
but at the same time I think it's
important for the kids to see

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.483
that we trust them and that we
know that they're self-possessed

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.296
and that they possess judgment
and even if they make mistakes,

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.836
you know life goes on and you
know if I, I would feel terrible

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.560
if you know my 12-year-old got into
it on the street with somebody,

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.043
he would be really, really upset

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.576
and he got something
taken away from him.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.333
He would be upset by it, but
life would, life goes on,

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.003
I mean he would also get past it
and he would be okay and so I,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.793
I do think it's important to get
kids a measure of independence

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.533
as long as you know it's
ultimately basically safe.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.460
Yes.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:54.486
&gt;&gt; In your book it
talks about landing

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.633
in the Broccoli patch
and seeing yourself.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.426
I actually didn't notice that,
the first time I read it,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.816
but after I read your
book I noticed that line.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.763
Did that in some way inspire
you to write the book?

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.630
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: That
part of A Wrinkle in Time.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.096
You know actually no,
I had, Miranda was,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.186
Miranda loves the book A Wrinkle
in Time and she's carrying it

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.346
around through the
book and I wasn't sure

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:22.880
that the book was going
to stay in my book.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:24.833
I thought you know this is
sort of a prop to remind me

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.700
of the kind of kid Miranda is.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.260
But A Wrinkle in Time you
can't just throw it in there,

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.456
I mean people have a lot of
strong feelings about this book

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:36.500
and it's an important book
in a lot of ways to many,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.600
many people of different generations
and I decided to re-read the book

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:45.470
as one of the characters in my book.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.276
Now this is getting
very you know meta...

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.076
I decided you know what since a lot
of Miranda came from my own memory,

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.336
I'm going to try to read A Wrinkle
in Time from the point of view

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.270
of Marcus, who's a character
who's very unlike Miranda,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.193
right in When You Reach
Me and that was

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:05.780
when I saw it for the first time.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.326
When I sort of tried to channel
this character or Marcus who's

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.566
like a very scientific thinker and
that was one when I first noticed it

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:15.760
and then thought ooh this is
great, you know this gives me a way

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.586
to really start opening up
questions about time and reality

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.380
and what could happen and so that
is when I had the idea to use it.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.433
I mean it was not early at all in
the process of writing the book,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.253
it was like a little gift.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520
Yes?

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.676
&gt;&gt; So, in when You Reach Me
there's sort of a circular plot

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.030
and every detail comes
together in the end.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.836
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Thank you.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.970
&gt;&gt; Did it just come together
that way or did you [inaudible].

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.613
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Ah, did the
plot just come together that way,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:51.926
you know yes and no,
I sometimes think

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.343
that writing a book is a little
bit like one summer in camp,

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.576
I built this wooden box and it,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.660
it was sort of loosely assembled
it first and then I had to kind

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.406
of tighten everything at once so
that it would all come out straight

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:11.410
and it's that's kind of like good
analogy for, for finishing a book

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.460
like this because there're all
these rough eng, edges and things

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.260
that are slightly unbalanced or
off and you, you know I did want it

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.376
to be completely straight
and I wanted it

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.650
to make sense and to really satisfy.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.196
You know that was always my
question, does it satisfy

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.723
and so what we did was we
had fresh readers, my editor

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.386
and I asked people who had
never read the book before

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.853
to read it every time I had a
new draft and there were a number

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.973
of drafts and we asked them
where did you get snagged,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.330
where did you get confused,
where do this become predictable,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.060
where and you know because the
book requires a certain amount

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.053
of tolerance of confusion.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.270
You'll have to be willing
to be confused for a while

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.253
and you know I don't underestimate
the people who are reading my book

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.686
and I ask a fair amount of you
know a fair amount from the.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.416
I expect them to be working a little
when they're reading and so it was

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.616
like a long process of refinement.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.083
It, it was not just sort of
organic way that came out that way.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.490
I sort of, I had the basic idea, but
it needed a lot of little things.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.566
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Thanks.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.653
&gt;&gt; Did you watch the $20,000
pyramid yourself in the 70s.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.546
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: I did watch
the $20,000 pyramid in 70s

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.143
and actually my mom was a
contestant on the $20,000 pyramid.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.240
But she actually a surprising
number of people it turns

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.133
out have been contestants
on that show.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.083
A lot of people have come to
me and said my sister was on it

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.100
or I was on it, my dad was on it.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.200
My mom didn't win, so this was

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.683
like you know important
for me to revisit.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.380
We did win consolation
prizes including like a crate

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.610
of dentine gums that we
dutifully chewed for months.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040
Yes.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.613
&gt;&gt; How did you react when you got
the award for When You Reach Me?

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.266
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Ah,
how did I react?

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.516
I was stunned and joyful.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760


00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.020
Yes.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, I have two things,
one my mom was on Jeopardy,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.153
she didn't win either but and...

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.220
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: We should talk.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.353
&gt;&gt; Yes and my question, my question
is if you could write the book

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.796
from either point of view of Sal
or Marcus , who would you do?

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:39.753
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Sal or Marcus.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.353
That would be interesting.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.620
I don't know.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740
May be Sal.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.476
Which would you most want to read?

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.166
&gt;&gt; Probably Marcus.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.166
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Oh, Marcus then.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.020
Yes. Ah, oh, okay,
we're in overtime.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.043
So one more, okay sorry guys.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.970
Oh, I before we're done, done, I
just want to say that I'm going

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.316
to I, I ran out of time at the
reading, I mean at the signing,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.063
and some people who I wanted
to meet I didn't get to meet

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:17.100
and I'm really sorry for that
because it was a hot long line.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.893
So I, we, we try, we, we
added a short second signing,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.456
so and I have instructions, it's
going to start at if you want

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.540
to come and then 1:30, I
going to try to sign for 20

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.550
or even 25 minutes, may be
and then I'm going to sprint

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.030
to somewhere else and it's
line 14, so line 14 at 1:30,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.583
I'm going to do a little
bit more signing.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.850
Yes.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:46.250
&gt;&gt; When You Reach Me
got the Newbery,

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.676
so did you read the second
place winner, the Newbery honor.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.356
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Stead: Wow.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.423
Ah, there were a bunch
of second place.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.246
Well I don't want to you know,
they're not second place,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.010
I guess that you're,
they're honors, right.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.443
I have not read the honor books.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.223
Yeah you know what I have to say

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.416
that for a while now
I've been reading a,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.763
a lot of what you would
call adult books and I find

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:16.826
that when I'm trying to write a
new book which I have been trying

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:20.770
to do very much for
the last nine months

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.803
since before the Newbery
was announced.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.126
I've been fiddling with different
kinds of gas really you know

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.616
like other people's books are kind
of like gas in the tank for me

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.083
and so, sometimes it's
actually more productive for me

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.526
to read adult books than it is
for me to read children's books

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.406
and may be it's because it's so
different from what I'm creating.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.600
But so I have been mostly
focusing on those, so I have a pile

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.086
of books next to my bed which is
like up to here, which I'm going

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.973
to get to as soon as
finish this darn book

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.510
that I'm writing right now.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.086
Okay, thank you.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.620
It was a tremendous
pleasure to be here.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.300
