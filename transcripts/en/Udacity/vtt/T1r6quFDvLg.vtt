00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.690
Okay, here are some two by two problems.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.960
Two by two matrix problems.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.070
The situation is somewhat similar,
but not exactly similar.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.090
Once again, we're given A, B, C, and D
is unknown, and we're given six choices,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and we are to pick
one of these choices and put it in D.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.020
What is different here however is that,
this time it is not just that A is to B

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.560
as C is to D but
also A is to C as at B is to D.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.490
That's why it's a two by two matrix.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.050
So it's not just the horizontal
relationship that counts but

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.200
it's also the vertical
relationship that counts.
