GUEST SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.320
As you know, this past July
our National Council overturn

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.150
legislation made
in December that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.380
would have allowed Uranium
Resources Incorporated to start

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.280
mining near Church Rock.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.810
This is the same
Church Rock that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.020
was the site of the largest
release of radioactive material

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.490
in US history, even larger than
the Three Mile Island accident

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.740
but with much less
media coverage.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.060
Over 1,000 tons of
radioactive waste

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.190
and 93 millions of gallons
of radioactive waste

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.630
water were dumped into the
Puerco River that day in 1979.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.360
For those of you that
remember, the warnings

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.450
came late and in English only.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.670
So our people went on
with business as usual.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.850
Many of our relatives
suffered for it.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.380
To this day the
government has not

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.220
measured the health
effects of the spill.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.574
Now, within 35 years of
the Church Rock spill,

00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:05.990
there are members
of our community

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.020
that are willing to open up
our lives to mining again.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.800
Thankfully, the council's ruling
has held off URI and others.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.990
But these mining
companies were waiting

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.480
with bated breath
for any opportunity

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.130
to mine on our lands.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.790
The voices demanding access
to domestic sources of energy

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.180
are growing.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.930
We need to prepare our community
for inevitable discussions

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.230
about uranium mining.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.460
I'm not here today to
argue whether or not

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.500
we should allow mining.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.070
I know a lot of you want the
economic growth and the jobs.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.490
I'm here instead to outline
a strategy for integrating

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.730
our voices into state
and federal policy making

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.110
and to highlight the
challenges that we face.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.860
So I'll start first
with the challenges.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.080
Integrating our knowledge
into the broader discourse

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.390
will be an uphill battle.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.550
First, we face
major disadvantages

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.590
compared to the
mining companies.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.810
We don't have an
organized constituency.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.572
We can't compete with them
in terms of resources.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.280
And we don't have the
influence that they

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.350
have over politicians.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
Second, many will dismiss
us for not being scientific

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.570
and will try to argue that we're
motivated by our own interests

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.000
and, therefore, not impartial.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.440
Third, the scientific data
isn't clearly on our side yet.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.530
The scientific community
has shown that uranium

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.150
has made our community sick.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.220
But there hasn't been
enough money or time

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.800
spent on how it's made us sick.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.940
So why is that important for
us to be able to clearly share

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.860
our narrative about these health
impacts with the government

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.660
and broader public?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.670
And why is it important
that we ourselves

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.940
understand the full
extent of these impacts?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.730
Because the government and
corporations have failed us.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.090
Not just failed us, they've
dismissed and rejected us.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.120
So moving forward,
what is our strategy?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.680
First, we will
develop a task force

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.790
that will be in charge of
mobilizing community members

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.400
and spearheading an
outreach program to let

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200
our community know
about the efforts

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.240
to reduce local knowledge
about the health

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.380
impacts of the uranium mining.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.100
Second, reach out to
the scientific community

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.690
for local partners.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.360
Several institutions such as
the University of New Mexico

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.180
and Southwest Research
and Information Center

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.790
have expressed interest
in health data.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.700
The task force can work
to get these scientists

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.440
from different institutions
to partner with us on this.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.120
Third, facilitate
the conversation

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.640
around the type of
data we should collect

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.890
with members of the
scientific community

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.230
and our own community.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.990
Fourth, train researchers
within our community

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.790
to conduct
face-to-face interviews

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.010
in English and Navajo.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.180
Make phone calls,
organize public forums

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.380
to collect data about
community health.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.050
And the data can
then be validated

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.384
through random sampling
to ensure validity.

00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:58.230
Fifth, pair
community researchers

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.240
with members of the
scientific community

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.970
to analyze and
interpret findings

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.470
in a language that
can be understood

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.390
within the scientific
community but also

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.310
within our own community.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.430
And then hold public meetings
around this information

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.520
to facilitate discussion about
the health effects of uranium

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.579
mining as well as the
impacts of the remaining

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.440
remnants of mining.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.110
Finally, the task
force should pair

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.570
with members of the
scientific community

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.760
to release findings
to local media,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.510
environmental organizations,
and to the broader public.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.570
Our strategy then is to
ensure that our community is

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.630
knowledgeable about the
impacts of uranium mining

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.660
so that we can understand
the full impact of opening

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.840
our lands up again and to
be able to translate what

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.910
we have suffered
in our own language

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.420
and technical language
necessary to make people sit up

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.310
and take notice of us.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.952
So I'll leave you with these
numbers; 29, 521, and 30.

00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:58.470
A 2000 study showed that
Navajo uranium miners

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.340
are 29 times more
likely than Navajos

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.390
that are not involved in
mining to develop lung cancer.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.700
There are now 521 abandoned
mines across the Navajo Nation.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.800
Although the federal
government is taking the lead

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.570
to clean up after
these mines, it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.540
will take billions of dollars
and hundreds of years.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.600
It's time that we
just don't have.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.920
And the mining has left scars
on our water and our land

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.170
that you can now estimate
that 30% of our people

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.770
don't have access to
uncontaminated water.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.720
The EPA has been
a valuable partner

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.080
in cleaning up old mines but
there's still much to do--

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120
sorry, but there's still much
to do in protecting ourselves.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.670
So we must convince the
government that they cannot

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.480
stand by and watch as waste from
the mining continues to seep

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.660
into our water,
land, and our bodies.
