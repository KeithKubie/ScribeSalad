hopefully and this is what we are going

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
hopefully and this is what we are going
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109
hopefully and this is what we are going
to cover first we'll talk about what's

to cover first we'll talk about what's
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.750
to cover first we'll talk about what's
consuming power and how we measure power

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
consuming power and how we measure power
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999
consuming power and how we measure power
consumption and then we're going to go

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009

your app will be affected by these

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
your app will be affected by these
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340
your app will be affected by these
restrictions and what you can do to work

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
restrictions and what you can do to work
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530
with them next I'll pass it over to a
myth to talk about what's consuming

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
myth to talk about what's consuming

power I quickly walked through how we

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
power I quickly walked through how we
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530
power I quickly walked through how we
actually estimate how an app consumes

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
actually estimate how an app consumes
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.660
actually estimate how an app consumes
power how much power it's consuming on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
power how much power it's consuming on
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.630
power how much power it's consuming on
the device these are the typical

the device these are the typical
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639
the device these are the typical
components our hardware components that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
components our hardware components that
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.300

I've highlighted some of the top

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
I've highlighted some of the top
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.740
I've highlighted some of the top
consumers you got an earful about

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
consumers you got an earful about
 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.090
consumers you got an earful about
display and how much power that consumes

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
display and how much power that consumes
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.359
display and how much power that consumes
from Chris and Alan running the CPU at

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
from Chris and Alan running the CPU at
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219
from Chris and Alan running the CPU at
high frequencies is also pretty

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
high frequencies is also pretty
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.880
high frequencies is also pretty
expensive and it's transferring data

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
expensive and it's transferring data
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889
expensive and it's transferring data
over the cell network is quite expensive

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
over the cell network is quite expensive
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.589
over the cell network is quite expensive
as well so

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599
as well so
 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.229
as well so
when each device is manufactured the OEM

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
when each device is manufactured the OEM
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.239
when each device is manufactured the OEM
provides something called a power

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249
provides something called a power
 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.879
provides something called a power
profile what the power profile contains

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889
profile what the power profile contains
 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.149
profile what the power profile contains
is the average current drawn by various

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159
is the average current drawn by various
 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.949
is the average current drawn by various
subsystems that we want to measure in

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959
subsystems that we want to measure in
 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.289
subsystems that we want to measure in
real time and for example you know if

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299
real time and for example you know if
 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.330
real time and for example you know if
you turn the screen on at minimum

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
you turn the screen on at minimum
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.949
you turn the screen on at minimum
brightness it might be about 100

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
brightness it might be about 100
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.440
brightness it might be about 100
milliamps and if you crank it up to full

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
milliamps and if you crank it up to full
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.030
milliamps and if you crank it up to full
brightness depending on the technology

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040
brightness depending on the technology
 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.339
brightness depending on the technology
let's say it adds another 300 milliamps

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349
let's say it adds another 300 milliamps
 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.409
let's say it adds another 300 milliamps
so we keep track of that in real time

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419
so we keep track of that in real time
 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.849
so we keep track of that in real time
CPU at different frequencies has

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859
CPU at different frequencies has
 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.619
CPU at different frequencies has
different power consumption so here that

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629
different power consumption so here that
 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.780
different power consumption so here that
in the power profile as well at runtime

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
in the power profile as well at runtime
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.390
in the power profile as well at runtime
what we do is that there's a subsystem

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400
what we do is that there's a subsystem
 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.479
what we do is that there's a subsystem
called battery stats it tracks what each

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
called battery stats it tracks what each
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.229
called battery stats it tracks what each
app is doing it measures how long it's

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239
app is doing it measures how long it's
 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.059
app is doing it measures how long it's
consuming each of these resources like

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069
consuming each of these resources like
 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.149
consuming each of these resources like
how much CPU time at what frequency how

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159
how much CPU time at what frequency how
 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.920
how much CPU time at what frequency how
many data packets it's transferring and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930
many data packets it's transferring and
 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.649
many data packets it's transferring and
so on we take those values and then we

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659
so on we take those values and then we
 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.170
so on we take those values and then we
multiply with the power cost for each of

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180
multiply with the power cost for each of
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.649
multiply with the power cost for each of
those in the power profile and we get an

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659
those in the power profile and we get an
 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.170
those in the power profile and we get an
approximate estimate of how much how

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
approximate estimate of how much how
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.539
approximate estimate of how much how
many milliamp hours the particular app

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549
many milliamp hours the particular app
 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.670
many milliamp hours the particular app
has drained and then we rank all the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680
has drained and then we rank all the
 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.869
has drained and then we rank all the
different apps based on their

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879
different apps based on their
 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.629
different apps based on their
consumption presented to the user so

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639
consumption presented to the user so
 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.129
consumption presented to the user so
they can see that in settings and then

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139
they can see that in settings and then
 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.839
they can see that in settings and then
they can learn for themselves what's

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849
they can learn for themselves what's
 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.830
they can learn for themselves what's
really draining their battery so let's

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840
really draining their battery so let's
 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.229
really draining their battery so let's
talk about how the OS is trying to help

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
talk about how the OS is trying to help
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.969
talk about how the OS is trying to help
the user extend their battery life but

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979
the user extend their battery life but
 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.530
the user extend their battery life but
first broadly speaking there are two

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540
first broadly speaking there are two
 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.990
first broadly speaking there are two
reasons why an app runs right the users

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000
reasons why an app runs right the users
 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.759
reasons why an app runs right the users

now that's as developers that's

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189
now that's as developers that's
 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.479
now that's as developers that's
something you don't want them to not do

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
something you don't want them to not do
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.039
something you don't want them to not do
but that's a whole different topic about

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049
but that's a whole different topic about
 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.559
but that's a whole different topic about
digital well being and trying to you

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569
digital well being and trying to you
 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.179
digital well being and trying to you
know help users control how much time

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189
know help users control how much time
 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.670
know help users control how much time
they spend on apps but one note I want

couple of hours let me put it in the
 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.900
couple of hours let me put it in the
active set and maybe it can freshen up

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:01.910

work and this year we'll introduce the

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700
work and this year we'll introduce the
 

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.730
work and this year we'll introduce the
work manager in jetpack which makes

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:18.740
work manager in jetpack which makes
 

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.430
work manager in jetpack which makes
running background work easier and since

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440
running background work easier and since
 

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.610
running background work easier and since
when it hits stable it will be the

when it hits stable it will be the
 

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.460
when it hits stable it will be the
recommended way to do background work so

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:27.470
recommended way to do background work so
 

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.600
recommended way to do background work so
we're starting mind let's look at this

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:31.610
we're starting mind let's look at this

manager is your answer if this work is

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.160
manager is your answer if this work is
 

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.460
manager is your answer if this work is
triggered online then you would use a

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:51.470
triggered online then you would use a
 

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.790

FCM message with work manager meaning
you would want to use FCM message to

you would want to use FCM message to
 

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.500
you would want to use FCM message to
notify your app that there's some work

00:18:59.500 --> 00:18:59.510
notify your app that there's some work
 

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.910

would want to use alarm manager finally

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:17.990
would want to use alarm manager finally
 

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.620
would want to use alarm manager finally
if this is something that the user
