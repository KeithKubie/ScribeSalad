00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:14.099
On October 31, 1992, the Roman Catholic Church
admitted it had been wrong to condemn Galileo

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
Galilei for promoting the Copernican astronomical
theory.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.050
After a 13 year investigation into the persecution
of Galileo that led to his official condemnation

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.630
in 1633, Pope John Paul II rectified a wrong
that forced the Italian astronomer and physicist

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.750
to live the last years of his life in exile,
and worse yet, to recant his proven discoveries

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.980
to save his hide.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.590
Through his use of the telescope – a tool
he did not invent but greatly improved upon

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.460
-Galileo proved the Copernican theory that
Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.720
the solar system.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.390
This scientific fact was in direct contradiction
to certain interpretations of scripture and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.600
was therefore considered heresy at the time.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.280
The relevant text included Psalm 104:5, “the
Lord set the Earth on its foundations; it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
can never be moved…”

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.900
But Galileo had influential patrons such as
the Medicis and Barberinis, and Pope Urban

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.230
VIII happened to be a member of the Barberini
family, as well as a close friend and great

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.800
admirer of Galileo’s.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.300
Pope Urban VIII also, before being raised
to Pope, opposed a previous attempt at condemning

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.310
Galileo in 1616.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.700
In the end, the Pope allowed Galileo to continue
his study into both the Ptolemaic and the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.880
Copernican theories, on the condition that
he drew no definitive conclusion that would

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.260
contradict Church teachings.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.480
Instead, he was to merely present the cases
for and against both sides of the argument,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.780
staying neutral in the telling.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.310
Galileo agreed, but when he published “Dialogue
Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,”

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.680
it was a ringing endorsement of Copernican
thought in direct defiance of the Pope’s

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
order.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.270
However, Galileo, who was Catholic himself,
took the position that this was not in opposition

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.220
to scripture because not every passage should
be taken literally, particularly ones dealing

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.420
with lyrics to songs, a position shared by
many even among the clergy.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.810
He might have gotten away with this even still,
except for one little fact not often talked

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.810
about.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.180
The Pope had requested that Galileo include
the Pope’s own thoughts on the matter.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.819
Galileo did this, but in such a way as to
make the Pope look the fool, incorporating

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.799
his ideas into the arguments of “Simplicio,”
(with connotations of “simpleton” in the

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.550
name) who defended the Geocentric view, often
with bumbling errors in the process.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.680
It’s not thought that Galileo intended to
make fun of the Pope in doing this.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.040
He was no fool himself and even explicitly
stated in the preface that “Simplicio”

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.599
was in homage to the philosopher Simplicius.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.200
Nevertheless, Pope Urban VIII certainly felt
like he was being mocked in seeing some of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.840
his own words put into the mouth of Simplicio.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.819
Needless to say, making the Pope feel like
you were publicly calling him an idiot was

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.129
not a good idea when you’re writing already
highly controversial scientific notions about

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.139
the universe that is likely to antagonize
the Catholic church.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.780
Because of his perceived heresy, Galileo was
summoned to Rome to appear before the dreaded

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.029
Inquisition.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.319
During his trial, Galileo fervently denied
that he had advocated for the Copernican view

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.920
in his work, despite all evidence to the contrary.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.010
Despite threats of torture, he still held
onto his denial.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.439
Nevertheless, he was convicted of “suspected
heresy” and was required to “curse and

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.230
detest” the Copernican viewpoint.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.750
Galileo was placed under house arrest in his
home near Florence until his death in 1642

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.779
at the age of 77 (though was permitted to
travel to Florence to see doctors).

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.859
Beyond being under house arrest, his punishment
was relatively light compared to others who’d

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.489
been convicted of heresy.

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.719
He was, for a time, required to recite seven
psalms of penitence once per week, but Maria

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.000
Celeste, his daughter, was eventually able
to convince the church to allow her to fulfill

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.840
this punishment for him.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.110
With nothing better to do while confined to
his home, he wrote perhaps his most famous

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.739
work, Two New Sciences, which more or less
summarized his life’s work.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.099
After several failures to get this new work
published, due to the prohibition on any of

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.040
his writings, he finally found a publisher
in Holland willing to risk the Catholic church’s

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.559
ire in publishing it.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.559
Since then, the Catholic Church has taken
several steps to reverse its stance against

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.780
Galileo’s findings prior to the action in
1992.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.599
Galileo’s “Dialogue Concerning the Two
Chief World Systems” was stricken from the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.180
Index, a list of banned publications, in 1757.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.830
A preliminary report conducted in 1984 by
scientists, theologians, and historians surmised

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.090
that Galileo had been falsely condemned.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.440
Pope John Paul II concluded that he had been
“imprudently opposed.”

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.390
The leader of the investigation conducted
in 1992, Cardinal Paul Poupard, said, “We

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.340
today know that Galileo was right in adopting
the Copernican astronomical theory,” a statement

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.819
that would have put him at risk of being arrested,
and possibly executed, by his own Church just

00:04:52.819 --> 00:05:45.820
a few hundred years previously.
