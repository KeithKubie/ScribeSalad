HERBERT GROSS: Hi, our lesson
today concerns functions.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.870
And in the certain manner of
speaking, this is perhaps

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.070
where a course in calculus
should usually begin.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.370
After all, what will be studying
is a relationship

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.090
between certain variables.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
This is what we mean by
a function in general.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.220
Or at least, in particular,
with our emphasis on real

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.580
variables and graphs that
we were talking about.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.180
And what we would like to do now
is to motivate the concept

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.490
of function from a more general
point of view in terms

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.690
of the language of sets that we
have talked about and read

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.890
about in our supplementary
notes.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.230
Let's then begin with a basic
general definition of what a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.280
function is, after which we will
specialize and talk about

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.130
functions of a real
variable for the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.150
remainder of the lecture.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.720
We begin with a definition
written this way.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.360
A function f from A to B--

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.650
see, it's written this way.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.230
It means f is a function from A
to B means that f is a rule,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.990
which assigns to each element in
set A, an element in set B.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.880
Now of course, this may
sound like just an

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.570
empty bunch of words.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.180
But if we come here and look a
little bit at a picture, we

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.560
get the idea as to
what's going on.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.260
Namely, we may visualize
our sets as circles.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.050
And what does the function do?

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.740
The function assigns to each
element of A, an element of B.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.280
In fact, notice the geometric
wording again.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
This element is mapped into
this element by f.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.790
This element is mapped into
this element by f.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.010
And this element is mapped
into this one.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.710
And while we're looking at this,
perhaps it would be a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.740
good chance to emphasize not to
read more into a definition

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.220
than what's already there.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.900
You see when we say that f
assigns to each element of A,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980
what we mean is we will
not allow something

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.600
like this to happen.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.770
We will not say, for example,
let f send this element into

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.890
this one and this one.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.220
This becomes non well-defined.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.740
It becomes ambiguous.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.750
In other words, we do not want
to have to make the value

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.410
judgment as to which of two
things we are going to look

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.440
back at as being what
A maps into.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.390
And why that's the case
we'll mention

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.260
as our course proceeds.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.200
Also, notice that when we say
that each element of A is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.470
assigned to an element of B, two
things are implied here.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.890
First of all, notice that we
do not insist that all

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.460
of B be used up.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.400
You see, in other words, here's
some surplus B's over

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.760
here, which are not used up
by A's with respect to f.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.280
And secondly, whereas we
prohibit the same A from

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.920
having two different images in
B, we do not prohibit one B

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.160
from being the image of two
different elements in A. In

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.850
other words, notice that even
though both of these elements

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.280
here are assigned to the same
element in B with respect to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.070
f, there certainly is no
violation of our definition

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.970
that each element here was
assigned to an element here.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.090
By the way, this leads in the
literature to three different

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.310
terms that we should
define right now.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.560
One of these is the set A itself
and that's called the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.100
domain of f.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.470
You see this is what
f is defined on.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.250
The domain is the
set A over here.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.780
Often abbreviated--

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.570
well, there are many different
abbreviations.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.690
Sometimes one just writes D-O-M
with an f or D-O-M with

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.210
a subscript.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.560
Or a capital D with
a subscript f.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520
But we will adapt to these
notations as we need them.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.980
But for our purposes all the
domain of f is, it's the set

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.350
A. It's the set on which f
operates to assign values, ok.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.520
And then the companion to that
is the set B. And B, almost

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.170
again in graphic terms, is
called the range of f.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.460
And by the way, as you look at
the range of f, you may get

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.020
the feeling that somehow or
other, this little element

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.380
over here is kind
of out of place.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.710
That maybe somehow or other
let me just circle this.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.670
Let me call this the set C.
Somehow or other, you get the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.000
feeling that C describes much
better what f does to A than

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.930
B. Because you see, each of the
elements in C is used up

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.232
as being the image of at least
one element in A. Somehow or

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:38.240
other you see, we could have
deleted this element B without

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.130
too much loss of continuity.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.790
And to get around this we
interject still a third

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:53.790
definition, C. It's called
the image of f.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.620
You see, image verses range.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.120
Image is the part that's
actually used up

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.870
by f with the mapping.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.690
And sometimes this is even
abbreviated as follows.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.070
You use the same f as one uses
for the function and then a

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.910
capital A in parentheses
to indicate what?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.410
This is a set of all things of
the form f of x where x is in

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.420
A. In other words, again, the
standard notation if we want

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.470
to look at it this way.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.340
If we call this element here a
and this element here b, to

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.510
indicate that a was mapped into
b by the function f or

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:38.640
the rule f, we often write
that as f of a equals b.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.730
Now in many places, including
our text, there is no

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.600
distinction made between the
image and the range.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.240
And the reason for this is that
in many situations, the

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.000
image and the range turn out
to be quite the same thing.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.830
In fact, if they do turn out to
be the same thing, we call

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.220
that a rather special
type of function.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.030
Namely, the function from A to
B is said to be onto if its

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.120
image equals its range.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.125
Now again, in terms of words,
that doesn't say very much.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.030
The image equals the range.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.430
What does that mean, image
equals the range?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.650
Perhaps the best way
to see this is

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.440
by means of an example.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.420
The example I have
in mind is this.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.180
And this happens many, many
times in mathematics.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.090
One begins with a set.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.550
In this case, I picked A to be
the set consisting of the

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.900
numbers 1, 2, and 3.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.610
Frequently, one defines a
function explicitly on A

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.350
without any regard to
a second set B.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.010
For example, in this
illustration I've said, let f

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.000
of a be 4a for each a in set
capital A. Well, what are the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.700
elements of capital A?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.170
They are 1, 2, and 3.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.730
So according to this recipe,
what do we have?

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.250
Well, f of 1 is 4.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.840
f of 2, see, it's what?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.500
4 times 2 is 8.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.030
And f of 3.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.660
That's what?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.740
4 times 3 is 12.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.560
Let me now invent a new set B.
And the elements of B, as you

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.210
could probably guess, are going
to be 4, 8, and 12.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.490
And now I look at my function
f from A to B.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.750
Notice that in this case the
function from A to B uses up

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.290
all of B. In fact, in terms
of a diagram, you see

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.570
here's A. Has what?

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.539
1, 2, and 3.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.159
And here's B, which is made
up of 4, 8, and 12.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.909
Now, what does have f do?

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.490
It maps 1 into 4.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.460
It maps 2 into 8.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.780
And it maps 3 into 12.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.080
What's happened here?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.250
A has not only mapped
into B, but all of B

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.730
is used up in this.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.100
In other words, notice then that
the range of B and the

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.970
image of B in this particular
case happen to be the same.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.290
This will happen in every single
case where we start

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.620
with a set A and define a
function on A. Namely, we see

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.000
what f of x is for each x in A,
take the collection of all

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.810
those images, call that set B,
and then you see by default so

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:22.010
to speak, B will be both the
range and the image of f.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.170
And it's in this sense that in
most textbook examples that we

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.480
deal with, we need not make any
distinction between the

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.700
range of the function and the
image of the function.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.030
But roughly speaking then, just
to keep things straight,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.030
a function is called onto if the
entire range is used up in

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.110
the mapping.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.710
But if there are elements of the
range which are not used

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.510
up as images, then the function
is simply called

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.110
into, or not onto.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.370
But at any rate, this
is the concept of

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.490
what we mean by onto.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.190
Now, a second feature that one
talks about with functions

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.850
which in no way is connected
with onto, this, but which is

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.540
a very important independent
feature is something which is

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.170
called a 1:1 function.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.032
Let's look at that
for a moment too.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.910
For example, let's suppose I
have a function f defined on

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:23.930
my set A. The question is, f
maps a1 into a particular

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.850
element of B and it maps a2 into
a particular element of

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.630
B.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.840
Now, there are two possibilities
that can happen.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:42.030
One is that f of a1 and
f of a2 will be

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.660
different elements of b.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.000
In other words, what will
happen is, is that two

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.120
distinct elements of A will
have distinct images in B.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.300
On the other hand, it's
possible that the two

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.910
different elements of A have the
same element of the same

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.410
image in B.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.030
Now, by and large, whereas
nothing is wrong when this

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.440
happens, it does cut down our
operating speed to some extent

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.450
when it does.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.530
Because you see, frequently to
study a particular function,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:20.580
we may want to look at the image
rather than the domain.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.790
And somehow or other, you see if
two different elements can

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.260
map into the same element in the
image, then you see when

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.760
we look at the image we have
no way of knowing which of

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.880
these two elements we're
talking about.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.700
So in other words then, if it
should turn out that no two

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.070
different elements in A can have
the same image in B, in

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.220
other words, notice what
this thing here says.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.590
You see, if what?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.220
This is the image of a1.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.700
This is the image of a2.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.390
It says what?

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.530
If a1 and a2 have the same
image, then they must be the

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.840
same element.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.820
Now if that happens, and again
as I show you over here, it

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.950
doesn't have to happen.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.570
If that happens, the function
is called 1:1.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.060
For example, here is a picture
I've drawn in which

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.310
a function is 1:1.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.190
By the way, I've drawn this
picture so that my function f

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.330
is both 1:1.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.040
Meaning what?

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.120
That no two elements in A have
the same image in B. And

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.210
secondly, it also happened
to be onto here.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.090
Namely, no element of
B was left out by f.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.550
Now that wasn't crucial.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.040
For example, if I do this notice
now that the function

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.410
from A to B is still 1:1.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.050
No two different elements in A
have the same image in B. But

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.240
now you see the function is no
longer onto because there

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.250
happened to be elements in B
which are not mapped into

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.820
under F by elements of A.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.900
Now, what is nice of course is
that if a function happens to

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.440
be both 1:1 and onto, notice
that we can induce a new

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.770
function, which I'll call g
from B to A by essentially

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.020
reversing the arrowheads here.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.990
You see, if the function is
both 1:1 and onto, by

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.020
reversing the arrowheads,
instead of getting a function

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.900
from A to B, I do get a function
from B to A. This

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.540
function is called the inverse
function and will play a very

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.150
important role in much of our
course which follows.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.350
The important point to notice,
however, is that if the

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.510
function is not both 1:1 and
onto, you cannot reverse the

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.880
arrowheads, believe it or not.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.480
Well, you say, I can reverse
them, can't I?

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.630
Why can't I reverse
them over here?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.670
And the answer is
well, look it.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.190
If we include these being in
here, suppose we reverse the

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.690
arrowheads now.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.240
Look at B.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.930
What is the domain of g?

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.720
Well, for B to be the domain,
every element of B has to be

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.190
assigned to something
in A by g.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.520
But look at these two elements
over here, g doesn't act on

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.550
those at all.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.270
In other words, if the original
function is not onto,

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.800
then when you reverse the
arrowheads you haven't defined

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.230
the new function on your
whole domain here.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.840
In another sense, if the
function was not

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.430
1:1 when you started.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.940
In other words, suppose
this happened.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.800
So f was not 1:1.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.810
Now you see when you try to
reverse your arrowheads,

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.370
notice that the element here
in B is assigned to two

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.410
different elements in A. And
we agreed that we wouldn't

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.730
allow that to happen.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.480
OK, so far so good.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.620
Notice that that particular part
of our course has nothing

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.060
to do with real variables
and the like.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.110
Meaning when we're talking about
sets they can be sets of

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.500
arbitrary numbers.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.450
Now what I'd like to do is
zero in, on our specific

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.130
calculus of a single
variable course.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.840
And let's go back to our old
friend who somehow or other

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.960
has made an appearance
in every lecture that

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.070
we've had so far.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.770
Let's go back to s equals
16t squared.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.140
Only now, we're not going to
repeat the same old stuff that

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.250
we did before with it.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.580
We're now going to get slightly
more sophisticated.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.020
Namely, when we talk about s
equals 16t squared, what

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.700
problem was being done here?

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.470
You are assuming that there
is no air resistance.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.940
An object is being held
above the ground.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.750
You release the object and the
distance s that the object

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.080
falls in feet after
t seconds is given

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.780
by s equal 16t squared.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.570
Now if we think about that for
a while, we realize that that

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.570
does not tell the
whole picture.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.240
Obviously, the s equals 16t
squared applies only to the

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.380
time in which that object
is falling.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.800
Perhaps what we should have said
was this, that until you

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.960
release the object it doesn't
fall any distance at all.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.100
Then from the instance you
release it, it starts to fall

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.450
a distance s given
by 16t squared.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.310
Not forever, but until
it hits the ground.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.560
Let's call t sub g the
time at which this

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.040
thing hits the ground.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.230
You see this recipe that we
called s equals 16t squared is

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.930
not in effect forever.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.510
It's in effect only when t
is between 0 and t sub g.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.300
And by the way, hopefully once
the object hits the ground it

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.840
won't fall any further.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.340
In other words, for any time
after t sub g, the distance

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.830
that it's fallen is
16t sub g squared.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.570
Meaning this is the distance
that its fallen when it hits

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.380
the ground and it stays there.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.390
If we wanted to graph this, you
see, and notice how we are

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.350
refining our previous result.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.000
The graph is not this, you
see, the graph is what?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.230
The distance is 0 until
t equals 0.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.520
Then the distance that it falls
increases up till the

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.330
time the object hits
the ground.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.460
And then it levels
off like this.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.310
And by the way, in terms of
making a few asides, notice

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.720
that this curve here does
represent a 1:1 function.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.950
Namely, if you pick two
different times in this strip,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.890
you have two different
distances.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.640
Two different times cannot
yield the same distance.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.390
As opposed to the fact, let's
call this t1 and t2.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.609
As opposed to the fact that
once the thing hits the

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.830
ground, our function
is no longer 1:1.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.100
In fact, the any two values of
t once the thing has hit the

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.220
ground, we have the
same s value.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.670
In other words, what we're
saying is what?

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.830
That once the object hits the
ground, it really makes no

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.570
difference what t is,
s is still going to

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.370
be 16t sub g squared.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.990
Now that was just an aside.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.590
The reason I mentioned this is
to motivate a very important

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.250
type of domain that takes
place when we deal with

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.970
functions of real numbers.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.680
In most cases, when we do a
physical experiment it's over

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.940
some time interval.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.980
We put something into effect
and say, let's

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.900
measure it for one hour.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.420
Or let's measure if from now
until 3 o'clock tomorrow.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.990
In other words, in general,
whereas a domain of a function

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.140
can be anything we want it
to be, in most real life

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.790
laboratory situations, our
domain happens to be a

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.520
connected interval, whatever
that means intuitively.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.000
In fact, let's try to talk about
that in more detail.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.020
In other words, a very special
type of domain that one uses

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.670
when one talks about functions
of a real variable.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.805
They are called intervals.

00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:41.360
Written as sets, if a is less
than b, we talk about what?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:48.650
The set of all x which greater
than a and less than b.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.350
By the way, that's called the
open interval from a to b.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.980
It's written this way
with parentheses.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.280
The set of all elements from
less than b and greater than a

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.090
inclusively is called the
closed set or the closed

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.880
interval from a to b.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.390
And it's written this way.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.920
And pictorially, you can't
tell these apart.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.840
Namely, if this is a and this
is b, both of these

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.190
pictorially are what?

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.540
An interval as we think
of it intuitively.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.840
Namely, it's this stretch.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.670
But in one case, the endpoints
a and b are included.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.600
And in the other case, the
endpoints are excluded.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.810
They're included in the
closed interval.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.270
They're excluded in
the open interval.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.070
And again, notice that since a
point has no thickness, we

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.540
have no way of telling just by
looking at the figure which of

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.550
these two is meant unless we
draw in the appropriate

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.150
diagram this way.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.960
By the way, notice also that an
interval can be half open

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.330
and have closed.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.850
I mean, for example, one could
talk about how about including

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.970
the left endpoint but excluding
the right endpoint.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.500
See, why couldn't we talk about
something like this?

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.740
In which case we would have
written the half open half

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.120
closed interval this
particular way.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.750
Now again, this is
all notation.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.690
It's things that you
can memorize.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.990
Things that are emphasized
in the text.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.450
But the thing that I wanted to
try to have you see from the

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.220
lecture is why we concentrate
so heavily on the things

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.560
called intervals.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.300
It's because in most situations
when we deal with

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.180
functions of a real variable,
our so-called input, is

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.100
usually defined on some
continuous interval.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.220
All times from such and
such to such and such.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.300
Now, by the way again, notice
that the picture-- just as

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.810
we've been talking
about before.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.520
The picture comes in handy.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.760
Namely, 1/2 being in the open
interval from 0 to 1 does not

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.410
need a picture to
interpret it.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.410
Namely since 1/2 is greater
than 0 but less than 1, by

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.790
definition 1/2 is in
this interval.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.190
On the other hand, by use of a
picture, I think it becomes

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.810
rather easy to visualize what
it is that we're saying when

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.260
1/2 is in this particular
interval.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.220
Again, notice when somebody
says does 0

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.650
belong to this interval?

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.140
Notice that subtlety about
open and closed,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.800
point versus dot.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.410
Namely, 0 does not belong to the
open interval from 0 to 1,

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.120
but it does belong, for
example, to the closed

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.010
interval from 0 to 1.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.620
Because what is the basic
difference between these two?

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.220
In this one, the endpoints
are not included.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.300
In this one, the endpoints
are included.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.060
Now, a companion to interval is
a very important building

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.420
block of this course.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.910
It's something called
a neighborhood.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.000
Now, in terms of a definition,
a neighborhood isn't a very

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.610
exciting thing.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.790
A neighborhood of a point c, a
neighborhood of x equal c is

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.490
simply an interval which
contains c inside.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.460
You want c to be inside
the interval.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.040
Now what does that
mean intuitively?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.830
Well, what it means is pick any

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.800
interval which has c inside.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.540
Maybe we can go from this
point to this point.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.720
This would be called a
neighborhood of c.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.870
By the way, you may
notice I've drawn

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.040
this as an open interval.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.920
The idea is that we
really want c to

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.020
be inside the interval.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.180
We do not want the
situation where c

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.730
is one of the endpoints.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.740
And whereas we'll talk about
this in more detail later, the

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.760
important point is that in many
of our investigations in

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.470
calculus we will want to study
what's happening just before

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.100
we get to a certain point
and just after

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.340
we leave that point.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.330
And somehow or other, if we let
that point be at the very

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.220
end of our interval, we
have no information.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.240
For example, if that point is
the left endpoint, we don't

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.120
know what's happening before
we get to the point.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.790
If it's the right endpoint, we
don't know what's happening

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.690
afterwards.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.360
And that's why you'll find
in the textbook that a

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.500
neighborhood is defined to be
an open interval, which

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.450
contains c.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.410
In other words, we want to make
sure that c is in the

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.530
interior here.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.040
By the way, in many cases it
turns out algebraically to be

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.540
easier if this happens to be
what we call a symmetric

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.290
neighborhood.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.930
In other words, if c
is in the middle.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.300
We won't go into that right now,
but if c happens to be in

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.630
the middle that's called a
symmetric neighborhood.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.080
In fact, another way of writing
that is to say what?

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.660
Pick some definite distance h
and what do you write down?

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:41.000
You write down c minus h to c
plus h and that puts c right

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.680
in the middle of this
particular interval.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.150
And you see, the idea here is
that when you're looking at

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.760
what's happening to a function,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.280
you may lose symmetry.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.480
For example, in this particular
graph that I've

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.280
drawn, notice that at this
particular point I've marked

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.880
off equal intervals on
both sides of l.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.160
But notice that when I come down
here, they do not project

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.530
onto equal intervals on
either side of c.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.180
In other words, if this had
been a straight line.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.140
Frequently what we do in
a case like this is we

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.180
say well look it.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.690
If we're interested in seeing
what happens near c,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.380
why don't we just--

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.490
this is non-symmetric.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.280
Why don't we just take the
smaller of these two widths

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.680
and see what happens in
the symmetric part?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.310
In other words, if the
neighborhood is not symmetric,

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.420
we can always make
it symmetric.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.390
And so there really isn't that
much to worry about in that

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.490
particular respect.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.190
But why are we interested
in neighborhoods

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.210
in the first place?

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.370
And the answer is that in many
cases what we're going to be

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.680
doing is studying what's
happening near a particular

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.600
point c and want to know what's
happened just before

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.550
and what's happening
just after.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.920
The next important concept
that's connected with

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.200
neighborhoods is the idea of
a deleted neighborhood.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.600
And that in turn, is very
strongly connected with 0/0.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.940
For example, consider the
function f of x which is x

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.910
squared minus 9 over
x minus 3.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.720
If we let x equal 3, if the
input is 3, notice that the

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.580
output becomes 9 minus 9
over 3 minus 3, or 0/0.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:20.290
On the other hand, if x is any
number whatsoever except x

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.920
equals 3, no harm is done
with this as an input.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.970
Consequently, what one is
talking about now is the only

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.330
time you get that 0/0
form is when x is 3.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.350
What happens if you're in a
neighborhood of 3, but not

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.190
equal to 3 itself?

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.420
You see what I'm driving at here
is pick any number x in

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.050
this interval other
than 3 itself.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.860
And notice that f of x can
be written this way.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.870
As long as x is not equal to
3, we can cancel x minus 3

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.650
from numerator and
denominator.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.540
Remember, we can't
divide by 0.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.950
And now we see what?

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.260
That as long as x is not
equal to 3, f of x is

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.780
perfectly well defined.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.230
And consequently, this is what
motivates the concept of a

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.520
deleted neighborhood.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.560
Namely, everything is fine in
this whole neighborhood except

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.750
for 3 itself.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.980
So to avoid that unpleasantry,
let's just delete that point.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.570
And that's called a deleted
neighborhood.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.770
And you see what we do when the
neighborhood is deleted,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.450
we're still going to
talk about what?

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.830
How close you are
to that point.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.900
And by the way, this brings us
to another very fascinating

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.020
aspect of what's going on
between our geometry and our

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.990
arithmetic.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.460
Do you really talk about the
distance between numbers?

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.660
I mean, is 7 near 3?

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.116
And the guys says, well, what
do you mean, is 7 near 3?

00:26:38.116 --> 00:26:42.810
Well, I would say here that
7 is very near to 3.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.120
When you say that 7 is near 3,
you certainly don't mean close

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.090
to in the geometric sense.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.600
You mean the difference
between them is small.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.520
In other words, the next thing
that we have to talk about is

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.600
how when we talk about being
close to a point which is a

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.250
geometric term, how do we talk
about that algebraically?

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.210
You see geometrically, how do
you talk about the distance

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.890
between x1 and x2?

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.340
Well, if you're going this
way, it's just what?

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.920
x2 minus x1.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.760
If you're going the other way,
the direct distance this way,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.580
it's x1 minus x2.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.070
In any event, the distance
between these two points is

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.080
just the magnitude
of the difference

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.720
of these two numbers.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.760
And that leads, you see, to the
concept that's hit quite

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.630
heavily in our text,
and that is the

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.500
concept of absolute value.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.600
Perhaps one of the most critical
analytical geometric

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.650
topics that we tackle in our
early part of our course.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.250
Analytically, we define the
absolute value written with

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.240
vertical bars here,
x1 minus x2.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.390
The absolute value of x1 minus
x2 to be the positive square

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.140
root of x1 minus x2 squared.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.800
And in plain English all
this says is what?

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.510
See when you square and then
take the positive square root,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.930
you haven't undone what
you've done before.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.010
All you've done is what?

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.790
If it's positive here you
haven't changed anything.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.350
But if x1 minus x2 are negative,
when you square it

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.960
and extract the positive square
root, all you've done

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.690
is changed the sign just like
you're supposed to.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.060
Let me give you an example.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.800
Suppose you're faced with the
absolute value of x minus 3 is

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.710
less than 2.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.490
What does this say
geometrically?

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.930
Geometrically what it says
is that x is within

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.910
two units of 3.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:31.260
in terms of a picture, all you
have to do now is draw in 3,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.590
mark off two units on either
side, and for x to be within

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.200
two units of 3, all you
know is is that x

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.215
has to be in here.

00:28:39.215 --> 00:28:42.230
In other words, look at how
easily you can solve this

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.380
particular problem.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.680
On the other hand, you can
always go back to the basic

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.710
definition and say,
wait a second.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:54.720
This means the positive square
root of x minus 3 squared is

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.880
less than 2.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.900
So I will square both sides.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.620
If you do that you get x minus
3 squared is less than 4.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.860
If you now collect terms and
expand, you get x squared

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.630
minus 6x plus 9 minus 4.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:11.320
That's what?

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.550
Plus 5 is less than 0.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:20.920
This factors into x minus
1 times x minus 5

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.640
is less than 0.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.700
The only way the product of two
numbers can be negative is

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.970
if the factors have
different signs.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:32.790
Since this is x minus 5 is less
than x minus 1, this must

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.670
be the smaller of the two.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.560
This must be the larger
of the two.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.920
To say that x minus 1 is greater
than 0 is the same as

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.990
saying that x is
greater than 1.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.570
To say that x minus 5 is less
than 0 is the same as saying

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.800
that x is less than 5.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.810
You put that all together and
notice that even though it

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.510
wasn't quite as comfortable, we
can obtain the same answer

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.040
algebraically as we can
obtain geometrically.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.405
In other words, our relationship
between algebra

00:30:01.405 --> 00:30:04.870
and geometry remains the same.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.040
Again, when you can draw
the picture, it's

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.520
worth a thousand words.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.470
If you can't draw the picture or
you're suspicious about the

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.170
picture, especially when it
involves point versus dot,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.000
then what you do is resort to
the analytic definition.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
These do not replace
one another, they

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.750
work hand in hand.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.630
Finally, what we must talk
about now is the

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.950
arithmetic of functions.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.820
Can we combine functions
to form functions?

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.960
And the answer is yes.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.190
First of all, in talking about
the arithmetic of functions,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.360
what must we do?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.860
We must first, at least, define
what it means for two

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.980
functions to be equal.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.670
Well, for two functions to be
equal, all we insist on is

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.510
that first of all, they're
defined on the same domain.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.670
And secondly, that for each
input in the domain, each

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.660
function gives you
the same output.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.770
For example, suppose a is
a set whose elements

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.410
consists of 0 and 1.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.020
And suppose b is also the
set whose elements

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.430
consist of 0 and 1.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:09.580
One such function would be f.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.190
It maps 0 into 0.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.480
It maps 1 into 1.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.760
Another function, which
I'll call g--

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.100
see, f does what?

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.340
It maps 0 into 0 and 1 into 1.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.970
What does g do?

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.350
g maps 0 into 1 and 1 into 0.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.430
Notice that f and
g are different.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.590
They both have the
same domain.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.530
They both have the same image.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.700
But notice that element for
element, they're not the same.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.960
Namely, f and g do different
things to 0.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.780
f sends 0 into 0.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.450
g sends 0 into 1.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.860
So I can tell f and g apart.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.860
And because I can tell them
apart, they're not equal.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.010
All right, so equality means
I can't tell f from g.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.440
Now the next kind of question
is, how do you do arithmetic

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.090
with f and g?

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.660
Can I add two functions?

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.430
Can I multiply two functions?

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.250
Can I subtract two functions?

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.680
And the answer again,
turns out to be yes.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.900
And not only yes, but yes
in a rather simple way.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.460
Let's again do this by
means of examples.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.120
Suppose we defined f of x to be
2x for all x in A. Namely,

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.630
if A is 1, 2, 3, f of 1 will
be 2, f of 2 will be 4, f

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.230
of 3 will be 6.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.840
Let's define another function
on A, let's call it g.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.960
g of x will be x plus 1 for each
x in A. In other words, g

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:39.000
of 1 will be 2, g of 2 will
be 3, g of 3 will be 4.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.340
Now the point is, can I
add f of x and g of x?

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.650
Well, sure. f of x is 2x.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.490
g of x is x plus 1.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:51.170
So if I add these I get
h of x is 3x plus 1.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.110
In a similar way, could I have
multiplied these two?

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.590
Well, sure.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.210
Again, f of x is 2x,
g of x is x plus 1.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.550
If I multiply these together,
I get what?

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.930
2x times x plus 1, which
is the same as 2x

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.040
squared plus 2x.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.540
Now of course this probably
doesn't look too smooth

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.180
because there's no
pictures here.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.750
All we're saying is this.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.760
Here's A and all you're saying
is that if you add f and g,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.840
what do you get?

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:25.840
If A is 1, 3x plus 1 is 4.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.760
2 times 3 plus 1 is 7.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.880
3 times 3 plus 1 is 10.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.706
In other words, in this case,
our image, if I want to call

00:33:34.706 --> 00:33:36.560
it b, would look like this.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.510
This would be the sum of the
two functions f and g.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.790
And similarly, for the product
I could do the

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.050
same kind of a thing.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.690
In other words, I can just
arithmetically, since both the

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.880
output of f and the g machines
are real numbers, and the sum

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.350
of two real numbers is a real
number, I can add and multiply

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.980
functions to form functions.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.950
But there's one other important
way of combining

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.430
functions in calculus.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:05.550
A way which is very, very
important and one which we may

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.700
not have seen too
much of before.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.219
And so let me close our lecture
for today with an

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:13.949
emphasis on that particular
topic.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.530
It's called composition
of functions.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.670
And to see what composition of
functions means think of a

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:25.659
particular example where maybe
the f machine f of x is 2x.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:26.929
In other words, think
of it this way.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.440
We run x through the
f machine, the

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.580
output will be 2x.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.360
Now we run the output of the f
machine into the g machine.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.420
Now what does the
g machine do?

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.370
If x is the input, x plus 1
means 1 more than the input.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.080
The g machine always adds
on 1 to the input to

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.110
give you the output.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:52.860
Well, if the input is 2x, the
output will be 2x plus 1.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.699
Notice that these two together
can be thought of as being one

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:00.230
function machine, which I'll
call the q machine.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.920
In other words, what happens
for the q machine is what?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.740
x runs into the f machine, the
output of the f machine

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.060
becomes the input of the g
machine, and the output of the

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.410
g machine is then the output
of the q machine.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.520
The q machine is sort of build
with component parts here.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.310
And the reason that this is
very, very important is that

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.390
this comes up in calculus all
the time, where the first

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.610
variable is related to the
second variable, the second

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.790
variable has a definite
relationship to the third

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:31.100
variable, and we now want to
relate the first variable to

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.410
the third variable.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.650
And the way we write
that-- and I guess

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.660
this is hard to see.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.265
This is not an O over here, it's
a little circle, like a

00:35:38.265 --> 00:35:41.360
dot, and it's called the
composition of g and f.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.380
It's not gof.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.480
Its g circle f.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.140
And the q machine is what?

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.780
You write it this way and
maybe if you look at the

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.550
picture you can see exactly
what's happening here.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.510
You apply f to x and then
apply g to the result.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.930
In other words, just looking
at this picture it becomes

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.570
rather apparent that q of
x is just 2x plus 1.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:07.320
Notice you see, that the domain
of the q machine is the

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.530
same as the domain of f.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.360
The input of the q machine is
what goes into the f machine.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.560
The output, the image of
the q machine, is the

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.540
image of the g machine.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.270
In other words, just this
particular thing.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.210
Now this type of function
combination called

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.870
composition, is a very
intricate thing.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.050
It depends on the order in which
you do these things.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.660
This is a rather interesting
point.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.970
For example, when you add two
numbers, a and b, it makes no

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.270
difference in which order
you add them.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.840
On the other hand, when you
divide two numbers, a and b,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.380
the quotient does depend
on the order in

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.580
which you divided them.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.520
Well, the same thing
is true here.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.160
Let's call p the function
which starts with the g

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.010
machine followed by
the f machine.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.090
And as this lecture wears on, I
think maybe there's a reason

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.800
for making this circle look
like an O. Maybe this is

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.430
starting to look a little bit
like fog at this time.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.400
It's not.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.174
All I want you to see is that
what we do now is we start--

00:37:04.174 --> 00:37:06.420
see, what are we going
to do here now?

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.450
We're going to start
with the g machine

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.240
first, then the f machine.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.000
In other words, what
happens now?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.660
If the input is x, the output
of the g machine is one more

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.690
than the input.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.780
That would make the input x
plus 1 to the f machine.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.990
What does f do?

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.450
Remember, f doubles.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.280
f doubles the input.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.810
So the output here
would be what?

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.230
Twice x plus 1.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.450
In other words, what would
p of x look like?

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:44.590
If x goes into the p machine,
what comes out is twice x plus

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.130
1, or 2x plus 2.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.320
On the other hand, when we put
the f and the g machine in the

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.070
other order and formed q of
x, what was the output?

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.680
Let's go back here and look.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.610
The output was 2x plus 1.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.570
In other words, do you build a
different function machine by

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.760
interchanging the f and the g?

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.370
And the answer is yes.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.830
In other words, what I'd like
you to see for concluding this

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.110
part is that whereas everything
was pretty

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.030
straightforward up until now,
the most important new

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.440
concept, one which was not so
intuitive is the one that's

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.330
called the composition
of functions.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.070
It's the one that occurs
all the time in

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.140
related rates problems.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.620
We'll be using it over and over
again in this course.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.790
And all I want you to see is
that first of all when you use

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.610
the composition of functions,
what you get depends on the

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.020
order in which you
combine them.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:42.120
And that secondly, and most
importantly, that neither of

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.800
these is the same as this.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.820
That combining two functions is
not the same as multiplying

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.170
the outputs of two different
functions.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.710
Well, I think that's
sort of enough of a

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.680
mouthful for one sitting.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.250
Our main aim today was to
introduce functions, the

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.270
language that we're going to be
using the rest of the way.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.920
Because after all if we don't
have the vocabulary

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.550
established it will not be
second nature to talk about

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.450
the concepts.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.750
Starting next time and beyond
we will deal more with

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.200
specific calculus contexts.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.910
But until next time, goodbye.
