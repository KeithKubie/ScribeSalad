00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.590
There are some movie characters that are so
over-the-top that it would seem impossible

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.400
for them to be based on a real person.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300
Since one of the most common devices for writers
is to write what you know, it makes sense

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.010
that there are so many film characters inspired
by stories of real people and true events.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.380
Here are 10 Crazy Movie Characters You Didn’t
Know Were Based on Real People.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.110
Ben from 21
21 is a 2008 film about a group of MIT students

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.990
who use their genius math skills to win an
excessive amount of cash from casinos in Las

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.990
Vegas.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.389
Jim Sturgess plays the leader of the gang
of brilliant mathematicians, Ben Campbell,

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:46.440
who begins counting cards as a way to pay
his tuition.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.219
Jeff Ma was the real life inspiration for
Ben.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.210
Jeff along with his number-crunching peers
were the subject of the book Bringing Down

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.850
the House in which 21 is based.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
While there was controversy surrounding the
casting of the film which consisted of a mostly

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:10.110
white cast portraying people who were Asian
in real life, the film was a success

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.780
Nacho Libre
The 2006 comedy, Nacho Libre stars Jack Black

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.049
as a monk turned Mexican wrestler.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.310
The film is wacky and directed by Jared Hess
who also made the oddball comedy, Napoleon

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.310
Dynamite.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.310
If the story sounds just silly enough to be
a film starring Jack Black, audiences may

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.679
be surprised to find that it is based on a
real life Catholic priest named Sergio Gutiérrez

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.310
Benítez who went by the wrestling name, Fray
Tormenta.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.750
He spent 23 years as the masked wrestler as
a way to make money for the orphanage he directed.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.380
The priest gained overwhelming support and
popularity in real life.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.969
He ended his wrestling career in 2000 but
dons the mask every once in a while just to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.130
entertain the children in his church.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.130
Rocky
Rocky Balboa is everybody’s favorite underdog

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.130
from Philly.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.130
The film about a regular Joe who pushes himself
to fight the biggest names in boxing is one

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.130
of the most successful franchises in film
history.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.689
Writer, Director and star, Sylvester Stallone
based Rocky on real life boxer Chuck Wepner

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.979
after watching Wepner go fifteen rounds with
Muhammad Ali in 1975.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.819
Later when Wepner tried to sue for a portion
of the money made from the Rocky movies, Stallone

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.749
stated that Wepner was not the inspiration
for Rocky.

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.500
So while there were many differences between
the character and Wepner, like Wepner being

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.590
from New Jersey rather than Philadelphia,
the many similarities suggest Chuck Wepner

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.860
did serve as the basis for the Italian Stallion.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.950
Frank Costello, The Departed
The character of Frank Costello in Martin

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.840
Scorsese’s ensemble crime drama, The Departed
seems somewhat unrealistic.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.099
How did a guy manage to groom a young man
to become a mole for the Boston Police department?

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.099
How did he not get arrested after years of
dirty dealing?

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.820
Even more unbelievable is that he was an informant
for the FBI the entire time?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.260
That could never happen, but it did.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.880
At least most of it did to a man named Whitey
Bulger.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.050
Bulger was an Irish mob boss in Boston and
managed to get away with a whole lot of criminal

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.939
activities for many years.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.070
He really did have a mole in the police department
and was an FBI informant to keep himself out

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.070
of prison.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.450
Bulger has such an interesting history that
he was also the subject of the 2015 film,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.450
Black Mass.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.980
Dirty Harry
The character of Dirty Harry Callahan is an

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.980
intimidating police inspector for the San
Francisco Police Department.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.540
Clint Eastwood’s iconic portrayal of the
character exemplifies cool as he goes on the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.560
hunt for psychopathic serial killer who goes
by the name of Scorpio.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.659
Scorpio is based on the similarly named Zodiac
Killer who terrorized the streets of San Francisco

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.430
in the 1960s and early 70s.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.980
Dirty Harry is based on the real life detective
Dave Toschi who was a bit of a loose cannon

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.450
for the San Francisco police department.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.379
His unorthodox behavior helped create not
only Harry Callahan but even inspired Steve

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.030
McQueen’s character in Bullitt.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.950
However, it was Tocshi's role in the Zodiac
killer case that inspired one of the coolest

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.090
characters in cinematic history.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.590
Regan from The Exorcist
Films about demonic possession have become

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.159
commonplace but back in 1973, The Exorcist
introduced audiences to the absolutely horrifying

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.200
tale of a little girl named Regan who was
possessed by a demon after playing with a

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
Ouija board.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.290
The book and film are based on the exorcism
of Roland Doe.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.010
Doe was a young boy living in Maryland in
the 1930s.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.760
He spent his time playing with his spiritualist
aunt who introduced him to a Ouija board.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.079
The result was a claimed possession which
caused a priest to perform an exorcism on

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.489
the boy and record the events.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.280
In the 1990s, a book was released stating
that Roland was not actually possessed by

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.459
anything supernatural but was most likely
just a disturbed boy who had suffered from

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.459
abuse.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:27.770
The truth will never fully be known but the
story of possession sure made for one terrifying

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.600
classic film.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600
&nbsp;

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.690
Rocky Dennis, Mask
The 1985 tearjerker, Mask in which Eric Stoltz

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.580
plays a teenage boy named Rocky Dennis who
suffers from Lionitis is based on a real life

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.840
boy by the same name and disorder.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.060
While the character may not be considered
crazy, the emotional appeal of the film proves

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.230
that reality is stranger and more compelling
than fiction.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.900
Rocky’s deforming disorder also known as
CDD, made his life extremely difficult and

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.110
it was nearly impossible to read or do basic
activities but he pushed through tasks and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.650
proved his teachers wrong.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.500
The film’s heartbreaking conclusion shows
Rocky’s mom, Rusty, enter teenage Rocky's

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.450
room to find that he has passed on.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.850
In real life, Rusty donated her son’s body
to the UCLA medical center.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.580
Norman Bates, Psycho
Norman Bates from Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.840
classic Psycho, is one of the most famous
killers in cinematic history.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.210
The voyeuristic mama’s boy may best be remembered
by the final sinister stare which closes the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.210
film.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.470
The movie was based on a book by the same
name, but the character was based on killer

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.920
and all around psycho, Ed Gein.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.340
Gein has inspired many movie maniacs including
Leather face from Texas Chainsaw Massacre

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.470
and Buffalo Bill from The Silence of the Lambs.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.080
While there was only proof that Gein killed
two people, he spent a lot of time grave robbing

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.890
and dismembering the corpses to make furniture.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.010
He also stalked local women in town.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.570
Just like Bates, Gein was dedicated to pleasing
his mother and even created a shrine for her

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.580
in her room after she died.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.080
After all, a boy’s best friend is his mother.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.980
The Dude, The Big Lebowski
Since its release in 1998, The Big Lebowski

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.720
has grown a cult following thanks to its endless
quotable dialogue and Jeff Bridges flawless

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.900
performance as Jeff Lebowski.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.900
Lebowski, or as he likes to be called, the
Dude, is just an easygoing stoner who wants

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.900
to clear up the confusion of sharing the name
with a wanted man.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:18.200
While the premise of the film is completely
made up by The Coen Brothers, the character

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.540
of The Dude is based on a real person, Jeff
Dowd.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.680
Dowd is a film producer and the Coen brothers
met him while promoting their 1984 film Blood

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.680
Simple.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.930
His appearance, style of dress, and general
mannerisms fascinated the filmmakers enough

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.790
that they just had to base a film character
on him.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.930
Even the nickname was real, something Dowd
picked up in the 6th grade that stuck with

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.830
him through his entire life.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.888
Lucy from 50 First Dates,
Adam Sandler comedies rarely strive for realism

00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:43.888
but the film 50 First Dates managed a semblance
of reality.

00:06:43.888 --> 00:06:47.870
The seemingly contrived plot revolves around
Adam Sandler falling in love with a woman,

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.990
played by Drew Barrymore, who suffers from
short term memory loss.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.990
As the film progresses, the characters fall
in love, marry, and have a child.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.990
All while she wakes up each morning forgetting
the day before.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.910
The story is more than just a wacky comedy
premise, it is actually based on a real woman

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.660
named Michelle Philpots who suffered from
two separate head injuries resulting in irreparable

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.560
brain damage causing short term memory loss.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.310
Just like Barrymore’s character, Philpots
has woken up each morning for the past twenty

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.910
years with no memory of the day before.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:19.150
Her husband helps her each day but luckily
she does recognize him as he was around before

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:26.050
the accident.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:34.080
What do you think of our list?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.720
