[MUSIC]

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:03.705
Hey there!

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.946
So, I was just calling to
say you're doing great work.

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:09.095
You got your fist bit of custom
data written into database.

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.568
And it only took a few minutes.

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:12.145
[MUSIC]

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.220
JP is calling.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.300
Hey JP, we just wrote our
first data to Firebase.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.710
And we didn't even have to
write a single Async task or

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.180
need to deal with threads.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you like it.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah actually, while I have
you on the phone, quick question.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.860
So you've looked at the dashboard
longer than I have.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.700
So how is data actually
structured in Firebase?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.240
It doesn't look like
a relational database to me.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.690
So what is this Firebase
data that I'm editing?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.510
&gt;&gt; Well, you're right about it
not being a relational database.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.630
So let me show you what it looks like.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.890
Let me pull up my screen.

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:46.850
First, SQL has a tabular format with
columns and rows, like Excel or

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.200
a Google spreadsheet.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.580
However, in Firebase,
data is stored in JSON.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.120
It's basically a simple declarative
language used to describe

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.470
objects and data.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.630
It's a lot more flexible
than a tabular format,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.889
since you don't need to strictly
define rows or headings.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.370
JSON contains a nested
structure similar to XML.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.819
And also like XML, JSON can be
represented in a tree structure.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.287
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember JSON from
working on developing Android apps.

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:14.231
I think it was the format that
both OpenWeatherMap API and

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:15.896
the movies database returned.

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.009
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.125
And if your developer's
unfamiliar with JSON,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.776
take a moment to close this hangout and

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:24.043
check out the links provided in the
instructor notes to get you up to speed.

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:25.999
&gt;&gt; All right, so
if I'm understanding you right,

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.443
the dashboard is basically
a visualization of my JSON tree.

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:32.271
And the Firebase object that we're
calling methods on in the Android

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:36.035
code that's also an object
representation of a JSON tree, right?

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:37.034
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:41.280
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay so what kind of things can
I actually store as values in JSON?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.050
It looks like here I stored a string
as a key and a string as a value, so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.120
does that mean that any type that
JSON normally accepts is okay?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.370
&gt;&gt; Right, let me explain.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.290
Well yes mostly,
the keys are always strings.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.670
The values stored in the tree
can be passes in as Booleans,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.519
longs, doubles, lists, maps, and
some specific types of objects.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.390
There are also Java types that
can be returned from the tree.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.039
List and maps can contain more lists and
more maps.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.980
And objects can contain other objects or
lists of other objects,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.910
meaning you can have nested data
structures within data structures.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.570
I know the dashboard is pretty powerful
when you want to look at your data,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.800
although it's hard to tell when
you don't have too many entries.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.740
Here's a look at it right now.
