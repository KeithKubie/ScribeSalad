- Well this lady said she
banged a bunch of poltergeists.

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:03.970
- That's close.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.472
- It's pretty cool.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.940
That's like a Sex Island on
a different astral plane.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.907
- Yeah.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.376
It's sex dimension.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.745 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "I want to marry and start
a family," with a ghost?

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.146
- Is she British?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:13.980
- Yeah.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.814
- Of course.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.518
Well I guess it's a ghost
wearing a lot of ruffles

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.955 align:start size:84% position:16%
and very dusty
buckles on his shoe.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.524
- Was the ghost possibly
wearing a powdered wig?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.360
- Yeah, does he have
a position like canter

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.029
or something like that?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.364
- [Interviewer] This is a
real presence in your life,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.799 align:start size:84% position:16%
your spiritual
guidance constantly,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're used to
this sort of thing.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.569
You open up channels
to the other side.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.439 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I guess none of
these ghosts are gay,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.408
that's why he's lettin' 'em
walk around with that hair.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.909
- [Both] Oh.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.078 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And he goes, "You open
channels to the other side."

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.180
She goes, "I guess you
could call it that."

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.118
(hard rock music)

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.088 align:start size:94% position:6%
- She wants to have a baby
with a ghost, which is,

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:55.922
I just want to hear
what she has to say.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.190 line:0%
- She has, she just did.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.291 line:0%
You see it?

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.459
- Oh, I had a baby.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.627
- Alright one, two, hang on,

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.195
oh it's quadruplets.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh my god, I'm such the
luckiest woman in the world.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.300
I'm not showing, I
have a ghost belly,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.736
it's a ghost pregnancy belly.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.205
- [Woman] So yeah.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.508
- [Interviewer] Yeah, and
this person, this presence,

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:19.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
can you tell us anything
about him, her, it?

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.682
- [Woman] I thought it as
him 'cause that's easier.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.117
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.854 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Woman] And he's very
ancient, very wise, very kind.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.324
- "So you like older men is it?

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.861
I can appreciate that,
an older gentleman."

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.064 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "My boyfriend is a
revolutionary war soldier."

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:43.069
- Then he goes, "Cool, cool,
my girlfriend is Cleopatra so."

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.972 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "I feel like
you're lying though,

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.341
I feel like you're
not being honest."

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.742
- She was renting another
person that claims it.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.378
- "I think you're being
kind of a dick to me

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.213
when you say that's just."

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.714
- "Are you lying?"

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "No, no, no, I'm plowin'
'em all, I'm plow'n' 'em all."

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.984
- "Marilyn Monroe."

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "Hang on a second, let
Anna Nicole Smith finish up."

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.454
- "Oh watch out, oh
she's a naughty."

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.455
- "She taught me off, she did."

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.023
- "Oh she's a bad bed.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.159
This bed right here."

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "She's a real baddy
she is, she is."

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.130
- "Yeah."

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.531
- [Jay] "When you see a
baddy, you go for it."

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "My boyfriend's a
15-century street sweeper."

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:19.305
"Oh, I been workin' out all
day, figure I'll come back

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.573
and put a baby in ya."

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.675
- "Hey horny, how was work?

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.978
You want me to give ya
a good ghost shaggin'?"

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.581 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "Oh yeah, you ready for this
uncircumcised ghost dick?"

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.985 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "You ready to put my
specter in your sphincter?"

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.254
- "Hey, hello, how are you?"

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:38.424 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Interviewer] When
you and he talk,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.659
what do you talk about?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.763
- [Woman] Its really
difficult to explain

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
in terms of normal Earth
bound relationships.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.569
- [Jay] What?

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Woman] It's a bit
deeper than that,

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
we don't have a need
for conversation.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.339
- Oh, you asshole!

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.641 align:start size:88% position:13%
Of course you're wearing
yoga pants saying

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.442
you're deeper than all
of us on national TV.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.410
- She didn't want
to give an answer,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.912
like what does he say to you

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.346
and she goes, "We just talk
about his ghost day and,

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.916 align:start size:88% position:13%
he's in a ghost
fantasy football league

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.585
and that takes up
a lot of time and

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.222 align:start size:88% position:13%
he makes me watch the
Jets but I wouldn't go."

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.057
- "I want to go to Sex Island.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.893
If I could I'd go
to Sex Island."

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.962
This is ridiculous, this is.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.130
- [Christine] Is this just

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
not considered mental
illness anymore?

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.301 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like somebody can say
they're gonna fuck a ghost

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.735
or marry a ghost and we're like,

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.437
"Oh no, we need to accept this,"

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.005
like there's not
something wrong.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Dan] I convinced
Christine I was a ghost

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.141
for the first few years
of our relationship.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.609
- No one else can see me.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.444
- I died 40 years ago.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.480
Christine goes, "cool."

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.685
- I drag raced off
of Hugin's Bluff.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.619 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And then you
have to do a whole,

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.154
you have to do a transfer,

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.090 align:start size:97% position:3%
you have to do a, I'm gonna
crossover just for you,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.659
I'm gonna give up heaven
for you and Christine goes,

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.294
"Oh my god."

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.230
- And then Dave's
like, "Hey dude,"

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.231
I go, "Yeah,"

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.365
- [Dan] What's up?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.633
- What's up?

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.868
Oh no no no, I'm doing
a thing with Christine,

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.170
she tells me I'm
a still a ghost,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.538 align:start size:81% position:19%
alright, just give
me one second.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hold on I'm
transforming into a human.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.174
- "Alright sorry, I'm back.

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:04.844
I'm back in the netherworld.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.513
I need you to help me escape.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:10.350
Only your love can
make me real again."

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.184
Hang on one second.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.018
- Hold on.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.853
Yeah no, buzz in.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:14.954
Buzz in, I got ya.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.458 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He goes, "Is
there extra cheese?

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.593
Is there extra cheese,
'cause I ordered it?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.662
Well, I'll look, did you
fall with this thing?"

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.030
- Yeah, the host.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.398
- Dude just take
it, just take it.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.133 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Take the tip,
yeah, tip included.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.002
- "Sorry, I'm back."

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.037 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The host is, the host,
this guy is so great.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.839
The look on his face right now.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.073
- [Jay] It doesn't
say he's buying it.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.909
- "Well, you look like
you're full of shit.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
So these guys are
coming by, bangin' ya."

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.181 align:start size:88% position:13%
- "You seem to be a real
shit sandwich here."

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.817 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Woman] That emotion and
feeling and connection.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:48.288
- [Interviewer] But you may
be feeling and connecting

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.658
a bit more than, you
know, more than that

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.027
because you feel that
you're gonna connect

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.129
to such a degree, am I right,

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.932 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
that you will have a
spiritual or physical baby.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:00.733 line:0%
- Baby.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.001
- [Woman] I hope so.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:03.303
- [Interviewer] What,
spiritual or physical?

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.005
- More than that.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.509
- [Woman] I would hope physical.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.110 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I hope this
lunatic walks around

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.146
with a piece of her
own shit wrapped

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.014
in toilet paper for a week.

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.282 align:start size:84% position:16%
- She goes, "you
want to see my baby?"

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.583
- "You want to see
my spirit baby?"

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.486
He goes, "Oh god, oh Amethyst.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.689 align:start size:84% position:16%
That is gone, you
gotta throw that out."

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.525
- "Amethyst, I'm gonna
puke, but real quick,

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.759
what are you eating?

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.827
It's not supposed to be
lime green like that.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.662
Are you eating a lot of bugs?"

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.863
- "Is that blood?

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:31.798 align:start size:84% position:16%
How many days has
this been out of you?"

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.833
- "Have you, it's hardened."

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
- "Did you put googly
eyes on a piece of shit?"

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:37.970
"No, what do you mean?

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.406
It's me baby I had with
me ghost boyfriend."

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.276
- "It's half ghost, that's
why it looks like that."

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:44.410 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "Amethyst, is this
the baby you had

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.778
with your ghost boyfriend?"

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.780
She goes, "Well, ghost husband."

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.282
- "Well, he made me
an honest woman."

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.783
- "We married."

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.353
"We wouldn't have had a baby
out of wedlock, we wouldn't."

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.923
- "No, you know what it's like
working at the ghost center."

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.458
- "Yeah, I know,
I answered calls

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.860
at the ghost center next
to you for five years."

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.762 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Or, "guys I'm gonna go cross
over at the woods and talk

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.830
to my boyfriend now."

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.732
- "You guys wouldn't get it!"

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.999
- (laughs)

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.934
- "You wouldn't understand.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.268
It's too deep for human realm.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.703
Bye!"

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.038
- "Can you give me
some privacy please?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.240
I'm having sex with me
ghost boyfriend now."

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.209
- (laughs) "'Bout to
go get drilled out

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.011
by a guy who died when they
thought the Earth was flat."

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.749
- Is this Florence from
Florence and the Machine?

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.785
- "Everyone, fuck a ghost!"

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.286
(laughing)

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.956
- "Touch everyone next to
you and say I love you."

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.991
- "Oh, do you feel the love?

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.226
Good, 'cause we're about

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.928
to dump some ghost
dick in this room."

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.265
- "Relax your eyes and
look between realms!"

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "Oh, feel the
ghost dick in here!"

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:46.873
- "Close your eyes,
and look again."

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:50.510
- There's all these
penises floating.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Holy shit,
everything's glitter.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.248
- Florence!

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.051 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Woman] It's actually
a real pregnancy,

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.621 align:start size:84% position:16%
but you have a
phantom inside you,

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.256
rather than a human baby.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.258
- [Jay] Oh that's easy.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.793
Christine, so if you
ever get the itch,

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.461
we could definitely
have a phantom baby.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.029 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Christine]
You're not a ghost.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.131
- Oh, am I not?

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Christine]
You're not a ghost.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:14.567
I can't have a ghost baby
when you're not a ghost.

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.368
- Listen, here's what I'll do.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.836
I'll go out one day.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.070 align:start size:97% position:3%
I might be gone for a while,
but I'm gonna come back,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.273
I'm gonna go to the
ghost sperm bank.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.507
- Oh.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:22.708
- [Jay] I'm gonna get
you some ghost jizz.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:23.643 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Make sure you
get a ghost doctor.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.877
- And then we'll put it in you

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:26.646
and then you'll have
a phantom baby in,

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:28.981
I don't know, you
call it, a day?

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:29.916
Nine months?

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.417
Do you want it make it legit

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
or do you wanna just fart
this thing out the next day?

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.487
- Do you want a preemie?

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.421
- [Jay] Yeah, what
do you want to do?

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.923
- Do you want a ghost preemie?

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.257
- I'm sorry, there were
complications, Christine.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:41.093
(laughing)

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.729
His phantom umbilical cord
was around his phantom neck

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.666
and he lost a lot of
oxygen to his brain.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.534
He goes, "He's alive.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.270 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's, don't worry, he's
very much alive/dead, but."

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm having a phantom
challenged baby?

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:54.807
(laughing)

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.275
- Yeah, it's gonna
be a real thing.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.877
Oooo, mom.

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.545
Oooo, mom.

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:00.346
Oooo, mom.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.748
Oooo, mom, mom.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.283
- It's gonna be
very complicated.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.319
- Oooo, mom, mom.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.621 align:start size:97% position:3%
She goes, "I'm sorry, I'm
having a hard time focusing,

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.824
I have a special needs
ghost phantom baby."

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.895
- Christine says, she starts
getting offended at comics

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:17.497
that do ghost retard baby jokes.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.099
- Oh, this ghost
must be retarded.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.134
Okay, alright, you know what?

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.803
Is that funny?

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.004
- Is that funny to you?

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.339 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause you know
what I have at home?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.673
I have a 7th month old

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
that is mentally
disabled and a ghost.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.646
- Oh she just sits
there in the park

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.681 align:start size:97% position:3%
and has her tit hanging
out with nothing happening.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.718 align:start size:88% position:13%
And she goes,
"Somethin' on your mind?

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.019
You want to say somethin'?"

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.554
- Say something, this is
beautiful and natural.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.923
In another realm, this
is looked at as beauty.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:47.727
- Okay, alright,
fucking asshole.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:48.761
So aggro.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's a phantom baby,
so it comes on down

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.969 align:start size:88% position:13%
and doesn't cry at night
so I sleep properly.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
- She pushes an empty
fucking stroller around.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.043
Christine, we could have a
phantom baby baby shower.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:04.977
That's pretty exciting.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:06.345
- Oh, I'll come over for that.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.481
A phantom gender reveal party.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.349
- Before I buy a present
for a phantom baby, though,

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:11.817
I'm coming over with baby powder

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.085
and I'm throwin' it around.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.720
I better see an outline.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.522
I better see, "where
is this motherfucker?

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:17.657
Alright prove, just show me.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.926
Show me footsteps or somethin'.

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I just dropped 90
bucks on a Rug Doctor,

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.996
'cause you were over
there with a fucking,

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:24.931
(imitates baby powder noise)

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.432
- You know how Christine gets,

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.301 align:start size:97% position:3%
can you just please just say
you see the phantom baby?

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.603
- Oh no, I wanna prove
that this thing's real.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.272 align:start size:81% position:19%
I watched that
Kevin Bacon movie.

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:34.674
I know how to get 'em.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.876
- He goes, "I'm gonna
Hollow Man this shit."

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:41.047 align:start size:97% position:3%
"A lot of people wouldn't
understand their miscarriages.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.749 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's just, you're queefin'
out phantom children."

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.952 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "Yeah, Arthur, you left,
where did you leave your baby?

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.386
He's at the hospital."

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.956 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's like, oh my god, those
babies didn't survive?

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.424
It's actually a tragic thing.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.793
- Yeah 'cause what she's
describing is gonna happen.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.994
- Not go full term.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.698
- I always make the
mistake of thinking,

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.500
because of the accent,
I think English people

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.069
are much more intelligent.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.903
- Oh yeah.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.371
- Then I hear this.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.572
- [Jay] I've made that
mistake a lot in my life.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah and then you hear
'em wingin' up shit.

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:08.474
- And then you hear
this coukoo bird.

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:09.408
- Fucking idiot.

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.876
- It really turns out they are

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:13.646
just fuckin' gravel chompin',
no flouride, teeth havin'.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:14.480
- Yeah.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.383
- But this is the
extreme version of,

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.486
- These limey fucks just
out there spreadin' lies.

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.988 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is the
extreme version of,

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.390
I have a girlfriend
in Niagara Falls.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.791
- [Jay] Yeah.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.728 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Oh no, he's ghost,
you wouldn't know him.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.663
Do you know ghosts?

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.999 align:start size:81% position:19%
Well then stop
asking questions."

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.367
- "Did you go to the
ghost high school?

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.601
(Jay laughs)

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.136 align:start size:81% position:19%
Then you don't
know my boyfriend.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.704
He's the quarterback of
the ghost football team."

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.673
- "I used to just date all
vampires and werevolves."

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:41.907
- "And then I got
like, I hated it.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.476
They got so many issues.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.379 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know vampires, they
change on you all the time."

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.781 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "I like loners, those
guys are all family dudes."

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.750
- "It's like, ugh,
I gotta belong."

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.984
- "Wolfpacks, vampire covens."

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "No thanks, I need
a ghost to just,

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.322
I like guy that's independent,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.757
comes and goes when he wants,

00:10:58.691 --> 00:10:59.992
between this realm."

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.527
- "Can't be held down,
he's such a bad boy."

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:03.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "Oh he's got a ghost
leather jacket on."

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.198
- "Sometimes he goes
back to the netherworld

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.867
and he won't answer him
phone for a couple days."

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:08.801
- [Dan] "And I love it."

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.602
- "It makes me jealous and hot."

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:10.870
- "I love it, I love it.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.138
And I know he's got
an ex on that plane.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.506
I know he's got an ex
on that astral plane.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.141
And he's just like."

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "I know he sees
her, he doesn't tell
me when he sees her."

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.845 align:start size:94% position:6%
- "They get coffee because
they're legit friends."

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.080
- (laughs)

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.314
- "But they're ghosts.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.582
So they have a lot in common."

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.051
- "I'm doing my best
not to get jealous,

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start size:94% position:6%
'cause they also, I
should've said it before,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.589 align:start size:97% position:3%
also, he's got a phantom
baby with an actual phantom."

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:31.524
- "So you guys."

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.758
- "And a different spirit."

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.427
- "And his, his phantom baby

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
from his first marriage
means a lot to him

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:37.763
and I love that about him.

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.565 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's why I want to have a
half human, half phantom baby

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.533
with him now."

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.500
- "So how are you guys gonna,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.369
make this family come together?"

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:46.138 align:start position:0%
He goes, "Do you understand
anything about quantum physics?"

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:49.308
- "Oh my god, you have
to flip the physical

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:52.178
and the spiritual world
in order to shake up.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.446 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's like when you
mix something."

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.548
- It's like, "why am
I doing this show?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.515
You guys don't get it."

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:57.349
- "You guys don't get it."

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.284
- [Woman] Oh my gosh.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.687
- [Interviewer] The
ghost, or presence,

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:02.655
whatever you like to call it.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.156
- "His name's Phillip.

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:05.758
(laughing)

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.193
His name's Marco.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.561 align:start size:94% position:6%
You can call him Phillip,
he's fine with that.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.063 line:0%
Or Phil, if you are
familiar with him."

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.233 line:0%
- [Interviewer] You met
in the Australian bush

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.968
and you had to leave Australia

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.203
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.437
- [Interviewer] And you
were feeling very sad

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.706
about leaving this
presence behind.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:23.242 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Jay] "I was chased
out by a neck romancer."

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.643
- Dude, this is so funny.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.078
Go back.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
Her fucking, her ghost
husband lives in Australia.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.382 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's just a guy sittin' behind
a bush fucking with her.

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:34.019
And he goes, "I think
this girl believes it.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.056 align:start size:94% position:6%
She really thinks I'm
alive, I'm a real ghost."

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:39.425 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That sucks to have,
you have a ghost husband

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.093
and he's not present very much.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:41.927
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.095
- "Oh I was busy babe."

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.498
- "Oh you, come on."

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:49.201
- "I got four houses I
haunt, a mental asylum."

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.803 align:start size:94% position:6%
- "I got a little boy
I've gotta scare the shit

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:51.871
out of every night.

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:52.705
(Jay laughs)

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.174
I'm fucking busy.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:56.675
Baby, I'm packed to the gills."

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:58.444 align:start size:94% position:6%
- "I'm tryin' to keep
the little bugger in line

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.212
from over in Liverpool."

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.915 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He goes, "Sometimes when
people stay at a hotel,

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.617
I like to fuck up their
experience a little bit."

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.219
- Yeah, "I gotta go turn
on some sprinkler systems

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:08.721
in a hotel later."

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:11.891
- "Oh I gotta move a cart of
food up and down a hallway

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.826
for a little bit, I can't."

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.428
- "Oh I'd love to but
I'm blowin' out candles

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.898
in castles all night."

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:20.800
- (laughs) His excuse
to get out of dates.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.535 align:start size:94% position:6%
She goes, "I was thinking
we'd go see a movie."

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:25.771
He goes, "Oh babe,
I totally forgot.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.840
I have to walk through
the back of a picture

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.342 align:start size:88% position:13%
that won't be developed
for two weeks.

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.744
No one will notice me.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:34.146 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh I've got a photoshoot,
I hate to say it."

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.782
- "I'm sorry I have
to be the third thing

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:40.019
under a sheet that's hangin' up.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.354 align:start size:84% position:16%
The first two things
are other things,

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.823
but what is that
third one there?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.024
It's gonna be me."

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.826
- "There's so much wood
that needs creaking.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.629
I wish all the wood would
creak itself, but I can't."

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "I'm the one
draggin' these chains

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.133
around these castle steps!

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:55.201
And for what?"

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.735
- Nothing.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:59.405
- "You can't take care of one
phantom baby while I'm out?"

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.207
- (laughs) That's 'cause she,

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.475
last left her boyfriend
in the Australian bush.

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:05.845
- Oh is this fucking U.K. Hoda?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.213
- Yeah.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.548
- [Interviewer] Feeling
very sad about leaving

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:13.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
this presence behind, but then
whilst you're on the plane,

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.553
tell us what happened then.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:16.655
- [Woman] So yeah,
I was really sad

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.023
because in my experience.

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He was sitting right
fucking next to me.

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.093
He should've let me go.

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.595
- Dude please.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.129
- He goes, "was he looking
at you through the window?"

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.398
She goes, "He was running down
the tarmac next to the plane,

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.633
isn't that so romantic?"

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.567
- "Stop the plane!"

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:29.602
- [Both] "Stop the plane!"

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.070
- "He was on the wing."

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.771 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You go, "that was an
episode of Twilight Zone."

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.440
- "He climbed up
the wheel well."

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.209
- Freaking out at the window,

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.578 align:start size:84% position:16%
"He's on, Phillip's
on the wing!"

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.813
(laughing)

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.047
"There's a man on the wing!?"

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:42.982
- "Sir, what, there's
a man on the wing?"

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.783
"It's something, phantom!"

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:47.620 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "I need him, I'm pregnant
with his phantom baby."

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.256 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "Get him in here, he wants
to be with his family!"

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:53.192
- She's going to jar
the fucking door loose.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.727
- "I gotta get to him!"

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:58.497
- "No no no no no
no no!" (laughs)

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.566 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Woman] Spirit's
tend to be quite static

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so I thought I had
to leave it behind.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.070
And then, whilst I
was on the plane,

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
I suddenly realized
that it had surprised me

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.275
and that, he had come with me.

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.442 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Interviewer] I'm
trying to understand this.

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start size:88% position:13%
Is this similar to
being possessed almost?

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.048
- [Woman] No.

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:16.882
- [Interviewer] No?

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:17.816
- [Woman] No.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.351
- It's much stupider than that!

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.854
- "I've got a real question
for you, where did you fall?

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.889
Where did you fall
and hit your head?

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.925 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause you're a
fucking loony one."

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.626
- "Who did it to you, girl?

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:28.627
Who did it to ya?"

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.429
- "Who did the damage?

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.798
Who did it, I see you
used your SkyMiles,

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.767
it's harder to get on the plane.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.303
I'm just wondering, 'cause
someone bought a ticket,

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.370
I'm sure of it."

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Could you imagine having
a girl argue with you

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.242
that you're sitting on
her fiance? (laughs)

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:46.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
- "Would you mind
switching with my fiance?"

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.746
"That empty chair over there?

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:50.015
Why do I, why do I?" (laughs)

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:53.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And she goes, "sir, we
don't get to be together much

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:56.021 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I just get nervous on
flights and he calms me down."

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.957
- "That's a middle seat.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.258
I can't do a middle seat."

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.093
- "Sir, please?

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:04.096
Can you not think about
yourself right now?"

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.531
- "I know, but I needed a,

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.266 align:start size:94% position:6%
I requested a window
seat 'cause it's a flight

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.500
from Australia to U.K."

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.135 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "You're a fucking
dimensionist."

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.637 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And he goes,
"Okay, you know what?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.539
I'll sit, I'm gettin' my stuff.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.040
Watch out, I think
I left my laptop.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.874
Can you move?

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:16.709
Move your feet.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:17.543
- "You're a phantomist?"

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.477
- [Dan] "What is this?"

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.678
- "You're a dimensionist?"

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.013
- Oh yeah, the guy,
William Shatner!

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:25.851
There's a ghost who's
in love with the woman.

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's John Lithgow
in the movie.

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.487
- Yeah that's the one I know,

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.357
the Twilight Zone movie
is fucking terrifying.

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:34.660
- "There's something on
the wing, some thing."

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.395
- "On the wing!"

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Jay] They're like, "is
this fucker here right now?"

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.199
- "Is he looking at me?

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.734
Is he touching me right now?"

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.202
- "He's been having sex with
your cohost the whole time."

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:46.305
- "He put his, he put his
testes in your water."

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:49.341
- (laughs)

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.844 align:start position:0%
- [Woman] It's similar to a
normal Earth bound relationship

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
just, my partner
happens to be a spirit.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.482
- [Interviewer] Except it's
not because no one can meet

00:16:56.482 --> 00:17:01.086 align:start size:97% position:3%
or see or greet or see the
love that you are experiencing

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:04.556
so I'm trying to imagine what
this is like and I'm thinking,

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.793 align:start size:94% position:6%
maybe this is like having
a really nice dream.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:08.727
(Woman laughs)

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:09.928
Yeah, that you can go back into

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.563
and opt into whenever you want.

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start size:84% position:16%
- She's gotten so
good now at giggling

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.968 align:start size:94% position:6%
and just knowing that
people think she's bonkers

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.469 align:start size:84% position:16%
so she just, 'cause
she just goes,

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.571 align:start size:97% position:3%
you just accept that this
is what people are gonna do.

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're gonna make
up your wacky story.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.708
- Yeah, I'm happy.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah yeah yeah I
outta tell people that.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.611
- She's like, sure.

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.678
I mean the balls to
go on TV and be like,

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:27.946
yeah, I'm dating a ghost.

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:30.349
Hi, I'm Dan Soder, I'm
in love with a ghost.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.217
- (laughs) When we come back,

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.385
- I'll reveal.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.987 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Jay] Dan talks about
how the love cave.

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.488
- Here she is. (laughs)

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.856
You just gotta be like, mhmm.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.558
Yeah yeah.

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.160
She's a firecracker.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.761
- Here you go, mmm.

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.097
- Yeah, I could do that right?

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:46.365
(laughing)

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:49.501
You go "baby, baby, no
not during the show."

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:50.335
- Mmmm.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.271
- You do the bite.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.874
- Yeah, I'm sidemouthin' it.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.478
- I start randomly
getting a ghost heeg.

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.979
I'd be like, whoa.

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:03.348
- "Oh baby girl, you couldn't
wait til we get home, huh?"

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:05.117 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Someone's gettin' handsy
right in the middle of.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:08.754 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You go, "Oh baby
I needed that."

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.956
- You go, "Is this
weird for you guys?"

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:11.790
Ahhh.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:13.592
- Ooooh, run a bit.

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:17.796
- Bring fucking Shawn
Fury to interview.

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.231
(Jay laughs)

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.265 align:start size:97% position:3%
Someone's ticklin' my belly,
but it ain't my belly.

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:22.634
- (laughs) Run a bit, oooh.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:26.872 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I wanna, I'm
fascinated by this woman.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.808 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Cause she's so full of
shit, she has to be, right?

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.276
Ghosts aren't real.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Woman] Definitely real,
I'm definitely awake.

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:33.812
- [Interviewer] Are
you being touched?

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.080
Are you being held?

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.315
Are you being kissed?

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.583
Are you being, or is
it just conversation?

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:38.517
- [Jay] All of it!

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.152
- [Woman] Sometimes, yeah,

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.653 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's just like a
normal relationship.

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:43.122
- [Interviewer] So you get
excited, you get turned on.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.457 align:start position:0%
- She keeps saying that but
it's not a normal relationship.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
I lose it, I'm
guest hosting, I go.

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.361
- Lady!

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.530 align:start size:94% position:6%
- (laughs) I go, "Dan
any follow up questions?"

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Guys, it's not a
normal relationship."

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.067
- You can't wear those
moron pants and come here

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.902
and tell me this nonsense.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.070
- I mean, are you warming up?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.004
What are you doing?

00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:00.973
- [Woman] Sometimes.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:01.807
- [Interviewer] Yeah?

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.275
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:04.776 align:start position:0%
- [Interviewer] You did say
that actually on the flight back

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:08.046
from Australia, you did
actually go into the loo

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.048
and do what some people do.

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:11.316
- [Woman] I'm a member
of the mile high club.

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.652
- No, shut the fuck up!

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:16.522 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're a member of the mile
high club with a ghost?

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:17.990
That is, no.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.558 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They don't even
know what a mile is.

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:22.294 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, it's a kilometer,
you dumb asshole.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.696 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "We're in the
kilometer high club."

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:25.531
- I mean,

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.201
what an asshole.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.802
- She just did the motions
in the bathroom by herself?

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:31.737
- She's just lying.

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.071
- "We did what people do."

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:35.307
He goes, "Piss and shit alone?"

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.875
Like what do you mean?

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:37.843
- She came out and she's like,

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.778
"Oh I'm feeling really randy."

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm sorry, she
messed her own hair up.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.017
- "Oh, oh!"

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.218
She comes out silent.

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Jay] With her
tits out of her bra.

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.086
- The guy sitting by the door.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.555
- [Jay] "Oh, me sorry."

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:50.856
- The guy sees her coming out
of the door and he's like,

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.591
"Hey, she's in there alone."

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.525
- [Jay] Yeah.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.726
- "She's in there alone."

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:55.527 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The guy on that
flight had to be like,

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.129
"dude what the fuck?"

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:00.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
- She scooped, she
scooped unstirred yogurt

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.234
into the front of a condom.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.403
She goes, "Sorry everybody."

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:05.771
- "Physical evidence."

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:07.539
(Jay laughs)

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.774
- "Physical evidence."

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:09.841
- "Sorry, I've got
to throw this out."

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.676
- "On the condom.

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.910
Physical evidence."

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.146
- (laughs) "What you
gonna do about that?"

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
- She's just saying
shit that like,

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:18.116
she should fuck one of
these Sex Island guys.

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.351
- Hell yeah.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.852
- 'Cause they would
be like, "Oh yeah,

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:22.087
does your ghost boyfriend
like to fuck all the time?"

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.021 align:start size:81% position:19%
- She's like, "you
don't even know

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.089
but we just had a nine some."

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:25.490
- "A nine some.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.826 align:start size:88% position:13%
With the entire dead
Marshall football team."

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.095
(laughing)

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.699
- "Well I hope you
like sloppy 31sts."

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.400
- "'Cause I just got gang banged

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
by the dead Marshall
football team.

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.271 line:0%
We are Marshall."

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.806 line:0%
(laughing)

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:43.408
"Oh Jesus, oh my god,
that's so tragic."

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.744
"Is it, 'cause I had
sex with Buddy Holly."

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.114 align:start size:81% position:19%
- "The Big Bopper,
Ritchie Valens.

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:52.484 align:start size:94% position:6%
My father would kill me
if I fucked a Mexican boy.

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.019
(Dan laughs)

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:57.089
Me father would not like
me to be with a Mexican boy

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.290
but Big Bopper?"

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.124
- Good guy.

00:20:59.124 --> 00:20:59.958
- [Jay] "Buddy Holly?"

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:00.692
- "Oh yeah."

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.428
- "Hello human."

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.765
- "Hello human sex, oh."

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.268
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.637
- "He's actually lost a lot
of weight since he died."

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:12.771
- "He's healthy now.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.939
(Jay laughs)

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have kale smoothies
every morning."

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.644
This is so dumb.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.245
How did we just get to this?

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:24.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
- She goes, "I like me
husband 'cause he eats a lot

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:26.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
of pineapple, if you
know what I mean.

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:27.419
If you know what I mean."

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.321
- "His ghost cum tastes sweet."

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.622
- (laughs)

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Alright, let's just
get a little last taste.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Interviewer] If you
have these feelings

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:35.027
because you imagine them,

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:37.462
not because it's
actually a ghost.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:41.600
- [Woman] Yeah I mean, for
me, I know that it's real.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.103
And, it's, that's
my relationship.

00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:48.573
It's personal and I don't mind
so much if people disbelieve.

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Your relationship's
personal except

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:52.344
for getting fucking railed
in the bathroom by nothing?

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:54.980
- Yeah, man, by a stiff breeze.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.014
A stiff breeze.

00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:58.016
- Did you fuck the plunger?

00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:01.019 align:start size:94% position:6%
- (laughs) She goes,
"What, you mean Phillip?"

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.422
- "Oh no, Phillip used
the plunger on me bob."

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.956
- "He's a crazy one"

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.460
- "Phillip's a bit
of a shag master."

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.296
(hard rock music)
