00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:03.970
I was just asking my friends how
you get your classrooms quiet, 

00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:08.236
but I don't even have to use my 
new trick. Thank you. We are so 

00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:10.129
happy that you are here at the 
library of congress this 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.130
morning, 

00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:17.158
and really excited to both 
welcome you

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:20.319
and introduce you to a terrific 
new author that you might have 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320
heard of 

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:25.338
before

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:29.301
. I direct a new office of 
learning and 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:36.056
innovation here at the lie BRAGS
library. We have another group 

00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:38.057
coming in, and I 

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.711
will let them trickle in

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:52.399
. 
    First thing I want to do is 

00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:57.071
recognize all of the groups in 
the audience with us today. When

00:07:57.072 --> 00:07:59.496
I say the name of your school, I
want you to get a big smile on 

00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:01.745
your face. And then when I've 
read all of the 

00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:07.042
school names, that's when I want
you all to clap. So, when I read

00:08:07.043 --> 00:08:12.147
your school name, you're going 
to smile. When I finish, you're 

00:08:12.148 --> 00:08:14.148
going to clap. Okay? All right. 

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.660
So today we are very happy to be
welcome

00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:25.605
ing students and parents and 
chaperons 

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.990
from Ledlow, trues dale 
education campus, from the 

00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:34.235
inspired teaching demonstration 
public charter school, 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.320
from Dorothy height elementary, 
from 

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:51.199
Tyler elementary, from 
Kimableble elementary, and from 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.690
Brant elementary school. Now we 
can cheer. 

00:08:57.712 --> 00:09:02.021
[ Cheers and Applause ] 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: That was 

00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:04.022
perfect!

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.878
We

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:19.099
also-- thank you. Hey I I see 
some of you doing this.

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:25.240
And that seems to work. Awesome.
Thank you guys.

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:30.076
I'm also excited to let you know
that in addition to all of the 

00:09:30.077 --> 00:09:34.377
students that are with us at the
library today, we have people 

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:36.378
all over the world watching 

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.390
this

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:42.966
program on YouTube and on the 
library's website and on the 

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:46.444
library's Facebook page, because
we're live streaming it. And 

00:09:46.445 --> 00:09:48.674
that camera right there, if you 
want to wave to it, you can wave

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:51.310
to people all over the whole 
wide world!

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.953
I think they liked that. Thank 
you. Now on with our show, so 

00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:28.184
last December, here at the 
library of congress, we had 

00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:34.241
a special program celebrating a 
book.

00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:39.351
ApproximateThe book we were sell

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.770
BRALTcelebrating was publiced in

00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:47.427
lished in 1936, and was turned 
into a movie.

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:52.232
You either read the book, "the 
story of Ferdinand" or you saw 

00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:54.233
the movie. 

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:58.459
Well, in the movie

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:03.373
--

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:25.506
in "Ferdinand" the movie, the 
voice of 

00:11:28.378 --> 00:11:30.820
Ferdinand was John see Cena, and
he came here to the library and 

00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:34.078
read the original book to a 
group of students in this very 

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:37.969
auditorium. Today we are very 
happy that he is back with us 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.970
again, and once again, 

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.742
inspiration is part of our 
program. Last December, when we 

00:11:44.743 --> 00:11:47.598
introduced John, we described 
him as an actor and as a 

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:51.444
wrestling superstar, and those 
descriptions certainly still 

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:53.445
apply.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.140
But today, we get to add author 
to his description.

00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:01.433
He has written a new book 
entitled "Elbow Grease".

00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:07.468
It was illustrated by Howard 
McWilliam, and published by 

00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:10.101
Random House. And a copy of this
is now in the 

00:12:14.397 --> 00:12:16.823
library of congress's 
collection, so it is part of the

00:12:16.824 --> 00:12:19.886
largest library in the world. 
John is here not only to read 

00:12:19.887 --> 00:12:21.887
"Elbow 

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:25.347
Grease", but also one written 
and 

00:12:27.005 --> 00:12:30.304
illustrated by Richard Scary, 
which inspired him. John will 

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:32.598
talk with us a bit and answer 
questions that I know a few of 

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:34.599
you have.

00:12:36.126 --> 00:12:38.126
So, please join me in welcoming 
16-time 

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.802
world champion wrestler, star of
block 

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.296
buster movies, record-setting 

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:51.816
make-a-wish granter, reader, fan
of Richard Scary books, and 

00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:54.043
published author, John Cena!

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.341
[ Applause ] 

00:13:19.574 --> 00:13:23.303
   » JOHN CENA: How is everybody
doing this morning. Is it okay 

00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:25.304
if I sit? No? Yes? Sit?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.979
I can't -- yes or no? 
   » AUDIENCE: Yes!!! 

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:36.648
» JOHN CENA: I heard everybody 
singing before I came out here.

00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:41.356
You all have a wonderful voice. 
Collectively it sounded 

00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:45.451
wonderful. Singing is fun, 
right? I couldn't quite 

00:13:45.452 --> 00:13:49.908
understand you. Singing is fun, 
right? Singing is great, and 

00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:51.909
drawing is great, 

00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:56.062
and maybe watching shows are 
great, and telling stories is 

00:13:56.063 --> 00:13:59.729
great, because it's all 
creative. And all of us, no 

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.239
matter where we come from, no 
matter what we look like, all of

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.676
us have inside of us this 
wonderful thing called 

00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:08.115
imagination. And when you get to
sing or you watch 

00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:15.876
something that stimulates your 
imagination, it's fun. And to 

00:14:15.877 --> 00:14:20.582
me, what also stimulates my 
imagination is books. Books more

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:23.213
than anything else, because in 
the pages, you can kind of 

00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:27.076
determine what the characters 
are like, maybe develop a voice 

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:29.077
for somebody or a personality 
for a character.

00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:35.507
So, books, certainly, are one of
my favorite ways to be 

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:37.781
imaginative. And I, of course, 
have a list of favorite books.

00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:43.025
But I wanted to ask you guys 
some questions.

00:14:46.293 --> 00:14:48.293
What makes iss a book a 
favorite?

00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:51.165
I know for me, but what about 
you guys? What are some of the 

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.389
things that you look for in a 
book that makes it a 

00:14:56.397 --> 00:14:58.397
favorite

00:15:08.778 --> 00:15:10.606
? We have a few answers out 
there. This is very interesting 

00:15:10.607 --> 00:15:15.090
to me, because I know all of our
answers are going to be 

00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:17.091
different. 

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.450
Initial reports are coming in.

00:15:32.887 --> 00:15:39.357
The question: Things that make a
book a favorite. Mystery. A good

00:15:39.358 --> 00:15:42.053
old-fashioned guessing game of 
what's really going on. Mystery 

00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:44.054
is good. Imagination. 
Imagination.

00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:50.676
That's also one of my faves as 
well. Inspiration. A very good 

00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:52.563
and powerful word, and hopefully
we have some inspiration here 

00:15:52.564 --> 00:15:54.564
today. What else have we got?

00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:01.852
Im

00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:06.455
aginative. Seems to be a good 
amount of imagination in the 

00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:13.627
room. It's going to be a 
wonderful morning. Pictures. 

00:16:13.628 --> 00:16:15.245
Pictures are also a key part of 
the book, because it can help 

00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:20.325
you imagine the world that the 
storyteller is trying to create.

00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:24.795
These are all great answers, by 
the way. Thank you so much. And 

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:26.796
so many people want to 
contribute.

00:16:28.828 --> 00:16:32.970
This is great! It takes you 
somewhere. That's the wonderful 

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:37.047
thing about books. It takes us 
to someplace special. They're 

00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:40.789
very powerful. Yes, they are 
very powerful. The stories that 

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.790
they tell are very powerful.

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:47.638
Cool words

00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:54.601
like Elbow Grease! And having a 
lot of books. That's extremely 

00:16:54.602 --> 00:16:56.602
important, because the more 
books you have, the more stories

00:16:57.473 --> 00:16:59.473
you can be involved in. Fiction.
Fiction is another great answer.

00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:02.568
We have one in the front.

00:17:04.426 --> 00:17:07.316
We have one coming up on the 
front. Colorful. That goes along

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:10.400
with amazing pictures, being 
colorful and vibrant.  And 

00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:12.401
traveling.

00:17:13.885 --> 00:17:15.324
Traveling is something that can 
take stories wherever you want 

00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:17.325
to be around the world or 
beyond.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.209
So, those are all -- and 
non-fiction! The opposite of 

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.701
fiction. We'll include 
everything, which is great. 

00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:27.939
We're at the library of 
congress.  We should give 

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.514
everything their due. 
    So, those are all great 

00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:37.296
answers. And I want to thank you
for you sharing with me what 

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:39.935
makes your books favorites. I 
wanted to share with you a book 

00:17:39.936 --> 00:17:41.936
that 

00:17:43.014 --> 00:17:46.060
was my absolute favorite when I 
was a little kid. I grew up in a

00:17:46.061 --> 00:17:48.061
small town. It was nothing like 
DC.

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:53.844
You couldn't see fancy buildings
and people walking the streets 

00:17:53.845 --> 00:17:55.845
and tons of 

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.411
cars and trucks and things that 
go. You had farmland, and I was 

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:06.082
lucky to maybe get a glimpse at 
a rusted old tractor, and my 

00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:08.083
next-door neighbor was miles and
miles away.

00:18:13.064 --> 00:18:15.064
So, when my mom read me this 
story, 

00:18:17.949 --> 00:18:20.413
"Cars and Trucks and Things that
Go," I didn't hang on every 

00:18:20.414 --> 00:18:23.040
word, because there's a lot of 
them in there for a children's 

00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:27.550
book. It's a long book. But what
I loved, as some of you 

00:18:30.597 --> 00:18:32.840
pointed out, I loved the 
pictures, because it brought me 

00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:35.711
to a world where I could see 
these amazing machines that I 

00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:39.157
had only heard about.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.200
But if you open the book -- I'll
just even flip to page 9. 

00:18:43.683 --> 00:18:45.707
There's a pickle truck. A giant 
pickle truck.

00:18:50.246 --> 00:18:52.246
There's also a dragster and a 
crocodile 

00:18:53.722 --> 00:18:55.755
car and a sailboat, and there's 
a tow truck and what looks like 

00:18:55.756 --> 00:18:57.756
a sports car 

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.447
and what looks like an antique 
sports car and a milk truck. And

00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:04.878
this is only one page. I saw 
this as a kid, and I was like 

00:19:06.724 --> 00:19:09.156
man, the pickle truck is bigger 
than everything else! It's huge!

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:18.554
If you turn to page -- oooh. 
This is a good one. So, page 15.

00:19:21.222 --> 00:19:23.222
I always loved construction.

00:19:24.245 --> 00:19:26.245
I loved bulldozers because they 
could 

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.816
smash and cranes baudss because 
they could lift things and big 

00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:32.817
trucks because 

00:19:34.067 --> 00:19:36.067
they could  carry and tow 
things.

00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:39.722
On one page you have a crane, a 
bulldozer, and a real small 

00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:45.446
minivan, which is a mouse van, 
you have a pumpkin car, a 

00:19:45.447 --> 00:19:49.538
rainbow bus, and a bunch of 
really cool stuff. And, oh, I 

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:51.976
think this was my favorite page 
of the whole book, because I 

00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:55.650
loved making a mess as a little 
kid, and I loved big trucks.

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:02.206
And you could see all sorts of 
dump trucks, what they carry. 

00:20:02.207 --> 00:20:04.447
And they're all making a mess.  
You have trucks that carry coal,

00:20:07.691 --> 00:20:10.139
trucks that carry rocks, carry 
dirt, tomatoes, oranges, and 

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.215
trucks that carry sand, and 
they're all making a mess. And 

00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:15.216
as a kid, I loved this.

00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:17.924
And it's just an example of your
answers to these questions about

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.925
what makes a book your favorite.

00:20:25.704 --> 00:20:28.579
If you turn to even page 35, you
again see dump trucks, but 

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.862
instead of making a mess this 
time, they're building a road. 

00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:35.079
So, they're doing something 
productive and they're making a 

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.190
road to help make a city. And 
then I got to thinking as a kid,

00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:40.630
who's going to live in that 
city? What's the city going to 

00:20:40.631 --> 00:20:42.631
look like?

00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:46.890
Man, it must be a crazy far-away
place! 

00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:55.687
And on page 45, I don't know if 
you know this about me, but I 

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:03.809
like to drive pretty fast. Like,
the speed limit... almost. But 

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.665
I've always liked fast cars, and
this is a whole page devoted to 

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:08.666
cars that go fast.

00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:12.785
And as a kid, I just couldn't 
believe that all of this 

00:21:12.786 --> 00:21:14.786
material was in one book.

00:21:16.491 --> 00:21:18.535
And guys, this is only five 
pages of this massive, massive 

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:23.251
book. And once again, I loved 
when my mom used to read me this

00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:25.911
story, but she used to read it 
and the words almost felt 

00:21:29.677 --> 00:21:31.677
like music, because I was so 
lost in the pictures.

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:34.805
And that's the great thing about
books, especially from some of 

00:21:34.806 --> 00:21:38.067
the answers we've heard. If 
they're colorful, if they're 

00:21:39.888 --> 00:21:42.119
vibrant, if they have a great 
story, if they have a little bit

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.120
of mystery, if they have 
wonderful pictures, it can 

00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:49.458
allow us to use that powerful 
thing called imagination that 

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:51.459
allows us to create fantastic 
and wonderful things.

00:21:55.012 --> 00:21:57.458
So, I want to ask you a few 
question s before we get into 

00:21:57.459 --> 00:21:59.459
this little guy, who I admire.

00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:06.857
How many of you, like me, like 
cars? Okay. There's a few. How 

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:09.576
many like trucks? How many like 
cars and trucks?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.450
Okay. 

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.130
How many of you have brothers?

00:22:23.268 --> 00:22:28.229
How many of you -- okay. All 
right. All right. Energetic 

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.308
subject. Maybe you've got a big 
brother or a little brother. How

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:35.967
many of you have sisters? Oh, 
okay. All right. How many of you

00:22:35.968 --> 00:22:39.369
have brothers and sisters? 

00:22:45.801 --> 00:22:47.801
Raise your hand if you have a 
brother, a sister, or a cousin.

00:22:54.953 --> 00:22:57.947
Okay. 

00:23:07.806 --> 00:23:10.652
This one we did pretty good 
with. And that's a very 

00:23:10.653 --> 00:23:13.090
important question, because it 
has to do with a story we're 

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.690
about to read.

00:23:16.948 --> 00:23:18.986
I wanted to ask if you have a 
brother, a sister, or a cousin, 

00:23:18.987 --> 00:23:22.030
because you know what it's like 
to be close to someone who is 

00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:26.095
family. Sometimes you get along.
Sometimes maybe you have a 

00:23:26.096 --> 00:23:28.922
disagreement and you don't get 
along. But at the end of the 

00:23:28.923 --> 00:23:33.844
day, because you're family and 
you spend time together, you 

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.483
develop love and bond with one 
another. And that's kind of what

00:23:36.484 --> 00:23:38.722
led me to want to write "Elbow 
Grease", because as 

00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:47.381
you'll soon find out, Elbow 
Grease lived in a wonderful 

00:23:47.382 --> 00:23:49.415
world of imagination, but he's a
little bit different from his 

00:23:51.252 --> 00:23:53.082
brothers and sometimes his 
brothers don't understand and 

00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:56.141
make fun of him for it. But 
Elbow Grease doesn't care 

00:23:56.142 --> 00:23:59.926
because he is proud of who he 
is. It was because of my family 

00:23:59.927 --> 00:24:02.390
that I wanted to write this 
story that I'm going to share 

00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:04.391
with you today. 

00:24:07.517 --> 00:24:09.552
Would it be okay right now if I 
were to share that story with 

00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:11.553
you? 

00:24:15.052 --> 00:24:19.963
[ Audience answers ]. 
    I must apologize. I'm not as

00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:21.587
young as I used to be and they 
say that hear something the 

00:24:21.588 --> 00:24:26.295
first thing to go. I didn't hear
your answer. Would it be okay if

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:28.296
I share this story 

00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:34.423
with you? Was that a yes? I've 
got to ask one more time. Would 

00:24:34.424 --> 00:24:36.424
it be okay? 

00:24:38.928 --> 00:24:42.582
[ Audience yelling yes! ]
    All right.

00:24:49.324 --> 00:24:50.972
Well, without further ado, the 
moment we've all been waiting 

00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:52.973
for, the 

00:24:56.403 --> 00:24:58.403
wonderful story of "Elbow 
Grease". 

00:25:03.404 --> 00:25:07.465
Here is our cast of characters. 
There is Elbow Grease. He he, 

00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:13.181
that tickles.  Flash. Come on, 
bud, story's starting.  Pinball,

00:25:13.182 --> 00:25:17.028
technically at this point, the 
story has already started. And 

00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:22.187
Tank, what story? And of course,
Crash! Last one there's a hunk 

00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:24.188
of junk!

00:25:34.594 --> 00:25:36.594
"Elbow Grease". 

00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:42.622
Hey, that's me! 
    All right. Elbow Grease was 

00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:44.623
the smallest truck in 

00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:48.338
the demolition derby, but he 
never that bother him. 

00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:50.339
Why should I? 

00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:58.337
His brother, Tank, was tougher. 
His brother Flash was faster. 

00:25:58.338 --> 00:26:00.338
His brother Pinball was smarter.

00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:06.080
His brother Crash was braver! 
    Okay. We get the point. 

00:26:10.775 --> 00:26:14.036
But what Elbow Grease had was 
gumption! You got that right, 

00:26:14.037 --> 00:26:16.900
buster! 
    He always tried his best, 

00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:24.172
and he never gave up. Ouch! Waaa

00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:30.330
! Oops! Yowww! 

00:26:35.868 --> 00:26:37.868
At night, Mel the mechanic 
plugged 

00:26:39.942 --> 00:26:42.998
in Elbow Grease to charge while 
the other trucks slept outside. 

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:45.642
Sometimes his brothers teased 
him for being different. -he's 

00:26:45.643 --> 00:26:47.643
got a plug. He's stuck to the 
wall.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.390
He's got alith on-ion battery 
which requires an external power

00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:56.874
source for daily recharging. 
    Huh huh huh. He's got a 

00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:59.755
plug. 
    Elbow Grease didn't get 

00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:04.846
upset. He was glad to be inside.
Especially during the 

00:27:04.847 --> 00:27:06.847
rainstorms.

00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:14.440
Yeah, have fun in the rain, you 
jalopies! 

00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:20.915
Then one might Mel brought home 
a 

00:27:21.927 --> 00:27:23.927
post

00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:29.919
er and Elbow Grease said, "Some 
day, I'm going to be on a 

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.920
poster." His brothers laughed.

00:27:35.056 --> 00:27:37.056
YYou're too slow. You're too 
small.

00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:41.576
Your technique and experience 
are insufficient to compete at a

00:27:41.806 --> 00:27:46.262
professional level. You're 
too... uhhh... 

00:27:48.928 --> 00:27:50.974
Don't hurt yourself, thank. 
    That made Elbow Grease mad.

00:27:54.452 --> 00:27:56.452
So mad that he zoomed off to the
Grand 

00:27:59.785 --> 00:28:01.785
Prix by HIMSS himself to prove 
his brothers wrong.

00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:09.163
I'll show those JAjalopieses 
what I can do. By the morning, 

00:28:09.164 --> 00:28:11.221
Elbow Grease was exhausted. He 
had been driving all night 

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:14.273
without a charge. But when he 
arrived at the Grand Prix, 

00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.734
he felt his circuits surge with 

00:28:22.355 --> 00:28:24.355
excitement, and

00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:29.782
he quitely pulled on to the 
track and snuck behind the other

00:28:29.783 --> 00:28:32.637
trucks. On your mark, get set, 
go! 

00:28:34.451 --> 00:28:38.504
The other trucks were bigger. 
The other trucks were faster. 

00:28:38.505 --> 00:28:40.505
The other trucks had more 
experience and better technique.

00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:45.847
But Elbow Grease wouldn't quit. 
Never give up! 

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.080
He fell behind.

00:28:53.137 --> 00:28:55.137
But he kept on trucking

00:28:56.712 --> 00:29:00.770
. Off. He got bashed and 
smashed, and even caught fire a 

00:29:00.771 --> 00:29:02.771
little bit.

00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:07.007
But still, he kept on going

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.183
. Ow-y kazow-y!!!
    Half way through the race, 

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:14.184
it started pouring rain.

00:29:16.884 --> 00:29:18.884
Thunder rumbled, lightning 
Flashed, and 

00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:25.276
all of the Sunday sudden, Elbow 
Grease's engine shut down. His 

00:29:25.277 --> 00:29:28.355
battery was completely dead. Oh 
rust buckets. Elbow Grease was 

00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:30.356
stuck, and for the 

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:33.389
first time, he wondered if his 
brothers were right.

00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:37.435
And he started to cry.

00:29:38.475 --> 00:29:40.475
I'm not c-c-crying.

00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:45.403
I'm just cold and tired and kind
of 

00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:49.845
scared of the lightning

00:29:53.331 --> 00:29:55.498
. CRACK-A-LACK-A! 
BOOM-SHOCK-A-LOCK-A!!!! 

00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:02.196
The lightning jumped his battery
back to life. Elbow Grease 

00:30:02.197 --> 00:30:04.713
barely had enough charge to keep
going, but he didn't give up and

00:30:05.713 --> 00:30:07.990
he didn't give in. No matter 
what, he would finish this 

00:30:12.619 --> 00:30:15.596
race, even if he came in last. 
Mel and Elbow Grease's brothers 

00:30:18.053 --> 00:30:20.706
arrived just in time to see him 
rattle across the finish line 

00:30:20.707 --> 00:30:22.753
and collapse in a heap. And the 
winner's celebration was 

00:30:26.166 --> 00:30:28.166
already over

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.324
. Look, Bo, most of the trucks 
couldn't even make it to the 

00:30:33.325 --> 00:30:35.325
finish line. 

00:30:37.215 --> 00:30:39.215
And just then, the winner of the
race rolled by.

00:30:41.468 --> 00:30:43.468
Well, shift my gears and call me
sally, this kid's got gumption.

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:47.945
You boys could learn a lot from 
him.

00:30:49.416 --> 00:30:51.840
Crash was shocked. Big? Flash 
was stunned. Wheels?

00:30:54.895 --> 00:31:00.178
Pinball was intrigued. McGeel? 
Tank? Tank was confused.

00:31:03.233 --> 00:31:05.233
Who? 

00:31:11.344 --> 00:31:16.305
Mel NUknew that Big Wheels 
McGeel was right. If you only 

00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:18.306
stick with what you're good at, 
you'll never learn anything.

00:31:21.203 --> 00:31:23.203
So, the next time your problem 
seems 

00:31:24.689 --> 00:31:26.689
too big or too hard, just 
remember, a 

00:31:30.998 --> 00:31:33.047
little elbowElbow Grease goeses 
a long a long, long way. The 

00:31:33.048 --> 00:31:38.925
end. 
[ Applause ] 

00:31:55.722 --> 00:31:57.581
First thing's first, I want to 
say thank you very much for 

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.845
allowing me to share something 
that's part of my imagination 

00:31:59.846 --> 00:32:04.131
with you. And secondly, I hope 
maybe we can all use our 

00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:06.132
imagination today to maybe see 

00:32:07.798 --> 00:32:09.440
the world of Elbow Grease and 
maybe a wonderful message at the

00:32:09.441 --> 00:32:11.697
same time. But lastly, and most 
important, I know 

00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:16.577
you guys and gals have 
questions. And I would like to 

00:32:16.578 --> 00:32:21.875
answer those questions now. So, 
I made a little bit of extra 

00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:25.378
time, because I saw how many 
questions and answers we had at 

00:32:25.379 --> 00:32:27.379
the beginning, and I want to 
make sure if you have a 

00:32:28.827 --> 00:32:30.235
question, I'll do my best to 
answer it. This is the most 

00:32:30.236 --> 00:32:32.879
important part. If you have 
questions, I have answers. Let's

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.880
go.

00:32:41.018 --> 00:32:43.662
   » LEE ANN POTTER: We're going
to start with those questions, 

00:32:43.663 --> 00:32:45.663
and if we 

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.985
have additional time, we'll move
on to some other questions. So, 

00:32:49.986 --> 00:32:51.986
my colleague who has the 

00:32:53.024 --> 00:32:55.024
microphones floating around, I 
think 

00:32:57.248 --> 00:32:59.248
Sasha's got one back here

00:33:00.991 --> 00:33:02.437
, and I think what we'll have is
two microphones on each side of 

00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:04.438
the room.

00:33:06.712 --> 00:33:08.937
And if you have a question that 
is on one of the Flash cards, if

00:33:08.938 --> 00:33:12.800
you could hold it up so that my 
friends in the audience could 

00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:14.848
see you, they're going to walk 
up to you, and they're going to 

00:33:14.849 --> 00:33:20.539
ask you to say your name, and 
then ask your question. Okay? 

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.430
All right! Sasha, we'll start 
with who you've got here. 

00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:26.671
» JOHN CENA: What's the first 
question? 

00:33:29.581 --> 00:33:32.007

still like cars and trucks? And

cars and trucks? You know, I'm a
little bit older now, so...

00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:35.419
YES! I absolutely do. I do!

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:41.546
Because cars and the way they're
designed is someone's 

00:34:41.547 --> 00:34:44.803
imagination come to life. If 
it's a sports car or if it's a 

00:34:46.812 --> 00:34:49.687
truck, just the way it looks and
the way it drives is someone's 

00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:51.688
idea, and I like

Please.

books did you read in second 
grade? 

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:22.846
» JOHN CENA: How many books did 
I read in second grade? I was 

00:37:22.847 --> 00:37:24.847
fortunate enough to have a 
second 

00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:28.075
grade teacher whose fair thing 
was favorite thing was book 

00:37:28.076 --> 00:37:30.076
reports.

00:37:31.178 --> 00:37:34.842
In second grade, I didn't think 
it was such a good idea. I 

00:37:34.843 --> 00:37:37.114
thought these crumby book 
reports. I got to write down all

00:37:37.115 --> 00:37:40.581
of this stuff about the books I 
read. But looking back, I read a

00:37:40.582 --> 00:37:42.582
lot of books.

00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:45.688
I would say in second grade, at 
the very least, because I'm just

00:37:45.689 --> 00:37:47.689
going to 

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.199
ballpark it, at the very least, 
10 books, and at the very most, 

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.685
probably 15 books, but without 
that teacher, I probably only 

00:37:55.686 --> 00:37:57.686
would have read one or two.

00:37:59.568 --> 00:38:01.568
So, I'm very happy for my 
teachers.  

00:38:02.245 --> 00:38:04.245

00:38:17.291 --> 00:38:19.291
Do you folks know what elbow 
grease means? No?

00:38:22.806 --> 00:38:24.806
This is a Firth first time, 
because 

00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:28.482
usually it's an overwhelming 
yes! That's okay. There's a lot 

00:38:28.483 --> 00:38:30.483
of you out there that 

00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:36.877
don't know what the word "elbow 
grease" means, which is why I 

00:38:36.878 --> 00:38:39.534
chose it. I want you to be so 
entertained by the 

00:38:42.795 --> 00:38:45.847
story that you ask someone what 
does elbow grease mean? I wrote 

00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:47.848
the book.

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.519
Elbow grease means hard work, 
and 

00:38:53.807 --> 00:38:56.445
that's why Elbow Grease's 
special talent is gumption, and 

00:38:56.446 --> 00:38:59.685
that is why he never gave up. 
Not only did you hear a good 

00:38:59.686 --> 00:39:02.529
story, but you also learned 
something; you know 

00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:07.844

What is my favorite thing that 
says Vroom? Anything that sounds

00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:58.145
like it goes fast. Because 
you've heard some cars, and I'm 

00:40:00.374 --> 00:40:02.374
a huge fan of the electric cars,
but I 

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.273
wish they could come with, like,
speakers in them, so when you 

00:40:05.274 --> 00:40:07.274
plug your 

00:40:11.766 --> 00:40:14.617
phone in, it's like vrooooom, 
vrooom! It's just because I grew

00:40:14.618 --> 00:40:19.330
up with it. But I'm learning to 
like no noise. Do we have more? 

00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:22.162
Of course we have more. Where is
our next question coming from?

» My name is Juaro, and my 
question is, what book are you

reading now? My question is, 
what book are you reading now? 

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.810
   » JOHN CENA: Okay. That's a 
great question.

00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:48.576
So, besides reading "Elbow 
Grease", I'm reading a wonderful

00:40:48.577 --> 00:40:50.577
story called the 

00:40:54.102 --> 00:40:56.543
storied life of AJ Fickry, it's 
about a bookstore owner and his 

00:40:56.544 --> 00:40:59.408
journey of life through books. 
And it's really, really good, 

00:40:59.409 --> 00:41:01.448
but maybe for a few years down 
the road. 

00:41:02.654 --> 00:41:04.654
Yes, right here. 

00:41:07.307 --> 00:41:10.845
» My name is Charlie, and how 
long did it take you to write 

00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:13.109
"Elbow Grease"? 
   » JOHN CENA: Oh, so, I'll 

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.110
answer the question with a 
question.

00:41:17.163 --> 00:41:19.163
How long do you guys think it 
took to write "Elbow Grease"?

00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:25.334
30 minutes? Five minutes?

00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:35.752
Ten minutes? Six minutes? Two 
minutes? I see a lot of twos. 

00:41:35.753 --> 00:41:39.423
    Would you like to know? 
Would you like to know how long 

00:41:39.424 --> 00:41:41.424
it took? Okay. Okay.

00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:45.468
Okay

00:41:51.212 --> 00:41:53.212
. It took

00:41:55.595 --> 00:42:01.736
me three years. Three whole 
years to write "Elbow Grease". 

00:42:01.737 --> 00:42:03.594
Now it seems pretty simple, but 
it's not simple. It's really 

00:42:03.595 --> 00:42:07.901
hard. And that's why I really 
wanted to tell the story, 

00:42:07.902 --> 00:42:09.902
because even though Elbow 

00:42:11.141 --> 00:42:13.195
Grease never gives up, there 
were times in those three years 

00:42:13.196 --> 00:42:17.908
that I could have been like man,
this is too tough. Or it's never

00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:22.184
going to work. And I never gave 
up, and I have a wonderful story

00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:25.679
to show for it, and I'm able to 
sit here and share it with you. 

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.722
So, it took a long time, and it 
was tough. It wasn't easy. Just 

00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:29.985
remember that. Sometimes the 
things you enjoy, they're not 

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:33.847
easy. They're tough, and they 
take a while. But keep at it and

00:42:33.848 --> 00:42:37.930
never give up. 
    Do we have another question?

00:42:41.965 --> 00:42:46.174
» My name is Julien, and my 
question is what is your 

00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:48.232
favorite color and your favorite
ice cream flavor? 

00:42:50.075 --> 00:42:51.688
» JOHN CENA: I'll only allow 
those two questions in one 

00:42:51.689 --> 00:42:53.689
question, because they're very 
good questions.

00:42:56.219 --> 00:42:58.219
Favorite color right now is 
blue, 

00:43:00.905 --> 00:43:02.905
because that's the color of 
Elbow Grease.

00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:09.031
Favorite ice cream flavor is 
chocolate 

00:43:12.472 --> 00:43:14.472
chip cookie dough with

00:43:19.382 --> 00:43:21.208
M&amp;Ms, and with hot fudge and 
sprinkles. I'm sure we have 

00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:23.860
more. I'm sure we have more 
questions. We have one right 

00:43:23.861 --> 00:43:25.861
here!

» JOHN CENA: What do I eat for 
breakfast?

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:39.928
I wish it was chocolate chip 
cookie dough ice cream. It's 

00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:41.929
not.

00:43:46.468 --> 00:43:48.468

of cereal, some eggs, and a big 
glass of water. 

00:43:54.033 --> 00:43:56.906

questions? Do we have time?

have about five more minutes. 

00:43:59.353 --> 00:44:01.603
   » JOHN CENA: Yeah. Let's get 
more questions out there. 

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.630

» Are you still a -- 
   » JOHN CENA: Now Jonathan, I 

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.396
thank you very much for your 
question, but I think you're a 

00:44:20.397 --> 00:44:22.397
little bit confused.

00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:25.825
You see

00:44:31.618 --> 00:44:33.618
, Bre is married to Daniel 
Grimes, so if 

00:44:34.865 --> 00:44:36.525
I answered your question yes, 
that would get me in a whole lot

00:44:36.526 --> 00:44:38.526
of trouble. So, the answer is 
no. 

00:44:42.208 --> 00:44:44.208
Do we have another question

00:44:45.681 --> 00:44:49.765
? We have a question. We have a

    Have I -- 

00:45:01.043 --> 00:45:03.043
How could you ask such a 
question?

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:07.957
I was just in Australia on 
October 6 in a WWE ring. And the

00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:10.822
next time in case you're 
wondering, I'll be in a WWE ring

00:45:10.823 --> 00:45:12.823
is 

00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:16.496
November 2 in a giant TOURNL 
tournament 

00:45:17.553 --> 00:45:19.606
to see what who's the best in 
the world. So, yes, I'm still in

00:45:19.607 --> 00:45:22.898
WWE. So, next? We have one. We 
have a question. 

00:45:26.172 --> 00:45:28.172
» Have you beat The Rock before?

Rock before? Does anyone know

Have I beat The Rock before?

One more time, have I beat the 
rockThe Rock before? I have. 

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.740
But, he's also beat me.

00:45:48.793 --> 00:45:50.793
So I've won, and I've lost.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.933
   » LEE ANN POTTER: I think we 
have time for two more 

00:45:56.934 --> 00:45:58.934
questions. 
   » JOHN CENA: You are doing a 

00:45:58.973 --> 00:46:03.036
wonderful job. There's a lot of 
questions out there, a lot of 

00:46:03.037 --> 00:46:05.037
excitement.

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:11.238
Do we have a question? 
   » LEE ANN POTTER: Okay. I 

00:46:11.239 --> 00:46:12.453
think we have one over here. 
   » JOHN CENA: We have one 

00:46:12.454 --> 00:46:14.454
right here. 

00:46:16.123 --> 00:46:18.123
» My name is Micah, and my 
question 

00:46:20.008 --> 00:46:22.008
is, why did you become an 
author? 

00:46:22.476 --> 00:46:24.476
» JOHN CENA: Oooo. That's a 
great question.

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:31.206
Because I wanted to encourage 
young people to read. That's why

00:46:31.207 --> 00:46:33.860
I didn't write an adult book. I 
wanted to become a children's 

00:46:33.861 --> 00:46:38.355
author, because I know a lot of 
children watch WWE, and a lot of

00:46:38.356 --> 00:46:40.356
children like to see 

00:46:41.408 --> 00:46:43.015
me perform, so I wanted to give 
a chance for young people to 

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:44.462
become readers.  
   » LEE ANN POTTER: And one 

00:46:44.463 --> 00:46:46.678
more, and that'll do it. 
   » JOHN CENA: One more 

00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:51.203
question. The final question. It
could be about ice cream... 

00:46:55.553 --> 00:46:57.553
» Hi, what is your favorite 
t-shirt?

00:46:59.614 --> 00:47:01.458
I mean your favorite shirt? 
   » JOHN CENA: What's my 

00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:03.459
favorite shirt?

00:47:04.915 --> 00:47:07.594
Well, I can't tell you that it's
what I have on, because I just 

00:47:07.595 --> 00:47:09.635
dressed up for you guys and I 
wanted to look nice.

00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:15.121
But, there's a picture of it 
right here.

00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:18.878
[ Laughter ] 

00:47:21.934 --> 00:47:24.165
I made sure that was my one 
demand when we did this whole 

00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:26.166
giant photo shoot.

00:47:27.439 --> 00:47:29.439
I said you better have my 
favorite 

00:47:32.782 --> 00:47:35.657
T-shirt there, and lo and 
behold, my favorite t-shirt was 

00:47:35.658 --> 00:47:38.502
there. White and comfortable. 
   » Thank you. 

00:47:40.545 --> 00:47:44.235
» JOHN CENA: You're very 
welcome. And wait a second.  

00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:46.271
Before we wrap up the morning, I
wanted to say thank you. Thank 

00:47:46.272 --> 00:47:50.569
all of you. Because I know 
sometimes it's difficult to sit 

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.426
in a place and listen to people 
talk. You guys have been a 

00:47:53.427 --> 00:47:57.530
wonderful audience. I want to 
thank you. I want to thank your 

00:47:57.531 --> 00:48:02.243
parents. I want to thank your 
teachers. I hope we had some fun

00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:06.117
today. Did you guys have some 
fun? This is probably the last 

00:48:06.118 --> 00:48:09.985
time today you'll be able to 
scream really loud, so give me 

00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:11.986
all you got! Did you have some 
fun today? 

00:48:14.815 --> 00:48:16.815
[ Cheers and Applause ] 

00:48:47.789 --> 00:48:50.228
[ Cheers and applause 
continue...

00:48:53.642 --> 00:48:55.642
]

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.927
    Pretty good. Pretty good.

00:49:49.892 --> 00:49:51.795
So there the most important 
thing I wanted to tell you guys 

00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:56.279
is -- I just wanted to make 
sure. That was very impressive. 

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.139
I want to thank everybody for 
being here today. I want to 

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.610
thank you for giving me so much 
energy to get through the rest 

00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:04.853
of my day. I hope you have a 
wonderful day, and I hope you 

00:50:04.854 --> 00:50:06.854
enjoyed the story. Thank you 
very much. 

00:50:08.352 --> 00:50:09.997
» LEE ANN POTTER: And John, the 
library thanks you, too. Thank 

00:50:09.998 --> 00:50:12.995
you.
