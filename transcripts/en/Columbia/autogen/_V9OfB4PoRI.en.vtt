of ethnicity and nationalism are
 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.109
of ethnicity and nationalism are
bedeviled by definitional debates and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119
bedeviled by definitional debates and
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.779
bedeviled by definitional debates and
this is not only important because some

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789
this is not only important because some
 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.930
this is not only important because some
of us like the abstract debates about

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940
of us like the abstract debates about
 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.790
of us like the abstract debates about
definitions but because depending

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
definitions but because depending
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400
definitions but because depending
on how you define some of the terms that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
on how you define some of the terms that
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.070
on how you define some of the terms that
we'll be throwing around this week

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
we'll be throwing around this week
 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.410
we'll be throwing around this week
depending on how you define a nation how

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
depending on how you define a nation how
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960
depending on how you define a nation how
you define nationalism how you think

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
you define nationalism how you think
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.770
you define nationalism how you think
about what animates nationalist

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
about what animates nationalist
 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.980
about what animates nationalist

that so I'm going to be talking about

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
that so I'm going to be talking about
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.490
that so I'm going to be talking about
some of the issues that are involved in

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
some of the issues that are involved in
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.760
some of the issues that are involved in
the definitions that we are that people

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
the definitions that we are that people
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.700

use for ethnic groups for nation for
 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.860
use for ethnic groups for nation for
nationalism and so forth and again at

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
nationalism and so forth and again at
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.750
nationalism and so forth and again at
this point it may seem on the abstract

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
this point it may seem on the abstract
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.680
this point it may seem on the abstract
side but in fact as you will see I think

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
side but in fact as you will see I think
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.720
side but in fact as you will see I think
today and certainly by the time you get

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
today and certainly by the time you get
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.600
today and certainly by the time you get
to your discussion there is a very

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
to your discussion there is a very
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.270
to your discussion there is a very
important relationship in this instance

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
important relationship in this instance
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.690
important relationship in this instance
as in many others between how you define

principal debates first are the
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.630
principal debates first are the
definitional debates how do we define

nationalist secondly where donations
 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.000
nationalist secondly where donations
come from how do we attribute history to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010
come from how do we attribute history to
 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.070
come from how do we attribute history to
what we have concluded our nation's once

they things that have been the same
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.960
they things that have been the same
since the beginning of time or do they

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
since the beginning of time or do they
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.280
since the beginning of time or do they
change over time

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290
change over time
 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.920

side of this coin and that's an
 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.020

something so not only are you an are you
and X are you a member of this community

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720
and X are you a member of this community

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.290
when you think about the ways that
people analyze nationalism and then the

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.300
people analyze nationalism and then the
 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.430
people analyze nationalism and then the
ways that they advocate nationalism

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440
ways that they advocate nationalism
 

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.680

so one of my favorite examples of this
 

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.600
so one of my favorite examples of this
is looking at the archaeology of the

is looking at the archaeology of the
 

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.200
is looking at the archaeology of the

imperial powers was one of the ways
 

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.600
imperial powers was one of the ways
they justified their claims to the

territory because what Italy was and so

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:13.420
territory because what Italy was and so
 

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.850
territory because what Italy was and so
they were and they called Libya the

territories that they had in Libya was
justified because the Romans had been

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560
justified because the Romans had been
 

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.650
justified because the Romans had been
there and you could see that because of

there and you could see that because of
 

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.750
there and you could see that because of
the archaeological sites so that's part

argues is things like print capitalism
 

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.910
argues is things like print capitalism
is things like being able to read and

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920
is things like being able to read and
 

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.860

people are reading other things and
reading it in other languages so

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:06.350
reading it in other languages so
 

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.830
reading it in other languages so
language becomes one of the important

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.080
vehicle for identity and for political
 

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.590
vehicle for identity and for political
action and there were entrepreneurs who

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:37.600
action and there were entrepreneurs who
 

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.140
action and there were entrepreneurs who
were competing for the loyalties of all

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:40.150
were competing for the loyalties of all
 

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.150
were competing for the loyalties of all
sorts of people throughout Europe and

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160
sorts of people throughout Europe and
 

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.950
sorts of people throughout Europe and
the rest of the world during the late

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960
the rest of the world during the late
 

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.200
the rest of the world during the late
19th and early 20th century for

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:46.210
19th and early 20th century for
 

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.980
19th and early 20th century for
precisely those kinds of identities and

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:49.990
precisely those kinds of identities and
 

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.160
precisely those kinds of identities and
those kinds of political movements so

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.170
those kinds of political movements so
 

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.970
those kinds of political movements so
one way of thinking about this is that

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980
one way of thinking about this is that
 

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:03.030
one way of thinking about this is that
you're looking at the incentives of

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040
you're looking at the incentives of
 

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.420
you're looking at the incentives of
individuals and a nationalist would say

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:06.430
individuals and a nationalist would say
 

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.980
individuals and a nationalist would say
that there is doesn't need to be any

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:07.990
that there is doesn't need to be any
 

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.310
that there is doesn't need to be any
incentive that actually we are all proto

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:11.320
incentive that actually we are all proto
 

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.320
incentive that actually we are all proto
nationalists ourselves anyway and we

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:13.330
nationalists ourselves anyway and we
 

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.680
nationalists ourselves anyway and we
just act on behalf of our nation out of

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:15.690
just act on behalf of our nation out of
 

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:20.370
just act on behalf of our nation out of
love for our fellow members of the

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:20.380
love for our fellow members of the
 

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.150
love for our fellow members of the
nation so there's a natural it's natural

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160
nation so there's a natural it's natural
 

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.360
nation so there's a natural it's natural
to be a nationalist or it's irrational

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:30.370
to be a nationalist or it's irrational
 

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.300
to be a nationalist or it's irrational
to be a nationalist that you're being

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:33.310
to be a nationalist that you're being
 

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.460
to be a nationalist that you're being
manipulated by the elites this is a form

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:35.470
manipulated by the elites this is a form
 

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.330
manipulated by the elites this is a form
of false consciousness or it's rational

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:39.340
of false consciousness or it's rational
 

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.490
of false consciousness or it's rational
to be a nationalist

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500
to be a nationalist
 

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.960
to be a nationalist
and there are a set of theories

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:41.970
and there are a set of theories
 

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:45.589
and there are a set of theories
associated with rational choice that

00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599
associated with rational choice that
 

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:48.500
associated with rational choice that
suggests that nationalism is a way of

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:48.510
suggests that nationalism is a way of
 

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.310
suggests that nationalism is a way of
engendering

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:49.320
engendering
 

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.010
engendering
trust among community members that makes

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020
trust among community members that makes
 

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.500
trust among community members that makes
their cooperation easier and it's

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:54.510
their cooperation easier and it's
 

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.750
their cooperation easier and it's
therefore a lubricant in relations among

00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760
therefore a lubricant in relations among
 

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.760
therefore a lubricant in relations among
rational individuals so it could be and

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:03.770
rational individuals so it could be and
 

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.550
rational individuals so it could be and
the analysis will you will see all three

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560
the analysis will you will see all three
 

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.410
the analysis will you will see all three
of those kinds of approaches that

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420
of those kinds of approaches that
 

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.910
of those kinds of approaches that
there's nothing to explain

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920
there's nothing to explain
 

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.890
there's nothing to explain
that of course there's something to

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900
that of course there's something to
 

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.450
that of course there's something to
explain but the people are being

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460
explain but the people are being
 

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.670
explain but the people are being
manipulated and they are falsely

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680
manipulated and they are falsely
 

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.130
manipulated and they are falsely
conscious or there's something to

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140
conscious or there's something to
 

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.480
conscious or there's something to
explain that this is really rational

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:20.490
explain that this is really rational
 

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.750
explain that this is really rational
action and therefore one could expect

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760
action and therefore one could expect
 

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.849
action and therefore one could expect
that rational actors would affiliate

00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859
that rational actors would affiliate
 

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:28.580
that rational actors would affiliate
with these kinds of communities and

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:28.590
with these kinds of communities and
 

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:30.500
with these kinds of communities and
identities because it makes it easier

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:30.510
identities because it makes it easier
 

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:33.980
identities because it makes it easier
certainly for in-group interactions and

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:33.990
certainly for in-group interactions and
 

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.870
certainly for in-group interactions and
to have strong in group interactions

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880
to have strong in group interactions
 

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.599
to have strong in group interactions
typically you have hostile out group

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:38.609
typically you have hostile out group
 

00:48:38.609 --> 00:48:40.730
typically you have hostile out group
interactions and that's one of the ways

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740
interactions and that's one of the ways
 

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.990
interactions and that's one of the ways
to think about the relationship between

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000
to think about the relationship between
 

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.790
to think about the relationship between
national nationalities and ethnic groups

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800
national nationalities and ethnic groups
 

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.160
national nationalities and ethnic groups
when they're in conflict this

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:49.170
when they're in conflict this
 

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.960
when they're in conflict this
rationalist approach does raise another

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:50.970
rationalist approach does raise another
 

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.400
rationalist approach does raise another
interesting question which we do not

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:52.410
interesting question which we do not
 

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.320
interesting question which we do not
have time to talk about today but you

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:54.330
have time to talk about today but you
 

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.030
have time to talk about today but you
may have time to talk about section

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040
may have time to talk about section
 

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.130
may have time to talk about section
which is when does it make sense to

00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140
which is when does it make sense to
 

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.800
which is when does it make sense to
switch identities if you're thinking

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:00.810
switch identities if you're thinking
 

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:02.270
switch identities if you're thinking
about this as a matter of rational

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280
about this as a matter of rational
 

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.140
about this as a matter of rational
choice then in a sense any calculating

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:06.150
choice then in a sense any calculating
 

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:07.820
choice then in a sense any calculating
individual would decide that it may be

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:07.830
individual would decide that it may be
 

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.730
individual would decide that it may be
smarter to be an X than a Y or a why

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740
smarter to be an X than a Y or a why
 

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.970
smarter to be an X than a Y or a why
then an X in at any given moment

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:12.980
then an X in at any given moment
 

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:17.720
then an X in at any given moment
this obviously suggests that natural

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:17.730
this obviously suggests that natural
 

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.480
this obviously suggests that natural
identity is not something you're

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:19.490
identity is not something you're
 

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.820
identity is not something you're
involuntarily forced into or stuck with

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:22.830
involuntarily forced into or stuck with
 

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.470
involuntarily forced into or stuck with
because of where you born what you were

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480
because of where you born what you were
 

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.930
because of where you born what you were
born in is but did you have options you

can change if there are appropriate

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:30.270
can change if there are appropriate
 

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.870
can change if there are appropriate
incentives for a rational individual and

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880
incentives for a rational individual and
 

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.240
incentives for a rational individual and
there are a number of interesting

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.250
there are a number of interesting
 

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.510
there are a number of interesting
studies that examine when people seem to

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520
studies that examine when people seem to
 

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.359
studies that examine when people seem to
switch from one kind of identity to

00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:41.369
switch from one kind of identity to
 

00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:44.390
switch from one kind of identity to

then we've hacked our way through the

then we've hacked our way through the

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.490
liberalism and democracy we'll be
looking at democracy yet again later in

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:51.500
looking at democracy yet again later in
 

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.890
looking at democracy yet again later in
the semester but it's worth thinking

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:53.900
the semester but it's worth thinking
 

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.700
the semester but it's worth thinking
about the extent to which much of the

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:57.710
about the extent to which much of the
 

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.640
about the extent to which much of the
way we think about democracy is

01:04:59.640 --> 01:04:59.650
way we think about democracy is
 

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:02.350
way we think about democracy is
confounded when people have not simply

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:02.360
confounded when people have not simply
 

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.600
confounded when people have not simply
individual identities as citizens and

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:04.610
individual identities as citizens and
 

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.180
individual identities as citizens and
popular representation is not simply the

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:07.190
popular representation is not simply the
 

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:09.630
popular representation is not simply the
representation of my interests and my

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640
representation of my interests and my
 

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.600
representation of my interests and my
perspectives as an individual but also

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:13.610
perspectives as an individual but also
 

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.930
perspectives as an individual but also
has to take into account the aspirations

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:16.940
has to take into account the aspirations
 

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:20.460
has to take into account the aspirations
of people as members of communities and

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:20.470
of people as members of communities and
 

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.770
of people as members of communities and
particularly members of ethnic and

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:22.780
particularly members of ethnic and
 

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.050
particularly members of ethnic and
national communities and under those

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:26.060
national communities and under those
 

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.510
national communities and under those
circumstances democracy is not

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520
circumstances democracy is not
 

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.950
circumstances democracy is not
necessarily ideally equipped to

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960
 

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.500
represent those interests in ways that

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:38.510
represent those interests in ways that
 

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:43.360
represent those interests in ways that
satisfy the citizens so it may be and we

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:43.370
satisfy the citizens so it may be and we
 

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.370
satisfy the citizens so it may be and we
return to Dahl that part of what we need

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:45.380
return to Dahl that part of what we need
 

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.140
return to Dahl that part of what we need
to be thinking about when we think about

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.150
to be thinking about when we think about
 

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:51.130
to be thinking about when we think about
how to promote democracy particularly in

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.140
how to promote democracy particularly in
 

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.040
how to promote democracy particularly in
divided societies is to think about the

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.050
divided societies is to think about the
 

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:58.390
divided societies is to think about the
sequence of institutional innovation and

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400
sequence of institutional innovation and
 

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.040
sequence of institutional innovation and
it may be that simply giving people the

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.050
it may be that simply giving people the
 

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.790
it may be that simply giving people the
universal suffrage and the vote lays the

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:06.800
universal suffrage and the vote lays the
 

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.580
universal suffrage and the vote lays the
ground more for the

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:08.590
ground more for the
 

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.590
ground more for the
the demagogues that I was talking about

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:10.600
the demagogues that I was talking about
 

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.130
the demagogues that I was talking about
before then it does resolves the kinds

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:14.140
before then it does resolves the kinds
 

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.730
before then it does resolves the kinds
of conflicts that are what the democracy

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:17.740
of conflicts that are what the democracy
 

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.910
of conflicts that are what the democracy
is supposed to address these this is the

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920
is supposed to address these this is the
 

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.880
is supposed to address these this is the
debate which professor Snyder has been

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:23.890
debate which professor Snyder has been
 

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:26.520
debate which professor Snyder has been
not only social scientists in but an

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:26.530
not only social scientists in but an
 

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:30.720
not only social scientists in but an
advocate as providing a variety of kinds

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:30.730
advocate as providing a variety of kinds
 

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:33.960
advocate as providing a variety of kinds
of policy advice to the democracy

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:33.970
of policy advice to the democracy
 

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.980
of policy advice to the democracy
promotion community and I commend those

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:37.990
promotion community and I commend those
 

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:41.420
promotion community and I commend those
sorts of debates you for your sections

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:41.430
sorts of debates you for your sections
 

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.070
sorts of debates you for your sections
and I think that's probably enough I

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:44.080
and I think that's probably enough I
 

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.390
and I think that's probably enough I
have 10 15 minutes for questions
