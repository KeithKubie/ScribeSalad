00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.003
(music)

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:08.041
- [Anna Temkin] 1913 was
a banner year for Leger.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.585
It was the year in which he figured out

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:14.881
how to become a Leger
instead of a follower

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.717
of Picasso or Braque.

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:19.469
He did a large series
of paintings entitled

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.221
Contrast of Form.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.932
Each of these examined
the ways in which these

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:26.852
basic primary and
secondary colors could be

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.812
put together with black and white

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.606
in order to make a
canvas like, that music,

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:35.652
could be appreciated
without having to read it

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.519
as a certain kind of scene or a narrative.

00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:41.199
Contrast of Forms, what
does that tell you,

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.620
not a whole lot, so what
he's not telling you,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.748
very deliberately, is that this painting

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.167
would have been figures and you see these

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.378
kind of mechanical shapes,
almost like mannequins

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:56.131
or tin men, that form
these vertical stacks,

00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.841
very much like bodies.

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.384
Like any painter at that time,

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:02.096
Leger would have training from life

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:03.638
to do anatomy.

00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:06.016
Now he's trying to put that behind him

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:10.103
trying to turn what might be a rather

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.649
calm image into one that almost seems

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.985
like a snapshot caught
at an accidental moment

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:18.987
in mid motion.

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:20.655
He wants you to look at this painting

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:21.948
as a painting.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:25.035
He leaves so much of that
burlappy canvas blank

00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:28.455
and raw, those pigments on it, they feel

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.417
kind of crusty and almost
like they're put there

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:34.503
not by a painter with a fine brush,

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:37.339
but somebody applying
things in a much more

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:40.592
rugged way, in a much more hands on way.

00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:43.595
The white is applied almost like chalk.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:45.013
It's so rough.

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:47.599
To make this picture pop, an offsetting,

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:51.561
contrast, as Leger knew,
to these reds and blues,

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.396
yellows and greens, that would have been

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:57.275
unthinkable in painting a
mere ten years before this.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.153
I bet you when this
painting was put on view

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:04.115
in 1913, most of the
viewers would have thought,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.201
"When is the painter gonna come along

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.411
"and turn this sketch into something

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:11.965
"that's actually a final product?"
