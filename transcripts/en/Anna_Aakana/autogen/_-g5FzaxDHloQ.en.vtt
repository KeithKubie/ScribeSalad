00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.040
We all encounter insecurity at

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.418
one point or another in our lives,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.450
probably...

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.400
multiple occurrences in our lives,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.500
and yet we all deal with it just a little bit differently.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.918
There's the one-uppers,

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:12.342
Oh, you speak Spanish?

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:13.439
Ah, me too!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Although I also speak Japanese.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.700
Trilingual.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.000
The people who take offense,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.055
I love watching romantic comedies.

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:21.800
You wanna laugh at my love life?!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.101
The people pleasers,

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.700
Here's all my money.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.255
The ones that put you down,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:26.831
Wow!

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:28.200
That was not funny.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.408
You are not funny.

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.770
You should stop making Youtube videos.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.361
The ones that put themselves down,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:33.987
Wow.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.517
That was not funny.

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:36.873
I am not funny.

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:38.927
I should stop making internet videos.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.200
(accent) The fishermen...

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.559
I'm so stupid.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.040
Right?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.988
I'm so ugly.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.404
Right?

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:48.442
I'm so wrong...

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.209
Right?

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:52.000
And the deflectors.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.602
I thought it was so well written.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:54.126
HUMOR!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.780
Get your fucking compliments away from me, bruh.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.800
I like to define insecurity

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.700
as the Eye of Sauron.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.400
Bearing down upon you,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.418
so that every move you make

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:05.209
or thought you think

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.449
or word you say

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.200
is just UNDER HIS SCRUTINY.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.178
And I found that the best way to deal with Sauron

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.818
is to try and forget myself.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.700
So if I'm talking to another person,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700
I will put all my concentration on them.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.396
So that there's literally no attention left
to reflect back on me.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400
I also used to pretend that I was invisible,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.700
no one can see me, therefore

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.000
no one can judge me...hmmhmmhmm.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.500
The best thing to do

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.600
is to just really remember

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
when you think about how tiny we are

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.900
in the grand scheme of things.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.800
Like, just imagine yourself standing next to the ocean

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000
and like, how fucking big that ocean is.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.200
Or how fucking big our planet is,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.758
or the universe in its unfathomable EXPANSIONS,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500
like that kind of stuff makes

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.106
my insecurities about

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.000
my vagina, or if I possibly have cameltoe,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.982
or if my butt looks weird

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.020
just seem so stupid.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.400
Anyway, I hope this video helped.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.178
And if not, then it doesn't matter

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:04.511
because stars are fucking ginormous

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.637
balls of gasses that twinkle in the sky

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:09.010
and they're beautiful.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.514
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.392
I really do worry more about cameltoe

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:14.240
more than I have--

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.400
more than I feel like you should have
to worry about cameltoe.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.015
Like how often...

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.666
does cameltoe plague you?

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.515
I don't know, but I don't want it.

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:24.276
I don't want..

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:24.776
