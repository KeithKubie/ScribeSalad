00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:09.066
Once, a long time ago,

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:13.084
there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei.

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.266
He had three promising students:

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.855
Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.194
Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth,

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:28.345
and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire.

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:33.366
Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.804
To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest:

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:41.894
whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:45.554
would be master of this mysterious gift.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:50.914
When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.465
They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched,

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.804
impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:01.214
When they returned to the hermit’s hut,

00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:06.525
they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.985
She had left her shawl out overnight

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:14.016
and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass.

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:17.643
Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children,

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:21.735
Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts.

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:27.195
He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe,

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:30.164
Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger,

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:35.576
and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:42.093
Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize.

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:48.065
He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.813
But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off,

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:57.144
Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force.

00:01:57.144 --> 00:02:00.794
Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala,

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:03.149
propelled on by a jealous rage.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.825
On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him,

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:11.885
knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal.

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.105
The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle,

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:18.904
and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.493
Sure of Vorachhun’s death,

00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:26.295
Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala.

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:29.606
He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him,

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:34.749
the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball,

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.315
or die like Vorachhun.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:42.153
Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds,

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.693
hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends.

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:52.345
Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:57.025
Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer.

00:02:57.025 --> 00:03:01.896
Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:06.086
Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:11.154
Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air.

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:13.624
As it climbed the height of the sky,

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:18.364
it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:22.235
Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:26.005
As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.876
creating deep, rolling peals of thunder.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.815
And when the lightning and thunder mixed,

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:36.331
precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain.

00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:41.564
Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe.

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:44.933
She pondered what
she should do to the murderer.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.743
Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher,

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:51.903
Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky.

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:57.663
Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her.

00:03:57.663 --> 00:04:02.485
Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:05.682
Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him,

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:09.833
his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.473
Grabbing his magic dagger,

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:15.842
he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala.
