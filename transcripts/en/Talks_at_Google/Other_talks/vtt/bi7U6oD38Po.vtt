00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; male presenter: I would like to introduce
David Brin, who is, despite that trip, still

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.140
alive.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.880
David Brin has been a science fiction author
for a very long time.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:18.720
As a result of having a fair amount of insight,
over the years written books like, "Earth"

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.500
and has ended up working as a scientist with
groups like NASA and JPL, over the years doing

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.930
very ordinary kind of scientific work as well
as doing the kind of science fiction work

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.860
that people like me appreciate.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.620
He's recently been working on a book called,
"Existence, " which seems to bare some resemblance

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.590
to other books he has written, but, that books
not out yet.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.750
It will be coming out in June.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.120
So, probably you're looking forward to it
as much as I am.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.251
He sent us an excerpt for us to read, which
I have the suspicion a fair amount of people

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:56.310
have looked at.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.850
And thank you very much for coming.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.850
[applause]

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.930
&gt;&gt; David Brin: Sure thing.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.930
[applause]

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.210
&gt;&gt; David Brin: What Alex doesn't mention is
that we've known each other a long time.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.400
Back when I lived in England.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.710
Back in the mid-1980s, I lived in London for
a couple of years.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.930
Very interesting times.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.310
The Thatcher years.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.310
[laughter]

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.600
And later on when I finished "Earth," my then
fiancÃ© got her doctorate at Cal Tech.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.690
We packed up our belongings and we had to
be at her post doc in Paris in six weeks.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.860
So, we took the long way around the world.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.630
If you ever go to India, don't get a round
trip without first looking into an around

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.060
the world pass.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.220
I don't know if they're still done the same,
but you can take an entire year to finish

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.590
it, zigzagging around the world.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.530
And we arrived back in L.A. a year to the
day after we left in order to get married.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.600
She still says, "You never gave me a honeymoon."

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
[laughter]

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.520
Well, because most of the trips after that
were with kids.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.360
I said, "I took you to Easter Island.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.650
I took you to Australia.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.650
I took you around the world."

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.850
And she says, "That was before we were married."

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.850
[laughter]

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.609
The day after we were married, we went on
a plane to the number one honeymoon spot in

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.299
the world.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.879
And she said, "That was going home to our
apartment in Paris."

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.069
[laughter]

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.159
A hard woman, but worth it.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.260
OK.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.040
So, I'm going to do just a lot of song and
dance just about ideas because here I feel

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.250
very much at home.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.340
I feel very much at home at Google.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.510
And besides, which I was born about 20 miles
from here.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.799
So, went to L.A. High.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.419
Same high school as Ray Bradbury.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:52.140
As a matter of fact, the one time my kids
gave me unalloyed respect for a two-hour stretch,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.499
all three of them at the same time, was when
I took them to meet Ray at his house.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.579
He got up from his walker, "David."

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.939
"That was Ray."

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.220
Two hours, solid respect, amazing.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220
[laughter]

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.220
OK.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.219
So, in any event, a hometown crowd.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.989
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to leap
and hope and jump around.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.909
So, what I'm best known for is the science
fiction novels.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.439
"Postman" was Kevin Costner-ized.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.219
Don't ask me about that.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.219
[laughter]

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.989
"Earth " is credited with having web pages
two years before the web was invented.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:34.989
Big deal.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.829
For a lot of us it seemed obvious where the
world was going.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.790
"Transparent Society " is one of the only
public policy books from the 20th Century

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.069
that's still in print and still selling more
every year, partly because of some very, very

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.670
creepy prescient predictions that came true.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.901
Partly because it's one of the only places
that is standing up for "sousveillance" as

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:03.739
a solution to our modern information problems.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:12.680
Rather than trying to use, as the Europeans
want, use law to protect people's privacy.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.040
As a short-term solution, I don't object to
such things.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.900
Over the long term, it's not going to work.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.220
The most recent book, which is coming out
with the cover on the left, in the States,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.160
and in the really creepy ominous cover on
the right.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.540
It's going to be in 3D, by the way.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.880
They're going to use new experimental process
in Britain for the cover of "Existence "there.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.770
And both of them will have this.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.970
I'm going to tell you guys for the first time.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.310
I just found out about it.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.600
Big, nice, glowing cover blurb from, Temple
Grandin.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.650
How about that?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.630
Have you ever heard of her?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.650
&gt;&gt; male #1: [inaudible]

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.360
&gt;&gt; David Brin: Most, well, the--.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
Yeah.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.830
The Clair Danes movie.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.840
Yeah.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.980
Most famous autistic person in the world.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.350
OK.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.650
But I'm going to get to talking about something
entirely different.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.410
And now for something completely different.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.030
I'm gonna talk about the big picture.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.470
Now, here's a big picture asp.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.690
One, just one of many.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.840
And that is the fact that for the last 500
years, western civilization has been having

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.220
breakthrough after breakthrough having to
do with three things.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:40.940
And that is our ability to see, our ability
to know, and our ability to allocate our attention.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.280
And the first of these crises was precipitated
by lenses, which empowered the ability to

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280
see.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.950
The printing press, which expanded the public's
access to knowledge and perspective.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.950
This is a little more complicated than this,
because about the same time the discovery

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.920
of the Americas and the vastness of the world
also have major effects upon people.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.670
Now each time, I'm gonna race through this,
each time what happened was, you had augmentations

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.330
of memory, vision, and attention.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.830
And one might also argue reach.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.860
Because your ability to do physical things
expanded as well.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.740
But these are the three I'm paying attention
to.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.310
And the result was not always an expansion
of people's wonderfulness, kindness, or even

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.090
empathy.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.570
Empathy did come from eventually, from augmentations
of memory, vision, and attention.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.900
But not at first.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.770
At first, these things were used for polemic.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:54.720
And the printed books that were produced after
Gutenberg's era for 150 years, tended to exacerbate

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.270
social problems.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.120
To exacerbate hatreds.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.080
And each time a quandary was developed, the
Renaissance versus rage of doctrine, and new

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080
concepts spread.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.320
The notion of progress.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.110
The notion of the value of an individual.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.330
Now I'm not going into these in detail, but
down here at the bottom, the knowledge mesh

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.910
is expanding our ability to have access to
memory in profound ways.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.889
It's almost as if you remember that.

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.650
This or that or the other.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.990
Omniveillance, television was one of the major--
radio and then television; these were major

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.740
forces that drove our ability to empathize
with people far away.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:48.260
Radio, the broadcasts of Edward R. Murrow
from the London Blitz helped to convince Americans

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.570
to get involved in World War II.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:59.300
Coverage from Vietnam helped to convince Americans
that this was not an undertaking that seemed

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.620
very worthwhile.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.000
Visualization, simulation and gaining, these
are all areas in which we are running into

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.140
the crisis that Linda Stones talks about when
she speaks of continuously divided attention.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.300
And as a parent of a kid in high school, who
wants to do his homework while Facebook is

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.830
up and while listening to music on the headphones,
I have to explain, "No, this may not be the

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.270
best approach."

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.800
And yet his generation insists that it is.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.680
The-.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.990
But you see my attitude is always the attitude
of the grouchy earlier generation.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:47.480
And that is that the people are not going
to be able to adapt.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.990
With each new tech wave, godlike expansions
of vision, knowledge, attention and reach

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.600
led to fear of hubris.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.540
Trying to take on God's power, or self-destruction.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.540
Future shock.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.110
I think your neighbor Alvin Toffler here in
town deserves to be considered one of the

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.339
great visionaries of the 20th Century.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:12.300
Because it's very clear that for the first
decade of the 21st Century, America has been

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.850
in horrible shape.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.040
State of future shock.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.649
At least a third of our citizens don't want
to have anything to do with the new era and

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:23.779
the new century.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.930
Which leads to cause for renunciation and
control by a trusted elite.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.990
This is something I go into in "Existence."

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.449
And yet despite painful adjustment we never
refuse these new prosthetics.

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:38.410
Always these godlike powers become the new
norm.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:43.430
Now who would have imagined that we would
be able to with this ape-like, or Garden of

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:52.279
Eden like, this ape-like organ in here to
be able to adapt to these floods of information,

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.950
vision, attention.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.790
Well, part of the answer is that as Carl Sagan
pointed out, we share the medulla and the

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.709
cerebellum with fish.

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:05.149
The mammalian cortex is laid upon it.

00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:09.399
The primate cortex is laid upon that.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:12.949
The portions that we share with apes are layed
upon that.

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:23.199
But then you go farther and what you get is
something that is just above the eyes.

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:24.199
Little nubs above the eyes.

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:26.930
Who can name them?

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.660
The prefrontal lobes.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.520
The prefrontal lobes are the organs that we
now know are the organs of the future.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:41.189
They are the seat of what Einstein called
the Gedanken experiment, or thought experiment.

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:47.459
Relativity was 50 percent him imagining riding
a streetcar at the speed of light leaving

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:50.260
the burning clock tower.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.990
And figuring out where all the rays would
go and where they would arrive.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.829
Only the-- only 50 percent of it was math.

00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:59.579
And he left half of that to his wife.

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:05.180
The point is that the Gedanken experiment
is what you do when you think with these prefrontal

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.420
lobes.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.720
What would happen if I raised this at the
meeting today?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.329
What would happen if I wear this?

00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:14.149
What would happen if I tried to run this yellow
light?

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:23.320
And as you guys, you males know, we have to
make those decisions about these Gedanken

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.170
experiments all the time.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:32.800
We're constantly saying, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.500
Now we know about this because pre-frontal
lobotomies, they are snipped and people lose

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.269
the interest in doing these thought experiments
about what they're going to do.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.240
They remain intelligent people.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.990
But that's why I would much rather have a
free bottle in front of me, than a pre-frontal

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.990
lobotomy.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.240
All right.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
All right.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.119
I saw the head shakes starting there.

00:11:55.119 --> 00:11:56.160
[laughter]

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.170
The point is that this layering effect is
arguably, what we are doing with these prosthetics.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:16.430
We're simply adding external layering's onto
this layered set of cortexes that has already

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.029
been taking place.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:24.829
And that is one theory to explain why we have
so gracefully adapted to orders of magnitude.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:32.679
Increases in our ability to know, remember,
to see, and pay attention.

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:36.319
I'm going to veer aside a little bit and get
even more general here.

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:38.720
Most human civilizations were shaped like
this.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.570
A few lords at the top lording it over vast
numbers of peasants below.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.170
And what was in the interest of those rulers?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.170
These were the allocators.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.920
And it made some sense for a while, because
we had very little surplus, frequent starvation.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:00.399
If you're going to have any kid live his whole
life without ever having an episode in which

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:07.000
his brain was starving, it might as well be
the kids of the priests and the lords.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.420
You had to have somebody.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.939
And so feudalism made some sense.

00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:16.749
And Locke's social contracts was, just rule
us well or we have the right to cut off your

00:13:16.749 --> 00:13:18.279
head and replace you with somebody else.

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:19.860
It seems likely to rule us well.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.709
That's the implicit social contract of Locke.

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:28.029
Now we are supposedly moving toward what Heinlein
prescribed as the explicit social contract.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:34.319
Where every 19 year old will negotiate with
the state and sign a contract.

00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:40.279
And if not interested in living by this contract,
go someplace else and sign a looser contract.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:45.790
Heinlein laid that out and it's a very interesting
potential end point for this process from

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.860
the implicit to the explicit social contract.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.019
And we're not going to go there at all today.

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:57.689
The point is that this was all an attractor
state propelled by Darwin and human nature.

00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:04.399
Once you're allured up there, it is in your
own Darwinian self-interest to persuade hundreds

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:10.570
and thousands of virile young males to go
off and fight and die to protect your seraglio

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.759
for you.

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:18.179
And the awesome thing is we're all descended
from guys who pulled that shit off.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:19.179
[laughter]

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:21.360
They actually succeeded at that.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.899
We're descended from the harems of guys like
that.

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:26.129
Wow.

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:29.980
So this is a major, major attractor state.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.920
And I defy you to take Dungeons and Dragons
dice, go home, roll up random decades across

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.869
the last 6000 years, and random locations.

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:43.249
Any place that had metallurgy and agriculture,
big males teamed up, picked up metal instruments

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:47.160
and took other men's women and wheat.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.379
Find for me the exceptions.

00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:55.230
Even the Soviet Union was run by nomenklatura
that acted exactly like the czarist ruling

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.300
class.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.209
The alternative is called the Western Enlightenment.

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:05.679
And it is very, very different in a number
of ways.

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.720
Including its shape.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.889
The first human civilization in which the
well off outnumber the poor.

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:14.749
And therefore, the poor is a small enough
portion of the population that we feel guilty

00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:15.749
about it.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.540
That we feel something can be done.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.690
Instead of a bitter sea that could never be
drained, it's a bitter lake.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.529
And therefore somebody's fault.

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:27.949
In every way, it's different.

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:29.189
The Churn effect.

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:34.970
The notion that no one should inherit automatically
the status of their parents.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:40.499
And the fact that we believe in the positive
sum game that the rising tide will lift all

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:41.499
boats.

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:45.170
Now, one can argue that we are in a position
right now that our parents faced and their

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.999
parents faced and their parents faced.

00:15:46.999 --> 00:15:49.709
Because this is inherently unstable.

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:55.009
If it's an attractive state-- attractor state,
it is a meta- stable attractor state.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:16:02.519
And every single generation, some of those
who got rich by these methods, do their best

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:05.679
to try to make it into a pyramid.

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.529
Because it's in our genes.

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:12.110
I don't think the Koch brothers are inherently
evil for obeying what their genes tell them

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.110
to do.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.170
We just have to stop them.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.269
[laughter]

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:17.790
Our parents did.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.790
Their parents did.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.679
The Enlightenment is over 200 years old I'll
have you know.

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:27.589
Do you know what the first acts, political
acts, done by our founding fathers as soon

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:31.970
as the Treaty of Ghent was signed and the
United States was officially independent?

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.149
Two things.

00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:42.480
A seizure and distribution of over one third
of the land in the colonies.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.579
And an utter ban of prima geniture.

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:53.420
You could not for 100 years leave all of your
belongings to a single child.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.449
It was fiercely- it's not fiercely enforced
today, but it was fiercely enforced then.

00:16:58.449 --> 00:17:02.329
Because they had, the large families divide
it up equally.

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:05.760
Your oligarchy problem goes away.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.079
Most people don't realize how radical our
founders were about this notion.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.990
Now, here's another big concept for you.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.610
You have hierarchical institutions.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.420
We've had them since Sumeria.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.420
Since the pharaohs.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.200
And, these are inherently pyramidal.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.750
You have commander in chief.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:33.880
You have pyramidal structures that are supposed
to do various things, enhancing their communications.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:41.120
Among these various portions of our government
is something I've been consulted on, and you

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.310
guys are engaged in that as well.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.510
Here you have a different type of institution.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.660
Here you have the four accountability arenas.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.840
Accountability arenas are the driving engine
behind the enlightenment.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:03.890
They harness creative competition, the greatest
force for creativity in the history of- in

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.540
nature.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.090
We are all result of creative competition.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:15.120
Darwinism made us and creative competition
isn't necessarily sweet.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.440
It isn't necessarily fair.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.100
Usually in the last 6000 years when it took
place in marketplace, we wound up with lords

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.960
who then tried to cheat to prevent further
competition from happening.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.650
But instead to have their own kids, own other
people's kids.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:41.310
The brilliance of democracy, markets, science,
and law courts is that they are designed to

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.510
harness competitiveness through ritualized
combat.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:54.890
In each case, there is highly ritualized regulated
form of combat that minimizes the blood and

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.290
waste on the floor.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:03.680
But maximizes rewards to those who actually
deliver a better product and service.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.230
Now, in some cases like markets, it's inefficient
and not always accurate.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.370
But we can afford that in order to have it
be more freewheeling.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:19.100
But supposedly, you aren't supposed to be
able to wind up at the end of a round of competition

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.370
with a monopoly that would then stop all further
competition.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:30.830
Instead, once you've created the new product
of service it's supposed to engender more.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.980
And if this is not what's happening then something
is wrong with the regulations of the system.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.780
Same is true with democracy.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.780
Democracy can be filthy.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.850
You can get wrong results.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.020
Boy, can you.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.651
But the point is, that supposedly you wind
up-.

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:51.630
Look, 2012 is the year that Robert Heinlein
forecast in his "Future History" back in the

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.830
60s and 50s that America would be taken over
by a fellow named, Nehemiah Scudder.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.830
Ever heard of him?

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.450
Oh, you really need to know more sci-fi.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.350
Nehemiah Scudder does not even win a plurality.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.750
But a Supreme Court decision gets him the
Presidency anyway.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.870
I think we're mixing this with a different
year.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:15.560
And then he clamps down, shuts down the constitution,
declares himself Prophet of The Lord.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.680
And there is a 70 year theocracy in America.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.800
Very, very chilling.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:25.580
The point is that each of these has its own
rituals and that's why we usually don't think

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.830
of them in parallel, but their similarities
outweigh their differences.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:35.170
There's always a centrifugal phase in which
through safety you can prepare your product.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:41.310
Your company, your political party, attorney
client privilege, or your laboratory and your

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.140
tenure in science but then there is ritualized
call to battle.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:51.890
The scientific conference, the publication,
the marketplace, the court trial and the degree

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:58.750
of ritualization is determined by the need,
or not need, for explicit accuracy.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.430
In courts, everything is extremely meticulous
because you can't afford a more than one percent

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.310
error rate but it keeps things slow.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.760
All right.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.540
Didn't need to get going on that.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.890
What I really care about is this one.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.170
You can see that these are entirely different
processes.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.760
This is the old pyramidal structure of decision
making, hierarchical decision making.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.150
We have needs for it, but it should devolve
to here wherever possible.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.280
Here you have structured competition.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.460
Here you have the people.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.500
And this is where web is starting to make
a difference in the ability of people to converse

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.950
and their ability to get involved in the problem
solving process and perhaps lead to an age

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.880
of amateurs.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.510
Now we spoke of the lamps on the brow, if
you're ever in Rome be sure to visit the greatest

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.760
piece of sculpture ever carved.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.080
Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.280
It's a few- it's about ten blocks away from
the Vatican in a little side church.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280
It's amazing.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.920
You swear he's about to stand up.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.020
And he's formidable.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.250
He makes you look like a little guy.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.680
OK.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.830
So the main reason why I show this slide is,
I do a lot of consulting for the Defense Department,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.200
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, CIA.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.340
After this trip, I go off to the Air Force.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.520
And I talk about the Professional Protector
Caste.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.130
The Professional Protector Caste has had its
budget increased tremendously since 9/11.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.400
And yet here's the interesting thing, on 9/11
they failed completely at what they aimed

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400
to do.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.100
And that's use these prefrontal lobes.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:42.400
To try to anticipate using data collection,
total information awareness.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.540
You've heard about the new two billion dollar
facility NSA is building in Utah.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:56.840
To hear everything and then analyze it and
then proactively act on dangers.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840
Fine.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.950
God bless them.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:06.080
As long as they are subject to scrutiny and
sousveillance.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.270
That's s-o-u-s- veillance.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.280
That means looking from below.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.530
Surveillance means looking from above.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.070
Incredibly important term.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:21.480
I helped Steve Mann coin it some years ago.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.020
Very important term.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.881
If we have sousveillance and supervision on
these professional protectors, then we will

00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:33.030
have a choke chain to remind it- the watchdog-it's
a dog and not a wolf.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:38.840
I need to be less chaotic here and spontaneous
because these things get recorded.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840
[laughter]

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.530
It's just- Ahh.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.530
[laughter]

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:49.690
But the other thing is to remember, is that
anticipation wasn't even involved on 9/11.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:55.730
Every single act performed by our professional
protector cast on that day failed.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:02.740
There was not a single success by any level
of professional protectors that day.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.760
Including the brave heroes in the New York
Fire Department.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:13.890
Remind me to get a link so you can see my
abortive TV show that I was supposedly going

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:20.650
to be one of the stars of, called "Architecs",
without a T. In which we slept in New York's

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.750
fire stations and interviewed the surviving
heroes of Rescue 1.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.080
And their comrades went charging into those
buildings.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.080
Very brave.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.680
Didn't work.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680
What worked?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680
I'll tell you what worked.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.830
Soon as I can get it.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.980
This worked.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.950
Average citizens out in the street saying,
"I know the 911 operators are telling you

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.270
to stay by your desk and help is on the way.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.570
Get out!"

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.690
30,000 lives saved by that.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.270
It was New Yorkers who fought the fires when
the professionals died.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.900
And it was people armed with this stuff that
rebelled, who rebelled on Flight UA 93.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.460
Ending the war that day because the war was
a test of our manhood.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.790
It is- it was essentially.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:20.680
Every decade Americans are challenged by opponents
who believe in the zero sum game.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.570
The fundamental ethos of the West and of the
Western Enlightenment is the positive sum

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.570
game.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:35.310
If you must read any book during the next
year read Robert Wright's "NONZERO."

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.820
That explains the distinction between these
two things.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:45.470
In a zero sum game, if I win a point, you've
lost a point.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:51.210
The positive sum game, I'm going to get rich
making Google and all my employees are going

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.950
to get rich just a little less than me.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.720
And all the people out there are gonna have
plenty of opportunity to get richer because

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.890
we set everything up.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.580
We all benefit from the positive sum game.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.600
Well, the point is there are many cultures
in which people are not raised assuming positive

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600
sum games.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:20.570
So, they look at America and they say, "You
guys are rich, you're happy, sexy.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.750
You must have traded something for it.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.490
"Hitler said so.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.140
The south said so.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.970
The Soviets said so.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.530
So on, and so on.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:37.160
Every generation makes this calculation and
says, "Americans, they have all this stuff

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.730
but they're decadent.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.020
They have no manhood.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.390
They have no courage.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.640
They have no guts."

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.710
And the heroes on Flight UA 93 disproved it
that afternoon.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.130
They won the war.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:59.230
Through the other thing, you have anticipation
and then you have resilience.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.800
So this is Steve Mann.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.140
This is the goggles arrangement he had in
1980.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.330
And it got smaller, smaller, smaller.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.610
And now of course, you guys are doing it.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:18.780
And this is a character from my new novel
where she has these little cyber activated

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:24.650
doogies that come up and look around in all
directions out of her hair.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.760
You can barely make out the stuff going on,
on the inside.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.060
And at lunch we were talking about how the
tooth clickers and the sub vocal checkers,

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.010
and all that sort of thing.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.610
And the main thing is, that-.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.250
Oh, have you heard about the latest DARPA
Challenge?

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.900
These annual things, a couple of years ago
it was to find the red balloons.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.750
And the-.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.100
Last year it was to remake shredded documents.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.650
This year's it's the challenge, and there's
a team in San Diego you could join if you

00:27:54.650 --> 00:28:05.350
want to, is to track five teams of fake jewel
thieves all across America and Europe and

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.610
to catch images of them.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.980
So the notion is you get smart mobs.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:16.690
And if you had read that scene, those scenes
that Alex told you about.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:21.240
Some scenes from "Earth", and some scenes
from my new novel, you'd see this in action.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.950
But this is from Patrick Farley's wonderful
web comic called "Spiders".

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:33.380
Where basically this little girl in America
is the one who finds Osama.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.160
This was pre Osama dying.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.170
Back when I was at Cal Tech as an undergraduate,
we were worried about something called the

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.520
overspecialization problem.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.550
It seems logical.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.140
It seemed to be completely where things were
going.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:52.060
And that is the notion that the-.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.860
Every year we know more, and more, and more.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.860
Right?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.650
Chemical abstracts used to be all on paper.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:03.550
And when the chemical abstracts would come
out every year, would be bigger, and bigger,

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.550
and bigger.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.660
And these are just abstracts of chemical papers.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.680
What does this mean?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.240
It means that every year in order to be a
specialist about something, good enough to

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.980
get a PhD, you have to know more and more
about less, and less.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.860
It seemed an unstoppable trend.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.110
And with the vocabulary getting narrower and
narrower, you would not know if someone in

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.580
the next building over there using a somewhat
different vocabulary was studying the same

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.580
thing you were.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.200
So you get duplication of effort.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.480
You get slowing down of accomplishment.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.860
You're 60 years old before you know enough
to get your PhD.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.640
It seems terrifying.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.060
Likely, it seemed unstoppable.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.360
There seemed to be no way out.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.490
And now it seems that no one ever mentions
this anymore.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.000
It seems a bizarre, quaint thing to ponder.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.650
Now the way I just described to you, it sounds
logical.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.070
And we may hit that wall again.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.550
Why didn't we?

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.490
Well obviously, I was there at the beginnings
of computer literature searches and I could

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.490
see.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.480
I could get links to things that were obscure
in various directions.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.870
And the trick was, I had to do the Google
tricks myself and come up with different vocabulary

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:21.170
twists that would sometimes bring in things
from other departments.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.450
But the other thing is that people got smarter.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:32.000
Down at UCSD, we just won the right to establish
the Arthur C. Clark Center for Human Imagination.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.670
It's gonna be wonderful.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.980
All the deans in all the departments, art
sciences.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.360
They've all signed on.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.360
Cognitive Science and Neuroscience is gonna
study the process of imagination.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.160
While getting involved the artists and the
authors.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.760
And then determining new ways of using computers
to enhance the imaginative process in kids.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.270
It's going to be very exciting and please
keep track of it.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.270
OK?

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.360
We'll have an announcement by the summer.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.510
But, the point is, that is reflective of cross
discipline.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.620
Of breaking down of guild boundaries.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:13.230
And the fact that, you guys there's a word
that starts with G.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.259
It's become a verb and a noun.

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:22.710
The point is that, that is the principle way
in which people have been able to get past

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.140
the problem of narrow-minded overspecialization.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:35.809
And now Nicholas Carr and the cyber grouches
are talking instead about a problem of broadminded,

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:40.180
scatterbrained, shallow mindedness.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.640
And that's the doom and gloom scenario people
are talking about.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.950
I'm sure you've all seen this cover of "Atlantic."

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:55.460
The notion that this is not necessarily making
us smarter; It's making us more aware.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.230
But they aren't necessarily the same things.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.130
Wish I had time to go into that in more detail.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.760
Now we won't go into huge detail about the
big picture issue.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.250
But another important book from the last few
years, get you nice and depressed about how

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.010
likely it is that we're going to have a collapse
of human civilization.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:21.000
The opposite extreme, the singularitarians,
as a contrarian who loves to be in the presence

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.170
of people he can say, "yes" back to you know,
libertarians who I can sound like a liberal.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.350
Liberals I can tell about Adam Smith.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.760
This is the golden age for me.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.800
I was garroted and burned at the stake in
all of my other lives.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.620
I get to live to be in my 60s and see my kids.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.650
And get paid for this because--yeah, but.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.610
Yes, but.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:52.670
The people who think we are all gonna be gods
in 25 years, remind me of Porgy and Bess,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.400
" It ain't necessarily so."

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.060
OK.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:05.130
The one big perspective thing that pins it
all is the Fermi paradox.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:13.880
And that is the question of why we see no
signs of anybody out there.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.100
The great big constructs that our descendants
may build, the visitations.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.690
The earth was prime real-estate for two billion
years with a no oxygen atmosphere.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.750
And nobody above the level of slime molds
to defend it.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.620
Why in all these movies do they show up now?

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.390
[laughter]

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.500
The Drake Equation of course, in one of my
papers.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.400
I've been engaged in this for 35 years.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:43.511
And in one of my papers, which is the only
major review paper about the field, I expand

00:33:43.511 --> 00:33:48.630
the Drake Equation because it doesn't predict
anything in that sense.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.630
But the whole notion-.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.150
You're all familiar with the Drake Equation
right?

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.230
The notion of the fraction of planets that
are out there.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.790
The number of planets.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:00.540
That's one part of the Drake equation that
has been expanded just in the last ten years.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.540
It's amazing times to live in.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:09.149
And we'll live to see whether or not there's
oxygen and methane on some of these atmospheres

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:11.030
and all that.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:16.980
But whether or not this pale blue dot, by
the way I consider this picture of the earthrise

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.030
from the Apollo 8, from that horrible year,
1968.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.090
It's like Pandora's Box got open.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:26.730
All the evils leapt out and there was this
little gleam of hope at the bottom of the

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.730
box.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:32.340
The Christmas message from the moon showing
a little oasis in space.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.960
One of the two most important works of art
in the history of humanity and it was done

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.260
by scientists.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.330
The other one was too.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.350
Who can name it?

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.350
It changed us forever.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.720
Changed our attitudes towards war.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.950
The image of the Atom Bomb.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:48.950
Both of them.

00:34:48.950 --> 00:35:00.450
Because visual art is changing human hearts
and minds without verbal persuasion.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:06.350
And the two most powerful symbols that changed
human hearts were the image of the Earth and

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.350
the Atom Bomb.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.010
So, the question is, will there be life?

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:15.010
Will there be the development of intelligence?

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:20.450
Technological intelligence that survives a
series of traps.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.960
A series of crises that might leave us like
Mars.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.590
In fact, there's evidence that this is our
second planet.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.890
We originally came from Mars.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.370
Because, don't you want an extra hour every
day?

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.990
Because wouldn't you be happier with half
the gravity?

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.990
[laughter]

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.990
Huh?

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.990
Huh?

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.990
We miss our homeland.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:43.500
Let's just hope we don't do to this planet
what we did to that one.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.370
The point is, I forget why I put that guy
there.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:47.450
[laughter]

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.440
The point is, is there a great filter?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.670
Why are the numbers small in the cosmos?

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.150
&gt;&gt; male #2: [inaudible]

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.100
&gt;&gt; David Brin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.100
That's the honey pot.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.970
The honey pot is one of the more popular notions
of, what keeps the-- It empty.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.710
And that is, we all, all the races go down
into cyberspace.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:16.040
And I don't believe it because if even one
race has a bunch of grouches who like to ride

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.230
motorcycles and are techies, then they'll
become Hell's Angels and they'll be the ones

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.560
who have the kids and go off into space.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.490
Everybody will be descended from them.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:32.880
While their distant cousins are back home,
ooooo, living forever in the web.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.850
This whole question of whether the great filter
lies behind us.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:41.500
And it may very well be that we are very rare
in our technological intelligence.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.440
Or, it may be, catch me some other time, and
I believe there's a good chance of this, that

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.190
99 percent of life worlds are water worlds.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.770
And that ours, with a lot of continental land
area, the ability to make hands and fire species

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.700
may be relatively rare.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.550
You have the guys who think it's coming right
away.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.220
Good old Ray, he's very optimistic because
he's one of the oldest of the singularitarians.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.690
So he thinks it's gonna come in time for him.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.400
And his younger colleagues are going "Oh Ray
sorry."

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.560
It's harder than you think.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560
Yeah.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.850
It's going to be at least another 20 years
after that.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.550
But in time for me.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.840
[laughter]

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.540
So anyway, this gives you the whole range
of some of the possibilities.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.540
He's a character in my new novel.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.680
[laughter]

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680
I couldn't resist.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.720
I couldn't resist.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.970
Everything that you see to this slide show
is all in the new novel.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:42.180
I want to get into some practical stuff that
is standing in our way of being resilient

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:49.650
civilization that practices the age of amateurs,
not in order to get rid of the professional

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.200
protectors.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.810
But in order to augment them.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.810
Because we are going to need healthy institutions.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.180
We are going to need healthy accountability
arenas.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.310
Those arenas, the markets, and courts, and
science, and democracy.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:10.350
And we're going to need to have the enhanced
resiliency that comes from a fully empowered

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.790
populous.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.619
In this argument that you saw.

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:18.471
In that Google is making us stupid thing.

00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:25.950
You have the cyber grouches like Nicholas
Carr saying that.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.930
It's not helping.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.610
Clay Shirky and the cyber optimists are all
saying, "Look how many people are expressing

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.620
themselves.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.460
All connected and expressing themselves."

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:44.140
And the average length of self-expression
goes smaller, and smaller, and smaller and

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.530
then had the major lobotomy down to 140 characters.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:56.930
Another major lobotomy when Facebook made
the return an automatic post.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.290
[laughter]

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.700
I could out do Facebook.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.380
Just, just, 20 million dollars.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.130
The point is, he's- they're both right.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:15.780
Do you remember how I mentioned this pattern
in the accountability arenas that have developed

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.450
over the last 300 years?

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:23.410
A pattern of centrifugal gathering in safety.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:29.190
Creating product, but then a ritualized call
to combat that could not be refused and would

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:39.180
result in maximizing the test of products,
while minimizing the cost that use to accrue

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.710
to that, to competition.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:46.120
Death, blood on the floor, monopolization.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.770
That pattern exists well in those old systems.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.070
It's always under threat.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.350
Several of them are under profound threat
right now in the west.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.690
But, we'll deal with it.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.560
We're no less people than our ancestors.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:07.520
The point is that the internet is missing
half of it.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.910
Think about it.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.610
It's got this.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:18.780
You've got people able to separate out into
little Nuremburg rallies.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.020
They can argue.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.280
They can stew.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.720
They can perfect their product.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:31.200
But war is the ritualized combat that makes
bad stuff go away.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.910
I'm not talking about creating an elite that
says, "That's a bad idea, no one will discuss

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.380
it anymore."

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:45.440
I'm talking about a kind of ritualized combat
that made the Edsel go away.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.890
Most of you don't get that.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.890
So, what?

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.050
What's something more recent?

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.070
That really-.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.070
[laughter]

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.119
&gt;&gt; male#3: Horror movies.

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.119
Myspace.

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.119
[laughter]

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:55.810
&gt;&gt; David Brin: All right, MySpace.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.880
That makes inferior stuff go away.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.250
How many of you have been on a blog in a comment
section?

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:06.530
And you wrote something that absolutely devastated
an untrue statement.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.970
And a dozen other people said, "Right.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.970
Yes.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:11.970
Dead."

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.410
And the next day you see it again somewhere
else.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.750
Nothing dies.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:22.970
And death is how creative competition works.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.740
All right.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.780
Let's just go through a few of these.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.470
Your phone.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.170
This phone was the hero on 9/11.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.330
On Katrina, and again at Fukushima.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:42.450
You had hundreds of thousands of people with
these in their pockets, fully charged, unable

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.410
to do squat.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:51.369
Fukushima they found several people had made
text messages and all of that they were clutching

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:53.100
their cell phones under rubble.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.440
They'd had time-hours-nobody came.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.440
The cell towers were down.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:08.300
I go at this again, and again, and again in-
at these defense meetings.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.130
It's insane.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:16.510
All it would take is a simple law demanding
that Verizon and the others include a simple

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:25.010
crude baron packet switching, text passing,
tier-to-tier system in the cell phones.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:30.720
You could even have it, so that if you don't
have a cell, it doesn't turn on unless-.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.060
If you are detecting a nearby cell tower.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.070
I think that's chicken shit.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:42.920
I mean if you could not come up with a system
that would tattle tale along the way from

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.880
cell phone to cell phone and tell who passed
it on until it reached a cell tower, give

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.580
them a penny each and charge an extra nickel
to the person who sent it.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.000
Then you don't deserve to be an engineer at
these companies.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.080
You should be able to make money doing that.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.080
[coughing]

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.800
But there's no excuse not to have it.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.650
Think about it.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:12.369
You're buried under a building, you can send
a text and then put it down go to sleep and

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:19.100
at some point when someone's passing by it
takes the text away.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.590
With a few dozen repeaters across the Great
Plains and the Rockies, we could have a crude

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:30.000
telegraph system across the entire country
if all the cell towers were down.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.650
But this should give the cell phone manufacturers
a way to go into that dark mile.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:42.101
You can say in most places, you will be able-
even in the dark mile, you'd still be able

00:43:42.101 --> 00:43:44.670
to send texts.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.960
Especially if people are encouraged to leave
their phones at the edge.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.340
Hooked and logged in, "Oh, I earned a buck
last night passing on"â¦

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.340
Why?

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:05.790
I talked to a vice president of Verizon; all
he could give me was just hate filled glares.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.110
I couldn't even get why.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:14.400
Other examples abysmal self-organizing software
on the internet.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.650
No emergency modes of access.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.140
There are people working on that.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.050
There's all sorts of examples on the web where
you can see where there are people who are

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.260
working on possible Wi-Fi based systems.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.890
Blue tooth based systems.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.100
There are lots of other examples.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.830
I'm putting solar on my roof right now.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.180
I've been asking about this.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.310
Do you know we have billions of people in
America with rooftop solar?

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.150
You know what happens in a power blackout.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.710
It shuts off.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:50.660
You cannot draw power from your own solar
roof in a power blackout.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.830
There are some clues.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:56.090
There are some rotten work-arounds that cost
thousands and thousands of dollars.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:01.980
What would it take to come up with a box that
people could add to their solar system that

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.520
would power one plug inside their house?

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.650
With all sorts of warning labels on it.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.260
You know, flashing lights and all of that.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:19.770
Just for their fridge and their rechargers.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.660
Why are we still vulnerable to EMP?

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.070
We've known about it for 40 years.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:29.640
It would surprise you now, but say Newt Gingrich
was right about that.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.619
Actually, he's the only one of the bunch who
would invite me to the White House.

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:35.619
[laughter]

00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:36.619
Because he's a sci-fi fan.

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:38.130
He's a sci-fi author.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.590
I mentioned the other sci-fi fan, Temple Grandin.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:46.230
Dull, dull, dull cell phone designs!

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.230
Awwwww!

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.230
Horrible!

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.230
Stupid.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:53.060
Oh, now I'm gonna take em-.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.150
[laughter]

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.240
No.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.780
Now I'm gonna show you what a cell phone design.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.650
Show you this.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.530
I'll talk meanwhile.

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:06.900
My son came up with this.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.760
I was part of a workshop in which we talked
about snap-on phones.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.150
In which you snap-on peripherals that could
do sensing.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.150
That could do detecting.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:25.210
That could put the laser display or the laser-projected
keyboard.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:29.030
All these things that you aren't normally
using.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.610
Interface.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:31.780
Web interface.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:32.930
You can see that-.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.760
Let me tell you something, I am old.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:47.780
Back in 1973, I sat at a teletype--there was
not a single computer monitor on the planet--

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:57.140
I sat at a teletype at Cal Tech and there
was one of the first networks in the world.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.530
A computer.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.340
A couple of other computers on campus.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:07.980
And I typed away at the teletype and in black
ink, D-B, colon, and part of what I said.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.960
Interrupted, C-K, colon, in red.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.660
What someone else was saying.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.190
Then, R-L, colon, and what someone else was
saying.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.320
And, D-B, finishing what I had typed.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.440
Now, here's the weird part.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.890
All of you know exactly what I am talking
about.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.430
It wasn't at all surprising.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.450
You understood exactly what I am saying.

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.450
Why?

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:36.180
Because sometime in the last few months you
did exactly that.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.670
Why did you whippersnappers have a clue what
I was talking about?

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:49.520
Alternating, interrupting, scrolling chat.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.070
I'm sorry the example here is Myspace, but
it's the same damn thing.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.820
Lobotomization, lobotomization, lobotomization.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.710
Have you ever been to Second Life?

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.660
I've had some of the most populated events
ever there.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.030
I'm sitting on stage, interviewing away.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.740
Wonderful buxom bods out there.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:21.030
And the actual exchange of informational content
is down here in the low half alternating,

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.130
interrupting scrolling chat.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:30.960
Now in fact, conversation goes back to the
Neolithic.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.220
I think our ancestors had cocktail parties.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.380
Seriously.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:40.010
I mean, you knew where you usually had a successful
hunt.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:46.510
You would send boys up ahead to gather firewood,
and to crush berries into gourds, and hang

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.580
them way up high in the trees.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.960
You had this year's successful hunt, you drag
the carcass over, you'd start the firewood,

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.109
and you invite the Ugrug tribe over, pulled
down the gourds and chat.

00:48:58.109 --> 00:49:01.910
We're good at it.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:09.190
And you know how in a conversation you adjust
who you're talking to by proximity, by angle

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:13.440
of orientation, by your estimation of their
reputation.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.920
&gt;&gt;male#4: [laughter]

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:23.890
&gt;&gt; David Brin: By the public estimation of
their reputation.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.260
By how interesting what they have to say is.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.500
Whether its topic related.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:36.720
But you've been in a restaurant and you've
seen when somebody mentions your name two

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.570
and three conversations away.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.020
What happens?

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.180
It pops out of the buzz.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.690
And you know, here's the scary part.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:49.000
A sentence or two before your name came up.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Several words of lead in.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.760
What does that mean?

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:57.220
It means your brain is providing services
to you.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:03.730
Constantly sifting and controlling what enters
into your conscious awareness.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.670
Now, all of these things that I've just described
to you-.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.220
Ha Ha, this is very funny.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.530
When are you going to stop wasting your time
with that science fiction nonsense and start

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.540
dealing with reality?

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.890
This being horse and cart.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:23.250
Very funny.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:28.530
We give high priority when we are able to
allocate our attention.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:37.130
We adjust attention by, criteria, topic, time,
reputation, etcetera, etcetera.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:44.869
The point is that everything I just described
to you is not existent in interaction on the

00:50:44.869 --> 00:50:45.869
web.

00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:53.450
Even though it's proved important and useful
in allocating what do we see, what we know

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.610
and how we pay attention in real life.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:01.710
These are real life phenomena that have not
made it onto the web and I can prove that

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.500
to you.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:10.670
If you look at the old Google Tech Talk, I'm
sorry I had a lot more caffeine that day.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.450
[laughter]

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:17.869
And that's taking breaks with my co-deliverer,
Sheldon Brown.

00:51:17.869 --> 00:51:22.410
He's going to be head of the Arthur C. Clark
Center For Human Imagination.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:29.570
Well, what I did during that talk is I looked
at my watch and said, "I know because I was

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.330
just granted a patent."

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:35.720
It happened to be on the day that my patent
came through.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:44.940
Every one of those things 
I own.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.450
Now, does that surprise you?

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.020
Does that make you skeptical?

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.530
Well, it should.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.070
I don't expect any of those things.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.619
Any of those claims to survive heavy-duty
attacks.

00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:08.240
Undoubtedly, there is some graduate student
somewhere who adjusted screen allocation values

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.750
by reputation.

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.619
Another who did it by angle of orientation.

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:16.860
We even found a couple at IBM that we had
to modify the patents.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:23.320
What the patent means is that nobody is currently
making a billion dollars off of us, those

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320
things.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320
Nobody at all.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.750
Let me see if I can remember where this goes.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.750
How's this work?

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:28.750
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:29.750
That's right.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:30.750
That goes there.

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.750
That goes there.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:35.330
It's been a little while since I've done this.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.450
It's gonna look a little awkward.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:49.550
Now, you're all used to answering the phone
like this and emanating into the world.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:51.991
How about, there's your watch.

00:52:51.991 --> 00:52:55.730
This watch is on your watchband.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.350
Ring ring, ring ring.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:05.010
Ah shoot.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:10.500
Hello? Microphone is here.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.859
This happens to bring your phone right up
next to your ear.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.590
Well, yeah, it did.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:19.950
OK, hello?

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.850
Now you're covering your voice.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:22.980
You're covering your mouth.

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.520
It will at least sell in Japan.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.520
[laughter]

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:31.420
Now, hey take a look at this.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:38.110
Oh wow, man that's incredible.

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.200
Hey.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.290
[laughter]

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:49.570
It's just an example of where you gotta think,
people say outside the box.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.930
You gotta think outside the playground.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.440
Because group-think is everywhere.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:02.710
Now, if you like, this is the Exorarium, I'd
love to set this up.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:12.260
It is a both computer game and museum place
where you would go from creation station to

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.890
creation station.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:19.190
And, you first choose your star, then your
solar system.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.530
And then your planet and then your ecosystem.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:26.470
And at the end of it you get your own alien.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:32.340
And we were invited up to talk to Will Ryman
about his thing, "Spore."

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340
Because he was way behind.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.280
He was a couple years behind on "Spore" and
he was scared of us.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.890
And so, we laughed and we said," if we had
four orders of magnitude and better funding,

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:41.060
you should be scared of us.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.060
[laughter]

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.400
And so, he described to us "Spore" where you
buy attributes for your race.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.010
And we said, "Oh, I see.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.950
You do creative design.

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:50.950
We do evolution."

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:55.619
[laughs] Now I thought he'd laugh, but Sheldon
said, "No, no, no.

00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:56.619
He was angry."

00:54:56.619 --> 00:55:03.490
But, then you take your alien race down to
the extraterrestrial terrarium and you have

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:04.780
encounter scenarios.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:09.270
You can do this online of course as a computer
game too.

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:13.970
You know, I would complain about the fraction
of my ideas that ever see real life.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:17.140
Except for the fact that I have a fair number
of them that see real life.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.680
And so, nobody's going to listen to me or
give me hearts and flowers.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.119
It's frustrating.

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:23.609
I don't even get any pity.

00:55:23.609 --> 00:55:30.290
So, my objective was to not be your typical
talk.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:36.880
To not have a particular focus but to dance
around and poke at ideas.

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.020
That perhaps some of them you hadn't thought
of before.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.030
Big perspective.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.599
Are us.

00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:45.080
Anybody?

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.030
&gt;&gt;male#5: Ok.

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:54.360
In that case, if you knew about Street View,
MySpace, and Facebook and other modern sharing

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.810
stuff that we've got now.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.570
At the time, you had written "Transparent
Society", you'd had many of the ideas back

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.710
then but things have turned out a little bit
different in various ways.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.210
How would you have written the book differently?

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:12.099
&gt;&gt; David Brin: It's all going inconsistently,
pretty much consistent.

00:56:12.099 --> 00:56:16.030
I would have more examples.

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:23.180
The fact of the matter is that we are seeing
a drift towards hierarchical institutions

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:27.320
having more and more power to see.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.260
The defenders of liberty are rightfully concerned
about that because the image that we have

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.890
of Big Brother with the telescreen, is pyramidal.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:42.750
And the main thing about the telescreen is
not the existence of the telescreen in 1984,

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:46.520
it is the fact that it is one way.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:51.750
Thereby enforcing power in a pyramidal structure.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:58.970
If the telescreen operated two ways, and the
people, even the Proles, were able to listen

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.790
in on every secret party meeting.

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:09.510
It would not matter that the party has absolute
power of physical control.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:16.490
Nevertheless, within a generation everything
would change.

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:21.100
It is not the equivalence of power that matters.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.830
It is some degree of equivalence of knowledge.

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.839
There are all sorts of potential equalizers.

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:32.560
For instance, you as an individual can join
non-government organizations.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:39.270
ACLU, electronic free- Electronic Frontier
Foundation, and all of these things.

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:47.060
By pooling together proxy power, you are enabling
them to hire professionals who are in range

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:52.960
of the professionals run by the Koch brothers.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.589
These techniques exist.

00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:57.830
These equalization techniques exist.

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.810
And we see this sort of thing happening all
the time.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.619
And, a recent example was WikiLeaks.

00:58:03.619 --> 00:58:11.430
I know the digital, top digital guy of Hillary
Clinton in the State Department.

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:18.500
And he said, he confirmed to me, that "If
she could give a secret medal without risking

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:24.920
anybody knowing about it, she would give a
medal and a great big wet kiss on the mouth

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.859
to Julian Assange."

00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:34.870
Because, he created what democracy and transparency
is supposed to create for our public leaders.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:36.220
And that's inconvenience.

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.390
He was highly irksome.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.270
But that was it.

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:42.500
There were a couple dozen embarrassing cables
that he released.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.370
And the storm over those went away.

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:51.290
Meanwhile, there were thousands of cables
released that showed our diplomats hating

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.370
Hosni Mubarak.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.920
Hating the dictators that they had to work
with.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:01.010
And totally within the cables being consistent
with our public statements.

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:07.800
The result was when the Arab spring burst,
and Assange says it was all because of him,

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.390
when the Arab spring burst there was not one
American flag burned.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:18.740
There was not one hint of anti-Americanism
in the Arab spring.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:26.180
In a large degree that is credited to the
fact that this asshole went ahead and leaked

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.690
a quarter of a million cables.

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:34.410
And the only loser out of this were our enemies
and that idiot who's going to go to prison

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.500
for the rest of his life.

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.420
Because he thought he was being an internet
hero.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:43.280
And all he was blowing the whistle on was
people doing their jobs.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.960
So, should we hurry through questions?

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.200
And those of you interested we could show
you that.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.369
But, thank you very much.

00:59:48.369 --> 00:59:54.119
You've been a lovely audience and go Google.

00:59:54.119 --> 00:59:58.029
