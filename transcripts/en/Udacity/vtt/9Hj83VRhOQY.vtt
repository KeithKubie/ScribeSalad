00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is: it's after the HTTP request headers.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me show you how to find that out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So first we'll go to our Editor

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we'll switch these lines around again

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so we can see the actual request.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So I comment these two guys out,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I uncomment these two guys--this is what we've been doing before.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's go back to our browser--okay, let's give it a shot.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to reload this page,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which is going to ask us if we want to resubmit the form.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We'll do so--aha!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And now we see our HTTP request.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This time it's a POST instead of a GET.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That's because we changed the method to POST.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We see more headers--we actually see a couple of these headers twice.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's kind of a side effect of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the fact that we're not printing the actual request.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We're printing the Python representation of the request,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which is a little glitchy--not a big deal.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We can see here, after all of the headers, we have some data:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
q=some+words--that's what I typed in my form.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Remember, spaces get turned into pluses.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So one of the big differences

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
between GETs and POSTs

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is that GETs include parameters in the URL

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and POSTs include the data in the request body.
