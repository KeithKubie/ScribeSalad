00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.810
&gt;&gt; So our next author's
name is Emma Donoghue.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.770
So Emma Donoghue is not only
an author, she's a playwright,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.320
a literary historian,
novelist, and screenwriter.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.550
Ms. Donoghue wrote the
novel "Room," which was made

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.350
into a feature-length film in 2015.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.950 position:56%
For those of you who haven't read or
seen it, "Room" is a harrowing tale

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.230
about a little boy named Jack and
his mother who are held captive

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.370
in a shed by Jack's father.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.130
It's a really haunting
story, for sure,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.640
but it's an incredibly moving
depiction of the relationship

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.210
between a mother and her child.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.770
The movie "Room" also has
a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
and it is Certified Fresh, if
that provides further incentive

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.960 position:56%
to see the movie and read the novel.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.360
Ms. Donoghue's most recent novel

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.170
"The Lotterys Plus One" came
out this year, in March.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.950
The novel's protagonist is Sumac
Lottery, a 9-year-old girl living

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.450
with her big, big family
in a Victorian style house.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.090
In the house are four parents,
six children, and five pets.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.770
How many people have that
many people in their family?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.070 position:56%
How many people have that many pets?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.550
That's a lot of pets.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.720
Just when we think that Sumac's
family can't get any bigger,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.460
her grandfather moves in
with them and Sumac has

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.610
to share a room with
her grandfather.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.790
This novel sounds truly,
truly delightful.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.510 position:56%
Without further ado, here to discuss
her works with you, Emma Donoghue.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.730
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.860
Thank you so much.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.320
I think this is the clicker here.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.670
Thank you.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.970
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: Hello all.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.960
It's lovely to be at the
National Book Festival.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.260
It's my first time.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.560
I'm very excited.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.160
I'm particularly excited
that it features sagbags.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.910
I think they should become a
feature at all book festivals,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.580
first time for me and
I'm seeing the appeal.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.670
And I like the way each reader
gets to occupy several sagbags

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.280
if they spread out correctly.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.200
I'm going to see if
my clicker works.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.500
I've never had a clicker before.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.800
It's all very exciting.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.060
Yes! And I start with
the elegant hand picture

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.370
because when I was a kid
and I wanted to be a writer,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.940
I assumed that it would involve
a lot of exquisite penmanship,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.910
you know, that I'd have a very
elegant hand and maybe a quill pen.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.960
And I was a bit worried that my
handwriting is particularly messy.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.970
So I've been comforted to discover

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.930
that the writing life
has not actually had

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.130
to include much handwriting.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.650
When I sign people's books and it's
messy, they don't seem to mind.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.450
My writing life in
fact looks like this.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.480
It's messy, not just in
handwriting, but in the mess

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.780
that spreads all around me.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.110
So that was one great discovery
for me about the writing life

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.500
that you don't have to tidy up.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.320
You don't even have to get dressed.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.090
So this one of my desks here.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.980
It's a pull-out desk on which
I just allow the mess to spill.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.720
And then another of my desks is any
surface I can sit on in my pajamas.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.860
I was waiting, for instance, in the
lunchroom for the authors upstairs.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.530
And I was writing in my
hotel room this morning.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.560
So my advice to young readers
to would be to write anywhere

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.730
and don't let any day get away
from you just because you happen

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.250
to be sitting on a bus, say.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.470
My third desk is my treadmill desk,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.770
which I thought I'd
show you a picture

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.300
of because people often don't
quite understand how a treadmill

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.730
desk works.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.450
This is the lazy author's
best friend because a couple

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.800
of years ago there was a lot
of publicity about how sitting

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.290
down all the time was very
bad for you and was likely

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.260
to shorten your life and I realized

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.140
that I was spending my entire
day sitting down and had been

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.070
since the age of about 4.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.220
So I decided to buy this
treadmill desk and I bought it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.720
without trying it out because I
thought I would probably hate it.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.790
So I hoped by spending the money on
this very expensive treadmill desk

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.090
that I would force myself to use.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.850
But actually I love it.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.870
So stand there with my laptop
on the desk bit and I walk along

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.320
at several miles an hour,
you know, just thinking,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.740
hands by my side sometimes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.000
and sometimes typing a few
words and it's just great.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.650
It just lets me get my
exercise while I'm writing.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.740
So this book I brought today "The
Lotterys Plus One" is the first one

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.720
that I've written mostly
on this treadmill desk.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.940
And that's an illustration someone
did of me on the treadmill desk.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.310
And what I love about illustration
is it gives the impression

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.550
that the pages are actually
produced by the desk,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.140
that the desk does my thinking
for me, that it's some kind

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.490
of miraculous dream machine and
they have not yet invented that,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.120
but if there's any clever
developer in the audience,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.680
please do because that
would be wonderful

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.070
if the treadmill actually
produced more than, you know,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.890
movement and static electricity.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.990
For the first year I spent
on the treadmill desk,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.880
I was getting slight
electric shocks all the time.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.590
That kind of added to the,
you know, keep me on my toes,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.890
keep me awake feeling of it.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.450
I just thought that was what's
it's like to be on a treadmill desk

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.750
until I mentioned it on Facebook

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.610
and somebody told me there's
a thing you can get for $2

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.330
which stops the electric shocks.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.260
Excuse me for the transitions.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.720
My 10-year-old helped me put this
PowerPoint presentation together

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.050
and she's got quite flashy
taste in transitions.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.890 position:56%
When I had kids about, let's see, 13
years ago, 13 and then 10 years ago,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.010
lots of other writers came up
to me and said things like,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.790
"Every baby cost you a book!"

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.350
What they meant was, you know,
when you have a baby it's going

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.150
to take a lot of time out of
your life and you'll be too busy

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.640
and you probably won't manage to
write a book in those few years.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.130
But I have found it
to be the opposite,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.910
that having kids was the most
inspiring thing I've ever done.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.470 position:56%
So that's what my children, Finn and
Una, in a pair of cardboard boxes.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.630
I didn't keep them stored
that way all the time.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.030
Okay, it was voluntary.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.760
They like to play in boxes
and with boxes and they

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.980
like to box each other up.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.100
So when they were this age, I heard
about a case of a child being born

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.240
into kidnapping situation
and I thought, wow,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.030
a child who was growing
up in a locked room,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.210
I guess he would just play with
whatever things there were,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.740
you know, and then I looked
at my son and I thought,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.320
he'd be okay in a situation
like that.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.620
He'd play with everything.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.490
He'd have little dancers
between the spoon and the fork.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.230
So that really was what inspired
me to write my novel "Room"

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.080
in which a child who's 5 not only
is growing up in a locked room

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.590
but thinks that that
is the whole world.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.460
And it was slightly inspired
by something my mother used say

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.760
and my mother had eight of us.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.150
So that was our normal,
an Irish Catholic family.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.450
She had eight children.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.320
And my mother used to say
that whenever she went

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.400 position:56%
into a public toilet, you know, went
in the cubicle and shut the door,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.580
she'd see our little hands coming
under the door, wanting her

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.000
and she would get the impulse
to kind of stomp on the hands

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.620
to make us go away
but she never did.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.000
She never did but she
had that feeling of oh,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.870
please leave me alone,
just for one minute!

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.170
And so I thought that the mother

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.800
in my book might sometimes
find it very difficult to be

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.430
with her kids all the time but that
the boy in the story would love it.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.480
This is my favorite piece of fan
art and a fan sent this to me

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.840
to describe what it was like
for her to read my novel "Room."

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.320
You see her face in the book.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.090
She felt entirely locked into
the room and scared and anxious.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.870
And although it's a scary
image, I love the idea

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.170
that my readers would feel

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.810
as if they are actually
living inside one of my books.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.930
That's a real thrill to me.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.230
So my kids grew up.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.850
As you can see, they're a bundle
of long limbs in the photo.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.070
And as they got older and I was
reading a lot of books with them

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.230
and getting so caught up
in the books with them,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.270
I began think I'd love to
write a book about not only

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.150
about kids but a book for kids.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.710
So I conceived the idea of
"The Lotterys Plus One."

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.310
I'm showing you the French cover
there because I just think it looks

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.440
so sophisticated once it's in
French, you know, [foreign words].

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.910
And I'm going to read you
just the very first page

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.390
from "The Lotterys Plus One."

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.850
In fact, it's a series and
this page is going to be

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.990
at the start of all the books.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.350
One upon a time a man from Delhi
and man from Yukon fell in love,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.020
and so did a woman from
Jamaica and a Mohawk woman.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.500
The two couples became best
friends and had a baby together.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.950
When they won the lottery,
they gave up their jobs

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.760
and they found a big old house
where the family could learn

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.250
and grow and grow some more.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.510
Now Sumac Lottery, age 9,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.800
is the fifth of seven kids,
all named after trees.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.010
With their four parents and
five pets, they fit perfectly

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.750
in the Toronto home
they call Camelottery.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.450
But the one thing in life
that never changes is

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.630
that sooner or later things change.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.620
So this is a sketch of what
the book would've looked

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.130
like if I had done the drawings.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.040
I'm just trying to make you
realize how grateful I am

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.710
that I didn't do the drawings.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.340
So luckily, the actual
drawings for the book are done

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.550
by the wonderful Caroline
Hadilaksono

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.370
and here's a two-page picture
of the entire Lotterys clan.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.250
So as I was saying, a big
family was normal to me.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.200
Eight kids just seemed like how
life was and then when I came

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.260
to North America for the first
time, people were just mystified

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.320
by how big a family I had been
in but it just felt normal to us,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.530 position:56%
you know, that you'd all be summoned
to dinner by a cowbell or a gong

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.610
or a drum or something
and that, you know,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.280
there would be a little notebook
with all your bedtimes written in

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.610
and all your pocket money
written in and it was a bit

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.980
like the Army and a
bit like a family.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.510
So the Lotterys are not
very like the Donoghues

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.490
because they're a much
more unconventional family.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.440
In my family, we sort of had to
be home for dinner at 6 o'clock,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.880
for instance, but I did try
to capture that sense of fun

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.200
and busyness and a big house, just
full of people and their stories

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.530
and their arguments and their
conversations and their jokes.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.020
So the Lotterys began with
the notion of a family

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.910
that would have two mothers
because my kids have two mothers,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.430
so I just thought, you
know, why not try that.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.750
But then that on its own didn't
seem interesting enough to me

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.000
and I thought what
else could they have.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.640
So I decided to give
them two dads as well.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.490 position:56%
And then I thought, well, let's make
sure there are quite a lot of kids,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.570
you know, let's just
go big or go home.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.850
So the Lotterys expanded and
then the pets came along.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.680
So all in all it sort of
branched off in all directions.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.990 position:56%
And I decided to write about a
family so expansive and so welcoming

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.420
that they could take a lot of
different things in their stride.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.210 position:56%
So there's the lovely Caroline
Hadilaksono who did all the pictures

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.380
and what I like is how she makes
each character look very different,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.670
because in a way if the
Lotterys have a kind of principle

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.860
as a family it's allowing people
to be different from each other,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.710
allowing people to be not the same.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.490
So here's one of the
pictures from the book.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:26.240
You will see that a scene set at an
airport and there is Lake Ontario

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.420
in the background and
that the famous Tower

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.990
in Toronto, the CN Tower.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.020
And one reason I have an airport
scene in that book is that I wanted

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.730
to make it a book all
about immigrants.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.700
The four parents are all from
different parts of the world.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.710
Only two of them were
born in Canada.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.010
One of them is First Nations.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.890
One of them has Scottish ancestry.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.200
And the other dad is from India
and the other mom is from Jamaica.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.010
So Canada, like The States, is
a country rich in immigrants.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:00.270 position:56%
And people have brought so much
different interesting food and music

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.400
and dance and language from their
different nations and especially

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.020
in an era where people often say
mean things about immigrants.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.670
I wanted this book to be really
celebratory of immigrants.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.220
I'm an immigrant twice
myself being Irish.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.490
I moved to England and
then I moved to Canada.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.730
So in this picture you see
Sumac in the foreground looking

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.010
around for her grandfather
who is hiding behind

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.410
that pillar there, at the back.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.940
So Sumac is a middle child
and they often neglected,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.670
but she's my point
of view character.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.350
So she really takes
center stage in this book.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.950
And in this particular
picture you see her horrified

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.530
to have been banished to the attic
because she had a lovely bedroom

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.800
of her own in the family's big
house but she's had to give it

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.760
up because her grandfather,
who she's never met before,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.680
has had to suddenly move in
because he's developed dementia.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.450
So he's not thinking
too clearly anymore

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.120
and he needs some looking after.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.110
And she's never even
met this man before.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.090
So she's appalled to find,
thank you, that suddenly has

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.670
to give up her bedroom to him.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.420
Her favorite sibling is probably
her big brother Sycamore.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.860 position:56%
I named all the children after trees
but they soon started rebelling

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.160
and changing their names a bit.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.330
You know, fictional characters
don't do what they're told.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.820
So he shortened his name
from Sycamore to Sic.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.250
Sic is a very handy little word
that editors used to mean, no,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.700
leave it the way I put it.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.390
Don't change it.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.720
So he calls himself Sic and
he makes his own T-shirts.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.570
So I've had a lot of fun
coming up with a list

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.350
of T-shirt slogans he would wear.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.890
And this one, his T-shirt
says, "back to front"

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.510
on his front to confuse people.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.770
And he's sitting on his little
sister there to kind of squish some

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.750
of the sadness out of her.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.460
The eldest daughter is called
Catalpa and I asked Caroline

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.630
to show her, you know, not
smiling in most of the photograph

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.260
because she's in that phase of life

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.960
where she's wearing a
lot of black, at 14.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.310 position:56%
One thing I like about these
pictures is that she manages to show

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.560 position:56%
so many different things going on at
the same time, like in the picture

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:09.740
on the right you've got a
light saber battle going

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.390
on in the background
as well as fireflies.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.150
The middle brother
was named Redwood,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.190
but he shortened his name Wood and
he's very, very outdoorsy and tries

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.380
to spend as much as possible of his
time in the woods behind his house.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.060
And he's got quite excited here
that his grandfather had brought

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.900
to the house lots of, you know,
taxidermied heads of hunted animals

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.680
in boxes, which appalls Sumac.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.620
One of the types of fun I was
trying to have with this book was

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.420
to give the family their own
kind of culture where lots

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.570
of things are they
take them for granted

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.080
like they're very eco friendly.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.380
They're always recycling.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.580
They go out on garbage night
and they salvage things

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.100
and make art out of them.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.970
And many of the things that
seem normal to them like lots

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.660
of vegetarian food or, you
know, interesting grains,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.960
their grandfather when he moves

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.260
in finds all these
things totally abnormal.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.560
So there's a lot of culture clash.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.730
One of the biggest painful
arguments the family has now is

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.310
that the Lotterys like to save
water by not flushing the toilet

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.960
until they really need to.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.150
They've got a philosophy which is,
"If it's yellow, let it mellow."

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.400
And the grandfather thinks
this is absolutely disgusting

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.770
and he keeps going around
flushing anytime he passes.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.290
Aspen is one of my
most useful characters

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.020
because he's a troublemaker.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.840
An Aspen tree is always
slightly trembling

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.600
and Aspen is in perpetual movement.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.310
This family don't go to school.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.040
They all stay at home and home
school or rather they roam around

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.310
and go on a lot of day
trips and home school.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.500
And Aspen likes to get
into a lot of trouble

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.030
by claiming things are experiments.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.360
You know, she'll set up
some complicated combination

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.080
around the house which is
likely to break a window,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.470
but she'll say she was
doing it as an experiment.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.240
So she's the middle girl and she's
a great maker of stories for me.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.670
Some of the Lotterys got
born into this family

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.110
and some of them got adopted.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.470
And one of the things
I decided to do

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.790
from the start was not
make a big deal about this.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.440
I couldn't care less which
of them were adopted.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.270
And I didn't ever want that to
be the big heavy issue dealt

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.570
with in the book.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.730
So Sumac is adopted and so are
the two youngest children, Brian.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.380
Another interesting
thing about Brian is

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.880
that she says she's not a girl.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.230
She's not decided what she is but
she says don't call me a girl.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.280
So she's going by Brian
at the moment

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.810
and Brian's gender fluidity is one

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.200
of the things I've had
most fun with in this book.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.840
And this particular book, far from
wearing either skirts or trousers,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.450
she wears a cardboard
firetruck for this entire book

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.270
until in a tragic scene
it gets left behind

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.050
at a outdoor showing
of "The Wizard of Oz."

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:52.330
And the baby of the family, Oak
[inaudible] and he is delayed

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.150
because before he came to the
Lotterys somebody shook him.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.610
So Oak needs a lot of looking after
and one of the things I'm dealing

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.630 position:56%
with in the book is how different
family members have different needs.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.590
And sumac is really resentful of
her grandfather needing looking

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.500
after because she doesn't know
him and she's not fond of him yet.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.840
But of course she's totally happy
looking after her baby brother Oak.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.510
So I'm looking at lot at how
if a family really works,

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.780
then it can be a kind of safety
net for all the different ways

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.860
in which different members
needs looking after.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.610
Here's one of the dads, PapaDum,

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.680
who's birth name is [inaudible]
and he's the main cook.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.880
Here's the second dad PopCorn.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.450
Quite early on I realized that
some readers would be annoyed

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.700 position:56%
by all these silly nicknames but I
thought, fine, I'll just way bye-bye

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.360
to those readers and carry on
with silly names because that kind

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.670
of thing, you know, if you're going
to do silly names at all you might

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.970
as well have a lot of
silly names and slang.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.560
So in this particular picture
is one of my favorites,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.280
PopCorn has got his glasses
entangled in a mobile

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.770
of the solar system, in a
very expensive toy shop.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.280
Here's one of the moms.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.690
She's Mohawk and her name is
CardaMom, which is a spice.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.450
And here's the fourth parent,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.120
MaxiMum who is a [inaudible]
Buddist, so she's always going off

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.130
and meditating and the kids or
the cats come and bother her.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.220
In the other picture, you
see her wearing a mask

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.950
because she's cleaning up
raccoon poo from their garden.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.170
And the kind of antagonist
or enemy figure

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.080
in this book is the grandfather who
the children quickly name Grumps.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.040
And when I was writing this book it
was my first time writing for kids.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.260
And I wondered, you know,
what is still taboo or still

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.680
against the rules in
writing for children.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.250
I found that most things are not
really against the rules anymore

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.540
but there's still quite a taboo
about a character smoking.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.210
So I thought, okay, if I'm going
to bring in this grandfather

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.180
who the kids won't at first, then
I'll make him the ultimate evil.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.480
I'll make him a smoker.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:56.680
So one way I'm going to show you
how I write is by exploring some

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.900
of the layers that go
into one tiny scene.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.260
So layer one is always inspiration.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.780
There's one scene in "The
Lotterys" which is inspired

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.970
by this crazy museum in Toronto.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.270
It's a 19 century museum

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.800
that they've added a
wonderful crazy glass section

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.510
to called the Royal Ontario Museum.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.690
So I took my kids there
to an exhibition

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.440
about the culture of
ancient Mesopotamia.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.540
And so I took notes on my phone.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.660
Maybe I've got particularly fat
thumbs but the notes all would come

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.960
out looking really messy and
then my phone auto corrects

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.760
them incorrectly.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.940
So this is what I would've
written on my phone.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.240
Finn [inaudible].

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.010
And then the phone corrected it

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.140
to fun fringe doing
cat's cradle asthma time.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.890
And then months later, I would've
looked at that and tried to figure

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.350 position:56%
out what I meant and I knew there
was no asthma involved in the scene.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.980
So what I think I meant was Finn,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.160
my son driving me mad doing
cat's cradle all the time,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.180
because he recently came back from
summer camp with a wool and string

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.250 position:56%
and was obsessed with making shapes.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.100
So I decided it would be
a good start for a scene

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.270
if the Lotterys were all at
this museum and if Aspen,

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:12.020
the most troublesome one, was
doing a lot cat's cradling.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.480
Then in this museum, I saw this
amazing ancient statue and I wrote

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.440
down Kong status, what
if lassoed this.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.630
And my phone corrected this to
kings state what I had [inaudible].

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.850
I think what I meant was the king
statue, what if he lassoed it,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.410
what if my naughty
son was even naughtier

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.440
and if he used his
cat's cradle string

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.500
to lasso this ancient
and priceless statue.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.080
So, you know, like I say, my
kids are extremely useful to me.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.780
Any time they behave
badly in public,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.510
I think what if that
went even farther.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.740
So here's my rough
draft of that scene.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.570
So this is Sumac who's a
really good girl trying

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.270
to find her troublesome
sister Aspen.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.240
And the bits I put
in brackets are bits

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.830
which at the time I'm
not sure about.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.290
First drafts can be so messy.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.620
You can see, you don't
even need to be able

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.200
to spell the word "lassoing."

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.110
She finds her big sister
two rooms back all alone

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.820
with a 3000-year-old stone statue
and making a pretty good attempt

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.320
at lassoing it with her
cat's cradle string.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.770
Aspen, you want us
to get totally banned

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.060
from the uh-oh building for life?

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.360
Oh, I should explain.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.100
Sorry. My son at the age of
three pointed at that museum

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.710
with all the crazy shards of
glass and he said, "uh-oh."

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.440
And I realized he thought
the museum had just exploded.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.270
So in our family, I think
every family has family slang.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.500
We've always called
it the uh-oh building.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.610
Her sister only giggles,
sniggers, brackets justifies self,

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.200
that means I couldn't think at the
time how Aspen would justify it.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.990
So then the first draft
turns into a sort

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.990
of a smooth looking prose
for the first time ever.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:51.000
And then the drafts that come after
that are following the principle

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.750
of what's called "killing
your darlings"

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.580
which although I illustrated it
with the picture of Finn trying

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.330
to throttle his sister on
Halloween and it really means,

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.160
look at all the bits you're really
fond of and say to yourself,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.350
do you actually need that
bit, is it good for the book.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.240
And if not, cut it.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.340
And I'm going to finish with
one of the pictures I like best

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.000
from the book where the Lotterys
are having a family meeting

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.520
which they call a fleeting and
they're having it on the trampoline

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.050
because being the kind of
family they are, they don't need

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.640
to do things in the usual
way or in the usual places.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.170
And Caroline also did a lot of
lovely pictures for the book

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.120
which are in silhouette
and I love this

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.690
because it turns the
whole family into a kind

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.960
of multi-armed, multi-limbed
monster.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.050
It sort of brings them
all together and

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.860
yet you can still glimpse
who the individuals are.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.510
And I suppose one of the things
I'm asking in this book is,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.530
is love a pie, meaning
Sumas has a feeling

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.510
that by including this new
grandfather, everybody else

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.860
in the family is going to end up
with less time, less attention

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.700 position:56%
from the parents, less of everything
and so really the question

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.980
that she's asking herself in
this book is, is it possible

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.660
to include somebody else and love
somebody else and still for there

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.500
to be more than enough
love to go around.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.800
Thank you very much.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.600
Any questions out there?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.500
[ Applause ]

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:25.800
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.520
Definitely although The
Lotterys is a series,

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.300
I'm still writing for
adults just as much.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.470
Yeah, I've always written
in a few different genres.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.730 position:56%
I've always liked writing historical
fiction and contemporary fiction

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.280
and I'm feeling the same
way about the new pleasures

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.080
of contemporary children's
fiction that, you know,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.260
they can't replace
adult fiction for me.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.500
And obviously my much darker stuff
I have to write for adults because,

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.040
you know, there's a limit to what
I'm going to put the kids through.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.570
I'm currently working on the
second Lotterys one we just set

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.540
in midwinter instead of summer

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.180
and is set during a big ice
storm that shut down Toronto.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.710
And so I've been enjoying
the pleasures of, you know,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.570
writing about ice and snow
and cold in midsummer.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.040
&gt;&gt; Are the Lotterys millionaires?

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.290
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: You know,
they are presumably millionaires

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.140
in that they have enough money to
all give up their jobs and stay

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.770
at home and that must
be a lot of money,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.260
but I don't have any idea
how much money they won

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.640
because I've never asked them.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.100
They're just not the kind of
people who talk about money much.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.600
And any time the kids ask their
parents how much money there are,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.250
the parents are like
enough, don't worry about it.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.600
Did you have a followup?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:42.150
&gt;&gt; I was going to ask them why
don't they live in a mansion.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.900
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: Why don't
they talk about the money?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Why don't they live in a mansion?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.320
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: Oh, well, you
know, it is pretty mansionly.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.710
You're only seeing the front of
it but it's got over 30 rooms.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.250
But that means a lot
of housework too.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.190
So the Lotterys have to do
chores and they have a big half.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.040
They borrowed this idea from
Hogwarts in the Harry Potter books.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.670
They have a big top half
with little slips of paper

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.850
that mention the chores
and their parents say,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.260
"Come and do your lots."

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.150
So they pick out lots,
like drawing lots,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.110
and each lot would say
things like, you know,

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.110
clean the cat litter trays or,
you know, roll all the bags

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:19.620
of laundry downstairs
to the basement.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.590
I've always liked books
which are about, you know,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.520
funny kinds of communities like say
The Wombles books, where, you know,

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.650
the characters in those
books just take for granted

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.080
that that's how their world works.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.480
So not quite pure fantasy but books
where, you know, a family is normal

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.970
to itself, but outsiders
would find it strange.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.690
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.990
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: Sorry?

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.830
Which one is more difficult?

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.000
Oh, it's way for difficult
to write for kids.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.340
Yeah. But that's not going to
stop me but it takes a lot of time

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.400
and work because you have to
put in all the same ingredients

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.830
that you would for adults.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.370
You know, you can't, like, do
a quickie version of anything.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.680
There has to be just as
much profundity and just

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.830
as much real thought in the books,
but then you have to make sure

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.040
that there's something
happening on every page as well

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.560
and that the words
are not too difficult.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.130
And often you can't assume that
your child readers will have heard

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.010
of things but nor do you want
to cut out every single thing

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.390 position:56%
that a child wouldn't have heard of.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.210
So there's a lot of, you know,
dithering about every little bit

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.650
of it, but it's so worth
it too, because, you know,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.310 position:56%
good kids' books are just best ever.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.810
So I'm finding a lot of adults
read kids' books as well.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.880 position:56%
You know, there's quite a cross over
audience there and I'm always trying

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.090
to get my adult friends to
read really good kids or --

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.910
books, say the Philip
Pullman trilogy.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.420
I often offer that to adult readers
who don't think they would ever

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.210
like kids' books because, you know,
these distinctions are not meant

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.970
to keep us in our little
reading boxes, you know.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.830
&gt;&gt; I have a question
for you over here.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:09.030
I wrote, not wrote, you wrote it,
you wrote "Frog Music" and "Room"

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.840
and those were completely
different voices,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.530
completely different stories,
completely different everything

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.070
and I haven't read the
children's book but it sounds

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.600
like there's a lot
of voices in that.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.290
How do you keep all the voices --

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.830
Well first off, how do you decide
what you want the voices to be

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.160
and then how do you
keep them straight?

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.320
&gt;&gt; Emma Donoghue: It would
be much harder to write books

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.590
in which the voices
were all similar.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.040 position:56%
I tend to write a few things at once
or at least I'll do like a few weeks

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.350
on something and then a few
weeks on something else.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.000
And the more different those
projects are the better.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.890
So if I'm working on say a
film script of "Frog Music,"

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.270
which is what I'm doing at the
moment, and then if I'm working

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.700
on the second Lotterys book,
there's no one sentence

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.050
which could be in both
those projects.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.500
So that helps me keep it
distinct, but also I work hard

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.200
on making the voices really
flavorful to begin with.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:05.710
So a character like, let me think,
the father who's called PopCorn

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.520
in this book, he's
particularly silly, you know.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.480
So he always calls his children
things like prodigious progeny.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.250
You know, he uses very theatrical
funny language and he's always kind

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.340
of flippant and a bit English.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.110
So once I've mulled over what
he's like, and done a list

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.220
of his favorite phrases
and his favorite nicknames

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.520
and what he would tend
to call his children,

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.180
then every time I'm writing
him, I'm sort of dipping

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.840
in that particular
paint bottle, you know,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.430
and with my historical fiction,

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.330
I suppose I do a huge
amount of research.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.040
So I'm really soaked in that era
and I have the kind of the slang

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.320
of the time and the, you know,
the root words of the time

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.680
and the sentence structures of
the time as well because it's not

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.660
so much that you always have to
use very 19th century words say

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.100
when you're writing 19th century
fiction but having a few terms

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.610
or phrase that sound
found Victorian,

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.160
they really help the reader
trust the whole thing after that.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.720
So really the more different voices
can be, the easier it is for me

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.380
to handle them all, you know.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.200
I suppose it's like
a circus, you know.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.920
You don't want two strong men.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:19.610
You want them all to play
very different vivid roles.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.060
Thank you all so much.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.360
I really enjoyed this.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.160
Thank you.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.310
