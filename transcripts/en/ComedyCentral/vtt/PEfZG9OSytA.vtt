00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.572
SO THIS ONE TIME IN COLLEGE,
MAN, I WAS STRAIGHT KICKING GAME

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.508
TO THIS BEAUTIFUL CHICK,
DIANA, MAN?

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.643
AND THE--IT'S A HOUSE PARTY,
AND SO ANYWAY,

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.512
I GO TO THE KITCHEN TO GRAB US
A COUPLE OF BEERS, MAN.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:15.082
I KID YOU NOT,
I SLIPPED ON A BANANA PEEL.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.383
A BANANA PEEL.
IT WAS LIKE THIS.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:21.522
I WAS LIKE--JUST FELL ON MY ASS.
I JUST BUSTED MY ASS.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.290
- A BANANA PEEL?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.458
- LIKE I WAS BUSTER KEATON
OR SOMETHING.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.760
I WAS LIKE--
POO!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.495
[laughter]

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.166
IT'S--UH--

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.703
- YO--YO, DOG, YOU GOOD?

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.974
- YEAH, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.311
- WHAT, ME?

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.114
IT WAS A FUNNY STORY.
I WAS LAUGHING.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.982
- THEN LET IT OUT, MAN.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.685
JUST--JUST LAUGH.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.320
- I AM.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.690
- YEAH, SO, ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
SO I GET UP, RIGHT?

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.958
AND I GO TO GRAB A BEER,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.726
AND I FORGET THEY
ALL WAS SHOOKEN UP

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.961
WHEN THEY FELL, RIGHT?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.665
I KID YOU NOT, THIS BEER
EXPLODED IN MY CROTCH,

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:05.866
AND IT LOOKED
LIKE I PEED MYSELF.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.769
AND NOW I'M TRYING TO WALK,
BUT MY PANTS...

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.438
[laughter]

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.007
COME ON, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.046

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.314

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.460
- WELL, WE WERE LAUGHING.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.596
YOU WEREN'T--YOU DIDN'T,
YOU KNOW, MAKE ANY NOISE.

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:39.533
YOU JUST OPENED YOUR MOUTH,
AND YOU STARTED JIGGLING.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:40.934
- YOU LOOKED LIKE
A WORM ON CRACK.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.236
- MM-HMM.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.874
- I GUESS EVERYBODY JUST
HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE LAUGH.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.675
- OKAY, MAN,
YOU WERE NOT LAUGHING.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.411
YOU WERE NOT EMITTING SOUND
UP OUT YOUR MOUTH, MAN.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:53.213
- HEY, I'M GOOD.

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.549
TELL YOUR STORY.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.851
- THANK YOU.
OKA--ANYWAY,

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.822
I WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN
TO GET TWO FRESH BEERS,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.224
AND SHE SAID, "I HATE BEER,

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.828
BUT WHERE DID MY BANANA GO?"

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:09.162
AND SO THEN
WE CALLED HER

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:13.967
CHIQUITA DIANA.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.769
THERE HE GOES.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.404
LARON, DON'T BACK UP.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:18.605
HEY.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.440
- COME ON, MAN.
- CUT IT OUT, LARON.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.043
- HEY,
GET AWAY FROM THE TURTLES.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.279
LARON, DON'T DO THIS,
JUST DON'T TOUCH MY TUR--

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.980
NIGGA, GET AWAY FROM IT.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.450
WHY YOU KNOCKING DOWN MY CDs?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.786
OKAY, YOU PUT A LAMPSHADE
ON YOUR HEAD?

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.121
HEY.

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.923
COME ON, THOSE ARE PRICELESS.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:37.558
NOW I SAY, LIKE,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.892
- ALL RIGHT, SEE?
THAT'S NOT EVEN--YOU KNOW,

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.460
IT'S ALMOST

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.595

CLEAN ALL THIS UP.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:42.930

LAUGH, THEN JUST LAUGH!

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.702
DAMN.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.441
- MAYBE SOMETIMES

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.145
YOU AIN'T AS FUNNY
AS YOU THINK.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.613
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:00.614
I GOT SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE
YOU LAUGH.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.450
HUH?
BAP, HUH?

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:15.629
- THAT'S FUNNY!

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.397
- COME ON, JUST LET IT OUT.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.832
COME ON, MAN.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.409

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.278
[all screaming]

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.348
[roaring continues]

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.185
[roaring stops]

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:46.560
- SEE, THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO LAUGH.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.210
HAVE A GOOD LIFE.
