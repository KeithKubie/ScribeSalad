00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.650
So, I made a new short film.
Yay! Well done, Charlie. 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.310
Lots of people said nice things about it.
Thank you very much to you folks, 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.760
but there were also a fair amount of people
who said some less than nice things about it,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.820
and, what are the odds, now all I want to
do is talk about dealing with criticism.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.940
First thing you need to get in your head
when it comes to taking criticism 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.180
is to remember that it is not
inherently a bad thing. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.440
Try, if you can, to be thankful that anybody
is bothering to criticize you at all 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.730
because that is so much better than someone
looking at something that you've made 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290
and being like,
"Yeah, it was alright." 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.900
That's not even
really a reaction. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.800
If someone's criticizing, you what
it means is that they are 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.860
paying attention to what you've made,
they are engaging with it, 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.260
and they're taking it seriously,
and those are not bad things. 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.800
The problem, really, just comes
in that isn't how it feels, 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
especially if you've been working
on something for a long time 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.230
because I think that, in my experience,
the longer that I've been working on a project, 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
the more that project feels like
a reflection of me personally. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.150
What I like to do is to try and create
much distance as I possibly can 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.610
between myself and the thing that I have
made because if that distance isn't there, 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.330
you're gonna look at criticism and
you're going to take it personally. 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.800
And really, the simplest way you can create
that distance is you just have to wait. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.120
You just have to resist looking at
those YouTube comments, 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.330
and then, eventually, that
distance will just create itself. 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.430
The next step for me, once I've
created that distance, is that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.790
I like to read the negative criticism, and
maybe this sounds weird, but, personally,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.620
as much as I love people telling me that
what I've done is great, who doesn't?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.590
It feels lovely. I just kinda thing that, often times,
the negative stuff is more useful. 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.150
It's not all gonna be useful. Obviously,
a lot of it will be people just being dicks 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.070
because that's what
people are like. 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.260
They like to tear stuff apart because
it makes them feel good. 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.550
Naturally, some of it is going to be like really
well thought out, really well meaning, 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.170
it will make perfect sense, but you just won't
agree with it. It's just not your taste. 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.080
That's completely fine,
but then there's the stuff, 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.180
and it's always there, it's
always in there somewhere. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.280
You'll just look at it and you'll
be like, "You know what, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.550
if I had done that, yes, it would
have been better. Okay.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.180
Oh well. What is the lesson I can take
from this to apply to the next thing I do?"

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.620
Now just as important as
knowing how to take criticism, 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.700
of course, is knowing how
to dish it out as well, 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.040
and the number one rule that I try
and stick to is, "Don't be a dick."

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.120
You just have to try and
remember that all the time, 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.560
there is a person behind that thing
that you just experienced 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.570
who might not be able to distance themselves
from that thing that they made, 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.820
and, especially if you're leaving a comment
on the Internet, they will likely see it, 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.030
they'll take it personally, and they'll feel bad,
and you won't have helped anyone. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.800
I just see it so often when like someone is
trying to give good advice to someone else, 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.410
but they're just not going
about it the right way,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.030
and to me, it's analogous to like writing
down the advice on a piece of paper, 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.770
putting it in a clenched fist, and punching the
person that they're trying to advise in the face.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.960
They can very well be like, "I had the advice,
it was right there, it's good."

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.660
It was right there in
front of you." 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.550
But all they're going to think is,
"You punched in the face!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.350
You pu-- I don't like you." 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.170
And honestly, learning how to hand
someone that advice isn't that hard. 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.600
All you need to do is tell them what you
liked about what they made 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.530
and tell them what you think
could improved. That's it.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.530
If all you do is tell them what you hated,
they're not going to listen to you. 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.700
So with all of that, hopefully now you'll
think I'm being genuine when I say, 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.340
"Thank you so much for watching my film.
Thank you for all of the positive comments. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.970
Thank you for all of the negative
comments unless, of course, 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.250
you're just being a dick, and let's
hope the next film is better, 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.300
that I learn some stuff, or else,
what's the point."  Bye! 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.550
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.800
which makes you, like, cool.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.590
(TYPEWRITER CLICKING)
 And in a turn of events that has surprised the world, 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.320
Charlie put a link to his short film
at the end of his video. 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.520
I hope you watch it if you
haven't already,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.960
but if you don't, it's ultimately not going
to be a problem. (DOOR SQUEAKS) 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.090
And now it's gone.
You missed your chance.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.938
(SIGH) Typical.
