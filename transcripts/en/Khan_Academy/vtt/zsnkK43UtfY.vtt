00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.992
Identify each number in the left column

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:09.172
with its opposite in the right column

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:11.355
They are taking opposites, these are integers

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.373
so they are taking about the negative

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:17.995
of that number.

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:27.191
So if we are looking at 3 its opposite in this context

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:32.206
we have 0 here, 3 is here to the right

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:35.457
so we go to the left of 0 for opposite

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:41.448
and we move the same distance 3 , so we have -3

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:44.188
So now 3 and -3 are opposites

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:56.959
No lets do 100, and -100 is the opposite

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:04.203
We have 12 , and -12 is the opposite

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:17.021
then we have -55, the opposite is positive +55 or 55

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:33.182
opposite of -3 is the positive 3 , almost done

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:42.934
opposite of -5 is the positive 5

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:53.104
opposite of 21 is -21

00:01:53.104 --> 99:59:59.999
and then opposite of -12 is positive 12
