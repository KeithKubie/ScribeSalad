00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.620
 We have succeeded in creating a corporate culture centered around innovation 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 Develop new features and address emerging challenges 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.400
 We are the company responsible for operating the LIFULL HOME'S real estate website 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.660
 Anyone planning to move to a new home 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 It is looking centrally and for a short time 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 Most of our queries come from computer pages 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.180
 Or mobile browsers 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.060
 And a little smartphone application 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.960
 But I think applications allow for deeper and greater connectivity 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.320
 Our mission is to increase the number of inquiries we receive through our application 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 That's why we focused on "users first" and "user happiness" 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260
 Our goal is to develop an application that meets user expectations 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.040
 Listening to our users is vital to achieving this 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.280
 So we started to answer every comment we get 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180
 Three members of the Panel have rotated on this process 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.599
 Through personal communication, users can see people behind the scenes 

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:12.160
 We conduct surveys and use results to help improve the app 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.600
 Then we test A / B on 50% of the ingredients 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 If it succeeds, try 100% 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.960
 The decision to introduce Bottom Navigation was the cause of several disagreements in the company 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.920
 But we decided to give it, for our convenience 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.320
 So we used the Firebase Remote configuration to perform the A / B test 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.480
 The reactions of the users were positive, confirming our chances of survival and adoption 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.280
 One of the key performance indicators we closely examined was the conversion rate in the app 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 Using Bottom Navigation has increased the conversion rate by 1.5 times 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040
 It also allowed us to improve the screen utilization rate 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.400
 LIFULL users have a clear AIM target 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.000
 The design is intuitive, the structure is good 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
 And even geometry, have all been identified in the multidimensional design 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 Everyone in our team agrees that this move was successful 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.080
 We work with the spirit of "user first" 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
 We used the A / B test from Developers Console 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840
 To perform A / B tests on Store Screens and Application Operator Token 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.600
 This has resulted in a 188% increase in stabilization rates. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 These figures confirm the effectiveness of our user-centric approach 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.560
 User queries across the application are the main internal performance indicator 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 It increased by 166% from last year 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.200
 Our Play Store rating increased from 3.5 to 4.2. 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
 We're very grateful for the feedback we've received from users 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.840
 We look forward to continuing our work on Google's new core systems 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 Providing innovative services to the industry.
