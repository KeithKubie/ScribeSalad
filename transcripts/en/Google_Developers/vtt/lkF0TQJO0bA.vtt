00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:11.080
On today's devices, apps rarely get
a neat little rectangle to run in.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.750
Notification bars
and controls can creep in,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.152
and rounded corners and notches
nip at your content,

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:17.761
complicating layouts.

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.782
That's why Flutter has SafeArea.

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:22.829
It uses a MediaQuery to check
the dimensions of the screen

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.821
and pads its shell to match.

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:27.030
So if your app looks like this,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.923
wrap it in a SafeArea,

00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:32.369
and keep your contents safe
on both iOS and Android.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.961
You can even specify
which dimensions you care about,

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.642
and wrapping the body
of a Scaffold works great.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:41.052
