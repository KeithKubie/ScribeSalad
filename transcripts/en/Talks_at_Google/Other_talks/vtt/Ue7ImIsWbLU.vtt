00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.330
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
here today with Yale

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.500
to talk about his
medical device company.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.590
What I learned from Yale
is that you can't really

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.130
quantify hustle.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760
And this guy, he really
knows how to hustle.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.670
Right?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.260
He is good at it.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.710
So without further ado, I'll let
Yale-- the hustler-- Zhang come

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.337
up here and tell you
about his product.

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.170
YALE ZHANG: Oh, man.

00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:36.140
Thanks.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.596
Hi, Alvin.

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:38.230
I don't know.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.438
I was going to begin today,
talking about vital signs

00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:44.195
monitoring, but I just want
to say, I would-- everybody,

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:47.126
give him a hand for his
speech because I don't know

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:49.180
if I can live up to
the hype that you just

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.430
described because wow.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.930
OK.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.870
Anyway, so everybody,
my name is Yale.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.570
And my company is
called Safe Heart.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.100
And I'm here to talk to you
about vital signs monitoring.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.769
But before I do that, let me
just show you what we make.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950
So it's an actual product.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.910
It's called the iOximeter.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.630
It's a vital signs monitor--
a pulse ox, actually--

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.170
that's powered through the
headphone jack on your phone.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.140
So I'll talk more about
the technical details,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.550
in a little bit.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.230
But first, let me
begin with a story.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.600
So we came out with the first
prototype, the first working

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.510
prototype for that, near
the end of last year.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.700
And I really wanted to
show everybody, wow,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.080
what a great product it was.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.389
So I took it with me
to a Christmas party.

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:36.680
A lot of my friends were there.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.971
A lot of new people were there.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:39.100
And I passed it around.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.210
And everybody wanted to try
it, to get their vital signs,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.720
to measure their vital signs.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.810
But there was one person there
who really got a great use

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.311
and benefited from
the iOximeter.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.060
And that's Maggie.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.120
So Maggie is actually
a friend of mine.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.950
She's an artist and a musician.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.200
And she was at the party.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.500
So when she measured her heart
rate and her oxygen level,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.050
using the device, we found
that the reading was actually

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.530
extremely low, that her
oxygen was in the low 90s,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.920
and that her heart
rate was around 47.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.560
And so she was concerned.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.660
And I tried to make
it not as serious.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.960
And I said, you
know, I mean, maybe

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.730
if you were an Olympic
athlete or you were asleep,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.494
that's the kind of heart
rate that you'd get.

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:26.160
But she was actually
concerned about it.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.430
So she called her doctor
and made an appointment.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.000
And two weeks later,
they did a full work up.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.450
And they found that her
medication that she was taking

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.770
for her insulin condition
was actually causing damage

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.600
to her kidneys, and
that, had they not

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.230
caught that at
that time, it could

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.350
have led to kidney failure.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.750
So the good news is that
they adjusted her medication,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.340
and that she's doing
a lot better now.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.320
And so she was the first person
that had used the iOximeter

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.980
and actually benefited from it.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.950
And now, now that our
product is on the market,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.160
I get phone calls every
week from customers

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.930
who call and say that
they had some condition

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.070
or they were using it
to monitor in some way

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.750
that they're able
to benefit from it.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.905
So back to vital
signs monitoring.

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:21.850
What I'm going to say today
is that, in the future,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.050
within the next few years,
all of our vital signs

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.010
are going to be available
to us everywhere we go.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.760
And that's because the
computational power

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.102
of the mobile handsets
that we have right now,

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:32.560
the mobile phones
that we have, are

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.680
going to be increasing
exponentially.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.450
And when that
happens, a lot of what

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.420
used to be done in
hardware is going

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.462
to be able to be
redone in software.

00:03:40.462 --> 00:03:42.920
And so we're going to be able
to have a lot of peripherals,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.811
attachments, and wearables.

00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.602
And you've already seen
that now, you know,

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:50.810
with the Nike Fuel FitBit and
other kinds of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.550
and other kinds of monitors.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.500
But what we're focused
on at Safe Heart

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.310
is we are focused on the
vital signs, the ones

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.280
that the doctors care about.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.530
So let me get a show of hands.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.700
How many of you have
heard or have seen

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.641
or know what a
pulse oximeter is?

00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:07.140
OK.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.180
That's actually a lot people.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.680
Cool.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.466
OK.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.840
Well, for the rest of you,
here's a brief history lesson.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.950
So in 1972, two
Japanese scientists

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.329
discovered that
by shining lights

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.790
of two different frequencies,
a red and an infrared,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.840
through your finger, you're
able to derive the heart rate

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.970
and the oxygen
saturation in your blood.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.890
And that is the principle
of modern oximetry.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.720
So later, companies,
such as Nellcor,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.020
would come out with these
devices, like the N-100.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.520
It's great.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.854
It has a digital readout.

00:04:35.854 --> 00:04:36.520
It's got alarms.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.645
It'll tell you, of your
vitals, if the measurements

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.750
are too high or too low.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.010
One problem is it's 25 pounds.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.670
So it's not a very
portable device.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.690
And that's where my
background comes into play.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.767
So I don't have a
background in health care.

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:53.350
I don't have a
background in medicine.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.190
And my background is
actually in logistics.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.900
In fact, my second startup,
called Clinical Guard,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.239
is actually a low-cost medical
devices distribution company.

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:06.530
Though, actually, the main
product that we're known for

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.970
is actually a $1
low priced THC test,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.551
to see if you've been
smoking too much.

00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:15.050
All right.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.940
And it's very popular
in UCLA, actually.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.700
That's actually one of
our biggest customers.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.520
So anyway, so I do get customer
phone calls on occasion.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.710
So in 2009, in the
fall-- that's actually

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.980
a picture of the
phone on my desk--

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.809
I had a call from a customer
who bought one of the lower end

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.350
pulse oximeters that
we were selling.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.280
And it was an elderly lady.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.750
And she said that though
she liked our product,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.222
she couldn't use it because
her eyesight had gone bad,

00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:44.430
and that she couldn't read
it because the display was

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.280
too small.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.400
And so I said, well, what would
you suggest as a way for us

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.370
to make the results shown
to you much more easily?

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.970
And she said, what if you could
show the results on my phone?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.960
And I said, you mean
like a phone oximeter?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.310
Is that what you're telling me?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.850
And she said, yes.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.240
And I thought, wow,
what a great idea.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.950
So I don't know how
many of you have

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.960
seen the movie
"Inception," but it's

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.710
kind of like waking up from
a dream, where I woke up,

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.300
and I said, wow,
that's a great idea,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.900
I want to make an
oximeter for the phone.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.920
So for the next three
years, I put together

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.960
a team, funded mostly by my
own savings, to come together,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.330
across multiple continents,
to make this device.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.279
So what I wanted
to talk about, now,

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.820
are the four goals,
the four founding

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.800
principles of Safe Heart.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.070
And the first one
is reducing costs.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.450
So what that means is that over
the last few decades, as we've

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.920
seen, the cost of health care
has gone up tremendously.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.080
And thanks to the
Affordable Care Act,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.540
the cost has been in
control, slightly.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.640
But our goal is to
reduce the costs.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.770
So if you think about how
plasma TVs-- actually, that

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.160
is a bad example, they're
not being made anymore.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.610
If you think about how LCD
televisions are continuing

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.540
to get much larger, and the
prices either stay the same

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.750
or drop, I thought, why can't
we do that for medical devices?

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.260
And there's no reason.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.020
There's no reason
why we can't do that.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.030
The next thing is
open access of data.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.500
So what that means is that
before, your doctor read

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.890
your chart, and they told you
their interpretation of it.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.220
But what if you could have
access to that data, yourself,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.050
and make informed
choices and make

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.490
informed choices from there?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.220
The other important thing
is that increased access

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.120
and validity.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.730
So what we're doing is we're
opening up all of our hardware

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.450
to third party developers.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.960
And we're going to
allow them to create

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.390
apps that run from there.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.650
So increased access--
I'm sorry, increased

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.970
accuracy and validity.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.740
What that means is
that-- so, for example,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.120
before, one of the problems
that had plagued clinical trials

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.920
is that the population
that they studied on

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.190
was homogeneous, which means
that the results of the derived

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.650
might have been skewed because
of the small study set.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.500
Now, because of the
deployment of our device

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500
and the fact that the app
can gather information

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.820
from every single user,
we're able to have

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.430
much finer granularity,
when it comes to data,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.960
so that we can make much more
intuitive and educated guesses

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.700
as to the trend.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.420
So, for example, we
can use it to study

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.330
where if someone is living
downstream from a power

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.320
station, is their
oxygen level going

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.640
to be lower because of that?

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.645
Now we can actually test that
by deploying these devices out

00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:39.669
in the field.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.470
So the last thing, like I
said, was the app ecosystem.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.970
Well, unlike some
wearable companies

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.810
that make their devices,
ours is going to be open.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.585
So we're going to
create an open API where

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.710
you can export all of the
data and you can actually

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.830
access and activate the
hardware and integrate the data

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.100
into whatever you're working on.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.880
So we want to be creative.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.400
But I know that there's a
lot more people, especially

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.480
people in this room, who
are extremely creative,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.120
who are already
having ideas on what

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.350
they want to do
with this device.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.560
So now, talking
more about the past.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.997
There's an old Chinese proverb.

00:09:14.997 --> 00:09:16.080
I know you've heard of it.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.090
It's probably been
used to death.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.090
It's called, a journey
of a thousand miles

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.481
starts with a single step.

00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:22.980
Well, for us, it was actually
a journey of tens of thousands

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.170
of miles.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.150
And the reason for that
is because, well, we first

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.656
came out with it--
I'm sorry to say that.

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.280
When we first came
out with the device,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.720
it was made for iPhone only.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.360
We came up with a solution
that used the 30-pin.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.870
And during that time,
Apple said, no, we're

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.020
going to switch everybody
to the Lightning jack.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.332
So we contacted
Apple, and they said,

00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:51.040
oh, yeah, you can use
the Lightning jack,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.124
but you're going to give us
this much money to license it,

00:09:54.124 --> 00:09:56.040
and you need to pay us
for every single device

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.810
that you use the
Lightning jack for.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.860
And I said, well,
you know, our goal

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.870
is to reduce the cost
of these devices,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.190
so how are we going to reduce
that if we were paying a tax

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.800
to use that plug?

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.320
So I said, uh, maybe we
could do something else.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.080
And so I said, well, let's use
the headphone jack, instead,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.830
because up until now,
every single phone

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:18.760
has a headphone jack.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.320
And for the foreseeable
future, they probably

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.627
will have headphone jacks.

00:10:22.627 --> 00:10:24.210
And the best part
about that is now we

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.820
can have a cross
platform device.

00:10:28.446 --> 00:10:29.820
So that seems like
a simple idea,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.642
but actually, it set
us back an entire year.

00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:35.350
Because there's a
limited amount of power

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.933
that's coming from
the headphone jack,

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:39.470
we had to make two
breakthroughs, one

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.350
in power consumption.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.183
So the original device
that we came out with

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.090
used 120 milliwatts.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.970
And the new device
that we have today

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.340
uses only eight milliwatts.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.162
So we reduced the power
consumption by over 95%.

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:54.750
The other innovation
that we made

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.340
was in data compression so.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.350
If you use the square or other
kind of credit card swipe,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.420
the data rate for that
is of only about 1k.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.890
Through compression
technology that we developed,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.432
we are sending data
back at about 20k,

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:09.320
so back to the phone.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.790
So that's why, now,
we have a device that

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.130
works both on Apple
and on Android.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.650
I didn't want to
infringe any trademarks.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.240
So we were using that picture.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.600
OK.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.170
So during the development
of our product,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.640
something else happened.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.640
It's the Quantified
Self movement.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.810
So starting with
companies like the FitBit,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.680
they're creating
devices that are

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.880
used to measure
everything about you.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.710
You know, how many steps
you're taking per day,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.660
how far did you
run, how many left

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.570
turns you made when
you're on the highway.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.160
Those things are good.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.600
And in fact, if you take
a look at the two images

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.960
here, that's actually a
map of all of the friends

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.637
I have on Facebook.

00:11:58.637 --> 00:12:00.220
And so that's part
of Quantified Self.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.050
And we want to contribute to
the Quantified Self movement

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.420
by creating actual
devices that monitor

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.460
the vital signs and
the same vital signs

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.160
that doctors have been using,
for decades, in the treatment

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.070
of actual health conditions.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.810
So we can contribute
to the, in addition,

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.760
new measurements
that can be taken

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.700
while you are going about
your everyday lives.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.640
Hold on.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.460
OK.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.870
Now, we're a small startup.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.340
And like I said earlier,
it was mostly self-funded.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.860
So we don't have a huge
marketing campaign.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.310
But we did try to do
some viral marketing.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.720
And so here is one
of our viral ads

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.390
that we released last Christmas.

00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:45.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Honey.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.290
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, baby?

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.165
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
want to have some fun?

00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:49.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.775
MALE SPEAKER: Wait.

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:51.880
I just want to be safe.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.140
OK.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.640
I'm ready.

00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:09.010
YALE ZHANG: OK.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.510
Yeah.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.960
It is a little bit risque.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.770
And believe me, there
was a huge backlash

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:19.320
from the nursing
community, telling us not

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.699
to advocate unsafe acts at home.

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:25.990
But the good news is, I mean,
we have over 30,000 hits.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.700
It seems to be pretty popular.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.260
And the people who are
forwarding it mostly

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.093
are people in health care.

00:13:32.093 --> 00:13:35.260
So I think the message
that comes across

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.460
is that unconventional thinking
and developing these products.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.690
We want to put that
message out there

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.960
in not just our product,
but also, in our ads.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.480
So let me tell you what I
like about the iOximeter.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.360
Well, if you take a look at
the exterior design up here,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.240
it's actually designed
by my friend, Simon Li.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.720
He was actually a friend
of mine from college.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.810
His background is
industrial design,

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.060
but he's mainly known for
bathroom fixtures, which

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.301
is great because you
would take a look at this,

00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:10.050
and it doesn't look
like a medical device.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.900
It wouldn't be out of
place on your coffee table.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.380
So what I also
like about it-- we

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.130
don't have any
proprietary ports,

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:23.020
which means that you can
use it with most phones.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.400
And the other thing is
that when you use it

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.700
with a different
operating system,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.090
if you want to
switch out phones,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.964
you're always going to
have a headphone jack.

00:14:31.964 --> 00:14:33.910
And I do a fair
amount of traveling.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.410
And the last thing
that I want to do

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:39.530
is carry a charger with
me, a bunch of chargers,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.477
a bunch of cables with
me, everywhere I go.

00:14:42.477 --> 00:14:44.060
Well, with the
iOximeter, because it's

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.039
powered from the
headphone jack, you

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:47.330
don't have to worry about that.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.500
You just have one device.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.990
You plug it in,
and it just works.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.950
And so back to what
I was saying earlier.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.910
This is how pulse
oximeters used to look.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.900
And this is how the
iOximeter looks now.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.760
So I'm going to
give a quick demo.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.260
All right.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.990
So my friend Lauren is going
to come over here and show you

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.050
how this works.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.440
All right.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.970
So what I have here is a S5.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.454
But you can also use
it on the phones that

00:15:15.454 --> 00:15:16.870
are produced by
the other company.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:22.990
All right.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.690
So what we have here
is the iOximeter app.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.830
It's started.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.210
And OK.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.939
Are you ready?

00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:32.730
LAUREN: I think so.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.368
My heart's beating a
little faster than normal.

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:34.680
YALE ZHANG: All right.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.310
All right.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.534
So OK.

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:39.200
I'm going to try to
show you right here.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.699
OK.

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:42.420
So basically, the
iOximeter app, it's

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.180
available on the Play
Store and the App store.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.600
It's gathering the
measurements right now.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.880
This is what's known
as a plethysmograph.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.935
And it's actually a
chart of the heartbeat.

00:15:54.935 --> 00:15:56.560
So Lauren's a very
good friend of mine.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.640
She actually came down
here, from Atlanta,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.220
to help support me on
this talk right here.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.530
But she's also the person who
told me about Maggie, earlier,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.039
who introduced me and
Maggie, and also Alvin,

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.330
and everyone else in this room.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.746
So she's a great
social connector.

00:16:11.746 --> 00:16:13.690
She's also involved
in a kickball league.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.100
And we're on the same team.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.570
So that's the story there.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.070
OK, good.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.430
So we have the measurements now.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.382
So what you're
looking at is actually

00:16:21.382 --> 00:16:23.840
a new version of the app that's
not available in the store.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.710
But we're going to be
releasing it this week.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.750
There's actually two
functions that are new here.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.833
So what we have here, on
the upper left-hand side,

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:31.760
the oxygen saturation.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.910
On the upper right-hand
side is the heart rate.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.597
So it's actually
dropped significantly

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:38.930
from where we started measuring.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.569
So--

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:40.360
LAUREN: Meditation.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.600
YALE ZHANG: Are you doing
that meditation breathing?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.100
OK.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.599
All right.

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:44.800
So the next thing is, on
the lower left-hand side,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.010
is profusion index.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.100
And that's a measurement of
the strength of your pulse.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.990
And on the lower right-hand
side is a brand new measurement,

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.580
too.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.220
It's respiration rate.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.280
And this is an improvement
from the app version

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.331
that we had just
a few months ago.

00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:03.830
Here's some other
functions that I'm

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.520
going to show just very quickly.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.380
There's a chart
right here that you

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.310
can use to zoom in and
look at the results.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.540
There's a summary
that you can use

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.596
to look at all of
the measurements.

00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:18.220
And then there's a
settings right here,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.829
where you can set
the alarms for when

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.617
the values are too
high or too low.

00:17:22.617 --> 00:17:23.470
All right?

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.119
And then, OK, so
now Lauren's going

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:29.140
to just walk around the audience
and show everybody the device.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.720
OK.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.220
All right.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:30.580
Yeah.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.913
Originally, we were scheduled
to have an Elmo projector,

00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:34.440
but it didn't happen.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.990
So we're going to improvise.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.770
All right.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.590
So what you saw
on the app was it

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.790
had the heart rate
and oxygen saturation.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.377
It had alarms to tell you
when the heart rate was

00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:47.960
too high or too low, when your
values are too high or too low.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.070
It's got recording
and the ability

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.120
to target your
results over time.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.594
We're actually working
on an exciting project

00:17:55.594 --> 00:17:57.010
with Wolfram
Research, where we're

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.310
going to be able to export to
their new programming cloud.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.361
You heard it here first.

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:01.860
All right.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.660
And then the new functionality
is the respiration rate

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.895
and the profusion index.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.170
So a new functionality that
came out for this app-- this app

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.126
is free.

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.750
All you have to do
is buy the hardware.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.070
And we're continuing to
develop new function for it.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.340
We're going to release
new updates for it

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.980
every few months.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.040
So one of the things
you're going to ask-- well,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.770
how am I going to make
money on this thing?

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.811
Why would I continue to
make new features for it?

00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:29.780
Well, one of the biggest
inspirations for me

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.710
was actually a
company called Nest.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.150
So two years ago, my
air conditioner broke.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.550
And as a part of that
new system that I got,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.540
I also got one of
these thermostats.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.570
And I only had to buy it once.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.500
But through the two years
that I've been using it,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.690
its function has
improved, and they

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.900
have continued to come out
with new features for it.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.900
And that's really been a
big inspiration for me,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.240
where we're going to make
a device that you only

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.270
have to buy once.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.430
You don't have to keep
buying a new version of it

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.180
every single year.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.130
You just buy it once.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.210
And we're going
to continue making

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.940
new functionality and
new updates for it.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.140
And here's an analogy
that I'll give.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.890
And it might be an
analogy that might

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.866
be too old for some of
you in the audience.

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:17.240
So when I was
younger, I remember

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.770
watching a movie called
"Charlie and Chocolate Factory."

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.360
And part of it, when they
made the factory tour,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.040
there was a candy called
the Everlasting Gobstopper.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.040
And one of the parents
that was on tour

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.460
said, well, if everybody
has one of these,

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.832
aren't you going to
stop selling candy?

00:19:35.832 --> 00:19:38.290
Well, that's fine because we're
going to do something else.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.472
We're going to make
other cool things.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.720
All right.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.450
So what was
inspiration for that,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.670
and why are we doing it
in an unconventional way?

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.180
Well, as I said, my background
is not in health care.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.050
It's not in medicine.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.060
It's actually in shipping.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.600
So one of the other
inspirations for me

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.440
was actually a guy by the
name of Malcom McLean.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.990
He was a person in 1934.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.104
He bought a secondhand
truck for $120.

00:20:10.104 --> 00:20:11.520
And over the next
20 years, he was

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.550
able to build a
trucking empire that

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.440
became the fifth largest
trucking company in the US.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.149
But he wasn't done yet.

00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.940
He wasn't done yet.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.100
At the time, the
law forbid someone

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.160
who had a trucking company
from owning an ocean shipping

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.960
company.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.570
But he had a really,
really good idea.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:34.610
So before his idea, when
you needed to ship something

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.850
from let's say New
Jersey to Miami,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.440
you could either use trucks
or you could pay longshoremen

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.220
to load things, piecemeal,
into a cargo ship.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.210
Well, his thought was
that, why don't we

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:51.120
have cargo ships using
a standard container?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.200
So it took a decade
of his life, but he

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.950
was able to convince
every single shipping

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.340
company to switch to a
standardized 40 foot container.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.960
And by doing so, he was able
to reduce the labor costs.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.200
He was also able
to reduce theft.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.960
And he was also able to
reduce the time that it

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.140
took to load things and
also, ultimately, the cost.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.170
So he reduced the cost of
shipping a ton of freight

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:24.360
from $5.18 down to $0.16 per
ton, a 97% decrease in cost.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.620
And so that's why,
every day, now, we're

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.160
benefiting from
that because we're

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.350
getting everything shipped in
here from China, via container

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.620
ships, at a very
inexpensive price.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.210
So back to the drawing board.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.980
We came up with the iOximeter.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.169
And now that you've
seen it working,

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:42.460
you know, you're going to
think, wow, it's really cool,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:42.995
I want one.

00:21:42.995 --> 00:21:43.611
Right?

00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:44.360
I thought so, too.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.470
I thought so, too.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.360
So we came up with the product.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.160
We went around to retailers.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.821
We explained to them, this
is how the device works,

00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:55.320
and this is why you
should carry it.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.270
Well, the first question that
major retailers, like Walmart,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.050
asked me was, why would
anybody want a pulse

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.320
oximeter on their phone?

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.760
And my thought was, why not?

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.270
So rather than sitting
there, in their office,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.580
and trying to convince
them otherwise,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.420
we decided to go
a different route.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.420
And that's why I
was here today--

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.563
to make that introduction.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.090
In the middle of
last year, I suddenly

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.714
discovered a thing
called crowdfunding.

00:22:30.714 --> 00:22:34.130
And I said, wow, isn't that
a great way to sell products?

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:38.010
So even though we already
had a product working,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.570
nobody knew about us.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.850
So through a fortunate
series of events,

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.120
we entered into the Insert
Coin contest over at Engadget.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.180
They selected us as
one of the products

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.250
to go out to the
show in New York.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.050
And after that, we launched
our crowdfunding campaign.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.590
And I will tell you this.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.600
I am not a social media guy.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.409
I barely use Twitter.

00:23:01.409 --> 00:23:03.450
In fact, I had only sent
one tweet my whole life,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.210
before then.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.900
So there were a lot of
things I didn't know.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.900
So that's why Alvin, who I
have hence called the crowd

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.051
whisperer, he was a big
part of our success.

00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:19.550
Although, I didn't listen to
all of the advice that he gave,

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.130
and we probably would've
funded a lot more,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.410
had I taken all of
the careful steps

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.790
and planning that we'd done.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.490
But regardless, we
had a 60-day campaign.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.272
The goal was $10,000.

00:23:32.272 --> 00:23:33.980
We raised a little
bit over that and were

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.530
able to pre-sell 188 devices.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.900
So that's the good news.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.610
So the campaign ended, we had
this money, and I thought,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.700
wow, this is cool, we're going
to go make this product now.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.262
Wrong.

00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:48.762
OK.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.700
We've never manufactured
anything before.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.000
I don't have a background
in manufacturing.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.060
So we ran into a bunch
of different challenges.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.560
The first one, communication.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.940
Well, when someone backs
a campaign on Kickstarter

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.280
or any other kind of
crowdfunding platform,

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.220
they're personally
invested in this product.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.300
So it's important to make
that person feel important.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.880
It's important to
make them happy.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.304
And I wanted to make sure
that they were happy.

00:24:22.304 --> 00:24:23.720
And the important
thing to do that

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.000
is if you encounter snags
or production problems

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.120
along the way or setbacks, that
you would tell them about that.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.100
Not what we did.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.791
Not what we did.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.040
So that's an important lesson.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.240
The second thing
was manufacturing.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.870
Did you know that
according to Pantone,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.020
there's over 1,000 different
shades of white for plastic?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.130
When we were making the
printed circuit boards,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.010
we had a problem where
they wouldn't fit.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.540
We had to figure
out new adhesives

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.394
to use that wouldn't
melt the plastic

00:24:58.394 --> 00:24:59.810
and would also be
strong enough so

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.810
that you could use it
for years without having

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.570
to break the device.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.410
And just, there's
a host of issues

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.700
that we wouldn't know until we
actually started making things.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.560
So there's a huge difference
between a prototype

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.660
and an actual finished,
commercialized product.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.230
And finally, shipping.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.020
Well, I'm standing
on stage today,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.570
but to let you know this.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.520
Did you know that after
the New Year is over,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.550
there is an additional,
separate Chinese New Year?

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.960
Because that's important to me.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.300
So once we had made
the devices, and they

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.470
were sitting on the dock,
ready to be shipped out,

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.880
Chinese New Year happened.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.840
And so, for two weeks, everybody
took a holiday in China,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.230
and nothing was coming
in or going out.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.080
So we were sitting here with
angry voicemails, emails,

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.090
and even a carefully
written, handwritten letter

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.170
from one of our backers,
asking where their product was.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.560
And there was nothing that
we could do about that.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.210
So it's important to plan ahead
and set realistic timelines

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.312
for when you're going
to deliver the product.

00:26:06.312 --> 00:26:08.520
But the thing is, there are
important lessons that we

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.320
did learn, though, and
things that really helped us.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.190
So first is getting
the word out early.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.210
So next time we run a
campaign or we come out

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.210
with some new
product, we're going

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.010
to listen to Alvin's advice.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.330
We're going to start
several months before, talk

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.480
to the right people, get
the PR machine working,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.140
and then just get
the word out there.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.090
It's not about making a great
product or great products.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.590
Yes.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.715
And you think, great products
will sell themselves.

00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:37.510
But it's really about marketing.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.140
And you might know
that, since there's

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.520
a lot of marketing dollars
being spent on products that you

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.500
buy right now.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.400
Next thing is talk to
anyone and everyone.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.370
And you know, that's the thing.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.190
And I actually
want to thank Ben,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:56.110
who's in the audience today,
about that because when Ben was

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.750
in town on Easter, he needed
a ride to the airport.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.646
And he said, can
anybody give me a ride?

00:27:02.646 --> 00:27:09.430
And I said, OK, I'll step up and
drive him down to the airport.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.110
And so during the
ride down there,

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.526
he asked me what
I was working on,

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:14.484
and I said, oh, I came
out with this iOximeter.

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:16.430
He said, wow, that's
a really cool product.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.440
You should come down
and do a talk at Google.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.230
And so that's why
I'm here today.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.790
So that's just one
of the examples.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.120
But you know, everyone
I've spoken to,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.720
even if they don't have
the same background as us,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.490
or they're not in
our industry, they've

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.930
been able to offer
new perspectives

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.610
and give us great insights
to make improvements

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.932
to our product, to our
app, and also, to the way

00:27:40.932 --> 00:27:42.890
that we're marketing and
selling these devices.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.860
So it's always important to talk
to everyone who you know or you

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.900
don't know about what
you're working on.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.927
Don't keep your ideas a secret.

00:27:50.927 --> 00:27:52.760
The next one is build
a group of super fans.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.890
So how many of you
know who that guy is?

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.540
OK.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.245
All right.

00:27:59.245 --> 00:28:00.120
He's Stephen Wolfram.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.620
He's actually the creator of
Mathematica and Wolfram-Alpha.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.720
He actually came by our
booth, and he saw our product.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.430
And I showed it to
him, and he said, wow,

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.310
that's really interesting.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.210
The next day, somebody
from that company

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.840
called us and said that,
yes, we want you to work,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.681
want your device to be sending
data to the Wolfram computing

00:28:18.681 --> 00:28:19.180
platform.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.850
I was like, wow,
that's-- really?

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.680
So it's not just him,
but through crowdfunding

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.100
this product, we were able to
develop a core base of what

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.330
I would call super fans,
20 or 30 people who we gave

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.570
early access to our app,
who can help us find out,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.110
to give us feedback.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.190
And as they're using
the app, they're

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.600
enjoying their day
to day activities.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.720
And they've helped us
improve the performance

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.790
and functionality greatly.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.000
And that's the other
benefit that we've

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.900
gotten from crowdfunding.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.990
So who are our
primary customers now?

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.680
Well, we have pilots, who are
general aviation pilots who

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.510
may be flying in
uncompressed cabin aircrafts.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.660
And they are looking
to avoid hypoxia.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.680
And also, high altitude climbers
who also want to avoid hypoxia.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.960
And also people who
are professionals

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.850
who are interested,
young people who

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.270
are interested in monitoring
every aspect of their health

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.980
as they want to
improve their fitness

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.590
or just to go about
their daily lives.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.680
And so this picture, I'm
actually most proud of.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.880
It's an image of every single
iteration of our device,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.690
from the first version
to the current version.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:46.130
So, as you see, there
are 13 different designs.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.190
There's actually a black one.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.440
Yeah, that was a one-off,
because I was thinking maybe

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.620
we could do a black one
with like a red cord

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.590
and then have like the
heart beats edition.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.100
I don't know if Dre
would like that.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.620
Anyway.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.340
So yeah.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.430
That didn't happen.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.433
But that's where we are.

00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:06.820
We are manufacturing
and selling this device.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.850
We have signed up two
major distribution deals

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:15.380
with the two largest
pilot and aviation

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.780
catalogs in this country,
Sporty's and Pilot Mall.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.020
And we also continue to sign
new distributors every week.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.790
So this is where I like to talk
about the next exciting thing,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.920
which is our partnership.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.230
So when I told you earlier
that all of the vital signs

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.950
would be available to
you in your future,

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:38.770
well, there's a team in Oxford
University, headed by Dr. Gari

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.740
Clifford, who has been working
on this for many years.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.370
So while we were busy
working on the iOximeter,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.710
they have been working on
a host of other devices.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.180
And so I'm glad to announce
a partnership with Professor

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.340
Clifford, where he
will be able to offer

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.930
the expertise and the knowledge
and also the technology

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.030
that their team has developed.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.220
And here's just one example.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.900
So the blood pressure
team, right now,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.390
consists of five
guys, [? Mauro, ?]

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.530
Marco, Carlos,
[INAUDIBLE], and Ali.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.830
And they're from
all over the world.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.220
They're working in a
laboratory in the UK,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.830
right now, on blood pressure.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.660
And they're working
on something that's

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.092
very, very extraordinary.

00:31:21.092 --> 00:31:22.550
But before I show
you what that is,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.680
here is a quote from
Professor Clifford.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.780
So he says that "we are aiming
to slash the cost of health

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.440
care equipment and transform
the landscape of competition

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.906
into the service-delivery
and software sector.

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:37.280
This partnership with Safe
Heart will accelerate our time

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.696
to impact and allow us to focus
on improving and designing

00:31:39.696 --> 00:31:41.470
new technologies."

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.770
He's basically saying that
we're on the same page,

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.570
that we both want to create
affordable, low-cost devices

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:51.640
for everyone in the world,
not just people that are here

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.460
in this office or in this
building, but everywhere.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.810
So one of the first problems
that we're going to tackle

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.372
is actually blood pressure.

00:31:59.372 --> 00:32:04.790
So as you may know, as people
from the Baby Boomer generation

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:11.040
get older, and as people's
quality of life increases,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.380
one of the side effects
of that is increasing

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.876
the number of people who
have high blood pressure.

00:32:15.876 --> 00:32:17.500
Well, there are blood
pressure monitors

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.625
that you can buy right now.

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.440
You can go to CVS and get one.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.920
But this new device
that they're working on

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.690
is going to be much
better in many ways.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.570
So if you take a look, that's a
picture of the current design.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.390
It's a small circuit board.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.150
It's a USB adapter that
fits on your phone.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.340
And it can fit inside
of a Tic Tac box.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.960
And what that makes
is this device.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.590
It's a hand-pumped
blood pressure

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.806
monitor that you can
attach to your phone.

00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:48.180
And why are we
using a hand pump?

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.510
Well, there are motor-based
blood pressure monitors out

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.250
there, but they're
actually fairly inaccurate.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.580
So by using a hand pump,
as in a sphygmomanometer,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.890
where-- yes, that's right.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.700
Gamification.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.030
That's what it's all about.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.740
So they made it
into kind of a game.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.370
But by using a hand
pump, we're actually

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.000
able to increase the
resolution and accuracy

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.890
by a factor of three.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.700
So this is what we envision the
final product will look like.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.100
And the best part
is we're going to be

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:27.530
able to have the product
available very soon.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.841
Now, currently, you can buy a
smartphone-based blood pressure

00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:31.340
monitor.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.120
They are out there
on the market.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.470
And their prices generally start
from anywhere between $6,220.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:43.590
This device is going to be
retailing for less than $30.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.527
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:45.527 --> 00:33:46.610
YALE ZHANG: So, what next?

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.040
Well, one of the problems
that still concern developing

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.650
countries is infant mortality.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.370
And it's mainly because of a
lack of health care workers,

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:00.580
a lack of facilities and
proper prenatal care.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.210
Well, one of the
products that we're

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.000
going to be working
on now is what's

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.650
known as a fetal Doppler.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.179
So from this early
prototype, we're

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:14.170
going to make a smartphone-based
ultrasound Doppler

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.409
that expectant mothers can use.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:21.690
And it's going to look something
like this, where you can just

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.550
put it on the stomach,
it'll measure the heart

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.139
rate of the unborn child, and
it'll display it on the screen.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.920
And you can also record
a 10 second audio clip

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.080
so that you can send it to your
doctor or grandma or Instagram.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.650
So whatever-- OK.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.780
And we expect the retail
price for this device

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.250
to be less than $50.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.500
So what I'm saying
is that we're working

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.303
on a lot of great technologies.

00:34:54.303 --> 00:34:55.719
And through our
partnership, we're

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.552
going to come out with
a lot of cool things.

00:34:57.552 --> 00:35:00.430
So we're going to
make a sporometer.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.580
We're going to make an ECG.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.310
And basically, what I'm saying
is that what we want to do

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.380
is we want to turn
this, which you

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.320
see in hospitals,
into this, where it's

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.190
a device, a host of
devices that can attach

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.740
to your tablet or your phone,
where all of your vital signs

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.550
will be available to
you, at your fingertips,

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.400
everywhere you go.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.250
Now, I'm not the only person,
and we are not the only team

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.630
around the world,
working on these devices.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:36.140
There's dozens, if not hundreds,
of teams, around other research

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.997
universities, trying
to do the same thing.

00:35:37.997 --> 00:35:38.580
And it's good.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.631
It actually creates a
market for this product.

00:35:40.631 --> 00:35:42.630
But there's one more thing
I want to talk about.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.550
And it's we're in partnership
with Professor Clifford.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.310
It's the Buy-one,
Give-one program.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.760
So, starting today,
until the end

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.000
of October, every
single iOximeter that we

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.870
sell on our official website,
for every single one,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.680
we are going to give
one to a charity

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.890
organization in the third
world, or you can also

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.740
select a charity in
the US that would

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.380
like to use one
of these devices.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.590
So everyone would
be able to benefit.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.010
So that's why I
want to leave you

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:16.600
with these final thoughts,
the four tenets of Safe Heart,

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.380
and also, our partnership
with Oxford Center

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.840
for Affordable Health Care.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.260
It's to reduce costs so that
everyone can have access

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.770
to the latest technology
without having to pay hundreds

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.920
of dollars for them-- to
open the access of the data

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.750
so that everyone
can make informed

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.130
decisions about their
own health care--

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.332
to increase accuracy and
validity through new analytics

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:43.790
that we're developing, based
off of the data set that we're

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.260
going to gather from these
devices and from these apps--

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.440
and finally, to create
an ecosystem of new apps.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.960
So I'm sure some of you here
are interested in trying

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.000
this device out and seeing if
you want to remix it and make

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.050
something cool and new for it.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.530
Talk to me after the talk.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.850
OK.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.100
So now I just want to give a
thanks to our team-- Simon, who

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.070
I talked about earlier, who did
the exterior design-- Alvin,

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:14.360
who did the PCB-- Herbert, who
was instrumental in creating

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.680
our apps so, unlike some
companies who came out

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.780
with their device for the iPhone
first, we were able to come out

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.950
with the app for both iPhone
and Android, simultaneously--

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:31.240
and then, finally, Gera, who's
responsible for developing

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.775
our user interface, a website,
and also, our packaging.

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:35.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.260
YALE ZHANG: And then,
also, I just wanted

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:43.190
to thank Maggie and Dave for
letting me use their story.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.410
It was just something that
really resonated with myself

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:54.139
because to see someone who can
benefit from something that you

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:55.930
created, something that
changed their lives

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.960
and improved it for
the better, that's

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.382
the most rewarding
part about what I do.

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:09.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.790
MALE SPEAKER: So, but you did
forget to mention your target

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.450
market-- the adventurous
couples-- right?

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:15.500
You didn't mention those.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.319
So--

00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:19.110
YALE ZHANG: I think
people already got that

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.420
from looking at the viral graph.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:20.856
So I think--

00:38:20.856 --> 00:38:21.292
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:38:21.292 --> 00:38:23.890
So the first question I had
for you, when I met you,

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.420
was, this is basically
a pulse oximeter, right?

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.766
And it almost seems too obvious
to connect to the phone.

00:38:31.766 --> 00:38:33.640
And I think you had a
pretty good explanation

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.660
or pretty good argument of why
that wasn't necessarily so.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:42.354
YALE ZHANG: Well, actually, if
you think about it this way,

00:38:42.354 --> 00:38:44.770
you would think that having a
pulse oximeter on your phone

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.450
is a pretty obvious
idea, and it is.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.320
It is.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.660
But let me tell you a story
about another really obvious

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.380
idea.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:51.880
OK.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.770
So in 1980, Proctor and
Gamble had a huge problem.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.240
They needed to create
a new cleaning device.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.020
They wanted new
cleaning technology

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.380
that would save people time.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.344
So their internal team
developed a more absorbent mop.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.010
When they put it out
in the test market,

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.176
the problem was they found
that people were spending

00:39:10.176 --> 00:39:11.710
80% of their time
cleaning the mop,

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.530
rather than cleaning the floor.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.250
So they hired an outside company
called Continuum Research.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.390
Continuum Research spent
another three or four years,

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.919
hundreds of hours
videotaping people

00:39:22.919 --> 00:39:23.960
while they were cleaning.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.350
They were doing studies.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.910
They were taking pictures.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.970
And they still couldn't
come up with a new idea,

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.320
until the leader of
the team, Howard,

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.530
in a frustrated,
exasperated sigh,

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.010
he said, why don't we just
track dirt into people's homes

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.870
and see what they did?

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.010
So it was during
one of these visits

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:47.260
that an elderly lady, just
like the elderly lady that

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.880
called in one day and gave me
the idea for the iOximeter,

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.680
an elderly lady saw
that they had tracked

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.200
coffee grounds onto her floor.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.170
So she went to her kitchen,
took a paper towel,

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:02.050
dabbed it with some water,
bent down, and wiped the floor.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.980
And when Howard
saw the video, he

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.970
said, well, I must have
done that hundreds of times.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.370
I must have done it
hundreds of times.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.830
What if I created a
paper towel that I

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.292
could put at the end
of a stick and then I

00:40:16.292 --> 00:40:18.750
can use it to clean my floor,
and then, at the end of that,

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.458
I could just throw
that paper towel away?

00:40:20.458 --> 00:40:22.490
Well, that became the Swiffer.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.224
So nowadays, it's a $500
million a year product for P&amp;G.

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:27.890
And if you think about
it, a paper towel

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.240
at the end of a stick,
that's a pretty obvious idea.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.040
But until someone comes up
with that, though, you know,

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.380
it's not been invented.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.610
MALE SPEAKER: I like it.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:41.096
So tell me about-- you said
you are sharing data, right,

00:40:41.096 --> 00:40:41.970
for making it public?

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.590
So I know there are lots
of rules and regulations

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.859
about how you can access
and share this data.

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:48.400
So why don't you
tell us a little bit

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.175
about how you're going
around those rules?

00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:50.800
YALE ZHANG: OK.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.174
Well, the important
thing is that

00:40:52.174 --> 00:40:54.740
when you're talking
about information,

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.747
about health and vital
signs, such as HIPAA--

00:40:56.747 --> 00:40:57.830
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.490
YALE ZHANG: OK.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.160
When you're talking about
guidelines such as HIPAA,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.170
one of the requirements
is that the information

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.230
has to be private.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.100
Well, if you are using this
device on a opt-in basis,

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.219
and you are selecting to
share this data with whoever,

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:15.260
then you are actually in
compliance with the law.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.676
But more importantly, when the
data's stored on the phone,

00:41:17.676 --> 00:41:20.364
it's stored on an
encrypted database

00:41:20.364 --> 00:41:22.030
so that their partners
can't have access

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.400
to it, unless they
are given permission.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.290
MALE SPEAKER: And what
are some of the uses

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.482
that you can see for
making this data public?

00:41:29.482 --> 00:41:30.940
YALE ZHANG: Well,
one of the things

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.590
I mentioned earlier was that
we can make educated guesses

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.110
and, actually, studies
about conditions

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.130
that people live in, and
also, have gathered more data

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:41.630
about that.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.150
So, for example, let's
say I live downstream

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.280
from a coal-fired power plant.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.430
Is my breathing
affected by that?

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.440
Well, if there's a
significant population

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.950
base who is using
this device or we

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.970
deploy this iOximeter
in a population,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.590
then we can actually measure
their performance, over time,

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.380
to see if that's effected.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.410
So that, and also, for example,
with the fetal Dopplers,

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.930
there would be ultrasound
Dopplers that we're developing.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:14.120
We're going to be able to
say, does the sleeping pattern

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.510
of the mother, or
their stress levels,

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.470
impact the health of the baby?

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.100
Now we're going to be
able to gather information

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.845
on a much more larger scale.

00:42:22.845 --> 00:42:24.000
MALE SPEAKER: Gotcha.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.199
So what are some of the other--
you showed us a few products,

00:42:27.199 --> 00:42:29.490
but are there any other
products which you're currently

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.145
working on?

00:42:30.145 --> 00:42:30.420
Can you tell us about those?

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:30.660
YALE ZHANG: Yes.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.810
Well, you've seen all
of the other products

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.074
that we've come up with.

00:42:34.074 --> 00:42:35.740
But one of the things
that we want to do

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.000
is create an information hub
where all of these devices

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.880
can be plugged into so
that they can measure

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.100
all the vital signs,
simultaneously.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.860
And then it'll be syncing to
your tablet PC wirelessly.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.315
So that would be
the ultimate goal,

00:42:50.315 --> 00:42:56.450
a patient monitor that you can
use at home on your bed stand.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.450
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.700
So I think you've
shared your prices,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.920
and you've shared basically
everything you are doing.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.130
Are you not afraid that other
people now have, basically,

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.200
a benchmark that
they need to beat

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.310
before releasing their product?

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.270
YALE ZHANG: Well, I mean, this
talk is going to be on YouTube.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.300
So the ideas that
I talk about today

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.520
are going to be out there.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.940
But the way I feel
about it is that we

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.000
don't have to be the ones
that make all of the money.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.880
If someone comes out with
something like ours that's

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.500
just as easy to use and is less
expensive, they should do that.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.380
They should take these ideas
and make it so that, in the end,

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.940
it benefits the great public,
where everyone can have access

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.440
to it.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.840
So one of the
inspirations for me

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.290
was actually Elon
Musk, who recently

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:48.410
talked about releasing his
patents to the Tesla motor car

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.230
to other automotive
competitors so

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.740
that the proliferation of
electrical car technology

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.810
is going to increase.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.490
And speaking of Tesla, one
of my greatest inspirations,

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.635
and somebody from your country--

00:44:01.635 --> 00:44:02.760
MALE SPEAKER: Right. right.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.201
YALE ZHANG: Nikola Tesla--
he gave all of the patents

00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:06.700
away that he even
worked on, just so

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:12.370
that we would have things like
AC power and induction motors.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:13.917
So they can knock
off our products.

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.000
They can copy our designs.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.780
It doesn't matter, as long
as more people have access

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.340
to greater technologies, at an
inexpensive price, that they

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.280
can use to improve their
end results, overall.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.070
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.690
AUDIENCE: Isn't iPhone getting
rid of the headphone jack?

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.815
YALE ZHANG: You
know, I was thinking

00:44:31.815 --> 00:44:33.440
someone was going to
ask that question.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:33.940
Yeah.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.260
So there have been rumors.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:40.040
And I've seen that there had
been some intellectual property

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.640
filings stating that they're
going to be developing

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.990
a digital audio converter
that uses the Lighting jack.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.587
So with their recent
acquisitions of Beats by Dre,

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.170
then it's possible
that in the future,

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.870
they're going to get rid
of the headphone jack.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.000
So when that happens,
though, we already

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.770
have a Plan B, which
has always been

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.380
Plan B from the beginning,
which is bluetooth.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.840
I personally don't
like bluetooth

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.440
because that means you'd have to
bring another charger with you.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.520
And that's just
another thing that

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.770
have to carry around with you.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.150
But bluetooth is going to
be an alternative that we're

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.910
going to use if it comes
down to that, where we can

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.285
no longer use the
headphone jack.

00:45:19.285 --> 00:45:21.076
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier in the talk

00:45:21.076 --> 00:45:23.490
that your team had developed
some breakthrough technology

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:28.992
in your profession
[INAUDIBLE] about.

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:31.390
And what are your
general thoughts on that?

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:35.440
YALE ZHANG: Actually, we are
making that information public.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.050
It mainly has to do
with time division.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:42.600
So just think about how-- I
don't know how old everyone

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.605
is in this room,
but a long time ago,

00:45:44.605 --> 00:45:45.980
when you wanted
to go online, you

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.130
had to use what's known as
a modem, through your phone.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.900
And so we had what's
called Dial-up.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.230
And so we were
using time division,

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.090
which is similar to what modems
used, to compress the data

00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.340
and send it back to the phone.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.923
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that you've

00:46:00.923 --> 00:46:03.610
used the [INAUDIBLE] something
by 90-something percent, right?

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:04.000
YALE ZHANG: That's right.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.710
That's right.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.010
AUDIENCE: So tell us a
little bit about that.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:11.346
Like, what did you do to
reduce the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:11.346 --> 00:46:11.970
YALE ZHANG: OK.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:12.928
That's a good question.

00:46:14.799 --> 00:46:17.090
I'm going to give away a
little bit of our secret sauce

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.577
right here because we
didn't even file it.

00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:21.160
We didn't even file
a patent for that.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.030
But what we've done is we
took the circuit board,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.270
we identified which components
absolutely needed power

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.570
and which ones did not.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.970
And so, as you're
using the iOximeter,

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.190
even though the light
is on all the time,

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:38.890
the rest of the circuit board
is actually turning on and off

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:39.860
10 times per second.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.860
So we have a 10
Hertz on-off cycle,

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.680
where we actually use capacitors
to charge it up, and then

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.130
turn on the entire board, only
briefly, once every 10 times

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.630
per second.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.260
And then we'd turn
it off again so

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.170
that you can set the
power, as opposed

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.520
to going full
power all the time.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.020
OK.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:04.130
Well, once again, I just want
to tell everyone my name's Yale,

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.740
and that's me in the corner.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.490
This is Alvin.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.330
Lauren was the one who helped
just demo the app for everyone.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.560
Maggie and Dave--
it was their story,

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.220
in the beginning, that
really impacted me.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.200
And also, if you use the
coupon code "Google,"

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.140
you can get 20% off when
you buy an iOximeter.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:28.780
And like I said, it's
fortunate that I'm here

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.360
to give a talk today, but
there are many other companies

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.410
that are making devices
similar to ours.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:38.700
So prepare to see a lot more
vital signs-based monitoring

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.420
devices showing up in the
marketplace, in the future.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.870
YALE ZHANG: Thank you.
