00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] What we have
here are a few data analysis

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.210
questions in a biology context

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.000
from the New York Regents Exam,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.020
but these are useful example problems

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.150
if you're studying high
school biology in general

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.760
because they might show up in some type

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.270
of an exam that your teacher gives you

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.580
or you might see on a standardized test.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.370
A student proposes that,
if volunteers warm up

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.620
before squeezing a
clothespin for one minute,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.780
they will increase the number of times

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.570
that they can squeeze it within tiring.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.550
He states that this is
because their muscles will

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.980
be better prepared for the exercise.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.480
The data from an experiment are shown

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.660
in the data table below.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.360
Which trial from the chart
above provides the best data

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.820
to support his claim?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.510
Support your answer.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.690
So, pause this video and
see if you could answer it.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.750
So, let's just make sure we
understand what's going on here.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.700
So, there's two trials.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.920
This is the first trial,
trial one, right over here,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.920
and in trial one, you had
two groups of 10 students.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.560
One of them did warm up and
the other 10 did not warm up,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900
and then in trial two,
you had two more groups

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.170
and this time, they were groups of 25.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.990
Once again, 25 who did warm
up and 25 who didn't warm up.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.750
Now, in trial one, the
group that warmed up

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.360
actually had a lower
number of average squeezes,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.070
so this goes against the
hypothesis that the student had.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.690
The hypothesis the student has
is if they warm up beforehand

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.230
that you would actually be
able to do more squeezes,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.000
so trial one actually goes
against the student's claim.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.950
Trial two seems to slightly go in favor

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.400
of the student's claim.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.820
The group that warmed up was
able to eke out a few more.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.220
Now, we haven't done
the statistical analysis

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.770
to know how probable this is,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.320
if it was due purely to random chance,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.340
but just to answer that question,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.410
one, the data goes, trial
one goes a little bit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.870
against the student's claim.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.430
Trial two best supports this claim,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.980
although it doesn't do it so strongly.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.593
So, I would say trial two

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.410
and that is because the 25 that warmed,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.810
warmed up, that is group three,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.603
group three, were able,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.423
on average, on average,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.140
to squeeze more in a minute,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.230
to squeeze more

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.650
in the minute

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.040
than group four

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.980
that didn't warm up.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.783
Alright, let's do another question here.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580
So, here we're told, students
were asked to design a lab

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.420
that investigated the
relationship between exercise

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.650
and heart rate.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.650
Heart rate was determined by recording

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830
the pulse rate in beats per minute.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.970
The students hypothesized
that increased exercise

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.340
results in an increased heart rate.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.710
The class results for
the experiment are shown

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.340
in the graph below.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.660
And then they say, which
statement is best supported

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.730
by this graph?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.740
And we're given four choices.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.610
So, pause this video and see if you could

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.883
answer this on your own.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.490
Alright, now let's go through
statement by statement.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.560
Statement one, before exercising,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.520
the average pulse rate was 65.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.420
Four minutes after exercising,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.910
the average pulse rate was 65.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.743
So, let's see.

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:30.430
Before exercising, the
average pulse rate was 65.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.130
So, before exercising, this
is time period right over here

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.520
and it does look like over most

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.170
of that time period,
let me do this in red,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.210
it does look like that is reasonably,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.440
that is roughly true.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.310
It looks like the average
pulse rate was 65,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.970
but now let's read the
second part of the statement.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.940
Four minutes after exercising,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.800
the average pulse rate was 65 as well.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.470
Four minutes after exercising,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.130
what's the average pulse rate?

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.640
Well, it sure isn't 65, it looks closer

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.640
to being, maybe, 135, not 65,
so we could rule this one out.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.990
After four minutes of exercising,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.680
the average pulse rate was 120.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680
Let's see.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.240
So, this is when the exercise starts.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.800
After four minutes, the
average pulse rate was 120.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.300
No, it looks like it was like
135 or something like this,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.900
so this is already looking fishy.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.390
Two minutes after exercising,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.540
the average pulse rate was 120.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.390
So, two minutes after exercising,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.280
the average pulse rate actually
seems closer to about 90,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.950
so both of those look fishy,
I'll rule that one out.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.340
While exercising, the average,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
the highest average pulse rate was 150.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.020
Before exercising, the
average pulse rate was 65.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.660
So, let's see, while exercising,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.630
the highest average pulse
rate happens right over there

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.860
and that does indeed
look pretty close to 150,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.330
so this part's looking good.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.360
Before exercising, the
average pulse rate was 65.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.910
Yeah, we already talked about
this period right over here.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.820
So, this is looking good,
I'm liking this choice,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.450
but let's see choice four.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.550
Two minutes before exercising,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.480
the average pulse rate was 80.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.110
So, two minutes before exercising,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.450
this is when we start exercising

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.410
and each of these hash marks is a minute,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.360
so two minutes before, the
average pulse rate was not 80,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.363
so that's false.

00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:14.758
After two minutes of exercise,

00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:16.186
the average pulse rate was 140.

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:19.660
After two minutes, the average
pulse rate was also not 140,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.020
so both of those
statements are not correct.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.760
So, I like statement three,
that's the one that seems

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.743
to be backed up by the data here.
