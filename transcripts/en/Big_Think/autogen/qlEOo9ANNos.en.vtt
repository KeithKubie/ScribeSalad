00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.129
 
even you ask a wonderful question how

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
even you ask a wonderful question how
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.949
even you ask a wonderful question how
many galaxies are there and this is

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959
many galaxies are there and this is
 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.450
many galaxies are there and this is
something that we actually don't know

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
something that we actually don't know
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.950
something that we actually don't know
the answer to but I can tell you a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
the answer to but I can tell you a
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.590
the answer to but I can tell you a
wonderful story about what we do know so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
wonderful story about what we do know so
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.930
wonderful story about what we do know so
let me first talk about what a galaxy is

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940
let me first talk about what a galaxy is
 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.440
let me first talk about what a galaxy is
and a galaxy is a family of stars but it

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450
and a galaxy is a family of stars but it
 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.690
and a galaxy is a family of stars but it
usually in the hundreds of billions of

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700
usually in the hundreds of billions of
 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.730
usually in the hundreds of billions of
stars we live in a galaxy called the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
stars we live in a galaxy called the
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100
stars we live in a galaxy called the
Milky Way and there are about 500

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
Milky Way and there are about 500
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990
Milky Way and there are about 500
billion stars we think in the Milky Way

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
billion stars we think in the Milky Way
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.680
billion stars we think in the Milky Way
galaxy galaxies are absolutely huge the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
galaxy galaxies are absolutely huge the
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389
galaxy galaxies are absolutely huge the
Milky Way galaxy is about a hundred

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
Milky Way galaxy is about a hundred
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.360
Milky Way galaxy is about a hundred
thousand light years across and that's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
thousand light years across and that's
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130
thousand light years across and that's
not really a number I can get my mind

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
not really a number I can get my mind
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229
not really a number I can get my mind
around seeing as one light year is about

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
around seeing as one light year is about
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.380
around seeing as one light year is about
6 trillion miles so our single galaxy is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
6 trillion miles so our single galaxy is
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270
6 trillion miles so our single galaxy is
a hundred thousand times 6 trillion

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
a hundred thousand times 6 trillion
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.059
a hundred thousand times 6 trillion
miles across it's absolutely huge that

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069
miles across it's absolutely huge that
 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.790
miles across it's absolutely huge that
the best analogy I know is that if you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
the best analogy I know is that if you
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.139
the best analogy I know is that if you
think about the Sun the Sun is a giant

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
think about the Sun the Sun is a giant
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.629
think about the Sun the Sun is a giant
thing that the Sun is so big you could

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639
thing that the Sun is so big you could
 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:04.430
thing that the Sun is so big you could
fit a million earths inside it it's

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440
fit a million earths inside it it's
 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.190
fit a million earths inside it it's
really really big and if we made the Sun

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
really really big and if we made the Sun
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590
really really big and if we made the Sun
the size of the dot of an eye so so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
the size of the dot of an eye so so
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210
the size of the dot of an eye so so
pretend that the Sun is only the size of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
pretend that the Sun is only the size of

like you know take a regular page of a
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270
like you know take a regular page of a
book look at the dot of an eye the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
book look at the dot of an eye the

summer that big how big would our one

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
summer that big how big would our one
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370
summer that big how big would our one
Milky Way galaxy be it'd be about the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
Milky Way galaxy be it'd be about the
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070
Milky Way galaxy be it'd be about the
size of the earth so that's how big a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
size of the earth so that's how big a
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.830
size of the earth so that's how big a
single galaxy is if the Sun were the dot

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
single galaxy is if the Sun were the dot
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080
single galaxy is if the Sun were the dot
of an eye the Milky Way galaxy would be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
of an eye the Milky Way galaxy would be
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.080
of an eye the Milky Way galaxy would be
roughly the size of our planet now how

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
roughly the size of our planet now how
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.930
roughly the size of our planet now how
many galaxies do we know of and this is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940
many galaxies do we know of and this is
 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.550
many galaxies do we know of and this is
a wonderful result from the Hubble Space

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
a wonderful result from the Hubble Space
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.470
a wonderful result from the Hubble Space
Telescope the Hubble Space Telescope

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480
Telescope the Hubble Space Telescope
 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.240
Telescope the Hubble Space Telescope
decided to try to answer that question

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
decided to try to answer that question
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.150
decided to try to answer that question
and what it did is it looked at an area

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160
and what it did is it looked at an area
 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.610
and what it did is it looked at an area
of the sky that as far as we know was

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620
of the sky that as far as we know was
 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.590
of the sky that as far as we know was
blank it was just black we couldn't see

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
blank it was just black we couldn't see
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090
blank it was just black we couldn't see
many stars there we didn't see any

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
many stars there we didn't see any
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.250
many stars there we didn't see any
galaxies there and it decided to take a

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260
galaxies there and it decided to take a
 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.560
galaxies there and it decided to take a
very very deep distant look at the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
very very deep distant look at the
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780
very very deep distant look at the

Telescope and any camera works is it
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.040
Telescope and any camera works is it
works kind of like a light bucket you

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050
works kind of like a light bucket you
 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.600
works kind of like a light bucket you
can actually open up the eyes of the

can actually open up the eyes of the
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160
can actually open up the eyes of the
telescope and tell it to just keep

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
telescope and tell it to just keep
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.310
telescope and tell it to just keep
staring and the longer it stares the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
staring and the longer it stares the
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100

fainter and more distant objects you can
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690
fainter and more distant objects you can
see for those of you that like

enough telescope up in space and we were
 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.720
enough telescope up in space and we were
able to keep it staring at a tiny little

you do the statistics if you take that
 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.589
you do the statistics if you take that
little dot of the sky and by the way

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599
little dot of the sky and by the way

images in different regions of the sky
 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.259
images in different regions of the sky
and we get about the same count of

and we get about the same count of
 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.199
and we get about the same count of
galaxies anywhere we look if you do the

math tiny little dot all over the sky

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
math tiny little dot all over the sky
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.960
math tiny little dot all over the sky
five thousand galaxies in each dot there

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970
five thousand galaxies in each dot there
 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.869
five thousand galaxies in each dot there
are actually several trillion galaxies

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879
are actually several trillion galaxies
 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.729
are actually several trillion galaxies
that we can see with the hubble space

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739
that we can see with the hubble space
 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.979
that we can see with the hubble space
telescope if we had the time to observe

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989
telescope if we had the time to observe
 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.129
telescope if we had the time to observe
the entire sky so we know that there are

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139
the entire sky so we know that there are
 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.689
the entire sky so we know that there are
several trillion galaxies that the

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699
several trillion galaxies that the
 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.059
several trillion galaxies that the
hubble space telescope can see but is

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069
hubble space telescope can see but is
 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.409
hubble space telescope can see but is
that really the number is that how many

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419
that really the number is that how many
 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.080
that really the number is that how many
galaxies there really are the universe

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090
galaxies there really are the universe
 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.659
galaxies there really are the universe
we think is far larger than we're able

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669
we think is far larger than we're able
 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.500
we think is far larger than we're able
to see right now

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510
to see right now
 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.020
to see right now
so we're actually building telescopes

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030
so we're actually building telescopes
 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.819
so we're actually building telescopes
that are so powerful the James Webb

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829
that are so powerful the James Webb
 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.439
that are so powerful the James Webb
Space Telescope we hope will launch in

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449
Space Telescope we hope will launch in
 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.569
Space Telescope we hope will launch in
the year 2020 and that will be so

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579
the year 2020 and that will be so
 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.430
the year 2020 and that will be so
powerful it will be able to see every

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440
powerful it will be able to see every
 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.509
powerful it will be able to see every
single galaxy

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519
single galaxy
 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.129
single galaxy
all the way back to the beginning of

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139
all the way back to the beginning of
 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.890
all the way back to the beginning of
time so it will be able to see so far

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900
time so it will be able to see so far
 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.289
time so it will be able to see so far
away that the light has taken thirteen

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299
away that the light has taken thirteen
 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.960
away that the light has taken thirteen
billion years to get to us and we should

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970
billion years to get to us and we should
 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.520
billion years to get to us and we should
be able to see at any part of the sky

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530
be able to see at any part of the sky
 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.430
be able to see at any part of the sky
every galaxy that's ever formed in the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440
every galaxy that's ever formed in the
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.860
every galaxy that's ever formed in the
history of the universe is that the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
history of the universe is that the
 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.719
history of the universe is that the
answer is that how many galaxies there

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729
answer is that how many galaxies there
 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.290
answer is that how many galaxies there
are well I ask you to consider there's

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300
are well I ask you to consider there's
 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.180
are well I ask you to consider there's
something that astronomers call the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190
something that astronomers call the
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.709
something that astronomers call the
observable universe

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:32.719
observable universe
 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.320
observable universe
and that is that if we take a telescope

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
and that is that if we take a telescope
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.389
and that is that if we take a telescope
and we look in every direction around us

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:37.399
and we look in every direction around us
 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.939
and we look in every direction around us
there is in fact a limit to how far we

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949
there is in fact a limit to how far we
 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.159
there is in fact a limit to how far we
can see and that's because the universe

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169
can see and that's because the universe
 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.529
can see and that's because the universe
is not infinitely old we think the

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539
is not infinitely old we think the
 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.799
is not infinitely old we think the
universe began about 13.8 billion years

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:47.809
universe began about 13.8 billion years
 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.829
universe began about 13.8 billion years
ago with the Big Bang so we can only see

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:50.839
ago with the Big Bang so we can only see
 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.889
ago with the Big Bang so we can only see
as far out as there's been time for

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:53.899
as far out as there's been time for
 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:57.100
as far out as there's been time for
light to get to us so we see in every

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110
light to get to us so we see in every
 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.409
light to get to us so we see in every
direction on the sky out to a distance

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419
direction on the sky out to a distance
 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.199
direction on the sky out to a distance
where we're looking back say about 13

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:02.209
where we're looking back say about 13
 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.419
where we're looking back say about 13
billion years and that's wonderful but

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:04.429
billion years and that's wonderful but
 

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.709
billion years and that's wonderful but
does that mean that's how big the

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719
does that mean that's how big the
 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.009
does that mean that's how big the
universe is no the universe must be much

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:09.019
universe is no the universe must be much
 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:11.169
universe is no the universe must be much
larger than that it's just that there

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:11.179
larger than that it's just that there
 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:13.600
larger than that it's just that there
hasn't been time for light to get to us

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610
hasn't been time for light to get to us
 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.299
hasn't been time for light to get to us
from the rest of the universe if the

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:16.309
from the rest of the universe if the
 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:18.429
from the rest of the universe if the
universe is around for another 20

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439
universe is around for another 20
 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.129
universe is around for another 20
billion years we will see farther and

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139
billion years we will see farther and
 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.459
billion years we will see farther and
farther and farther out into the true

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469
farther and farther out into the true
 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.579
farther and farther out into the true
universe we have no idea how big the

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:27.589
universe we have no idea how big the
 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.279
universe we have no idea how big the
universe really is we can only see the

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289
universe really is we can only see the
 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.989
universe really is we can only see the
part of it where there's been time for

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:31.999
part of it where there's been time for
 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.929
part of it where there's been time for
light to travel to us the universe is

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:34.939
light to travel to us the universe is
 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.899
light to travel to us the universe is
not a sphere centered on us that would

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909
not a sphere centered on us that would
 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.309
not a sphere centered on us that would
be very very strange

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319
be very very strange
 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.799
be very very strange
that's just how far we can see in every

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:41.809
that's just how far we can see in every
 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.169
that's just how far we can see in every
direction since the beginning of time so

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.179
direction since the beginning of time so
 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:45.939
direction since the beginning of time so
what's the real answer how many galaxies

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949
what's the real answer how many galaxies
 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.889
what's the real answer how many galaxies
are there and this gets to one of the

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899
are there and this gets to one of the
 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.600
are there and this gets to one of the
most amazing things that we don't know

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610
most amazing things that we don't know
 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.850
most amazing things that we don't know
and that is what is the size of the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
and that is what is the size of the
 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.919
and that is what is the size of the
universe for all we know the universe

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:53.929
universe for all we know the universe
 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:55.689
universe for all we know the universe
could be infinite it may be that the

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699
could be infinite it may be that the
 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.040
could be infinite it may be that the
real answer is if there an infinite

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050
real answer is if there an infinite
 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.739
real answer is if there an infinite
number of galaxies space never ends and

00:05:59.739 --> 00:05:59.749
number of galaxies space never ends and
 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:01.389
number of galaxies space never ends and
there are galaxies throughout an

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:01.399
there are galaxies throughout an
 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.639
there are galaxies throughout an
infinite universe or maybe the universe

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:03.649
infinite universe or maybe the universe
 

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:05.979
infinite universe or maybe the universe
isn't infinite maybe there really is

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:05.989
isn't infinite maybe there really is
 

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:08.469
isn't infinite maybe there really is
some vast shape to it that we're not

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479
some vast shape to it that we're not
 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.749
some vast shape to it that we're not
aware of yet just like how we're

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759
aware of yet just like how we're
 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.549
aware of yet just like how we're
standing on a spherical earth right now

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559
standing on a spherical earth right now
 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.199
standing on a spherical earth right now
but it seems flat to us because we can

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:14.209
but it seems flat to us because we can
 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:15.699
but it seems flat to us because we can
only actually walk around a little part

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:15.709
only actually walk around a little part
 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.589
only actually walk around a little part
of it at once it could be that the

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599
of it at once it could be that the
 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.929
of it at once it could be that the
universe has a larger shape and maybe it

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:19.939
universe has a larger shape and maybe it
 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.819
universe has a larger shape and maybe it
even has boundaries maybe there really

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:21.829
even has boundaries maybe there really
 

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.799
even has boundaries maybe there really
isn't answer to how big the universe is

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:23.809
isn't answer to how big the universe is
 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.869
isn't answer to how big the universe is
in the time the universe has existed

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879
in the time the universe has existed
 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:27.729
in the time the universe has existed
there hasn't been time for light to

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:27.739
there hasn't been time for light to
 

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:29.529
there hasn't been time for light to
travel to us from the farthest reaches

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539
travel to us from the farthest reaches
 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.350
travel to us from the farthest reaches
of the universe so right now we honestly

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360
of the universe so right now we honestly
 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.150
of the universe so right now we honestly
have no idea how many galaxies there are

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160
have no idea how many galaxies there are
 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.410
have no idea how many galaxies there are
