00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.610
 Good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.870
We apologize for the late start.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.090
The regents had a
wonderful opportunity

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.810
to have breakfast with a
select number of the faculty

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.360
at the University this morning.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.780
And their passion for
students, for where

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.870
we're going based on
this strategic plan

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.400
was very evident to us.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.850
I think there's a certain
excitement among all of us

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.270
at this turning point
for our great university.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.910
So we're going to
focus the entire day

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.130
on the operational
and financial review

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.095
for the University of Arizona.

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:40.380
The board's scheduled to
meet until 1:00 PM today.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.260
Afterwards, the U of A will host
a strategic reception planning

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.940
reception in Old Main.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.360
With that, I'm going to turn
it over to President Robbins.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.110
Good morning, sir.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.960
 Good morning.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.390
Thank you, Chairman.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.100
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.710
I have been apologizing
for the cold weather.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.050
But all of a sudden, they
got this room warm enough.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.670
So I'm liking that.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.080
It'll be good.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.000
So, I'm here representing
literally thousands of people.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.150
And in four hours,
we're going to try

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.670
to relay to you as regents
and to the greater world what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.020
we've been working on
for the last year--

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.310
literally thousands of
people, tens of thousands

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.520
of hours that we've worked.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.470
As everybody knows by now,
there are 168 hours in a week.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.300
So use them wisely.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.440
So how this is going to go is
that there are five pillars

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.290
to the strategic plan.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.240
We'll cover pillars one and two.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.710
We're getting a little start.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.510
But it was well
worth it as we had

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.420
a great breakfast with
the faculty members

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.030
and the regents
conversing and exchanging.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.350
Ideas but we'll try to stay
on track and be done by 11:00

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.410
and give you a 30
minute break and then

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.500
come back and finish off
pillars three, four, and five

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.050
and some closing comments.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.170
So, I'm starting out
today to say this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430
that we are standing on
the shoulders of giants.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.990
And President Schaefer
and President Likins

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.940
particular in this picture have
been tremendously helpful to me

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.830
and have given
graciously of their time.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.110
I meet with them frequently.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.840
If you ever go to
the football games

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.820
and go to the
presidential suite,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.770
you see they sit side by side.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.950
And what you don't see is--
because most of the coaches

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.210
have headsets on--

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.030
they've got these
little microphones.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
And they're actually calling
plays from the press box

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.700
up there down to the coaches.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.200
And I saw president Likins here.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.336
Is President Schaefer here?

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:45.210
All right, President
Likins, please stand up.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.050
We meet every month.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.680
And the beauty for
me is that he just

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.810
gives it to me like he sees it.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.190
He's like an umpire, he
calls it as he sees it.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160
And he's been tremendous help.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.750
We have very scheduled meetings.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.640
President Schaefer
just comes to see me

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.590
when he thinks he needs
to tell me something.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.940
And I am incredibly
appreciative to both of them.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.350
And then of course, I had the
incredible, great fortune first

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.800
of all, to have this job.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.540
So thanks to the regents
for selecting me.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.540
And I remind the faculty that
all the time-- or they remind

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.840
me, they didn't choose me.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.590
But you did.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.020
So thank you.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.480
And President Koffler, I
had almost a year with him.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.150
And we had the same doctor.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.490
So we would sit and
talk about our ailments

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.450
in the waiting room.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.330
And his caregiver it
would remind me, at 95,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.790
he was still doing pilates.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.680
And I've yet to find
the gym yet here.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.270
So he was the only alum
ever to hold this office.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.380
And we'll be honoring and
celebrating his life on Monday.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.260
So if you can come to
the memorial service,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.590
that would be great.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.290
And this plan, this
is not my plan.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.270
So I feel somewhat inadequate
here delivering the message

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.430
on behalf of literally
thousands of people.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.230
But this plan could
not have been executed

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.410
and get to this day without the
tremendous leadership of Lisa

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.530
Ordonez and Elliott Cheu.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.260
So in the first
couple of months,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.450
I kind of walked to campus
and listened very carefully.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.850
And I wouldn't say that
two stars are born.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.980
They were already stars.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.580
That's why I selected them.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.980
But I will say that
after this process,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.220
even though they've
gotten beaten up--

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.040
and I mean beaten
up, because this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.130
has been a very healthy but
very involved discussion.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.700
And they've been challenged
over and over and over.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.410
And they kept their
eye on the ball.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.800
And so not two new
stars are born,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.520
but their stars are
shining more brightly today

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.734
because of this plan so
could you two stand up.

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:07.900
And let's give you applause.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.922
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.220
And this just shows
you we couldn't

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.470
get a picture of everybody.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.740
Although, now that I'm thinking
about it, all the things I wish

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.770
I had done it was to get
everybody in the mall

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.560
and take one of those
pictures from a drone

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.780
from above so that you could
see how many people were

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.520
really involved.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.710
This is just a collage that
represents the initiative

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.320
leaders, the pillar
leads, the deans.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.710
The deans are very,
very important,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.420
because they lead our colleges.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.160
And as I've always said, the
most fundamental academic unit

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.290
of any university
is the department.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.210
And the deans look over
departments and lead.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.170
And this just shows a
picture of all the people

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.740
who've really put their heart
and soul into this plan.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.130
And I just wanted to thank them.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.480
I wanted to thank others
that are in the room.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.830
But importantly, I want to thank
Brew McKenna who actually took

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.400
the bait and has been commuting
back and forth from Houston

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.500
to get the band
back together again.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.160
Brew, I hope we don't have to
do this again anytime soon.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.540
But thank you for your help.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:38.730
And Christine, Katherine,
[? Oneley, ?] Andre, Clare, all

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.090
of the people who've been
here every week helping

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.809
us to get this plan
together, we couldn't

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:44.850
have done it without you.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.140
And I look forward to the
celebration after this.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.960
I was tempted to
open the presentation

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.200
with a little known
one hit wonder band,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.720
the New Radicals, "You
Only Get What You Get."

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.360
And it starts out by
saying "wake up, kids,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.860
we've got the
dreamer's disease."

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.800
So all these people have
the dreamer's disease.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.420
And we're going to share
with you what our dream is

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.860
to try to make the world a
better place through changing

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.530
the University of
Arizona and giving us

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.710
a roadmap for the next
five 10, 15 years.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.370
So this is actually a picture.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.100
I thought it was a
photo-shopped thing.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.770
But this is actually
a peek at Mt.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.860
Lemon.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.470
And you can see that
wind was blowing

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.540
kind of like it was on Monday.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.100
And I think this is symbolic.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.650
And it represents
the mountain that we

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.590
have to climb here at
the University of Arizona

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.520
for this plan.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.240
And the most difficult
part of this I

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.640
kept saying we've got this giant
novel, this classic novel we've

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.240
produced.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.310
Here it is right here.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.880
And you all got you know
200 pages worth of our plan.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.480
And the most difficult
part was editing down

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.770
for this presentation,
converting a great novel

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.794
into a hour and a half
feature motion picture.

00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:12.210
So there are a lot of things
that aren't included in here.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.130
It doesn't mean that
they're not important,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.070
but we only have limited time.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.570
And the more I
talk, the less time

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.220
we have for you
to ask questions,

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.860
which is the most important
part of this presentation.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.700
I'll also say that the
words that we produced here,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.520
the data the thoughts,
that we've collected

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.030
are really important.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.840
But what has been
almost as important

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.669
has been the journey
that all of us

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.690
have been on to reexamine what
is the University of Arizona.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.790
What are our values?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.720
Where are we going?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.760
What's our true north star?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.540
And I think you'll find that
there are some areas where

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.430
we're really great.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.310
But there are also
incredible opportunities

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.140
as we move forward
to be even better.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.100
So I just want to use
the next couple of slides

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.240
to review what I started with
last year in this room at that

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.680
my first presentation
at an [? OFR. ?]

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.370
And that was to
focus in on rankings.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.580
And I've, as recently as
a couple of weeks ago,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.730
been challenged very viscerally
and very defiantly about

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.504
why I talk about rankings.

00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:26.670
And we can have that debate.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.230
We're not going to
have it here today

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.960
unless you want to get into
it in the question and answer

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.770
session.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.180
But I think rankings
really are important.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.510
And I started out last year
by saying we've been flat

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.460
over the last few years.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.990
Fortuitously, our
rankings improved.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.990
Just the idea that we're
going to do a plan,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.560
it's like preseason
polls in football.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.100
Just the idea we're going to
have all these star players

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.190
shot us up in the poll.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.410
But in all candor, the
methodology for US News &amp; World

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.760
Report changed.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.080
And I think it broke to our
advantage, because instead

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.220
of giving credit to the
elite for acceptance rate,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.500
that metric was tossed out.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:19.390
And now universities are getting
credit for graduating Pell

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.350
recipients.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:25.990
And that's right in our sweet
spot, since 35% of our students

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.850
are first generation.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.240
We have the largest number of
Pell students that of any AAU.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.450
And we should not
only be proud of that,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.880
but it now plays
to our advantage.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.820
And we only get credit
if they graduate.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.260
So we've got to do a better
job of retaining and graduating

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.510
all of our students.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.860
Coincidentally, also
in the rankings,

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.760
we made it into the top 50
public universities, which was

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.350
sort of a goal that I had set.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.060
I thought both ASU and
the University of Arizona

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.820
are such great institutions.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.360
It's just it's a shame,
it's a wasted opportunity

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.610
if we're not both ranked in the
top 100 and the top 50 publics.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.190
Now I have to have
to re-gauge that.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.210
I think we need to be top
75 in a top 30 public.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.580
But we'll get to that later.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.100
They'll be the next
strategic plan,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.240
or we'll outperform this one.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.880
And the next couple
of slides are

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.480
metrics around retention
graduation rates and research

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.470
activity.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.350
Now, for all of you who
really pay attention--

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.330
and the regents really
have meticulous attention

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.260
to detail--

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.690
these slides are off.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.520
The numbers you see on the
right are 15 peer institutions

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.780
that we're compared to.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.760
And if you'll
notice that the top,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.740
it's 2017 the data
in the bar graphs.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.110
We have this year's data
compared to last year's data,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.230
the red box is last year's data.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.760
But you know the story.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.810
We're not retaining our
students anywhere close

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.520
to where we should be.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.970
As one of the top global
universities based

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.390
on our research
productivity and reputation,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.940
our student performance--
as I said last year

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.910
and I'll maintain
again this year--

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.820
we're just not
where we want to be.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.100
And I think you're going to find
that this is going to be a very

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.720
student-centric strategic plan.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.200
We're going to focus on
what our students need,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.000
because we want each and
every one of our students,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.590
no matter where they come from,
what their backgrounds are,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.970
to be successful.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.800
We're here to help our students
realize their hopes and dreams.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.060
And we can't do that if we
can't retain them in school.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.910
Additionally, these
data are two years off.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.460
If you'll see the
bar graph data,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.860
we were at 60% graduation rate.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.040
We've improved over the
last two years, now to 65%.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.370
But in the case of
retention, you'll

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.500
see this plan calls for a
91% retention rate and a 75%

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.390
graduation rate by 2025.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.860
And it just shows you where
we line up with our peers.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.470
Now, many of you said,
we are very concerned.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.530
We don't think you
can hit these goals.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.720
And I think it will
be a lot of hard work.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.460
We'll have to come
together and work together.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.020
But at the same
time, I would say

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.890
they are conservative
goals, because if you

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.900
notice the number,
everybody else is

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.670
going to be trying to improve.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.620
And even if we hit
our target goals,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.420
we're still going
to be in the lowest

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.990
quartile for student success.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.530
But you've got to
start somewhere.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:59.050
And then on research
activity, this is a graph--

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.370
and it's hard to read.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.132
So even with your
pages there, you better

00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:04.840
put your reading
glasses on, because it's

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.756
a little hard to read.

00:14:05.756 --> 00:14:07.790
And I know everyone
in the back can't.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.710
But this is the top 38 research
universities in the country.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.700
And we rank 38th.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.130
Again, the data
lags a little bit.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.780
Our research activity has gone
up over the last couple years

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.860
by about $20 million a year.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.460
So I think we're on
a good trajectory.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.720
It clearly is one of the
assets and great things

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.900
about the University of Arizona,
it's our research mission.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.950
So it's about both.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.840
It's about student success,
and it's about research.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.090
We're in the knowledge
generation and knowledge

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.140
transfer business.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.210
We discover new
knowledge, and we

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.160
try to translate
that new knowledge

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.100
into commercializible
things that can simply

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.910
make the world a better place.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.100
But we also need to educate
the next generation of leaders.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.680
No matter what level
they go into society,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.550
they need the skills
and the education

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.500
to be productive members of
their communities and society

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.650
writ large.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.200
So we've got both
of these missions.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.110
So over the source of
the many town halls

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.830
and the multiple college
departmental meetings

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.880
and engaging with the
stakeholders from around

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.730
the state and really
our alumni base, which

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.510
is around the world,
we also recently did

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:39.000
a survey that was for the campus
community, 15,000 people, which

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.360
we got about 4,700
responders too.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.310
But it's very clear.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.850
And it confirms
empirically what you all

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.690
told me before I agreed
to come and take this job

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.080
and what I've observed
over the last 15 months.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.470
We've got incredibly
strong, talented people

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.500
who are highly motivated,
who love this place

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.420
and want to come to work
every day and do great things.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.320
Where we have
opportunities is around

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.550
holding everyone accountable
for what their job is clearly,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.160
defining which
lane they swim in,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.660
but also managing
them and helping

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.240
them succeed in their job.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.880
We also need alignment
around our values.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.820
And I'll talk about
values and pillar five.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.210
But there was clear from the
respondents in the survey

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.680
and from the
workshops that we've

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:41.280
done that people are desperate
for a strategic clarity.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.690
What's our true north star?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.890
Where are we going?

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:49.200
And I'm hoping that this
plan begins to address that.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:56.670
Today is really is the end of
the beginning as we go forward.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.150
The implementation phase that
I'll talk about at the end

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.730
is where the real work
is going to happen.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.010
I've said this often.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.359
I stole this from one of
my friends in Australia.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.849
Andrew Forest, "Twiggy,"
I'm giving you credit right

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.020
now for this, because
I stole it from you.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.329
But we are a team of champions.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.050
We have incredibly
talented individuals.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.250
What we're seeking to do is
build a championship team.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.770
And that requires
us to work together

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.690
to be clearly aligned around
a set of strategic objectives

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.160
and then execute on them.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.570
So this is what we're all about.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.410
This is our manifesto,
Regent Myers.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.240
I wasn't allowed to put
manifesto on the slide.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.070
This is our commitment.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.890
This is our contract.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.610
This is our promise to our
students, to our faculty

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.390
to all of our stakeholders.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.670
Just parenthetically,
the Checklist Manifesto

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.820
developed for aviation and for
medicine, particularly heart

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:05.080
surgery, has saved thousands
and thousands of lives.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.860
So when you said manifesto,
it resonated with me.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.230
But that didn't make
it into the slide deck.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.870
But I want to give you
credit for encouraging

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.760
me to call it our manifesto.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.830
This is our public declaration
for where we're going

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.800
to go with this university.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.260
And I'll read this
to you, because I

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.210
think these are powerful words.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.870
We're going to develop
innovative, adaptive learners

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.420
who will go out into the
world to be disruptive

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.960
problem solvers who are prepared
to lead meaningful lives

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.750
and improve society in this
Fourth Industrial Revolution

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.460
economy, improves society,
simply make the world

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.140
a better place.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.620
In the second mission
that I talked about around

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.110
we're in the knowledge
generation business,

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.940
we're going to invest
in the discovery

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.250
research and creative
endeavors that

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.620
are going to seek to go
out and solve the world's

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.370
grand challenges.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.560
And finally, we'll leverage
Arizona's unique assets.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.510
And we are different.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.331
I always used to go around
and look at operating rooms.

00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:08.580
And they would say, yeah,
if you've seen one operating

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.121
room, you've seen
one operating room,

00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:11.740
because they're all different.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.860
They're still operating
rooms, and universities

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.000
are universities.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.460
But they all have a
distinctive set of assets.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.390
And I would say the University
of Arizona has a soul.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.180
And that soul is
being reawakened

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.960
to focus on we're
in a changing world.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.980
And where we're going will
be captured in this plan,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.910
not totally, but in large part.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.900
And we're going to
use our advantage

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.890
of being a diverse population of
people from all over the world.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.060
And we'll use that to leverage
our strengths to integrate

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.060
and collaborate with
our partners locally

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.490
and around the globe--

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.850
the across the street and
around the world approach.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.560
And I think is as the
land grant university

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.620
for the Fourth
Industrial Revolution,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.290
this is our manifesto.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.050
So I've talked about the
Fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.180
And I remember when
I first arrived--

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.000
even before I took the job--

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.550
Jeff Goldberg-- Jeff,
thank you for everything

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.010
you've done to be a
part of this and to be

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.010
a great leader at this
university for over three

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.810
decades now and for stepping
in to do the most difficult job

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.510
at this university,
which is be the provost.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:39.220
But I remember you and others
have a book club every month.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.190
And you chose the book, "The
Fourth Industrial Revolution"

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.560
in preparation for
me arriving here,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.180
because I'd been
talking about it.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.710
And we had a lively discussion
that day around Halloween

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.480
of the world could
you be thinking

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.990
of a university in terms of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.460
in some small book
that was very dense.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.320
And I remember the
critique of that book

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.780
being somewhat brutal.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.060
But anyway, I just wanted to
review the Fourth Industrial

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.350
Revolution.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.200
It started with the first
Industrial Revolution

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.360
with mechanization,
steam engines,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.710
and automated or mechanized
weaving machines.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.970
And it resulted in the
Luddites who thought,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.960
this is going to be
terrible for the world.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.900
We have to break
into these factories

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.720
and destroy these
machines, because our jobs

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.900
are going to be taken away.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.720
And we can put an end to this.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.580
We'll just break the machines
and this will all be over.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.790
And it's progressed through
electricity and the Digital

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.540
Revolution and then now this
fourth Industrial Revolution,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.370
which is the
convergence of physical

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.770
or digital and
biological sciences.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.210
And it's captured in the
book by Klaus Schwab.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.610
And I think it's
worthy of noting

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.280
that we shouldn't
be like the Luddites

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.720
and be afraid of technology.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.694
We should embrace it.

00:22:01.694 --> 00:22:02.610
We should leverage it.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.970
We should use it to
help us learn better,

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.420
to do our jobs better,
to be more effective.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.310
And we shouldn't allow
it to destroy society,

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.540
to further our gap between
the haves and the have-nots,

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.240
but use technology
and the concepts

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.700
around the Fourth
Industrial Revolution

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.050
to help our societies and
our people be more productive

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.790
and do better things.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.690
I also wanted to reference
President Allen's book

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.140
Robot-Proof at
Northeastern University.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.980
I think that he captures
many of the guiding

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.290
principles of the fourth
Industrial Revolution

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.260
and puts it in a context
of higher education.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.380
I really believe that
the University of Arizona

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.170
can be the land grant university
in the Fourth Industrial

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.190
Revolution.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.730
We've got a chance
to redefine ourselves

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.920
in terms of what
our students need

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.670
to be prepared to go out
and be competitive for jobs

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.760
in this ever-changing,
rapidly-changing world.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.030
And I just put up a couple
of other articles here

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.510
about what role the universities
have in the Fourth Industrial

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.530
Revolution.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.190
And then the Wall Street
Journal just last week published

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.880
an expose on what the Fourth
Industrial Revolution is

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.230
and how important it is.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.570
And it's not some
futuristic thing.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.980
We're living it right now.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.610
So we need to be aligning
our research programs

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.970
and preparing our students to
be competitive and not only

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.100
competitive, but to
thrive in this new world.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.810
So this is a video
that sort of shameless

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.910
self promotion of the
University of Arizona

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:46.130
around the fourth
Industrial Revolution.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:55.239
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:57.280
NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): We've
done incredible things

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.380
at this university.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.060
We've made the moon
landing possible,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.660
the first portable
artificial heart.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.490
And we understand climate
because we know tree rings.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.230
But yesterday's
thinking isn't enough.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.080
We have two jobs--

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.880
to prepare our students for
tomorrow that's so different

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.180
it's hard to imagine
and to share what

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.180
we know to make life better.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.120
Our world is changing
faster than ever.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.050
Lines are blurring.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.340
We are redefining what
it means to be human.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.265
And every decision
has a global impact.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.990
Our students want
to make a difference

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.940
but wonder what we can
teach them that they

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.560
can't learn on their own.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.390
We need to teach
students how to think.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.480
But to stay relevant,
to outpace the world,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.630
we need to change everything.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.170
By thinking bigger, breaking
routines, and collaborating

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.150
more intensely.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.030
Not a single one of us is
exempt from this mind shift.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:08.000
To prepare disruptive problem
solvers, we must disrupt.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.380
To make the world better,
we must do better together.

00:25:16.112 --> 00:25:18.070
ROBERT ROBBINS: So in
this very room last year,

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.340
we started talking
about this process.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.060
And over the course
of the last year,

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.610
we've had multiple stakeholder
engagement meetings,

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.430
like this one that was
captured in this photograph

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.630
and also in Phoenix and
have gone around the state.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.110
We've engaged over 10,000
Wildcats in this process.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.050
You've all seen the five
pillars, the first one

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.490
being around students.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.920
This is a very
student-centric plan.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.230
The second around
research and discovery,

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.180
the third about being
the new land grant

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.860
university in this Fourth
Industrial Revolution.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.960
Four will be around are global
and international efforts.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.970
And the fifth pillar
will be around

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.060
how we actually run
the university better,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.550
better business processes
more efficiently

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.170
to serve our students, our
faculty, and our staff.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.141
This is a slide that I'll
refer back to-- of course,

00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:14.890
you can't read it.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.140
Not even in your books
can you hardly read it.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.350
But it just outlines
the over 90 initiatives.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.330
And these were
developed by real people

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.360
who were leading them with
groups to design strategies,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.120
tactics to achieve
those strategies,

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.330
metrics to measure
success, and identifying

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.720
the resource necessarily
to execute this plan.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.180
And you can see just
by the sheer numbers,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.440
this is a very
student-centric plan focused

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.630
around the first pillar.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.770
So I'm running behind.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.300
So I'm speeding up a little bit.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.129
And I know that producers
are in my ear telling me,

00:26:51.129 --> 00:26:52.670
you're way behind,
you're way behind.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.124
But we started a
little bit late.

00:26:55.124 --> 00:26:56.540
And you're going
to get a chance--

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.810
and I forgot to
say, at any point--

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.490
I'm trying to read
your eyee-- if you

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.640
want to ask me a question,
please stop me and ask me.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.290
But I wanted to cover our
goals for student success.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.500
I've already alluded
to them that we're

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.240
going to have we're
going to go out

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.560
and recruit a very high quality,
high potential student body.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.800
But we're also for
the first time--

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.030
and I credit many people
and Vin Dell Casino

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.600
and his team and Casey
for thinking about.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.170
Because I thought we need
to raise the quality.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.980
Therefore, we need to lower
the number of students

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.130
that we admit to the
University of Arizona,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.360
because we can't grow
to be as big as ASU

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.240
or other big
universities, because we

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.800
have limited resources.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.500
But I was wrong about that.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.050
They have identified
something that I

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.570
believe is going to
be of great service

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.240
to the citizens and the
students of Arizona.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.610
And that's focusing
on transfer students,

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.850
to focus with our
partners certainly

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.700
here at Pima Community College.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.250
But also, I was just out
visiting the Tohono O'odham

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.850
Nation, and they've got
a community college there

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.380
with nearly 500 students.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.600
And we just haven't
done a good job

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.840
of going out and working with
them and helping them do better

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.250
and partnering with them.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:28.120
Coaches Community College,
Vin and his team went down,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.080
and I got a call from the
chancellor thanking us

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.280
for coming down.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.930
And of course, Maricopa
Community College,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.600
they're 200,000 students.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.520
And we've just never
focused on these students.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.550
And I think that's something
that I look forward

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:46.720
to watching and helping
build out in this plan.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.090
I said we're going to
have 91%, retention ,

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.910
rate 75% six year
graduation rate.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.840
And there are many
different initiatives,

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.780
as you saw in that
earlier slide.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.940
They're four that I
wanted to focus on--

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.880
general education,
active collaborative

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.880
teaching and learning,
student success and retention,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.372
and our honors village.

00:29:10.372 --> 00:29:12.400
These are three
quotes that we pulled

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.790
from a task force that
was commissioned by Gail

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.650
Byrd around general education.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.350
And what it says is
we've had a proliferation

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.300
of general education courses.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.310
We've not had proper oversight.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.020
It's very difficult
for our students

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.750
to maneuver this system.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.230
And it calls for
reform for us to put

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.250
in some central oversight and
structure as we go forward.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.260
Our general education
vision is that we're

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:44.320
going to develop a core
set of courses and themes

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.770
that will help our
students be prepared

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.560
for this Fourth
Industrial Economy

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.640
by studying grand challenges and
looking at driving questions.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.700
The first tenet in
this Wildcat Core is--

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.510
and I'll have to
say, there have been

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.630
Elliot and Gail and
Vin and Bruce Johnson,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.960
the Dean of Education,
and many others.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:14.200
You saw 2141, the home that
I am privileged to live in,

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.090
we would sit in that great
room and have debates

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.510
and discussions and talk about
what is general education need

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.780
to be at the
University of Arizona.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.260
Almost every university
is debating this

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.380
and struggling with it.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.030
But I want to thank everyone
who's put a lot of effort

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.300
and a lot of deliberation in
developing learning outcomes

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.900
so we'll know what our
students are learning.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.320
Moreover, we're going to
have professors examining

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.580
how effective they are at
teaching and delivering

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.620
this information.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.400
We want to develop critical
skills for our students,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.890
so that they'll be
ready to go out and have

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.250
the mentality and the tools
to think about design thinking

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.240
and coding.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.730
And then a required
first year course

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.120
that I'll show you some
of the ideas we have for.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.200
But importantly in that red box,
a central oversight structure

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.370
that will give some
clarity to this process.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.990
And we're going to
get right on this.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.700
We're going to start some pilots
in the fall of 2019, including

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.710
this first year introductory
bootcamp type course.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.900
So just like Arizona
has the five C's--

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.130
I got a lot of pushback
on this, but I got it.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.580
We had some creative
differences with the producers

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.270
and directors.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.620
But I got this in.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.350
And this has not
been codified by all

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.690
of the experts in
general education.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.720
But I thought it
highlighted what

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.100
I had hoped that the core
learning objectives would be--

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.290
that our students would
develop critical thinking,

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.000
communication both written and
verbal communication skills,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.850
collaborative teamwork
to solve big problems,

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.640
have an understanding of the
differences of the world--

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.030
because we're in a globally
competitive economy now--

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.890
So to have cultural
understanding,

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.050
creative problem solving.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.960
These are the five C's
of general education

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.340
that I think are important.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:19.230
Of course, civic engagement,
service back to the community,

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.990
there are many other C's
we could add to this list.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.830
One that does not
begin with a c,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.150
we could call
commanding leadership.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.410
Leadership is very important
for our students in my opinion.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.730
So this video, what
I've learned is

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.990
that companies like Google
and Amazon and Apple, they

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.280
want a hard generalists.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.740
They want students that have
those core skills and values.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.350
And Jeff Bezos was
supposed to be on video.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.570
Actually, he's supposed
to fly in on a drone,

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.000
but we got mixed up.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.420
And so we've got Taylor Lawrence
to do this video for us.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.450
TAYLOR LAWRENCE (ON VIDEO):
At present, just over 8%

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.420
of all of Raytheon
company's 64,000 employees

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.600
hold a degree from
the U of A. Raytheon

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.110
will hire more than 260 U
of A grads this year alone.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:16.260
And we've hired nearly 1,000 of
them from 2014 to the present.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.990
AU students are
consistently up to the task

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.630
of tackling some of the
most demanding challenges

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.240
in technology and in
advancing and managing

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.510
the business the success
of U of A grads at Raytheon

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.210
has acted as a catalyst
for the increasingly

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.390
important relationship between
our company and the University.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.050
This relationship has an
impact on national security.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.900
It has an impact on
Raytheon's global growth.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.640
It makes us a more
productive company,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.860
because you have
a grads or quality

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.930
employees who can
work complex problems

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.930
and care about
business outcomes.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.920
The educational institutions,
such as the U of A,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.580
that help prepare students
to compete in these

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.860
and other digital fields
will be the schools that

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.360
grow their capability faster
and make stronger contributions

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.110
to industry and society.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.000
We want to see the
U of A transforming

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.389
into the Fourth Industrial
Revolution alongside Raytheon's

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.250
own transformation
so that we can

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.030
take this partnership to
several next levels together.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:23.429
ROBERT ROBBINS: So I think that
illustrates the competitive job

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.429
market that's out there and
what we need our students

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:28.380
to have a great foundation.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.650
In this first year course
that's being developed,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.520
you can see the things
that we hope that students

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.630
will learn as they get ready.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.070
As a pre-medical
student, I was really

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.830
focused on physics
and organic chemistry.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.110
And I didn't really
want to take the time

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:50.580
to broaden my horizons with
a liberal arts education.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.040
But I went to a small
liberal arts college,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.219
and it absolutely
changed my life.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.650
And I think our
students, as I've

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.137
talked to them, this
big 450 courses,

00:35:02.137 --> 00:35:03.720
and how do we've
been maneuver, and we

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.390
need to just focus on our
engineering studies and all

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.020
the things--

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.070
I think we need to slow
the game down, emphasize

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.580
that all of these five
C's can be developed

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.000
will help you no matter
what you do in your life,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.750
whether you are an
engineer at Raytheon

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.960
or you're going to law
school, critical thinking

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.160
skills, communication skills,
these fundamental, foundational

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.990
skills are so important.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.730
And I'm glad to see
that we're getting

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.710
this introduced
into the curriculum

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.990
as a pilot in the fall.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:42.060
Active learning and teaching,
Gail Bird, John Pollock,

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.360
Paul Blowers, who you'll see
in a video in just a minute,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.020
have really been national
leaders in this movement

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.740
around using the so-called
flipped classroom

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.130
for peer-to-peer
mentoring and teaching.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.570
Instead of the sage on stage,
as Shan Sutton calls it,

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.690
it's the coach on the sideline
that's helping students

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.080
in real time to help
them understand and learn

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.940
what they need to do.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.000
Through this
process, people have

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.620
started to think we need more
of these flipped classrooms,

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.430
and so we're reimagining
the old chemistry

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.880
building as an innovative
teaching hub as a possibility.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.550
Whoever lives in there
right now, don't freak out.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.400
This is not-- it's
not decided totally.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.470
But this could be
a place where we

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:33.300
could have a whole building
dedicated to collaborative

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.100
teaching and learning.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.676
One of the key points
of this, and I give--

00:36:38.676 --> 00:36:40.050
President Schaefer
always said he

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.230
wanted to connect the main
library to the engineering

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.589
library but Bear Down
Gym was in between,

00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:47.130
and he wasn't going
to be the guy who

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.750
took down Bear Down Gym.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:55.110
So Melissa Vito and Shan Sutton
and Vin Del Casino and others

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.780
envisioned this idea that we
could build a student success

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.180
district.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.300
And I'll show you a video
in the little fly through,

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.240
but it'll essentially
be repurposing Bear Down

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.180
Gym as a center for
student activities

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.140
to help them as a one stop shop
and opening up and connecting

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.930
the libraries and putting
another building on the back

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.770
to create this vibrant
community where they can go

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:23.520
and they can get advising,
they can do job interviews,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.410
they can have maker
spaces, as you'll

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.920
see on one of the slides,
where the traditional library--

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.340
yeah, it happens when
I use certain words,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.511
Siri just kicks on.

00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:36.760
I don't know how that happens.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.690
But somebody is monitoring me.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.560
But this will be a
transformational differentiated

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.690
facility, and the programs that
go on in this student success

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:54.110
district will be like
no other in the US.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.789
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:57.330
SHAN SUTTON: One of
the things that's

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.450
really unique about the student
success district design,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.510
it's an intentional design of
four different buildings that

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.240
are adjacent to each other
and their outdoor spaces

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.090
to create one seamless
student experience.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.100
And this is really
distinctive to the U of A.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.170
We're not aware of any
other university that's

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.990
attempted this in terms of
integrating library spaces

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.650
and services, as well as
student success, student affairs

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.890
spaces and services, so that
students can really easily

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.350
move from one space
and service to another.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.690
 When you think
about a space, you

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.820
have to imagine it as a site
where people come together.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.970
And that's exactly what
we're building here.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.150
And learning is not
a singular pursuit.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.370
Learning always happens in
concert with other people.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.800
So the student
success district is

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.980
designed to increase
collaboration between students,

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.660
because that peer
to peer learning

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.570
is as important, if not
more important than some

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.210
of the learning that goes on in
all the other spaces, including

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.135
the classroom.

00:38:52.135 --> 00:38:53.760
I will share with
you that when I first

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.176
came to the
University of Arizona,

00:38:55.176 --> 00:38:56.940
I was a very gifted lecturer.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.840
I won lots of awards
in that format,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.570
but students were still
not passing my class.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.910
But lecturing is, in my mind,
is me talking at students,

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.970
and the students are
passively receiving

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.660
that information of some sort.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.570
And then they watch
me solve an example.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.611
And they go home and they
try to do the homework,

00:39:14.611 --> 00:39:16.600
and it looked really
easy when I did it.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.890
Obviously, it isn't.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.050
And so lecturing is one way
of conveying information

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.500
to students, but it doesn't
allow for the opportunity of me

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.930
to really see what
they're understanding.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.840
And I will say since I moved in
in the collaborative learning

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.690
spaces, which really
facilitate the active learning

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.720
like this room here,
not a single student

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.760
has fallen asleep in my class.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.050
Attendance hovers around
90% to 95% on any given day,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.468
and you don't see that in
lecture hall very often.

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.005
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:49.005 --> 00:39:52.020
ROBERT ROBBINS: So Paul
shared with us in the faculty

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.500
breakfast this
morning, first of all,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.870
in the first week
of school last year,

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.810
I got to go and
observe Paul teaching

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.120
in his collaborative classroom.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.930
I was impressed he knew
every student's name, 100

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:10.170
students in the class he walked
around, called them by name.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.190
And he told me-- and Paul
you can tell me later

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.680
if I got this wrong--
but essentially, he

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.200
teaches high level,
very difficult

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.450
chemical engineering
course that he

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:27.240
said before changing to this
active collaborative style

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.630
around half of the students
could pass or either finish

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.650
his course.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.570
And now over 90% of students
finish his course successfully.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:42.000
So I think that's a testament
not only to his ability and his

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.510
seeing the future and changing
his pedagogical approach,

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.690
but it also says a lot
about him as a person.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.120
He shared with us
this morning that he

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.450
went to a high school that
didn't even offer trigonometry,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.440
and now he's one of our
most esteemed professors

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.550
of this university.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:05.250
And he and so many
of our faculty staff

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.010
care about our students and
want to see success for each

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.810
and every one of our students.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:16.080
So the libraries, the new
student success district,

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.260
very impressive buildings.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.150
But what goes on
in the buildings,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.270
I think, will be more important
than the buildings themselves.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.210
There are programs around
first cats for first generation

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.650
students that have more
than 90% retention rates.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.050
New Start just
celebrated 50 years

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.890
of helping students, primarily
from our Latino and Hispanic

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.630
communities, and that program
where they come for six weeks

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.140
before school starts
that first semester

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.880
and they get to live in the dorm
and they get to take classes

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.160
and they get to go
to this boot camp

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.260
and get ready for college--

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.110
50 years into this, the
retention rate in that program

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.010
is 90%.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.470
And I said, why don't we
do this for every student?

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.930
Well, this costs money
and requires resources,

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.620
but this is absolutely the
meticulous attention to detail

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.080
that we need to have
for all of our students

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.180
if we're going to get out
of that bottom quartile

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.940
with our peers.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.420
And then finally
in this session,

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.620
I wanted to just talk
about the Honors Village.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:23.280
I think Dean Hunt in recruiting
Associate Deans John Pollard

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.040
and Melissa Fitch
are really developing

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.220
an exciting new curriculum
and new direction

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.730
for our honors students.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.650
And this building facility,
this complex, this village

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:39.360
will be as good if not the best
in the country that currently

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.240
will be scheduled to
be open for students

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.610
in the fall of next year.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.630
And so if you walk through it--

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.380
I have to point on this screen--

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.570
but the dorm rooms are here.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah, I don't have a laser.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.840
You can see it.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.000
Dorm rooms in the red.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.450
And then all of the activities
that are currently spread out

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.790
across the campus
will be centralized

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:07.140
in this one village with a rec
center, with a dining hall,

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.770
with all the classrooms, and
the administrative offices

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.180
being in this one village.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.720
So our students can
get this high touch,

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.800
highly directed
liberal arts experience

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.200
inside this large
research university.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.690
And you can go to
football games.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.830
Please come on Saturday
after Thanksgiving.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.110
I know maybe we won't have
a lot of students here

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.710
but a big game.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.460
We're going to have
to beat Arizona State,

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.769
I think, to get to a bowl game.

00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:34.810
So it's going to be good.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.820
But you can have this incredible
liberal arts experience

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:44.220
by some of our master
professors like Paul Blowers,

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.630
like our regents
professors, people who are--

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.200
Dante, who you'll see on a
video in the next section who's

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.490
leading the OSIRIS-REX program,
leaders from our health

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.900
sciences, come in and talk to
our students about their life

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.330
and about how important it it
is to get real life experience

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:12.440
and also combine that with
a liberal arts education.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.220
That's it.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.720
I'm finished with
the first section.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.240
So your question, your
timing is perfect.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.115
I'm also 20 minutes
behind time, but that's--

00:44:20.115 --> 00:44:21.740
AUDIENCE: OK, Honors
Village, so you're

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.550
recruiting right now for
honor students in the Honors

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.410
Village for fall 19.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.070
Yes.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.890
So recruiting students without
facilities to show them, yeah.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.740
What are you anticipating
the enrollment

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.590
will be first year there?

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.400
 Well, I think, we have
an Honors College now,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.800
and we have about
1,000 students.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.950
And so I am confident that we're
going to have 1,000 students.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.000
The difference I
think is we're going

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.010
to have many more highly
qualified students than we

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.470
potentially can accommodate.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.630
And I know that
Dean Hunt is looking

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.360
at raising the bar for what
it means to be an honor

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.380
student at the
University of Arizona,

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.220
and I think that's a good thing.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.790
So we are starting
to think about how

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.980
we're going to market
this new village

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.080
and also not just
the new village

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.630
but the programs that will
go on inside the village.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.540
I mean, Terry's only been
here a year, and I think he--

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.850
and he's putting his team
together and thinking

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.840
about what are the
differentiated type of programs

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.130
and curriculum and seminars and
experiences that will go on.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.580
What's traditionally gone on
here at our Honors College,

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.520
because it's been spread
out all over the campuses,

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.070
you go for the first
year, you live in a dorm,

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.500
and then there's not a
lot of connectivity back.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.150
I think this new village with
rec center and food and seminar

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:58.280
series and things going on
in that beautiful green space

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.230
and the quad inside
of it, I hope

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:04.225
our honor students will stay
connected for all four years.

00:46:04.225 --> 00:46:06.350
AUDIENCE: Is the anticipation
that it would only be

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.720
freshman in the dorm, though?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.970
ROBERT ROBBINS: It would be
only freshmen in the dorm,

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:15.590
but there is enough leeway that
if you want to stay in the dorm

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.170
then I think that you
can be accommodated.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.070
But traditionally, that's
what the model has been.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.590
And that gets me
into another thing

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.660
about I think all
of our students

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.370
should want to live on campus.

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.540
We don't have enough
dormitory rooms now,

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.500
but we need to build more.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.180
I also think that we need right
alongside the Honors Village,

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:42.650
the next project I think is
going to be focused on building

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:46.040
a graduate student
village that would serve

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.530
the graduate students
who are incredibly

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.940
important to this university.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.290
And I'll get into that more on
the research side of things.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.770
But we need to invest in
our graduate students.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.860
They're so important to the
success of the university.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.760
So giving them a place that
would be sort of out in front

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.600
of Eller, so they could--
they could live there and go

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.400
across the street
and go to Eller

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.767
or the law school or engineering
or the health sciences,

00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:15.600
I think that's going
to be really important.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.190
And at least from the focus
groups I've done with students,

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:25.610
would be quite positive
in terms of the desire

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.780
to want to live there.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.460
But we've got to
look at expenses.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.400
People live off campus now,
because we charge them too much

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.850
to live on campus.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.030
So we're looking at
that and the possibility

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.780
of building new dorms.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.370
So I think the health
of a university

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:43.490
is indirectly measured by how
many students want to stay

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.470
on campus all four years.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.598
Other questions?

00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:52.700
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, Dr. Robbins.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.120
I just want to go back
to the beginning of this,

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.020
and I wanted to compliment
you and the entire team.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.340
Your manifesto, as
you said, but I see

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.600
this is such a great platform--

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.200
the whole idea of the
fourth industrial revolution

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.107
and the idea that
it's a changing world.

00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:15.440
And while we're going to spend
the rest of the day going

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.960
through a lot of the particulars
of what you've come up

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.320
with already, kind of, the
most important thing to me

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.710
is the recognition that we
don't know what's going to come,

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:26.630
but we're going to help
shape what that is.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.000
And U of A's going
to play a key role.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.130
And I think the whole
underpinnings of this

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.150
is the idea of U of A being
a leadership university,

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.340
being a leadership entity
in this state and the world

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.660
and unleashing that power
of the people of U of A

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.330
to go make that happen.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.430
So I just want to
congratulate the whole team

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.890
on the fundamental
way you started this.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.260
The details are
great, and the details

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.440
will change over time as
people come up with new ideas.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.540
But putting that
challenge in place

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.120
and starting from that
position, I think is great,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.080
and it's what a great
university should do.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.180
So thank you.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.060
ROBERT ROBBINS: Thank you for
your nine years of guiding

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:09.140
this this whole enterprise,
but particularly living down

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.810
here and all the things you've
done for the community here

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:12.620
and pushing me.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.060
I mean, they're very kind words.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.330
When we're off camera
you challenge us,

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:18.530
and I appreciate that.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:24.730
And I appreciate this
process of the give and take

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:25.490
and the challenge.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.640
And we're not we're not
finished with this yet.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.620
As I said, this is the
end of the beginning.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:37.250
And so I look forward even
when the governor does finally

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.650
put someone in the game--

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.509
I think what they do
on the football field,

00:49:41.509 --> 00:49:42.800
you see him patting their head.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.380
That means I want to come out
of the game, because I'm tired.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.660
Maybe you need to send a
video patting your head,

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.700
and so the governor will
get you some relief.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.660
But you're going to remain
involved because you live here,

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.844
and we greatly appreciate
all your help on this.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.890
We can't move on,
because we haven't

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:06.110
spent enough time on the clock.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:07.789
We still have more
time for questions,

00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:09.830
but I'm happy to move on
because that means I get

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.510
more time on the research side.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.710
AUDIENCE: Faster,
funnier, great.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.230
 Yeah, OK.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.980
AUDIENCE: Move on.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:19.190
 Well, we had a chance to
meet with each one of you

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.940
over the past few months and,
kind of, bring you along.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.420
And we had a-- we had a good
exchange yesterday morning

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.330
about some of the important
parts of this plan.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.650
So I'll keep going
on, and we'll move now

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:38.300
into the research and discovery
side, another important mission

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.290
for the university.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:42.080
And I would say--

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.150
I don't love President
Schaefer made it here,

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:48.050
but when I talked
to and I've visited

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.390
with every one of
my predecessors

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.600
and they all pointed
to President Schaefer

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.180
being the transformational
president of this university.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.940
He got us on the
right pathway, and I

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.270
think he was probably 37
when he started as president.

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.460
I don't know if he's here.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.560
Did he make it?

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.420
President Schaefer, thank
you very much for being here

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.242
and all the guidance
you've given me.

00:51:11.242 --> 00:51:15.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.260
And there he and
President Likins

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.000
are sitting, scheming
about how they're

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.190
going to beat the pirate
up at Washington State

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.840
this weekend in football.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.570
But I do think it
was an important time

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:30.190
for the university, and the
beauty is he's a scientist

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.460
but at the same time
focused on the arts,

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.990
created the Center for Creative
Photography, the Poetry

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.920
Center, which is one
of the great poetry

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.090
centers in this country.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:44.050
So we have a lot
too-- and I personally

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:48.010
have a lot to owe to both
he and President Likins

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.450
for being around.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.050
And I can just go they're not
many people, and President Crow

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.180
and I talk about this all the
time, these are hard jobs.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:00.190
And there are not many
people who understand.

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:03.280
Regent Penley, certainly,
is somebody that I can go to

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.220
and understands what
the complexities

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.000
and challenges of this job are.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.966
But I've really appreciated
all of the guidance and support

00:52:11.966 --> 00:52:13.840
I've gotten in the short
time I've been here.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.980
And hope to be here
for a long time.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:20.630
So one of the things that
makes this university great,

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.930
and if you look at
why we're consistently

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:26.200
ranked in the top
100 universities

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.700
on all global rankings--

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.880
I think this year, we were
by one of the rankings

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.790
ranked 16th worldwide--

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.190
is because of our
research productivity.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:39.970
And we, of course, want
to continue to invest

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:41.710
in our research enterprise.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.820
I think it gives--

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.370
one of the things
that is a little

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.460
different about the
University of Arizona

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.000
and from the previous
strategic plan

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.930
that President Hart put
together is 100% engagement.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.410
I think that's fantastic.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.640
And the opportunity for
undergrads on this campus

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.700
to be involved and
to actually-- you'll

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.060
see Dante talk about this
in the OSIRIS-REX project

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.960
to actually be part of that
and do research and understand

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.930
how the research that they do
either in the health sciences

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:18.380
center are in engineering
or in the environment

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:23.440
or at the biosphere affects the
bigger picture of the world,

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.460
I think is one of the
differentiating parts

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.400
of the university and
it keeps us competitive.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.640
So even though
we're ranked 38th,

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.730
I am absolutely confident
that we can do better

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:41.560
and that we can be a top
25 research university.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.290
You see in the
third bullet point

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:47.140
that we want to be a top
25 health sciences research

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.770
center.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.894
Currently, we're ranked 54th.

00:53:49.894 --> 00:53:51.310
I think that's
where there's going

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.780
to be a lot of opportunity
moving forward in the world

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.900
as we move into this fourth
industrial revolution.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.080
But I think specifically
because of the University

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.820
of Arizona's assets--

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.910
not the least of which is
we have two medical schools,

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.400
great pharmacy, nursing,
and public health--

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.350
but also we've got a clinical
partner in Banner that I think

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:18.250
will help us get to
move up to the rankings.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.200
And I'm confident
we can hit our goals

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.510
and actually exceed
our goals that we

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.580
have for our research goal.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.130
So we say that we want
to hit $800 million

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.400
in research activity by 2025.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.860
I think this is one
of the few goals--

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.890
the ABOR goals that we're
actually saying we're

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:36.790
going to exceed.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.490
Because I think
it's $752 million

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:43.120
was the original ABOR goal
or the revised ABOR goal.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.700
Maybe it was $1.2 billion, and
someone got some reality check

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.350
and moved it back to $750.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.790
So I think this is
a reasonable goal.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:57.160
But if you go back to that
slide of the 38 top research

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.100
universities, what I would
love to be able to do

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.400
is be here long enough to
hit the billion dollar mark.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.900
I think that our endowment
needs to be about $800

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.070
plus million dollars.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.930
Now it needs to be
about $2 billion,

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:14.880
and we need to have $1
billion in research activity.

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.830
And I absolutely believe
we could hit that.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.010
By 2025, I think we'll
hit the $800 million

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:22.660
for all the reasons I've said.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:25.130
And there's no
magic formula there.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:28.960
I've been told that you all
want to hear exactly how we're

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.950
going to get there.

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.680
We're going to get there
one grant at a time.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.650
We're going to recruit
and retain star faculty

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.615
from all over the world.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:44.410
We have the facilities,
we have the mentality,

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.410
we've got great
weather, great culture.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:51.320
There's a soul to this place
that people want to be here.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.700
And that's how we're going
to win research grants.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.820
And we've got to do a
better job of recruiting

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.270
faculty members from all walks
of life and all backgrounds.

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.910
And as I've said
before, our diversity

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.430
at this university
especially as we

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.340
go into this globally
competitive fourth industrial

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.500
revolution economy
is going to be

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.570
one of the great strengths
of this university.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:18.950
Equally, we've got to
attract great grad students

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:20.270
and professional students.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.630
But the graduate
students are the students

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:27.410
of how this actually works
is brilliant professors will

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:31.280
conceive of and write grants
and go out and win the grants,

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.770
and who does the work actually?

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:36.980
Our graduate students, our
undergraduate students,

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.750
our postdocs.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:40.380
That's how this
whole thing works.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.770
So we've got to
double down, invest,

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.870
and support our
graduate students

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.570
not only in the
research side but also

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.490
allow them to get
in the classroom

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.350
and to teach our undergrads.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:54.470
Because many of them
if we can't begin

00:56:54.470 --> 00:57:01.370
to change the quality of our
teaching by our professors,

00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:02.840
because most of
the time you're not

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.120
taught actually how to teach.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.020
And we've got a
great opportunity,

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.380
and I think Gail and
her team and others

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:15.650
are thinking about how we do
evaluations of our professors.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.520
This didn't go over very
well, but I suggested, well,

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.550
we videotape them.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:24.840
And we get a quality control
person just like the NFL has,

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.800
and we look at everything
they talk about

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.430
and you give them
positive feedback.

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:33.980
I don't know that we're
there yet on that idea,

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.760
but the idea is we need to
start with our graduate students

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.360
and teaching them how to teach
and give them the opportunity

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.260
to teach.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.410
And then finally,
it's really important

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:49.850
to have the facilities to
be able to do this work

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:52.820
and to be able when you
put a grant in there's

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:58.400
always an environmental and
facilities part of any grant

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.670
application.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.430
And the funding
agencies want to know

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.040
that if they give you the
money to do this work,

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.010
you're actually going to have
the facilities, the equipment,

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:12.050
the infrastructure in place and
mostly the intellectual talent

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:16.070
to be able to be successful
and advance science and have

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.740
new discoveries
for the betterment

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:24.620
of our state, our country,
and indeed the world.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:28.910
So this part of the
plan, we'll get into it

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.790
in pillar three
around our service

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.520
to the state, our
stewardship back,

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.460
what's in it for the state
when they invest in us.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.770
And economic
development is clearly

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.390
one of the great multipliers of
being located near a research

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.590
university.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.690
I think if you look at
the economics of it,

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.530
it's about a 3.4
multiplier on how

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:54.320
communities around great
research universities

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.030
develop their economies.

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:58.140
And you saw Taylor
Lawrence in Raytheon.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.770
I mean, their world
headquarters is outside Boston,

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.380
but their missile
defense business is here.

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.440
And what Taylor
always tells me, I

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.390
ask him what can we do for you.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:11.110
He said keep
producing engineers,

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:15.980
but keep producing engineers
that have those core five Cs

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.050
that when they hit the
ground running here ,

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:20.810
they know how to work in teams,
they know how to be leaders,

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.810
they know how to communicate
and how to critically think.

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.390
So this is how we're going
to get to that 800 number,

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.900
and I think we've got the
opportunity to do even better.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.700
These are the areas--

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.960
again, this is
somewhat sensitive,

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.770
because I can remember when
we were doing a strategic plan

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:43.110
at Stanford and it came
down to the final cut

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:46.620
and I was lobbying the
president very hard

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.060
that cardiovascular diseases
kill more people than anything

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.260
else in the World.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.320
Cancer now does, because
we've done better mitigating

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.890
cardiovascular disease.

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:58.910
But at the final cut,
neurosciences in stem cell

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.610
biology made it and
cardiovascular didn't, so I

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:02.870
was really disappointed.

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.780
But it didn't stop me
from raising money, doing

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.970
our research, and
running our institute.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:08.870
And it won't stop.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:14.690
If I don't mention the
discipline that you work in,

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.530
it doesn't mean that
it's not important.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.910
But these are the things that
we're really going to focus on.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.370
The first area is around space.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.060
I mean, we've got to
be able to continue

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.270
to invest in the things
that made us great,

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.120
that got us to where we are,
and we'll continue to do it.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.560
And it just so happens there's
great opportunity around space.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.540
Around human
health, it's obvious

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.900
that that's going to be one of
the world's great challenges--

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.820
not only in the
science side of thing

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:48.680
but also in policy
and societal issues.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.630
Data computer and
network science,

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:55.700
it's the fundamental platform
of the fourth industrial

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.390
revolution.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.100
We've got to be good at that.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.840
We've also got to incorporate
humanities into this,

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.440
and then finally the
environment is so important

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.510
that we at the University have
the institute the environment,

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:15.300
over 300 researchers
that are focused here.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.670
And we're one of the
great universities

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:23.010
around environmental studies and
particularly around arid lands.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:27.660
So for space, there are many
things that we can focus on,

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.650
not the least of which
would be exploration, what's

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:35.310
out there, what are the
origins of the universe,

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:37.950
how did we all get here.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.600
When you start
thinking you're all

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.390
that, just remember we're
just one little speck

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.460
in that big universe out there.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.580
And there was a
recent article, and I

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.710
was going to have a fly
through here about it

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:53.250
because it was so timely
about Harvard professor see

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.730
moving object that's
accelerating and decelerating.

01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:00.270
And they think that it's a
spaceship from another galaxy

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:03.500
or another universe
coming to say hello to us

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.440
and explore with us.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.000
Well, I'm not really sure.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.997
We can ask the real experts
who do rocket science what

01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:10.830
they think about it.

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:14.550
But I think the point
is we're out there,

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.120
the whole OSIRIS-REX
project is trying

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.840
to sample this
asteroid, Bennu, and try

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.970
to get an analysis of what
the origins of the universe

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:30.570
and how we got here
and what's out there.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:34.230
We've got telescopes to the
north, east, west, south,

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.210
and that's why
we're so good here.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.740
I asked why are we so good
at astronomy and planetary

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.760
sciences?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.010
It's because we've
got great weather.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:48.150
325 nights out of the year,
you've got a beautiful portal

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.770
into the universe.

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:55.050
The other one is around
using satellites and imaging

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.570
to help things on
Earth, particularly,

01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:05.070
around watching around crops and
water and other things that'll

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:07.850
be turning back on Earth.

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.860
That great picture-- the
first picture of Earth

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.520
was from our team here
as we were scouting out

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.040
places for the first
landing on the moon,

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.490
and then the rogue professor
who was told he could only

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:24.999
take pictures of the moon at the
last minute turned the camera

01:03:24.999 --> 01:03:26.790
and took a picture of
the Earth, and it was

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.440
the first picture of the Earth.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.220
So there are a lot of things
that we can do in the space

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.250
environment, and I
would say, as I'll

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:39.870
talk about in the third pillar,
some potential partnerships we

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:40.390
can do.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:42.600
But the business of space,
which I didn't really

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.720
understand until we
got into this process

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:53.010
about doing asteroid
mining for precious metals,

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:57.210
that seems a very, a
very low margin business.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:00.850
But as President Crow and
I were talking about it,

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:02.910
this is something that is--

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:06.650
it's a real thing, and I think
we're going to see it happen.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.530
I had some venture
capitalists from Palo Alto

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:13.170
recently tell me that
their fund is only

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:15.040
investing in the
business of space,

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.670
and did I know that if
you produced optic cable

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.060
for telecommunications
in microgravity

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.820
that it's like 10x
more efficient?

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.520
Again, I think a very
low margin business,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.720
but people are thinking
about this stuff.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.620
The one that Dean
Wakene Ruiz told me

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.090
about the other day-- which I'm
now starting to get onto it--

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:42.390
is we've got a company
here that you'll

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:45.390
hear about in a video called
Vector who just figured out

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:50.490
how to launch satellites at low
cost, a relatively low cost.

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:56.790
Probably the size of this to put
these satellites out and circle

01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:00.720
the entire earth so that
you could send signals

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.760
from anywhere on earth
constantly and think

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.420
about using those satellites
as a part of a series

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:16.920
of computers, the so-called
blockchain for cybersecurity

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.290
or for data management.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.000
This is the kind
of business that I

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.660
think that we not only here
at the University of Arizona

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.670
and southern Arizona
but the entire state

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.230
are poised to take advantage of.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:32.540
So this is Dante
Lauretta who is the--

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.970
who is just an
incredible individual who

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:39.460
leads the OSIRIS-REX program.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.900
One of the first
missions that NASA ever

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.650
entrusted to someone
other than NASA to do,

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:49.530
and the University of
Arizona is doing this

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.800
and has done another--
is run another project.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.690
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.750
 There is an enormous benefit
to our faculty, to our staff,

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.240
and to our students to be
leading a NASA mission like

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.650
Osiris-REx.

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.900
It allows really
highly talented people

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.980
to be attracted to
our institution,

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.980
both in the faculty, but
also in our engineering

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.050
staff and our support services.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.140
It's been a great educational
experience for our students,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.990
working hands on a Osiris
REx since we started

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.430
conceiving of the mission.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:20.320
These are real jobs with real
resume-building experience,

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.280
and our students have
gone off to great careers

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.230
in space, engineering,
management,

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.950
and many other disciplines.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.180
 Just in Tucson,
we have companies

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.440
ranging from Raytheon Missile
Systems to World View,

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.350
doing ballooning at the
edge of space that is really

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.950
space missions, to
Vector, that is launching

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:41.840
small satellites
into space, something

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.570
that nobody ever was
able to do before.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:45.980
These are the
kinds of companies,

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.410
and the companies that will
come with them, that we

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:49.970
want to work with.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:52.637
 We need to become
proactive in promoting

01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:53.720
the University of Arizona.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.330
Making sure not only
does the city of Tucson

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:58.460
know about the amazing
things that we do here,

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.490
but that reverberates throughout
the United States, Washington

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.282
DC, and even worldwide.

01:07:06.138 --> 01:07:08.042
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.680
 So I think everyone here
knows about how good we are

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.020
in space science and astronomy.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.680
I think we can even do better.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.470
And you'll see a couple
of my thoughts in Pillar 3

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.240
when we come back
from our break.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.190
I want to move on to one of
the other parts of our research

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:31.799
portfolio and initiatives.

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:33.340
And that, of course,
is human health.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.100
And you can see
to the right there

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.120
the incredible amount
of opportunities

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.020
we have across this campus,
certainly south of Speedway,

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.990
to work with the
different colleges

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.790
here, whether it's
optical sciences--

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.010
And I have to say,
optical sciences

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:56.320
is just an incredible program
that Tom Koch and others

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.980
have built here over the years.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.340
And they probably
have more partnerships

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.970
and do more economic
development for this region

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:07.900
by working with
Fortune 50 companies.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.960
And so we're incredibly
lucky to have them,

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.290
and you're going to hear
some more really good news

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:18.430
coming out of optical science
in the coming weeks to months.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:20.680
And I'll show you
a building that'll

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.859
be built in their
neighborhood that we've heard

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:25.920
about at committee meetings.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.180
But the opportunity for our
health sciences programs

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:36.020
to collaborate across the
other colleges is tremendous.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.550
And I think it's one of the
great advantages we have

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:43.060
by having two medical schools
and the other health sciences

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.479
colleges partnered with Banner.

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:50.950
If you look across the
United States in communities

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:53.380
of a million and
less, unless you

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.990
have an academic medical
center in that smaller

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:58.899
population and that
catchment area,

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:02.510
then without having a partner,
you're going to struggle.

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:06.430
And I know that the
partnership with Banner

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.500
was something that
was very difficult,

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.840
and it was born out of a
time of necessity and need.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.310
But I think it's
going to turn out

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:18.399
to be one of our great
competitive advantages

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.830
as we look forward, to
have a system that's

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:24.550
the seventh largest
in the United States.

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:28.270
And to be able to leverage
all of these technologies,

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:31.810
and to really change
the way that health care

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:34.810
and medicine and
wellness are delivered,

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:37.060
I think are a
competitive advantage.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.270
Much of that is going to be
focused around data and data

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.279
management.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.720
Hence why I keep talking
about the fourth Industrial

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.460
Revolution so much.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.140
And as you can see, the
collaborative boxes there.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.380
You know, BIO5, as I
often tell Tom Keating,

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.930
BIO5 was the fourth
Industrial Revolution

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:59.140
before the fourth Industrial
Revolution was ever

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.890
conceived of by Klaus Schwab.

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:08.830
Also, Shane Burgess, our
vise president for College

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:11.110
of Agriculture
and Life Sciences.

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:13.600
I mean, he was onto
this a long time ago.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.870
And when I was giving
a talk and said,

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:20.890
just imagine that in
the future, farmers

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:23.890
will have these fleets of
drones that will go out

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:26.920
and assess their property,
and assess their crops,

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.900
and use data analysis.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:32.500
He said, we were on
to that 10 years ago.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.774
So Shane and Jennifer
Barton and others

01:10:37.774 --> 01:10:39.190
that are around
the university who

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:42.820
are running these big operations
really understand this.

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.990
And I think the new veterinary
school that we're starting.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.990
And we have a dean.

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:54.280
I think Jeff has made an offer,
and hopefully she's accepted

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.930
and will start in January.

01:10:55.930 --> 01:11:00.130
It's very exciting for us,
because it combines this one

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:05.080
health concept that goes
all the way from the farms,

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.860
and the ranches, and not
only crops and livestock

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.860
with our incredible
land grant mission

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.920
of cooperative extension and
helping farmers and ranchers.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.890
But while we're
there, we can also

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.810
be talking to them
and their families

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:22.600
about their personal health.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.740
One of the areas that we have
great strength with here,

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:30.250
in addition to the artificial
heart you saw in the video,

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:32.370
is telemedicine.

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.360
One of the experts
in telemedicine

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.020
came to the University of
Arizona over 30 years ago

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.450
and got that program started.

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:41.950
And that's going
to be, Mike Dake

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:45.100
has come to lead the
Health Sciences Center.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.560
And I'm incredibly grateful.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.620
He also wanted to get the
band back together here

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.350
in the desert.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:54.280
And I think he's doing a
tremendous job with some

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.890
of the people like
Larry Goldberg that's

01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:00.550
been hired by Banner to be the
CEO over the Academic Medical

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.600
Center's side.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.890
I think their partnership
has allowed us to now start

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:08.230
talking about these
transformative,

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:11.620
fundamental discoveries
that can be made across all

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.870
of our colleges, and
incorporated into redefining

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:20.140
the future of health
care and wellness care.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.160
So the three areas that
the health sciences

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.000
have chosen to focus
on around unlocking

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.180
the mysteries of the
future health puzzles

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.340
are around the brain.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.850
Obviously, we're very
good at neuroscience.

01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:42.430
If you look south of
Speedway, John Hildebrand,

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:45.340
Linda Dale, Carol
Barnes, who is one

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.640
of the most gifted
neuroscientists in the country,

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.380
have tremendous neuroscience
programs on the main campus,

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.310
if you will.

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:59.020
And then the recruitment of
Robbie Brinton and others

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.910
on the north side of Speedway.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:04.030
Bringing those groups together,
along with Eric Reiman,

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:07.360
who is in Phoenix, who is
a world's expert along with

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.300
Robbie Brinton on
dementia and Alzheimer's.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.470
This is a powerful
group of investigators

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:18.400
that can come together
and help unlock some

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.730
of the mysteries of why
people get dementia.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:26.560
We still don't know, what are
we going to do with our aging

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.310
population?

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:32.590
By 2030, this country will
be spending $20 trillion--

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.320
that's a t, not a b--

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.860
$20 trillion on the
care of individuals

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.980
with cognitive
dysfunction, dementia,

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.850
and Alzheimer's disease.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:49.510
So we need to learn how to
help our individuals age

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:53.020
and have better quality of life,
and how to take care of them.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.270
I think a lot of this is
going to happen because we're

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:59.470
doing a better job of
mitigating the ravages of cancer

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:05.680
through the second bullet, which
is immunobiology for cancer

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.680
and the entire immune system.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.380
Remember, we just mapped
the whole human genome

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.820
about 15 years ago.

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.820
It took 10 years and
billions of dollars.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.700
If we were going to invest in
the next big thing like that,

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.190
it would be a human
immunome project.

01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:29.170
Because your immune system,
from fighting infections

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.050
and emerging pathogens
in the world,

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:34.150
to turning your
immune system on-- we

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.760
all get cancer every
day in our bodies.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.160
Our immune system find
those cancers and kill them.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.970
So by definition, if
you develop cancer,

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:47.110
you've got some dysfunction
of your immune system,

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.400
compared, or in concert
with, your genetics.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.720
And your environment.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.210
If you smoke, for
instance, you're

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.920
at a higher risk of lung cancer.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.090
But your immune system has
to fight those cancer cells.

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:03.730
And the Nobel Prize
for Medicine was just

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:08.020
won by Jim Allison at M.D.
Anderson for this work.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:13.330
So I'm glad to see that this
area of discovery and treatment

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.700
and diagnosis made
it into the plan.

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.390
And then finally,
we were awarded

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.750
one of the largest
precision medicine grants

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.910
in the country's history.

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.230
$48 million.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.150
And they thought we're
doing such a good job,

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:29.920
they increased it
to $60 million,

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.810
which never happens
from funding agencies.

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:37.570
But we clearly have a great
strength in precision health,

01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:40.820
genomics, proteomics,
metabolomics.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.590
And the reason we got
that grant, in my opinion

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.200
as an outsider at
that point going, wow.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.390
University of Arizona.

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.140
They're punching above
their weight there.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.010
Why is it?

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.730
Two factors, I believe.

01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:53.380
Well, three.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.050
One, we've got great
scientists who do great work.

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.890
We've got a diverse
population of patients,

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:03.460
with a large Hispanic-Latino,
large Native American

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:10.420
population, that makes these
data important and interesting.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.020
And then the final one is
because we have Banner.

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.780
We've got a system to be
able to recruit patients,

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.860
and deliver care, and answer
some of these questions because

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.480
of our partnership with Banner.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.980
So I think that those are
three important pillars

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.760
in the strategic plan.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.160
Stem cells didn't
make it in there.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.030
That's my particular area.

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:37.120
And I really like stem cells.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.870
But I couldn't lobby hard enough
to get stem cells in there.

01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.200
So twice in these strategic
planning processes,

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:44.920
I've lost out.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.120
But at the end, we're
all going to be winners.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.910
After, as I said, this is
the end of the beginning

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.500
part of this process.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.010
And I'm thankful that
when Mike came here

01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:05.200
that he pushed hard on what they
need to be part of this plan.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.620
I was just looking for
some collaborative projects

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.166
across Speedway, north
of Speedway, that

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:12.290
could be part of this plan.

01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.720
But he pushed me really
hard to say no, we

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:20.030
need to have a full-on strategic
plan for the health sciences

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:22.550
that incorporates into
the main campus plan.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:25.790
So this idea that there
are two different plans,

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:27.620
I really don't like.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.150
This is one plan.

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:31.430
And the health sciences
are a big part,

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:35.240
just like the environment
and planetary sciences

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.980
and astronomy are.

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.250
But there is a need
going forward for Banner,

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:44.810
now that Larry Goldberg and
Mike Dake have been here

01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:51.000
for almost a year, that we do
need to partner with Banner

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.440
to do an in-depth strategic
plan for the clinical part

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.880
of the operation.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.990
But integrating the teaching and
research mission and discovery

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:06.590
mission of the university
into the culture of Banner.

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:11.660
So this is the first time
that Banner has really gotten

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.730
involved in academic medicine.

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:16.950
And it's not like running
all of their other hospitals.

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:18.260
That's clear.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:23.810
Secondly, our physicians
and our staff--

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:25.790
there's a rigor.

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:30.170
And the world is changing
to focus on protocols

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:33.650
and, dare I say, artificial
intelligence and machine

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.950
learning algorithms.

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:39.080
And we've got to be
up to speed together

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.520
as we advance those technologies
to simply take care of patients

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.980
better and improve our outcomes.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:50.540
But at the same time, fulfill
our education and research

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.290
mission.

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:54.740
So there will be another
plan that we'll come back

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:59.750
to present to you which is the
combined Banner U of A health

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:01.820
sciences plan.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.890
I wanted to sneak
in a commercial.

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:06.410
Maybe I could do
it at the break.

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.870
They'll kill me for this, but
I don't know if any of you

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:13.370
have seen the advertisement
that U of A Banner

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:17.360
has that I saw when I was
watching the local Fox

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.880
affiliates and watching a
football game on Saturday.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.790
It's outstanding.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.950
And maybe I'll stimulate
you to go look it up.

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:27.900
So we'll have a plan
that we'll come back--

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:30.191
and I think it's really going
to be important-- that'll

01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:35.930
focus on what service lines,
what's the length of stay, how

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:38.720
we're doing on our
customer service,

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.570
patient service surveys.

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.900
How we're investing
the resources together

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.690
to get the hospitals profitable.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.990
When we started, it was about
a million dollars year deficit.

01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:54.920
And I hear we're down to
about $60 million a year,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.530
and maybe $20 million next
year, and break even the year

01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:58.460
after that.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.220
I'm very confident with the
team that we have in place

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.600
that we'll get there.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.430
And then we need to build out
the Phoenix Biomedical Campus.

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:11.600
Not only with our partner
institutions, but Banner's

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.500
flagship hospital is there.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.412
So you'll see a lot more
to come about what--

01:20:18.412 --> 01:20:21.200
one of the reasons, I
think, primary reasons

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.290
that to all hired me, was
to help focus on this.

01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:27.470
And at this point, I'm
excited about what's

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.020
in the strategic
plan, but equally

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.350
excited about what's going
to come in the future.

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:38.450
So this is a new
college initiative 2.5.

01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.540
It's very robust.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:44.060
And it calls for the
creation of a college of data

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.600
computing and network science.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.720
Anytime you start talking
about changing the curriculum

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:56.090
or starting new colleges,
the faculty and the deans

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:59.180
get very concerned,
and tell me I'm going

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.360
from preaching to meddling now.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.060
But I think that--

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.180
and of course, we've got to
go through all of the steps

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.920
to make this a reality--

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.980
but I really think
this is something

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.710
that if we're going
to be the land grant

01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:19.010
university for the fourth
Industrial Revolution,

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:20.930
it's my opinion
that establishing

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:24.110
a college like this, and
making it a college because

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:26.340
of the last bullet
point down there,

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.740
which is attracting students.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:31.280
And we could have all
of these activities

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.890
go on in all the colleges.

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:38.510
But I think to have it
in one central location,

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:45.950
so that these programs and
professors and students are

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:50.180
centralized, and are being
prepared for not only

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:52.430
our research activities.

01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:55.430
It's sort of the
idea of the center

01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:59.960
of a sunflower with petals
coming out of the center.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.740
Data computing, network
and quantum computing,

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.850
are going to be fundamental
platform technologies that will

01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:10.090
support the health sciences.

01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.770
A big part of this
is going to be

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:14.410
around artificial
intelligence, machine learning

01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:17.010
algorithms, quantum computing.

01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:19.600
And medicine is
moving very rapidly.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.160
Siemens, GE, Philips are
investing billions of dollars

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.470
in algorithms that will
help to interpret CT scans.

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:33.400
Pictures of
dermatological lesions.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.830
Pictures of histopathology.

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:38.170
Pap smears single cell cells.

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:39.040
Is this a cancer?

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:39.940
Yes, no.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.620
And the way that's
done is to compare

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.900
10 million normal pictures
or images to 10 million

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:51.310
with malignant melanoma, or
small cell cancer of the lung.

01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:53.800
I think this, along
with interacting

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.650
with our world-renowned
MIS program

01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.550
in Eller; with Shane
Burgess and all

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:03.940
of the incredible
opportunities in agriculture;

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:11.550
with our engineering
college; with humanities,

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:16.690
because of the opportunities
around digital humanities,

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:20.590
and using, as we heard this
morning, using technology

01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.630
to help students learn better.

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.790
No matter what discipline it is.

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:27.760
I think this is going
to be really important.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.460
And it brings together and
connects some of the things

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.040
that we have.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.430
SciVerse is a huge--

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:38.980
that came out of [? Cals. ?] I
think the signature program was

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.820
sequencing the rice genome.

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.670
It's now moved into
one of the largest data

01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:47.680
repositories in the world.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.600
Putting all these
assets together

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.290
I think is going to be an
important part in the evolution

01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.870
of the university.

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:58.030
Regent Myers.

01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:59.800
 Maybe using this
as an example.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.300
I mean, this is
all very exciting

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.890
that you're talking about.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:06.940
But when we leave
today, this wants

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:10.420
to accelerate, not slow down.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.060
And maybe using
this as an example,

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.580
how do you accelerate it?

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:17.890
How do you drive the
execution in a way

01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:20.560
that we're going to see
these things materialize

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.710
in the short term,
not the long term?

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:27.760
 At the end, I'll have
a slide about that.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:34.250
As I keep saying, this is
the end of the beginning.

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:36.400
The most important
part-- it's great to have

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.000
these great ideas.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.305
I love the idea of
being a futurist.

01:24:42.305 --> 01:24:44.680
Because the only thing you do
is just predict the future.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.030
You don't ever have
to make it happen.

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:51.340
And so the idea that we've
pulled this vision together.

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.550
And it's more than just the
slides and the four hours

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.390
that we have today.

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.980
It's all that's in
here, and even more.

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.010
It's the implementation phase.

01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:01.660
We've got to be
able to execute it.

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:06.050
We've got to have the
discipline to stay at this.

01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:08.930
And it's-- excuse me--
not going to be easy.

01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:10.490
It's going to be a lot of work.

01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:13.390
But we have to have processes,
and structure, and people,

01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:17.470
and resources in
place that will focus

01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:21.310
on the execution of each
one of these initiatives.

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:25.690
Not only executing the
strategy, but devising

01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:30.140
existing or new tactics to
help us to achieve those goals.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:34.930
But also metrics
to define success,

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.510
because you can't change
what you don't measure.

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:39.910
And then finally,
the resources that'll

01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:42.010
be needed to build on this.

01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:49.280
But as a trailer to the
end of the presentation,

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.880
we will come back
to you every quarter

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.430
and tell you,
initiative by initiative

01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:57.460
on those 90-plus
initiatives, where we are,

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.570
and give you an update.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.080
And you'll hold us accountable.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.510
It'll be transparent.

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.842
And we'll all be rowing
in the same direction.

01:26:03.842 --> 01:26:05.800
LARRY PENLEY: President
Robbins, perhaps you're

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.090
going to answer Rick Meyer's
question in the way you've just

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:10.880
described.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.600
But let me just phrase
it a different way.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.740
But also just say to you
before I ask the question

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:22.720
that all of us appreciate the
engagement that you've really

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.060
had with this strategic plan.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.220
You talked about
that at the beginning

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.780
with all of the constituents
that you've worked with.

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:33.910
But you have, as you
noted, engaged each of us

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:36.010
along the way in
the strategic plan.

01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:39.490
And I think that's
just really well done.

01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:42.220
I think as well, you've
presented something here

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:46.240
that has a multi-year process,
as you're pointing out,

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.750
associated with it.

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.720
It's not a strategic
plan for next year,

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.510
it's a strategic plan for the
longer run for the university.

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:56.060
And I think that's admirable.

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:56.992
But in the end--

01:26:56.992 --> 01:26:58.700
and this is the tough
part, and you and I

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.550
have talked about
this at times--

01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:03.010
all of us want you
to do something

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:06.820
in our area, whatever
that area is.

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.740
But in order to achieve this
plan, choices must be made.

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.690
Priorities must be set.

01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:16.900
Strategic imperatives for
this year and next year

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.670
must be selected.

01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:22.960
In some ways, what you've done
so far in the presentation

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.450
is to make it clear that
one of the imperatives

01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:27.440
is a reorganization.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.640
And that is this college that
you've just been talking about.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.020
And I applaud the college.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.600
I think it makes a
great deal of sense.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.670
Having come from the
academy, none of us

01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:38.920
like disruption
in organizations.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.420
We all like stability so that
we can teach our students

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.740
and do our research.

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.720
On the other hand, as
the environment changes,

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.320
the organization has to
change as well if it's

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.810
going to accomplish what
it needs to down the road

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:54.260
in the future.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.190
So this appears to be
one of those imperatives

01:27:57.190 --> 01:28:00.400
that you're choosing at
this particular point.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.010
In what you've done so
far, both in talking

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:06.430
about the kind of student
body you need to put together

01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:10.630
and in terms of the importance
of certain research areas

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:14.590
for this institution, what are
some of the other imperatives

01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:17.200
that you've identified
so far that really

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.840
must be done immediately?

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.750
 Well, I think we've come all
the way to the 11th hour here

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:29.200
to get this plan together,
And there's still

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.320
discussions and negotiations
going on, and thinking about.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.460
For instance, there's
a whole set of colleges

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:39.440
that we could establish.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.830
And I think I'm eagerly
awaiting a report

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:50.480
from an external review of our
Institute of the Environment.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.350
One of the individuals that
served on that committee

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:54.340
used to be here.

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.220
He was recruited to the
University of Washington

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.240
to establish a college for
environmental sciences,

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.380
for instance.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.720
Could we have the
discussion about creating

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.520
a college of
environmental sciences

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.780
here with students that go to
many different colleges now?

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.190
That's an example.

01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:19.150
So I think there are other
examples around what model

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:22.510
we're going to deliver
this new structured part

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:24.910
of general education.

01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:26.170
Should that be in a college?

01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:28.930
Should it be run
through a program?

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:34.550
Should we combine the college
of science, humanities,

01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:36.730
social and behavioral
science, and fine arts

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:42.496
into a mega college
of arts and sciences?

01:29:42.496 --> 01:29:43.870
These are all
questions that will

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:47.800
have to be answered in the
coming weeks to months.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:53.470
But I think that we'll have
those answers very shortly.

01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:57.430
Because when we start
deploying resources,

01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:59.960
that's when we'll
have the answer.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.920
And at the end, I'll
also get into where do we

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.150
get the resources from.

01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:06.460
How could we possibly
do this and how could we

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.690
fund this plan.

01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:10.210
So important, very
difficult questions.

01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:15.640
I think that certainly, if
we look to Arizona State,

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.480
President Crow has done an
incredible job of creating

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.210
new colleges and
moving people around.

01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:24.500
We have a different
culture here.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.340
So to be able to do
something like this

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.690
in this strong culture of shared
governance and the traditions

01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:33.780
that we have at
the University here

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:35.650
is going to take a lot of work.

01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:38.800
But I'm convinced that
this one in particular,

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.530
if we're building the
whole plan around the idea

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:43.960
that we're going to
be the land grant

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.350
institution for the fourth
Industrial Revolution.

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:51.520
I think back to, what were
Oxford and Cambridge thinking

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.780
about during the first
Industrial Revolution

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:58.960
when the Luddites were
breaking windows and breaking

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.610
weaving machines?

01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:01.820
What are we going to do?

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.860
How are we going to
prepare our students?

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.570
How are we going to organize
our research activities

01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:11.770
to be competitive in this
rapidly changing world?

01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:13.448
And I think this is
one way to do it.

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:17.170
 Just a quick question.

01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:21.160
I want to go back to the
OSIRIS-REx and the space topic.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:26.680
OSIRIS-REx is, no
question, a home run.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.260
But just like the
biomedical industry,

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:31.150
home runs in any of
these research areas

01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:32.740
are few and far between.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.837
So what are we doing,
if we want to remain

01:31:35.837 --> 01:31:37.420
number one in the
space industry, what

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:42.190
are we doing to maintain,
look at the next opportunity

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:47.250
for that $100 million
project grant?

01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:50.730
What do we need at the U
of A to maintain that level

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:54.520
of expertise and research?

01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:01.200
 Well, Dante brought me someone
who is a potential recruit

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:01.870
and hire.

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:05.130
And I don't say too much more
about it, but it would be--

01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:08.970
actually, there are two recruits
that we were talking about.

01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:14.700
We're already on to, for all of
those who are behind me who are

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.050
saying don't, don't.

01:32:16.050 --> 01:32:16.860
Stop saying it.

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.670
Stop right there.

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:21.030
But there's some big
projects on the horizon,

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:25.860
and there are some key recruits
that I think we can make here

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.150
that would make us competitive.

01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:34.620
The other thing is I think
that going forward, as I'll--

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.810
again, spoiler
alert for what I'm

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:40.560
going to talk about
in the next pillar--

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.540
is the opportunity to work with
NAU, and in particular, ASU

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.980
to come together.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:53.340
Because as I've said,
we're too small to be

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.000
competing with each other.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.570
We need to come together.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.230
It's a good thing for the state.

01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:01.770
We're part of the same
enterprise with this governing

01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:04.230
board overseeing us.

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:09.000
And we have an opportunity to
come together with our sister

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.280
institutions to be very,
not only competitive,

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.660
but I think lead the world
in space exploration, space

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.930
science technologies, and
in particular the business

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.100
of space.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.800
So I think those are
some of the things.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:32.340
But the other thing is to have
a presence on the ground in DC.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.670
We've moved one of our
incredible individuals

01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:39.540
who've worked into the
Office of Research here.

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:44.250
Had them moved back to
DC to be close to NASA,

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:49.080
because he he's
an expert at NASA.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.970
And he'd moved here.

01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:52.710
We wanted to deploy
him back there

01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:56.910
so we have someone on the
ground interacting with NASA.

01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:59.070
We need someone on the
ground there working

01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:02.350
with the NIH, the NSF,
and other agencies,

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:05.640
so we know what
these opportunities

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.030
are as they come down the
road, and be prepared for them.

01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:14.910
I think for a $100 million
grant for the next things

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:17.160
that we know are
coming, we need to start

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.400
making investments a million
dollars to put together

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.460
teams that will help do
grant planning submission.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.700
Getting all of our CVs together.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.540
Pulling all of our preliminary
research data together.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.300
The things that the three of
us have published together,

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.990
and make a compelling
argument about why

01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:42.960
we're the place that should
be awarded that contract

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:44.040
and do that work.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.270
Because the agency
has to have confidence

01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:50.112
that they're making
a good investment.

01:34:50.112 --> 01:34:51.570
Those are the kind
of things that I

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:58.590
think are going to help us
maintain our position in space.

01:34:58.590 --> 01:35:01.170
Also, having the
telescopes and being

01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:03.960
able to continue to have the
great weather that we have,

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.750
which I don't think is
going to change too much.

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:09.580
We've already got the
infrastructure here.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.500
So having all those assets, but
aligning them and coordinating

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.970
them is going to be really key.

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:18.740
So I've got a
couple more slides.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:24.230
And then I just wanted
to show validation.

01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:27.380
We thought we were going to
be the first out of the chute

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.250
to say, this is such
an important area.

01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:34.790
If you go back to the fourth
Industrial Revolution book,

01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:38.270
all the stuff that's in there
are a part of this college.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:41.240
But of course, we got scooped
by MIT a few weeks ago,

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.030
where they announced their big
college or program, school,

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:49.550
with a billion dollar backing.

01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:51.830
So I don't think we're going
to have a billion dollars

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.450
to invest in this new college.

01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:56.880
But certainly, we're
in good company

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.790
as being in the leaders in
this area around how we're

01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:06.380
going to change the way we
educate the next generation

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.630
of students and do research.

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.430
Additionally, Berkeley
and Boston University

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.280
are onto this.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.640
And the University of
Pittsburgh has a school

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.970
that was developed by one
of our former professors

01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:22.300
who's now the dean
of that school.

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:25.490
And just like the
environment school

01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:28.970
that I talked about earlier,
a college, one of our people

01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:31.340
left to go to Washington
to start that college.

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.020
Be the founding dean.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.230
We had another person who
worked in the environment

01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:39.290
be recruited away from
the University of Michigan

01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:42.750
to start an environmental
program there.

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:45.650
So I think that we're
onto the right thing.

01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:49.070
And it certainly
fits with the theme

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:51.800
around the fourth
Industrial Revolution.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.760
Importantly, this
idea came together,

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.870
and President Aoun in
his Robot-Proof book

01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:01.430
coined the term humanics.

01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:04.310
And I like that, because
it's the intersection.

01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:08.270
And this fourth
Industrial Revolution talk

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:11.410
seems very stemish.

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:13.910
I would put an a in there and
say we're all about steam,

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:15.530
because the arts
are so important,

01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.990
and they're going to
permeate almost everything we

01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:19.580
do across this plan.

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:24.950
But the humanities,
we've already

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:27.200
talked about the
incredible importance

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.660
of general education.

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.860
And that's delivered
through the humanities.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:37.250
And we've got
incredible programs

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:45.330
in writing, and philosophy, in
political science and policy.

01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:49.070
And the idea of
bringing together

01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:53.390
the physical, biological,
and digital sciences,

01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:56.070
and what impact that's
going to have on society.

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.750
If you look in the fine print
of Professor Klaus's book,

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:02.790
he talks about the
good and the bad that

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:09.830
are going to happen with this
very rapid change in technology

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:12.140
and revolution that's going on.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.730
I mean, we were
talking earlier about,

01:38:13.730 --> 01:38:15.720
everybody has to
look at their thing.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.700
Did you see that?

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.957
I'm just checking my phone
thinking that I was just--

01:38:18.957 --> 01:38:20.540
no, I wasn't really
checking my phone.

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:23.660
But everybody is so
tied to these things.

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.720
And I think it's impaired
our cognitive ability

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.260
to remember things.

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.530
And it's certainly
changed interactions

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:34.010
of people having meaningful
conversations and debate,

01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:36.780
and relationships.

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:42.410
So how do we weave that
part into this very techie

01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:45.270
fourth Industrial
Revolution conversation?

01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:48.500
Well, I think there are plenty
of examples and opportunities

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.970
for us to explore the intended
and unintended consequences

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:56.360
of this rapidly changing
world on society.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.360
The moral issues, the ethics.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.810
I mean, now, you can
send one discrete thing

01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:06.500
to one person in the world,
and everybody in the world

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.470
at the same time on Instagram,
or whatever platform

01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:10.620
you want to use.

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.750
So there are consequences.

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:14.840
And I think it's an
opportunity for us

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.450
to not only educate
our students,

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:20.120
but to also do discovery
and scholarship

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.380
around the intersection between
the humanities and science.

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:26.380
And then at the
bottom, of course,

01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:29.120
there is the whole
idea of digital health

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:33.650
that I touched on earlier around
using artificial intelligence

01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:36.710
and machine learning
algorithms to actually help

01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:38.390
to take care of patients.

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:42.440
And not to replace
pathologists and radiologists,

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.990
but to help them to do
their job better and take

01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:47.090
care of patients better.

01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:50.510
So this is just a video that
shows two new buildings that we

01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:52.910
discussed at the committee.

01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:57.050
The first one is the Applied
Science Research Building,

01:39:57.050 --> 01:40:00.440
where we'll do a lot of this
work that's translational--

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.270
translating
fundamental discovery

01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:07.400
into commercializable products,
fulfilling one of our land

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.740
grant missions around
economic development,

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.050
because we'll spin
companies out.

01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:17.950
And we've also invested
in establish UARC, which

01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:23.080
is a ability for us,
and have a program where

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.960
we can get top secret
contracts from the government.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.330
We didn't have that ability
until we established UARC.

01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:35.740
And that program will be
located in this applied research

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.350
building with skiffs for
conversations that can only

01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:47.140
be had if you have these very
high level, top level secret

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.330
security clearances.

01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:52.960
And then, as we fly
across Speedway,

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.280
south of Speedway, in the
parking lot of the Optical

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.490
Science Building.

01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:01.060
And for all of you who park
there for the basketball games,

01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.530
just come see me.

01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:03.880
I'll help you out.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.050
But we're going to have a Grand
Challenges Building so that we

01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:12.310
can do some of the work
around the College of Digital

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:16.330
Network and Computer
Science around having

01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:20.230
fundamental discoveries
of bringing engineering

01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:24.490
and optical science and
astronomy and health together

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:27.850
to make some of these
fundamental discoveries.

01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:29.890
So this will be the
Grand Challenge Building.

01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:32.560
It's envisioned to
be about 10 stories.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.960
Will house all of
the things that

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.470
are in the strategic plan
around the research objectives.

01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:41.980
And then the Applied
Science Building right next

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.110
to the aeronautical engineering.

01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:47.140
Just north of Speedway,
and just southwest

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.110
of the Health Science Campus.

01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:53.650
So we've got 20 more
minutes of questions

01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:55.497
before we're
scheduled for a break.

01:41:55.497 --> 01:41:57.080
RON SHOOPMAN: Oh,
the break is up now.

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.202
 Oh, it's now.

01:41:58.202 --> 01:41:59.160
BOARD MEMBER: It's now?

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.050
 I'm behind.

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.850
I'm way behind.

01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:01.992
[LAUGHTER]

01:42:01.992 --> 01:42:03.450
LARRY PENLEY: You're
right on that.

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.140
 We have more
time for questions.

01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:07.380
Or we can shorten the break.

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.850
 Well, let's take questions,
and see how long that takes.

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.470
Questions, comments
from the regents.

01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:21.170
You know, I think you've done
an extraordinary job of bringing

01:42:21.170 --> 01:42:23.090
us along in this process.

01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:25.340
The time we spent
individually and collectively

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:30.290
with you has really prepared
us to hear what you're saying.

01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:34.520
I found it to be extraordinarily
inspirational for me, because I

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:37.250
think we may not know
the how just yet,

01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:41.070
but I see this as a living plan
that will take shape over time,

01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:47.360
as your entire team grapples
with just how we execute this.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.890
The fact that you brought
thousands of your university

01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:55.880
faculty and the rest of the
team here together to have input

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.640
into this is really important.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.760
Because as a leader, you
can't execute it alone.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.430
It'll be executed by everybody
in this room, and everybody

01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:07.100
watching university-wide.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.930
And I think it's very exciting.

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:14.540
I commend you for the reach.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.490
It's a tall order.

01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:20.660
What you outlined
there is really

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.150
the old big, hairy,
audacious goal.

01:43:23.150 --> 01:43:25.710
It's a BHAG, to say the least.

01:43:25.710 --> 01:43:28.520
And I think that if
we can execute it,

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.530
it will separate
and identify U of A

01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:32.970
as a leader in the
world in this area.

01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:34.340
So my congratulations to you.

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.320
 Well I appreciate
all your support.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.060
But if you thought
that part was good,

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.300
come back after the break.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:42.080
We've got really good stuff
later after the break.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:42.980
And I know why.

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.080
I'm watching how
long it's taking.

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.580
We got started late.

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:50.180
RON SHOOPMAN: Yes No,
you did a fine job.

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.840
Any other questions or comments?

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.924
Regent Heiler, please.

01:43:53.924 --> 01:43:56.090
JAY HEILER: Dr. Robbins,
don't worry about the time.

01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.990
It's not dragging.

01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.430
It's very engaging.

01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:04.430
And we appreciate it, and it
is an impressive compilation

01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:05.550
up to this point.

01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:09.710
One specific question that
I'd like you to address.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:14.060
In your thinking about
advancing the student experience

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.410
and the undergraduate
offering at the university,

01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:22.040
at the same time, you're
going to reestablish it

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.320
as a leading
research institution

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:27.860
and take the research
budget up to $800 million.

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.470
What is your
construct for how you

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:34.240
intend to pursue both those
things at the same time, when

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.170
in the traditional
paradigms, they're thought

01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:38.820
to be at odds with one another?

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:42.016
So what is your thinking
about that as you go forward?

01:44:42.016 --> 01:44:43.640
 Well I don't think
it's an either/or.

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.360
I think these are two
fundamental missions

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.240
that we have.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.950
And as we were talking about,
President Crow was talking

01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:54.470
about, it's not either/or.

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:55.610
It's both/and.

01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:56.180
Yes.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.440
We're going to get to yes.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.060
We're going to do both of these.

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.830
They're both
critically important.

01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:04.130
And as we shared
with you yesterday,

01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:07.430
there'll be a process that
we'll go through to triage

01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:11.780
and prioritize different
initiatives from different

01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:12.530
of the pillars.

01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:15.860
And some of which,
we've already started.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.160
The others are low risk,
high impact investments

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.960
that we can make
immediately, and we

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.690
have some funds
that are set aside

01:45:23.690 --> 01:45:28.530
for strategically starting to
invest in those projects now.

01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:30.740
The next level and
the next tranche

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:36.260
will be really dependent on
how we can reallocate resources

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:39.950
that are currently being
deployed across the university.

01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:42.860
And we're going to have to
have a discussion around RCM

01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:45.830
and any modifications
that could be

01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:49.020
made to that budgetary process.

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.160
And then finally,
there are many things

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.330
in this plan that are going
to be revenue-positive for us,

01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:59.450
and give us new resources
to invest in programs that

01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:04.030
will help our students be
successful, or do research

01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:08.330
and give us an advantage
to get the discoveries made

01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:10.670
better and faster.

01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:13.555
But one of the key parts
of this, of course,

01:46:13.555 --> 01:46:14.930
will be one of
the things that we

01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:17.810
talked about even in
the interview process,

01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:19.910
is a fundraising campaign.

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:23.390
And we raised more
money last year

01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:27.140
than any other single year in
the history of the university.

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.595
Over $300 million.

01:46:28.595 --> 01:46:32.930
And JP Roczniak and his
team, and the deans,

01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:38.570
and people who have spent
years developing relationships

01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:42.770
and presenting inspiring
opportunities for investment

01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:46.820
from donors are to
be congratulated

01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:49.050
for that accomplishment.

01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.630
We're going to have
to do better than

01:46:50.630 --> 01:46:53.390
that every year for
this next campaign

01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:57.600
to be able to have the
resources to fund this plan.

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.480
But it'll be a combination
of all of those.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:05.040
And we'll have discussions
from the senior leaders,

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.330
the deans, and the
implementation team about how

01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:15.860
we pick and choose in a timely
and efficient and smart way

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:22.340
which initiatives that we
will deploy assets to as time

01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.160
goes on.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.730
But we intend to get
to all 90 of the things

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:27.080
that we've talked about.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.450
Now, there's even
an initiative--

01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:30.770
forgotten what number it is.

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:32.340
I was going to memorize it.

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.130
There is an initiative
for new initiatives

01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:38.090
so that this plan can
continue to be organic,

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:40.640
and flexible, and interactive.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:44.180
If there are people who
come to the university,

01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.920
or people who have not been
as involved as they thought,

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.350
if you have a new idea, then you
can come to the implementation

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:53.610
group and pitch this idea.

01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:59.630
And maybe we won't do a couple
of the other initiatives,

01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:03.350
but some of these
new initiatives.

01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:06.080
RON SHOOPMAN: Other comments
or questions before the break.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.270
Regent Taylor Robson.

01:48:08.814 --> 01:48:10.730
KARRIN TAYLOR ROBSON:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:12.710
I just want to add
to your comment

01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:15.440
about the success of
this strategic plan

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:20.150
really stemming from President
Robbins' engagement of so

01:48:20.150 --> 01:48:21.680
many people, the
thousands of people

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.720
here at the
university community.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.800
But also this board.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.990
Not only this board as a
whole, but each one of us

01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:30.830
individually have been asked
to engage and have engaged.

01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:33.980
And I think that
will go a long way

01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:37.719
to a successful
implementation of the plan.

01:48:37.719 --> 01:48:39.260
At the end of the
day, people support

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.150
what they help to create.

01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:44.630
And so you certainly are
off on the right foot.

01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:46.880
The other thing--
teams of people

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.270
that are engaged in this,
they seek leadership,

01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:51.680
and they respond to leadership.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.500
And your leadership in
this is really palpable.

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:57.560
And the clarity that you
in this plan are providing

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.810
will be very helpful
as you move forward

01:48:59.810 --> 01:49:02.030
for the implementation of it.

01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.900
And the metrics.

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.340
Metrics are obviously
very important.

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.140
It's the benchmark from which
this board will watch you

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.900
as you implement this,
and as you succeed,

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.970
as undoubtedly you will.

01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:15.410
So congratulations.

01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:18.920
I'll have more to say after
your next few pillars,

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.240
but I think you're
off to a great start.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.680
So thank you.

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.180
 Thank you.

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.630
And, we listen.

01:49:26.630 --> 01:49:30.195
We've listened to each
and every one of you.

01:49:30.195 --> 01:49:33.680
Regent Manson, the last
time we met with her,

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.500
she said, you know,
I mentioned to you

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:40.130
before that there's
nothing about the new vet

01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:41.360
school in here.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.040
And I see that
there's still not.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.630
And I think now
there's something

01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:45.838
in here about the vet school.

01:49:45.838 --> 01:49:47.940
Because we're all
excited about that.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.090
It's just that we're going--

01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:53.000
there's so many things
moving very rapidly.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.940
And obviously, it's a
big part of the plan.

01:49:55.940 --> 01:50:00.830
But I think people around
campus, when we've asked them,

01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:05.780
first of all, they sometimes
have issues with what's in

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.520
or what's not in the plan.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.340
And we said instead
of, well, get in line,

01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:13.580
or send us something, come
in and let's talk about it.

01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:17.960
And hours and hours and hours of
discussions and deliberations.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.240
And many of the things
have been changed.

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.770
And I think probably the
biggest changes have been

01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:26.540
when we listen to students.

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:28.790
And there's no perfect plan.

01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:33.530
And this obviously will continue
to evolve and get better.

01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:36.140
But having the students
involved and telling us,

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:38.840
if we're going to
be student-centric

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.440
for this university, we need
to know what the students want,

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.670
and what they need.

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:47.120
And to help them be successful
one student at a time.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.360
RON SHOOPMAN: Regent Meyers.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.170
 Yeah.

01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:53.180
You know, I appreciate one of
the underpinning principles

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:54.920
of this is leveraging place.

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:59.420
And I've often felt that
one of the important aspects

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.790
of the place we live
is our military.

01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:05.630
And we have a great asset of
the Army down in Fort Huachuca

01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:08.240
down in Sierra Vista,
with their major focus

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.370
on intelligence operations.

01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:12.260
And as I look at this
new school of data,

01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:15.020
I like seeing the
word cybersecurity.

01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.810
I mean, it's not all
about fighting wars,

01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:19.440
but it's preventing wars.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.620
And I think there's so
much U of A could do.

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:24.530
And I think it's maybe been
an under-realized opportunity

01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:28.410
to work with the military,
and to help our place,

01:51:28.410 --> 01:51:31.370
but also do research in
fundamental areas that

01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:35.191
will help protect our nation
and prevent war in the world.

01:51:35.191 --> 01:51:35.690
 Yeah.

01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:42.560
And, I've had the opportunity
to go to U of A Sierra Vista,

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.260
and see our cybersecurity
program there

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:50.710
and what Jason Dunham
has done there.

01:51:50.710 --> 01:51:54.050
I think it's going
to be a critical part

01:51:54.050 --> 01:52:00.190
of this new college, If
we can get it executed.

01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:02.000
And people like Jason.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.600
We just recognized him at
the last football game.

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.980
He's clearly one of the
leaders in education

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.430
around cybersecurity.

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:15.900
And it's because he worked so
closely with the Fort there.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.640
So we've got a lot
of opportunity.

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.310
And I think that
times are exciting.

01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:26.390
The world is changing very
rapidly, as I keep saying.

01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:31.130
But the idea that you
can pay your income

01:52:31.130 --> 01:52:35.970
tax in Arizona using
bitcoin or cryptocurrency.

01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:37.820
I mean, who knew?

01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:40.250
This is a very
progressive state.

01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:44.660
I think it's a pioneering
entrepreneurial state.

01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.390
I keep saying, I spent time
in California and Texas.

01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:51.620
And this is sort of the
perfect blend and perfect place

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.130
to be a leader.

01:52:54.130 --> 01:52:56.870
Certainly around
higher education

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:59.430
and economic development
for the state,

01:52:59.430 --> 01:53:01.874
particularly around
health sciences and space.

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:10.760
 I was very impressed with what
you told us, I think, probably

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.090
even in committee meetings,
that just because one

01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:16.340
of the great programs at
the University of Arizona

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.210
didn't make the plan in terms
of what's being presented today

01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:22.850
doesn't diminish its importance.

01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:25.610
Getting everybody
involved and recognizing

01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:29.210
that all of these folks,
regardless of whether they're

01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:31.670
listed on the plan or
not, are key to the future

01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:33.230
of the University of Arizona.

01:53:33.230 --> 01:53:35.780
This will take leadership
at every level.

01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:37.430
It can't be done by this board.

01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:41.900
For certain, we will approve
it, and support it, and do

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.320
what we can to make it happen.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.580
But it will really be the
team under your leadership

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:47.874
that gets it done.

01:53:47.874 --> 01:53:49.790
And I think you're off
to a great start of not

01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:52.880
making people feel like
they're a loser in the plan.

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.940
Because your emphasis that
we're building on the success

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:59.450
that we have rather
than deciding

01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:01.920
who's a loser in the plan.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.590
We'll win going
forward together,

01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:06.550
is a very important
message for your team.

01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:07.670
 Yeah, I appreciate that.

01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:10.490
And the one thing
I keep saying is,

01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:16.320
if you can't find yourself being
excited about student success,

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.290
you're in the wrong place.

01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:20.990
So that's the most
important part of this plan,

01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:25.340
and my opinion, is
getting the resources

01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:28.250
and developing the programs,
and just changing the culture

01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:33.830
and the mindset of service.

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:37.040
I heard Paul talk this
morning at the breakfast,

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.210
and he said exactly what
I've always thought.

01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:45.530
When you use to go in these
classes in medical schools.

01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:47.460
Look to your right
and look to your left.

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:48.918
There's only going
to be one of you

01:54:48.918 --> 01:54:50.240
left at the end of this course.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.160
And Paul said what
I've always thought,

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.840
which comes from the
Positive Coaching Alliance.

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.060
If any one of my
students fail, it's

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:03.860
my fault. It's not their fault.
I didn't do a good enough job

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.960
to help them be successful.

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.680
I think that cultural
shift in our mentality

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.270
across this campus could help us
to be really transformational.

01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:17.990
For no matter who the student
is, where they come from,

01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:23.270
once they're part of our family,
we're their surrogate family,

01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:25.430
it's our job to help
them be successful,

01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:28.460
no matter what we have
to do to help them.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.220
Now we've got finite resources
and limited resources.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:37.280
But I think just having
that mind shift, the idea.

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.890
I've always said about the
Ritz Carlton, it's their job.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:45.390
If you stop anybody in
a Ritz Carlton and say,

01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:48.110
can you tell me how to
get to this place or that?

01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:50.460
It's their job to help you.

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.590
And I think that that's part of
what this cultural shift will

01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:58.400
be here I was incredibly
impressed by-- there were

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.060
seven deans from law schools
across the country who

01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:07.280
came and gave me a report, a
remarkable report on what Dean

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:10.130
Miller and his colleagues
at the law school are doing.

01:56:10.130 --> 01:56:15.052
And at a time when people were
challenging me when I got here.

01:56:15.052 --> 01:56:16.760
So are you going to
close the law school?

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.920
Because you know
law schools are--

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.490
with all due respect, Regent
Ridenour-- law schools

01:56:21.490 --> 01:56:23.360
are a thing of the
past, and all that.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.151
Well of course we're
not going to close it.

01:56:25.151 --> 01:56:29.130
So it gave me incredible hope
about the future of our law

01:56:29.130 --> 01:56:29.630
school.

01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:32.600
But the thing that I
was most impressed about

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:38.330
is that the students really
had no real negative comments

01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:40.160
about the college in things.

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.000
And pointed out that even
the custodial staff would

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.940
stop and ask the students,
how are you doing today?

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.050
Is it going all right?

01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.950
How can I help you?

01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:50.390
We're pulling for you.

01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:52.640
That kind of pride.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:55.520
And I think that's why a lot of
people stay at the university.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.860
They could make more
money other places,

01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:00.740
but they want to be
part of something that's

01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.730
bigger than themselves.

01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:06.020
And the thing that
helps us to achieve

01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:11.570
that is if for our students
go out and be successful.

01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:14.090
If our research
projects succeed,

01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:17.600
and we discover new knowledge,
and we come up with a new drug

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.000
to treat cancer
better, whatever it is.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.010
That's the kind of spirit
I think that this plan has

01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:28.151
the opportunity to achieve.

01:57:28.151 --> 01:57:29.930
 Along those great
words, I think

01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:32.510
it's appropriate to
end this first session.

01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:34.520
If you are ready to do
that, Mr. President.

01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:35.030
ROBERT ROBBINS: I'm ready.

01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.810
Yes, sure.

01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:40.760
 We have some lunch for
regents in the next 25 minutes.

01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:41.810
Or 20 minutes or so.

01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:46.250
Let's try to be back to
start right on time at 11:30.

01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:48.830
Thank you for your attention
for the wonderful presentation.

01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:51.650
We'll continue
here in 20 minutes.

01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:53.410
Thank you.
