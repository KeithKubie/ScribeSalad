00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.004
- Salam, I'm Jamsheed
Al-Jamsheedi and this

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.205
is a Mideast Minute.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:09.042
(orchestra music)

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.112
Villagers, thank you as
always for tuning in from

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.380
the Middle East today

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.850
as we broadcast to you
live from Springfield,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.519
the hometown of a
number of peacekeepers.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.353
In a recent interview,
Donald Trump suggested that

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.356
his son-in-law, Jared Kushner,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.626
could play a pivotal role in
Middle Eastern peace talks,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:29.929
leading many to accuse
Mr Trump of nepotism.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.797
Which means it's time for
us to put Jared Kushner's

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:34.401
political future in context.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.202
(dramatic music)

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.072
Villagers, Jared Kushner is not
the beneficiary of nepotism.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.742
According to the Oxford
Dictionary, nepotism
is the practice

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:46.078
among those with power or
influence of favoring relatives.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:48.881
And no-one in a position
of power or influence

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.751
is favoring Kushner
because he's a relative.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.152
Especially not Trump.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.754
He's a ruthless business man.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:57.556
He puts America
first, not family.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.059
Just listen to
Esquire's Vicky Ward.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.396
- The Trumps are a
hermetically sealed unit.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.065
It's family before anything,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.300
or anyone else.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.235
- Yes, exactly.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.638
He puts family before
anything or anyone else,

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.574
but only because
they're qualified.

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.910
Prior to joining Trump's
political campaign,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.647
Jared Kushner ran a
billion-dollar business.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.914
And that's not just
the kind of thing

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.116
your family hands to you.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.952
Here's Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.587
- [Andrea] Jared took over his
family's real estate business

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:32.458
when his father, Charles
Kushner, went to prison in 2005.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:33.292
- Yes.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:34.793
Exactly.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.763
His family handed that to him.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.531
But only because
Kushner was qualified.

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:41.134
He attended Harvard University,

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.802
one of the hardest schools
to get an admission to,

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.503
on the planet.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:48.341
And it's not as if anyone just
handed his admission to him.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.277
Here's NPR reporting on
a book by Daniel Golden.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.345
- [Narrator] Charles Kushner
gave to charities, hospitals

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.514
and universities,
including Harvard,

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.782
which admitted Jared Kushner

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.819
after a 2.5 million dollar gift.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:00.653
- Yes.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.788
Exactly.

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.624
His family just
handed that to him.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.192
But that doesn't mean
that he's unqualified

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:09.462
to broker peace between
Israel and Palestine.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.533
Quite the opposite, he's
immensely qualified, okay.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.001
And as Lawrence O'Donnell
reports for MSNBC,

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.304
Trump himself has outlined why.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.472
- He said quote, Jared's
a very smart guy.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:24.410
He's a quality person and I
think he can be very helpful.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.245
- Exactly.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.214
He's very smart.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.317
So.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.156
Get ready for peace.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.326
I'm Jamsheed
Al-Jamsheedi and this

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.495
has been a Mideast Minute.
