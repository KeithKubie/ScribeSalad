00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.090
Fishing with dynamite, or blast fishing as
it’s more accurately known, despite sounding

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.790
like something more suited to a Looney Tunes
cartoon, is a genuine and well-documented

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.380
practice that is still commonplace in select
areas of the globe today.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.080
This is more than a little unfortunate for
the many fish and marine animals that call

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.620
the oceans and lakes their home due to the
invariably cataclysmic impact the practice

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.570
has on local aquatic ecosystems.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.660
Exactly when blast fishing first began is
hard to pinpoint, but it should come as no

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.980
surprise that it seems to have become popular
within decades of dynamite being invented

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.390
in 1867 (incidentally invented by Alfred Nobel,
known today for the Nobel Prizes, but in his

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510
time as “the merchant of death”).

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.750
While someone probably fished using improvised
or homemade explosives prior to the invention

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.080
of dynamite, the creation of a commercially
available, relatively safe to handle and inexpensive

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.439
explosive made it an option for the wider
public.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.939
As for the first documented references to
this method of fishing, while it is certain

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.531
that there were many earlier instances, the
first we could find was an 1894 reference

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:26.290
to a man being arrested for the crime of blast
fishing, as reported in the New York Democratic

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.700
Herald:

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.750
John Tickwich was arrested at Binnewater for
destroying fish in one of the Binnewater lakes

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.750
with dynamite.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.780
He had just exploded a number of cartridges,
killing several hundred fish, and was gathering

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.250
them into his boat when arrested.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.520
The prisoner will be taken before the State
Game Protectors of Albany.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.860
Five years is the penalty for the crime.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.810
Another early reference to blast fishing likewise
comes from it being banned, this time in Hong

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.810
Kong.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.460
In 1898, the government asked fishermen to
stop blast fishing and that the fisherman

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.229
police themselves over the matter.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.430
The governor also issued the following statement
to fishermen: “The practice of fishing by

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.400
means of dynamite is unnecessarily destructive
and contrary to the spirit of true sport.”

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.010
As you might imagine, little seems to have
changed as a result of this request, so the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.280
government stepped up their game on the issue,
officially outlawing blast fishing in Hong

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.450
Kong in 1903.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.100
Despite the governments of the world seemingly
realising blast fishing was a bad idea pretty

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.900
much right from the start, this method of
fishing’s popularity quite literally exploded

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.819
throughout the world thanks to WW1 and WW2.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.560
Soldiers from both sides of each conflict
made extensive use of explosives in fishing

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.219
while stationed in foreign countries, a practice
locals took notice of and copied.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.779
As an example of this, Japanese soldiers stationed
in the Pacific during World War 2 are noted

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.829
to have given out hand grenades to locals
to be used for fishing.

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.129
In return, the locals were required to share
the fish they’d catch with the soldiers.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.730
As a result of this, many Pacific islanders
became incredibly adept in the handling of

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.730
various explosive devices.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.999
This is knowledge they put to use after the
war, taking advantage of the numerous explosives

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.159
left behind to construct their own makeshift
fishing bombs.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.889
For instance, on the small island nation of
Palau, even as late as the 1960s, huts could

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.609
be found containing large caches of undetonated
WW2 explosives, with the compounds within

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.180
the devices, or the devices themselves, slated
to be later used for fishing.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.439
As the availability of unused munitions from
World War 2 dwindled, the islanders began

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.769
to use more commercially available explosives
or, more often for small time fishermen, simply

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.970
constructed their own using readily available
materials.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260
For instance, former blast fisherman Abdul
Karim Laing noted that all one needs is a

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.069
bit of fertilizer, gasoline, matchsticks,
and a beer bottle to make a very effective

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.669
explosive for fishing with.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.709
But as you might imagine, such home-made bombs
can be very dangerous and fishing in this

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.689
way tends to make the practice not only devastating
for marine life, but occasionally for the

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.870
humans doing the fishing as well.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.949
fishermanFor instance Mwanya Sleiman, a former
blast fisherman in Tanzania who has since

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.349
become a staunch opponent of the practice,
accidentally blew off both of his hands when

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.400
a home-made explosive detonated when he was
trying to light the fuse.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.140
As for why he used to fish this way, he noted,
“My motivation was just the money I got

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.310
from selling the fish but I didn’t know
about the impact it would have on me or the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.780
underwater environment.”

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.540
Speaking of Tanzania, blast fishing is outlawed
there due to it not only negatively impacting

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.730
tourism, but also because they’ve seen a
drastic decline in fish stock as a result.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.120
As one Tanzanian fisherman lamented,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.050
Blast fishing destroys the fish habitats under
water where fish reproduce and that has had

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.030
a big impact, especially on us who use ring
nets to fish…

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.540
The number of fish has drastically reduced
we are not able to catch many fish like before…

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.200
He also stated that reporting blast fishing
did little good in the region because “When

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.130
[the blast fishermen] are arrested, they bribe
and come back, and if they find out that you

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.410
reported them they mark you and threaten to
hurl explosives on your boat, so sometimes

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.850
we are scared to report them.”

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.400
Speaking of this, while blast fishing is technically
outlawed by most countries of the world, it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.220
remains incredibly popular in places such
as the Philippines, Indonesia and coastal

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.690
African nations both due to the general apathy
of local law enforcement and how much easier

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.070
it is in the short term to get a big catch
this way.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.160
The latter point is, of course, the key reason
blast fishing is considered so difficult to

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.190
stamp out.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.560
When a fisherman can acquire what would otherwise
be his entire daily quota of fish using more

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.230
traditional netting methods in a few minutes
by hucking a few well-placed, extremely inexpensive

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.570
explosive devices into the ocean, there’s
little incentive for many of them to do it

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.580
the hard way.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.930
We can scoff at the shortsightedness of these
individuals, but it’s important to note

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.380
that many are completely ignorant of the long
term damage they’re doing to the fisheries

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.430
they depend on.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.000
And even for those who know, they have families
to feed, often with few resources to do it,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.680
and may not be overly concerned about what
will happen years down the line if they continue

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.200
blast fishing.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.790
So what’s the problem with blast fishing?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.540
To begin with, as alluded to previously, there
is the danger posed to the fishermen (often

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.530
using home-made explosives) and potential
swimmers and scuba divers (particularly a

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.210
problem in touristy coastal areas).

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.940
Another big problem is the efficiency of this
method of fishing.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.940
Blast fishing works by bursting the air bladders
and sometimes other organs of the fish in

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.260
the immediate area.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.320
The result is that some of the fish float
to the surface to be collected.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.310
However, it’s estimated that approximately
ten times that amount go the other way and

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.010
sink to the bottom as a result of the ruptured
air bladders.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.430
Beyond this all being incredibly inefficient,
it should also be noted that according to

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.090
one fish trader in Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam
fish market, she tries to stay away from blast

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.240
fishing caught fish, because she claims the
fish caught in this way “rot very fast – by

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.300
the time you get home they are rotten.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.330
Some buyers and sellers don’t know that
so they buy them.”

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.740
But these aren’t the biggest problems with
blast fishing.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.360
For that, we have to look at what the blasting
does to the ecosystem of a relatively large

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.980
area around the explosion.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.040
Explosives are, by their very nature, somewhat
imprecise in their targeting, making the act

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.910
of fishing with them unsustainable as they
will invariably destroy countless other marine

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.130
creatures besides the fish, as well as their
underlying habitats like coral reefs.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.660
Most critical for the fishermen, this ultimately
destroys the habitat for the fish themselves.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.690
This means the fish that survive in the area
now have fewer resources to live on, and in

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.810
many cases their normal breeding grounds are
destroyed, further reducing the fish population

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.270
beyond what the initial blast does.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.730
Unsurprisingly from this, as with Tanzania,
areas where blast fishing is prevalent tend

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.610
to see a rapid decline in fish stock.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.410
Nevertheless, blast fishing remains a problem
in some regions, even where authorities have

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.330
made a concerted effort to crack down on it.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.180
That said, perhaps the cleverest way to stop
blast fishermen we could find was implemented

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.750
in the Philippines where authorities dropped
statuettes of the Virgin Mary underwater across

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.150
the country’s coastline and announced it
to the public.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.300
This cut instances of blast fishing almost
overnight as many fisherman from the predominantly

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:27.030
Catholic region didn’t dare risk harming
an image of one of the most revered figures

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:51.889
of 

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:54.410
their faith.
