00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.590
HEY NO TOUCHY, science says I’m allowed
to have a stuffed animal.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.220
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.599
Most of us had a thing growing up, a teddy
bear or maybe a baby blanket.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.140
Something we held on to while we slept or
were scared.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.340
But why do we love these inanimate things?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.810
Science shows us why we place so much meaning
in objects.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.230
Psychologist Donald Winnicott who was a prominent
member of the British Independent Group of

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.230
the British Psychoanalytical Society, introduced
the idea of a transitional object.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.779
That these things help us transition in some
way.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.700
They ease the separation between mother and
child.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.820
Babies don’t see themselves as independent,
they believe they are one and the same as

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.820
their mother.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.100
As the mother starts to separate this causes
anxiety in a child.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.310
A bear or blanket helps them self soothe,
“I can’t have my mom right now, but I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.310
have this, this helps.”

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.289
Or maybe these objects help us transition
from sleeping with our parents to sleeping

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.289
alone.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.289
This theory has some evidence.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.149
For instance, more kids tend to have attachment
objects in Western societies where kids sleep

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.839
alone earlier than in Eastern countries where
kids sleep with their parents through middle-childhood.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.840
But why do we get so attached to things?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.110
There’s an idea called called "essentialism,"-
We tend to think objects have an essence.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.250
Something we add to them, like the same way
we wouldn’t wear the shirt of a murderer

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.789
or feel strange when standing in a place where
something bad happened.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.000
Scientists put this to test with little kids.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.320
A 2007 study published in the journal Cognition
had kids put their beloved object into a special

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.210
box that would “replicate” it.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.770
When asked if they wanted the new, but identical
object, many kids refused.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.430
Maybe it’s a kind of anthropomorphism at
work.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.890
Some studies show that kids are natural anthropomorphizers,
meaning they believe almost everything can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.820
think and feel like a person can.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.969
In one study, from Bristol University, researchers
show young kids two pictures, one of a living

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.400
animal and one of a toy animal.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.760
They told the kids stories in which the living
animals responded with a feeling and the toy

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.249
responded physically.

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.920
The kids were asked how would your toy respond?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.380
Kids with no special attachment object or
whose object had no face, like a blanket,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.450
said their toys would respond physically,
like the toy in the picture.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.799
Kids whose special toy had a face, said it
would respond with thought and feelings.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.790
When I was a kid I used to line my stuffed
animals on my bed to make sure none of them

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.000
felt left out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.530
I may or may not still snuggle with a stuffed
animal while I sleep.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400
Do you still have your stuffed animal or security
blanket too?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.240
Feel a little weird about it?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.950
Have no shame!

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.390
A 2012 study published in the Journal of Adult
Development showed that there’s no connection

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.901
between having a teddy bear and immaturity.

00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:34.150
In fact, a lot of people still have attachments
to their beloved childhood objects.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.849
A 2010 study in the Journal of Cognition and
Culture showed that many adults became stressed

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.069
when asked to cut up a picture of their stuffed
bear or blanket.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.349
In fact, having one might be a good thing
for grown ups.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.870
Separate studies out of Singapore and Amsterdam
have found evidence that touching a teddy

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.299
bear can ease feelings of social isolation,
fears of death and might even make you friendlier.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.970
So do you still have your beloved childhood
toy?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.090
You don’t have to lie!
