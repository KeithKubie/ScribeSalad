00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.540
[music playing]

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.000
NARRATOR: Sicily, 2015,
archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.500
excavates a shipwreck
less than a mile

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.790
off the coast, which
has remained undisturbed

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.330
for more than 2,600 years.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.420
His team dredges up an ancient
payload of 39 metal ingots.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.170
Interestingly, spectrographic
analysis of the recovered alloy

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.540
reveals the compound is
unlike anything ever found

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.250
in the ancient or modern world.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.250
The interesting
part about this

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.380
is the composition of the
ingots that they found.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.670
The metal is 80%
copper and 20% zinc.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.000
There were other
things found in it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750
but that's the majority
of the opposition.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.080
Now zinc only occurs in
nature as sphalerite.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.120
It's a zinc-sulfur complex.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.960
In order to create zinc, which
didn't come around till about

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.210
1,000 years ago, you
have to actually process

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.290
the zinc out of this sulfide.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.710
They didn't have that
technology back then.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.460
DAVID WILCOCK: What was someone
doing blending together copper,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.420
zinc, lead, nickel, iron?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120
This is a complex alloy.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.790
This is nothing easy to do.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.120
It suggests the
possibility that it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
could have special electrical
or energetic properties

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.290
that we don't even know about.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.960
People would not be
expected to be making

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.460
such a complex alloy back then.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330
NARRATOR: How is it possible
that such an advanced alloy was

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.790
manufactured over 2,600 years
ago, centuries before man

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.960
had the technology to manipulate
elements like zinc into metals?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920
And what was its purpose?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.500
Based on the composition
of this alloy,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620
scientists believe
what they have found

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.500
is orichalcum, a
metal associated

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
with the legendary
continent of Atlantis.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.080
According to Plato's
fourth-century dialogues,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.170
"The Timaeus" and
"Critias," Atlantis

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.080
possessed a power and
technology greater

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.670
than any other
civilization on Earth.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.790
It was founded and ruled over
by the Greek god, Poseidon,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.380
whose temple was covered
in a precious metal

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.790
called orichalcum, which
translates to mountain copper.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.880
The composition of the alloy
is not specified by Plato.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.290
But based on its electrical
properties, color, and luster,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.170
scientists suggest that
if it really did exist,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.710
it most likely consisted
of copper mixed

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.540
primarily with zinc,
just like the metal

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.210
found in the shipwreck.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.210
It was said that the temple
of Poseidon on Atlantis

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.040
flashed with the red
light of orichalcum.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.920
The copper tint of
this metal caught

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.330
the attention of the seekers
that came to this sacred place.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.750
This is not just an
attractive color.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.830
This has spiritual implications.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.750
There was something about
this metal that was said

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.500
to resonate with the divine.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.710
Perhaps it was its origin,
that it had come from heaven.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.000
It fell out of the sky.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.210
NARRATOR: According
to Plato's story,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.420
the Greek god, Cadmus,
son of Poseidon,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.750
came down from Mount
Olympus and gave orichalcum

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.830
to the people of Atlantis.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.580
An important figure
in early Greek mythology

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.790
was Cadmus, a divine
character, the first hero,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.920
fifth in the lineage from
Zeus of the Greek gods.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.080
It was Cadmus that brought
the making of bronze.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.120
He knew how to make alloys,
special metals, which

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.960
in the early days
of civilization,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.120
was the beginning of technology.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.960
So Cadmus is the
one who shows us

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.290
the divine nature of metalwork
and gives this as a gift

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.210
to the generations.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.120
DAVID WILCOCK: Why are we so
quick to dismiss the underlying

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.540
stories in those myths?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.960
Those stories talk about
extraterrestrials coming

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.250
and visiting our culture.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.330
They talk about gods
that walked among us

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.750
and interacted with
humans, but with a severely

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.120
advanced technology beyond
anything that we have today.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.750
Ancient astronaut theory
says that the legends

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.920
of these Greek gods are
not just mythological,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.920
but they're actually
rooted in actual events.
