00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
 I can imagine 

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.514
 That even the oldest species of humans, 

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.119
 Or possibly objects before human 

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.232
 They have asked themselves questions 

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:10.052
 why I am here? What is the nature of existence? 

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.973
 Why is the universe organized in such a way that it is? 

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:17.488
 And these questions are what we seek to answer them 

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.071
 In physics 

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.316
 In physics 

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.312
 Where you can put it 

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:24.612
 Maybe immediately after math 

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.761
 As the oldest science. 

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.646
 If we have mathematics, where it is very ancient, 

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:33.592
 And hence on the basis of sports 

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:34.933
 You have physics. 

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:39.159
 Physics is really trying to use those maths 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.048
 Along with some basic ideas 

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:43.060
 To explain phenomena, 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.238
 All phenomena, 

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:45.437
 in the universe. 

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.204
 Physicists are the first to admit 

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:49.643
 It's just just beginning to understand 

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:51.065
 The nature of reality, (the universe) 

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.076
 The nature of everything around us. 

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:54.986
 Now many times, we believe that physics 

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:59.638
 Confined only to things like cosmic phenomena 

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:01.731
 Or send missiles into space, 

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:04.779
 Or how waves move or build structures. 

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.379
 But physics is the basis for 

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.452
 All other sciences. 

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.630
 When we think about chemistry, 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.519
 When we think about chemistry, 

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.678
 Which is the ultimate 

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.384
 Interactions between atoms, 

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.858
 These interactions are really physics-based interactions. 

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:22.820
 That is why chemistry is actually placed 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 On a physical basis. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.062
 Even when we think of ourselves, 

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:30.764
 Our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains, 

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:35.437
 All of this is really about chemistry and physics. 

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.997
 It is summed up in interactions between atoms 

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.719
 And even the mechanical properties of our bodies. 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.829
 Even biology, 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.596
 So what we are, 

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:49.943
 It is built on the foundations of chemistry. 

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.072
 So this is the biology here, 

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:54.901
 Built on the basis of physics, 

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.562
 Which rely heavily on some mathematics 

00:01:57.562 --> 00:01:59.269
 Which you have been learning all your life 

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:00.874
 Which you will continue to learn 

00:02:00.874 --> 00:02:03.007
 This fundamental question that I may have asked, 

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:04.958
 Well you know, "Hey, why am I learning this math?" 

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.461
 , 'The answer is because mathematics is beautiful, 

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.859
 But you too will see it start, 

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:13.044
 In describing the structure (existence) of the universe. 

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:15.990
 We are going to see more, more and more 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.473
 We go on physics 

00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:19.139
 All these complex phenomena 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.033
 Which we see around us, 

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.272
 If we are looking at a galaxy 

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:22.694
 Or looking at ocean waves, 

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.600
 Or even look at biological systems, 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.139
 We will see that the amount of shock (large) of them (mean phenomena) 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.695
 It can begin to be described using some mathematics to some extent 

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.503
 The mathematics on which we can build 

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:34.702
 And continue to build on them. 

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:36.815
 Simple or complex mathematics (higher) 

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:40.919
 Such as force = mass × acceleration (wheel) 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.824
 We will talk about strength and acceleration 

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:45.246
 As directed quantities (vectors). 

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:48.314
 We will think of things like displacement, 

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:50.143
 I will put it as a vector quantity, 

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:52.317
 We'll learn more about vectors soon 

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:53.637
 And numerical quantities. 

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:58.005
 Offset = Speed ​​× Time. 

00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.321
 We will learn things like acceleration (the wheel) 

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:04.385
 Wheel = change in speed التغير change in time 

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.985
 You will even see with a little amount 

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.281
 From very simple ideas like these .. But we 

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.536
 We will go deeper into future recordings. 

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.320
 You will be able to expand all kinds of complex phenomena 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.819
 The only thing I have always loved in physics, 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.627
 I do not think he is always fully aware, 

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:20.110
 Sometimes when you begin to learn physics, 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.979
 You will see all these complex formulas, 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.621
 All these types of complex problems, 

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.221
 But it is a great value to achieve - it means understanding physics 

00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.883
 It comes from some of these basic ideas. 

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.224
 Some of the things I just mentioned, 

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:34.373
 These ideas, we will discover the laws of energy. 

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:37.400
 We will learn about Newton's laws. 

00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:41.992
 We will think and explain the types of forces, 

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:44.978
 And why they are, why they actually exist. 

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:48.310
 In essence, it's an attempt to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.033
 Explain the complexity of the universe, 

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.739
 Predict what will happen 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.685
 Based on simple ideas. 

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.022
 That's all that physics involves. 

00:03:58.022 --> 00:03:59.708
 Now when we think about physics, 

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.979
 It has been studied by humans for a very, very long time. 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.036
 In fact, I'm sure we do not know 

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:07.733
 Who are the early physicists? 

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:08.883
 But some of the .., 

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:11.321
 I think you can tell founding thinkers 

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.490
 In physics. They are the gentlemen I have here. 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.343
 This is just ... 

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:19.569
 These are some of the most prominent thinkers in physics 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.886
 But certainly this is not a complete list 

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:25.238
 First of all, we want to talk about Isaac Newton. 

00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:27.838
 Especially when starting to study physics, 

00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.219
 I have begun to understand the world 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.621
 As understood by Newton 

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:32.881
 "He said," Hey, 

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.344
 "Things do not fall to the ground 

00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:35.664
 "Just because it's always so, !! 

00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:37.208
 Just because this is the universe! 

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.748
 There is a force that affects them, 

00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:41.820
 "It is probably the same force that affects me 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.137
 "To be sitting on my seat now 

00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:46.839
 "Which makes the earth revolve around the sun 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.882
 "Or the moon revolves around the earth." 

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.096
 I have explained in detail the Law of Attraction, 

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:54.844
 We will study Newton's laws 

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.627
 We will go into the basics of physics. 

00:04:57.627 --> 00:04:58.623
 We will see and explain 

00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:00.004
 Even classical mechanics (primary, 

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.052
 Physics created by Newton, 

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.977
 Many phenomena can be explained 

00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.278
 Stunning accuracy. 

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:10.325
 But as we progress in the early 20th century, 

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.398
 Physics is more complex 

00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:14.393
 While looking at metrics 

00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:15.592
 A tiny king 

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:18.842
 Our Max Planck gives us quantum mechanics, 

00:05:18.842 --> 00:05:20.712
 And then we have Albert Einstein 

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:23.840
 We begin to think very quickly, 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.380
 The speed of light, we realize it is absolute. 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.102
 Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, 

00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:31.378
 And this is a puzzling thing 

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.674
 We have these ideas 

00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:35.787
 Public and private relativity, 

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.697
 And we begin to realize that the universe 

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:40.521
 In some ways more strange, more ambiguous, 

00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:43.548
 And the most wonderful ever we could imagine 

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.413
 But all this work, from Planck and Einstein 

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.135
 To understand modern physics 

00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:52.203
 And they are based on a lot of basic ideas 

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.133
 Which was given to us by Isaac Newton, 

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:56.226
 Even people before Isaac Newton. 

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.725
 As you deepen your study of physics 

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.671
 I hope to be a physicist. 

00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:03.479
 I wanted to be a physicist. 

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.933
 'Cause it's all, we're all a wonderful miracle, 

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:07.969
 Why are we here? 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.777
 What is the nature of reality? 

00:06:09.777 --> 00:06:12.378
 Why are things as they are? 

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:14.979
 These are questions that physics tries 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.624
 To answer them 

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:19.225
 Since you will begin your studies of physics, 

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.074
 I want to leave you with some quotations 

00:06:21.074 --> 00:06:22.801
 Of these three gentlemen. 

00:06:22.801 --> 00:06:25.401
 So the first two of Isaac Newton. 

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.018
 "The truth can not be found in simplicity, 

00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:32.594
 "And not in the multiplicity and confusion of things." 

00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:34.300
 I really wanted to emphasize this, 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.661
 Because sometimes in your study, 

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.795
 You can find yourself save formulas 

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:41.208
 Vocabulary, but .. 

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:43.768
 If you do this, you are too superficial not to want to delve deeper. 

00:06:43.768 --> 00:06:45.759
 But if you really start to think about it, 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.055
 Think and wonder where these things come from 

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:51.285
 With time, what you are studying will be easier, easier, and more intuitive. 

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:54.577
 After that, you will get closer to the truth. 

00:06:54.577 --> 00:06:57.380
 Now, I like this second quote from Isaac Newton. 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.265
 "I do not know exactly how to look ... 

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:03.171
 "I also do not know how to appear to the world, 

00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:07.234
 "But for me, I just look like a little girl 

00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:08.534
 "Playing on the beach, 

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:11.033
 "I pray myself from time to time 

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:12.699
 "To find a smooth pebble 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.426
 "Or shell is more beautiful than normal, 

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.352
 While it is a large circumference of facts 

00:07:17.352 --> 00:07:20.521
 "Anonymous for me". 

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.126
 I would imagine that there is a lot we do not know 

00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:24.321
 , Although we believe we know a lot, 

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.571
 So we do not even know a small part about 

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:29.258
 What the universe really is. 

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.594
 Even a great thinker such as Isaac Newton, 

00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:32.630
 Has admitted this. 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.113
 It's like "Hey, I'm just a Hao 

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:36.572
 "On the seashore I pick up a pebble from there, 

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:37.750
 "But there is this vast ocean 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.558
 "Which I can not even begin to understand." 

00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:41.488
 You can even imagine exotic civilizations 

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:43.845
 That thousands of years before us 

00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:45.918
 Technically or scientifically 

00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.157
 Or even millions of years, 

00:07:47.157 --> 00:07:49.067
 How they can perceive reality, 

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.408
 And they may see us as ants 

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:51.789
 We're just beginning 

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.309
 To discover a small part of the universe's realities. 

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:56.836
 This is from Max Planck. 

00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:59.173
 "When you change the way you look at things, 

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.286
 "Things you look at will look different." 

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.947
 I find that these are very deep, 

00:08:03.947 --> 00:08:04.739
 Because it is truly substantive wisdom. 

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:05.674
 When studying physics, 

00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:06.588
 You will start to see, 

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:08.234
 Most of what we consider a reality, 

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:09.717
 Based on our current understanding 

00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:11.789
 On these forces, but what are these forces? 

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.004
 Even these things that we think are solid, 

00:08:14.004 --> 00:08:15.650
 When we reach the atomic level, 

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.112
 We see that most of them are void 

00:08:17.112 --> 00:08:18.819
 And it's really just a powerful interaction 

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.790
 That makes us believe that something 

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.594
 Solid or material in one way or another. 

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:24.934
 You are aware of these very concrete things 

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:27.149
 Not even concrete after all. 

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:28.774
 In the end, the whole world 

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.477
 It is just a model of our mind. 

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:32.309
 In some ways, 

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.971
 It's just an illusion 

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.815
 That our mind thinks so we can work. 

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:40.313
 But we are just beginning to understand it. 

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:42.041
 last but not least, 

00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:43.464
 There are actually tons of many quotations 

00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:44.825
 Of these people and others, 

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.450
 But especially Albert Einstein. 

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.340
 "The most beautiful experience 

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.453
 "We can go into it is ambiguity. 

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:53.399
 "It's the core emotion that stands 

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.446
 "In the cradle of real art and real science." 

00:08:56.446 --> 00:08:58.762
 I really want you to take this seriously 

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:00.123
 While studying physics. 

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.155
 There will be times where you will 

00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:03.435
 We build our kit 

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:04.146
 What is the vector value? 

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:04.776
 What is the numerical value? 

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.280
 Going into some math, 

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.702
 Some formats are proven. 

00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.165
 That is our kit (our tools) 

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.648
 But then we will try to understand 

00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:12.050
 Basic phenomena. 

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.244
 How does the universe actually work? 

00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:16.397
 And when we begin to think about these, 

00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.856
 You will not get a little chills on your skin, 

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:21.538
 A few cries of horror, you will feel that the universe 

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:23.569
 Is more mysterious than I thought, 

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:25.419
 Then we only study physics 

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.734
 Because we have to study them.
