00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:24.850 align:start position:0%
would it have played as well because I'm
 

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.950 align:start position:0%
would it have played as well because I'm

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
thinking in the scene because there are
 

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.530 align:start position:0%
thinking in the scene because there are
scenes<00:08:26.200><c> that</c><00:08:26.370><c> just</c><00:08:27.370><c> are</c><00:08:27.850><c> still</c><00:08:28.180><c> part</c><00:08:28.390><c> of</c><00:08:28.420><c> the</c>

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:28.540 align:start position:0%
scenes that just are still part of the
 

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.390 align:start position:0%
scenes that just are still part of the

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
origin like Uncle Ben getting shot and
 

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.230 align:start position:0%
origin like Uncle Ben getting shot and
so<00:08:30.520><c> I</c><00:08:30.550><c> don't</c><00:08:30.760><c> think</c><00:08:30.910><c> I'm</c><00:08:30.970><c> giving</c><00:08:31.090><c> anything</c>

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't think I'm giving anything
 

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.750 align:start position:0%
so I don't think I'm giving anything
away<00:08:31.450><c> with</c><00:08:31.720><c> that</c><00:08:31.840><c> but</c><00:08:32.220><c> when</c><00:08:33.220><c> you</c><00:08:33.340><c> get</c><00:08:33.490><c> there</c>

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
away with that but when you get there
 

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.750 align:start position:0%
away with that but when you get there
it's<00:08:34.030><c> sort</c><00:08:34.210><c> of</c><00:08:34.360><c> like</c><00:08:34.540><c> okay</c><00:08:35.200><c> well</c><00:08:35.410><c> they</c><00:08:35.560><c> this</c><00:08:36.520><c> I</c>

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like okay well they this I
 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.250 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like okay well they this I
don't<00:08:37.090><c> want</c><00:08:37.210><c> to</c><00:08:37.270><c> say</c><00:08:37.330><c> it</c><00:08:37.419><c> seems</c><00:08:37.570><c> rushed</c><00:08:37.900><c> but</c><00:08:38.169><c> it</c>

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:38.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to say it seems rushed but it
 

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
don't want to say it seems rushed but it

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:56.500 align:start position:0%
figure out I think it's still work but
 

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.170 align:start position:0%
figure out I think it's still work but
that<00:08:56.620><c> would</c><00:08:56.740><c> have</c><00:08:56.830><c> been</c><00:08:57.010><c> a</c><00:08:57.339><c> little</c><00:08:57.910><c> bit</c><00:08:58.000><c> of</c><00:08:58.089><c> an</c>
