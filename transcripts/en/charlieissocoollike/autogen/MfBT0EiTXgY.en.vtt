you've been working on something for a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
you've been working on something for a
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360
you've been working on something for a
long time because I think that in my

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
long time because I think that in my
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920
long time because I think that in my
experience the longer I've been working

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
experience the longer I've been working
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.020
experience the longer I've been working
on a project the more that project feels

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

like a reflection of me personally what

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
like a reflection of me personally what
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.860
like a reflection of me personally what
I like to do is to try and create as

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
I like to do is to try and create as
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.439
I like to do is to try and create as
much distance as I possibly can between

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
much distance as I possibly can between
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510
much distance as I possibly can between
myself and the thing that I have made

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
myself and the thing that I have made
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520
myself and the thing that I have made
because if that distance isn't there

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
because if that distance isn't there
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.810
because if that distance isn't there
you're gonna look at criticism and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
you're gonna look at criticism and
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.550
you're gonna look at criticism and
you're gonna take it personally and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
you're gonna take it personally and
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380
you're gonna take it personally and
really the simplest way you can create

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
really the simplest way you can create
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660
really the simplest way you can create
that distance is you just have to wait

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
that distance is you just have to wait
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060
that distance is you just have to wait
you just have to resist looking at those

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
you just have to resist looking at those
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679
you just have to resist looking at those
YouTube comments and then eventually

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
YouTube comments and then eventually
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.330
YouTube comments and then eventually
that distance will just create itself

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
that distance will just create itself
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830
that distance will just create itself
the next step for me once I've created

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
the next step for me once I've created
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230
the next step for me once I've created
that distance is that I like to read the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
that distance is that I like to read the
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179
that distance is that I like to read the
negative criticism and maybe this sounds

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
negative criticism and maybe this sounds
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.910
