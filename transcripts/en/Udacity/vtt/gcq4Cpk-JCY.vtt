00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.450
Where a practice level
quality metric is of concern,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.970
the next step would typically be to
drill down to the individual providers

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.070
to see who might be
the source of the problem.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.290
So PoP Health provides data
at that level, as shown here.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.210
We see providers, and within them we
see the actual individual persons.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.500
Here's someone who's doing very well
on this screening metric for tobacco.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.840
Here's someone who's doing not nearly so
well.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.930
Even though we're working at
the population level, the results can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.800
be aggregated and reported for
an individual patient as shown here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.900
Such a report could be reviewed
as part of a patient visit and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.100
makes the patient status easy
to encompass at a glance.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.450
Care outside of guidelines is flagged
here in red, to make that obvious.
