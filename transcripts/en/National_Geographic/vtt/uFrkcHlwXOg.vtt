In Peru it is very common
that archaeological sites

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:10.543
are surrounded by
local communities,

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:13.346
villages, towns,
where people live

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.349
usually in the most
traditional ways.

Pachacamac is a
huge archaeological
site south of Lima.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.475 align:start size:84% position:16%
Around it we have
three million people

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.143
living in shanty towns,

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.713 align:start size:84% position:16%
in one of the poorest
sectors of Lima,

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:51.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
always threatening to encroach
and jump into the site.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.099 align:start size:97% position:3%
We need to engage with
them and interact with them

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.467
in ways in which they feel

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.803
that this site is not
subtracting from them

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.239
but is adding to their lives.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.205
Local communities
can and should be

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
the first line of defense
for these archaeological sites

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.878
that are not only part
of their heritage but,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
if properly
developed, like here,

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:57.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
they can become sources
of income for them.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.408
SPI stands for Sustainable
Preservation Initiative.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is an initiative
that started

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.846 align:start size:97% position:3%
with archaeologists interested
in developing better means

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.283
to protect cultural heritage.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have now six
programs around Peru

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.924
in different communities in
the highlands and the coast.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.259
What we do is we
have engaged women

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.061
that live around the sites.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:44.663 align:start size:97% position:3%
These women are some of
the most traditional people

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.599
living in the coast of Peru.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.458

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.988
