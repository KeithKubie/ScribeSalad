00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
You just found the differences between these two files by hand and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.040
it worked all right.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.670
But it probably seemed pretty tedious and the files were also small.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.250
What if you had files with hundreds or even thousands of lines?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.700
Let's take a look at what we could do in that case.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.640
Now, let's take a look at a program that require's a bit more code.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.720
This is a game called Asteroids and I know this text is a little hard to read,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.000
but it says press space to start.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.430
Some of you may recognize that this is a classic arcade game that has been

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.390
ported so you can play it in the browser.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.280
You press the left and

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.450
right arrow keys to turn the ship, up to fire the engine, and space to shoot.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.970
Props to Doug McGuiness for creating this game.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.170
If you want to play it yourself,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.400
there's a link to it on Doug's website in the instructor notes.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.850
But right now, we're going to be focusing on finding a bug in its code.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.980
The code for this game is in JavaScript.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.120
But don't worry, you won't need to know JavaScript to complete the exercise.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.480
I thought using space to fire the engine might be more intuitive to me, so

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.040
I changed the controls for the game to use space instead of up arrow.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.750
Then I needed a different way to shoot, so

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.930
I decided to use enter instead of space for that.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.510
But when I tried the game out,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.610
the engines didn't work at all anymore, I couldn't move.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.350
I think I made a typo, but I'm not sure where.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.040
Most of the code for this game,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.860
including the codes that maps keys to actions, is in a file called game.js.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.871
Now, this file contains over a thousand lines.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:23.010
It would be way too time consuming to go through this entire file,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.570
comparing the new version to the old version.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.350
Fortunately, there are a bunch of tools that can automatically find

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.110
differences between files.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.530
If you're using Windows,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.740
you have a tool in the command prompt called FC, which stands for file compare.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.570
If you're using Mac or Linux, then FC is a different unrelated command, but

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.460
you have a built-in tool, called Diff, you can use, which stands for difference.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.320
I'll demonstrate using these tools to compare the HTML you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.470
just compared manually in the previous exercise.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.360
Then I'll ask you to go through the same process to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.970
find the differences in game.js.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.780
On Windows, I'll open the command prompt first.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.770
By the way, if you'd prefer to use git bash to complete this exercise, then,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.860
you can follow the instructions for the Mac and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.680
Linux students that are coming in a minute.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.310
But for now,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.570
I'm going to show how to complete the exercise in the command prompt.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.010
So first, I'll need to change to the directory that has my files in it.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.800
So I'll type cd Downloads.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.150
Since I downloaded my files to the downloads folder.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.620
Now I'll enter the command FC favorite-app-old.html favorite-app.html.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.600
So, to the FC or File Compare Program, I passed two files,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530
the first one that I want to compare, and the second.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.990
Now, when I hit enter, I can see that

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.760
I'm comparing the files Favorite-app-old.html and FAVORITE-APP.HTML.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.170
So, each of these two sections are showing different parts of the file.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.708
So here, you can see that favorite-app-old.html href style-1.css, and

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.260
FAVORITE-AP.HTML href style-!.css.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.570
Then down here, you can see the next section that changed,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.040
which was the description.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.820
Some description here changed to the fun fact.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.480
Did you know that sunflowers were used to remove toxins from

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.850
a pond after the Chernobyl disaster?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.580
Sections that didn't change aren't shown,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.570
since we're only trying to focus on the differences here.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.870
On Mac or Linux, I'll open the terminal, navigate to where the files are,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.116
then enter the command diff -u favorite-app-old.html favorite-app.html.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.760
The -u option stands for

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.610
unified diff format and it will make the output a little easier to read.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.810
Now, I'll go ahead and hit Enter.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.530
The output format here is a little bit different than for FC.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.230
I'll scroll back up.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.120
And first, you can see that there were some lines at the top.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.640
And you don't really need to worry about these lines.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.255
They're just showing you that you're comparing favorite-app-old.html,

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.195
to favorite-app.html.

00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:48.970
Ones with no plus or minus sign next to them like these haven't changed.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.480
That is they existed in both the old version of the file and the new version.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.530
Lines with a minus sign were removed.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.110
That is they existed in the old version, but not the new version.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.550
And lines with a plus sign were added, so vice versa.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.570
Now I'll scroll back down.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.040
And here's the style sheet change that you found earlier.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.970
And here's the description change.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.430
Now, go ahead and download the filesgameold.js and gamenew.js from

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.260
the downloadable section and compare them using either FC or Diff.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.220
Your files will probably be downloaded to the downloads folder, so

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.040
you can navigate there by using CD downloads, just like I did.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.250
What word contains a typo in the version of game.js but not in the old version?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.610
Once you found the word, enter it in this box.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.300
Use the correct spelling for the word.
