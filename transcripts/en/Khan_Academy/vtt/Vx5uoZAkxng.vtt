00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:05.949
In a language class, the girl to boy ratio is 5 to 8.

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:09.536
So for every 5 girls, we have 8 boys.

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:13.247
If there are a total of 65 students,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.576
how many girls are there?

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:16.576
So this is interesting.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.131
They give us the ratio of girls to boys.

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:20.900
But then they want us to think about how many

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.803
girls there are given that there are 65 total students.

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:26.313
So what we really want to think about

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:28.977
is not just the ratio of girls to boys – we want

00:00:28.977 --> 00:00:36.536
to think about the ratio of girls to total students.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.523
So how can we figure out

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:39.727
what this ratio's going to be?

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.870
Well the girl-to-boy ratio gives us a good clue.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.306
If there are 5 girls for every 8 boys, how many total

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:51.403
students are there going to be for every 5 girls?

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:54.604
Well for every 5 girls, you're going to have

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:56.809
5 girls and 8 boys.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.995
You're going to have 13 total students.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:01.246
So I just added the 5 and the 8 right over here.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:04.836
The ratio of girls to total students is 5 to 13.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.844
One way of thinking about it is if you were

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:10.453
to evenly divide the students into groups of 13,

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:14.710
every group of 13 students would have 5 girls.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.573
Now, I think we're ready to figure out

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:19.172
how many total girls there are.

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:24.965
Because they tell us that there are 65 students.

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.130
So, we don't just have one group of 13,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.003
we have 65 students.

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.630
And how many groups of 13 are in 65?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.037
Well to go from 13 to 65, you have to multiply by 5.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:41.431
5 × 10 is 50 and 5 × 3 is 15. Right.

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:43.365
So, 13 × 5 is 65.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:45.078
So essentially, one way you could view it is

00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:47.284
you have 5 groups of 13.

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:48.925
So if you have 5 groups of 13,

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.018
each of those are going to have 5 girls.

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:56.441
Multiply by 5, and you're going to have 25 girls.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:58.113
So for every 65 students,

00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:00.171
you're going to have 25 girls,

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.722
given the information that has been given.
