00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Voiceover] Yochanan walked
from home to the bus stop

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.517
at an average speed of
five kilometers per hour.

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:08.406
He immediately got on his school bus

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:10.133
and traveled at an average speed

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.668
of 60 kilometers per hour
until he got to school.

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:16.374
The total distance from his home to school

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:18.526
is 35 kilometers, and the entire trip took

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.240
one and a half hours.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.286
How many kilometers did Yochanan cover

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.094
by walking, and how many kilometers

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.137
did he cover by travelling
on the bus? It's fascinating.

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.620
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.037
and try to think about on your own.

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:32.785
Alright, so let's just
define some variables here.

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:34.837
How many kilometers did
he cover by walking?

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:38.230
Let's call this W and how many kilometers

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.388
did he cover by travelling on the bus?

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:44.284
Let's call that, Let's call that B

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.094
and so what do we know?

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:47.812
We know that the kilometers

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:49.243
and I can actually even
draw it just to make sure

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:51.104
that we're visualizing this thing, right?

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:55.578
So this right over here is
his home, that's his home

00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:59.627
and then he is going to
travel and see they tell us,

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.935
they tell us that it is
35 kilometers to school

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:05.618
so this is his school right over here.

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:08.564
I'll draw a bigger
building, that's his school,

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:13.420
and we know that this
distance is 35, 35 kilometers

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.719
and we also know that it
took one and a half hours.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.910
One and a half hours, now he traveled

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.657
at different rates for
different distances.

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:23.678
So he traveled some
distance to the school bus

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:26.862
so this is, or to the bus stop,

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:30.437
so that's the bus stop, right over there,

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.611
and we're seeing this
distance to the bus stop,

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.696
that's how much he covered by walking.

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:37.053
So this right over here, this
distance, right over here,

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.141
that is W and the rest of the distance,

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.839
he covered by the bus, so
the rest of this distance,

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.876
all of this distance right over there,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.468
that is going to be B.

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:49.452
So what do we know?

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.464
We know the distance covered by walking

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.008
plus the distance covered by bus

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.554
is going to be 35 kilometers,
35 kilometers here,

00:01:56.554 --> 00:02:00.557
this is the entire, that
is the entire distance

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.997
from home to school, so
we know that W plus B,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.560
W plus B, plus B is
equal to 35 kilometers,

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.403
is equal to 35 kilometers
and just with one equation,

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.468
we're not going to be able to
figure out what W and B are

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:20.527
but we have another constraint.

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.631
We know the total amount of time.

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.805
So the total amount of time is going to be

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:27.934
one and half hours, so we'll
just write that over here.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:32.934
This is going to be 1.5, so
what's the time traveled by,

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:35.256
what's the time he walks?

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:38.827
Let me write this over here, time

00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:43.477
time walking, we'll that's going to be

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:46.334
the distance walking
divided by the rate walking.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:50.003
So the distance walking is W kilometers

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:55.003
W kilometers divided by his rate,

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.322
the distance divided by your rate

00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:58.556
is gonna give you your time, so let's see,

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.913
his rate is five kilometers per hour,

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:05.078
five kilometers per
hour and so you're gonna

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.419
have kilometers cancel kilometers

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.507
and if you divide by or
if you have one over hours

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:12.453
in the denominator, that's
going to be the same thing,

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:17.390
this is gonna be W over five
hours, so the units work out.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.397
So his time walking is W over five,

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:23.424
W over five and by that same logic,

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.802
his time on the bus is
going to be the distance

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:30.353
on the bus divided by,
divided by the average speed

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.278
of the school bus, so
this is going to be 60.

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.188
This is all going to be in hours

00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:37.829
and now we can solve
this system of equations.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.999
We have two linear
equations with two unknowns.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.604
We should be able to find W and B

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:45.631
that satisfy both of these.

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.232
Now what's an easy thing to do?

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.343
Let's see, if I can multiply
this second equation

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.972
by negative five, and I'm gonna,

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.355
this is going to be a negative W here

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:57.671
so it'll cancel out with this W up there.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.800
So let's do that, let's
multiply the second equation

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.461
by, I'm just gonna
switch to one color here,

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:08.461
so this top equation is going
to be W plus B is equal to 35.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.580
This bottom equation,
if I multiply both sides

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.388
by negative five, so both
sides by negative five,

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.526
I'm going to multiply both
sides by negative five

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.411
I'm going to get negative
five times W over five

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:27.411
is negative W, negative
five times B over 60.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.176
Let's see, it's gonna be,
it's going to be negative five

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:34.032
over 60, that's negative
1/12, so this is negative B

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:38.644
over 12 and then it is
going to be equal to

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:43.644
1.5 times negative five is
negative 7.5, negative 7.5.

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:46.567
Now we can just add the left and

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:49.147
right hand sides of these two equations.

00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:51.403
Now let me, I can do
this a little bit neater,

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:54.674
let me actually delete, let me make these

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:58.493
line up a little bit better
so that we, delete that,

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:02.394
make this, so this first
equation was, whoops,

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:07.394
this first equation was
W plus B is equal to 35

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.674
now they line up better and now we can add

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:13.830
the left hand sides of these equations

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.016
and the right hand sides,
so the left hand sides,

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:18.162
the W's cancel out. That's what we wanted.

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:22.530
Now B minus B over 12 or
B minus the twelfth of B,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.582
well that's going to be 11/12B,

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:28.930
11/12B is equal to, let's see,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.930
35 minus 7.5, see 35 minus seven

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.604
would be 28 and then another
half this would be 27.5.

00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:45.497
27.5 and since I'm dealing
with a fraction here,

00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:47.123
let me write this as a fraction

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:51.753
so this is the same thing as 55 over two.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.799
Let's me just write it this way.

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:58.058
This is the same thing as 55 over two.

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.703
Now to solve for B, I
just have to multiply

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:01.447
both sides times this reciprocal.

00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:04.190
I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.190
So multiply both sides by
12 over 11, 12 over 11,

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.414
what we get, these cancel out, what we get

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:16.543
is that B, so I'll do this in this color,

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:20.097
B is equal to, let's see, I
have a 12 in the numerator

00:06:20.097 --> 00:06:21.459
two in the denominator so I can

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:25.542
make that a six and a one,
then I have a 55 and 11,

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.151
I can divide both by 11, so
it's gonna be five and a one.

00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:31.650
So it's five times six, B is equal to 30

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.868
and B was in kilometers so
if he travels 30 kilometers,

00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:39.606
30 kilometers by bus, B
is equal to 30 kilometers,

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:42.288
and the amount that he walks,
well, we can figure that out.

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:43.853
If this is 30, well the amount

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:46.472
that he walks is going to be five.

00:06:46.892 --> 00:06:50.529
This is going to be five kilometers, W,

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.475
let me write this, W is
equal to five kilometers.

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.141
He walks five kilometers and then he goes

00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:58.916
by the bus 30 kilometers.
