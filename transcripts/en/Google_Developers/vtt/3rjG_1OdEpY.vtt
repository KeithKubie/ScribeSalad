00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.392
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:02.100
I'm Nathan Martz.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.070
I'm the developer PM
for the Daydream team.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.540
And I'm here to talk to you
about enhancing applications

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.712
and websites with
embeddable VR views.

00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm sure all of you have
heard a great deal this week

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.000
about our brand new platform
for immersive long form VR,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.380
Daydream.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.500
Now, Daydream is amazing, and
you've heard a lot about it.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.830
But today I'm going to talk to
you about a different mobile VR

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.940
platform from Google
called Cardboard.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.080
And even though we're talking
a lot about Daydream today,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.000
Cardboard is alive and well.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.510
In part because it has some
really unique properties.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.170
Cardboard still is the world's
most affordable and most widely

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.440
distributed VR platform.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.115
It's really, really good
at bite size experiences.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.990
It's something you can drop
into and drop out of really,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.410
really comfortably.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.780
It also works on my
iOS and on Android.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.860
And it's super
easily branded if you

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.450
want to use it in a marketing
campaign or a give away.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.910
And especially the
bite size nature

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.740
of the content, the fact
that you're not necessarily

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.380
locked into VR for a
long time with Cardboard

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.390
makes us think of some
interesting applications.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.950
That's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.400
Also the heart of Cardboard,
and of Daydream in general,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.440
is this idea of VR for everyone.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.710
And when we say that we mean
not just VR for every user,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.530
but actually we mean
for every developer,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.850
and also hopefully
for every business.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.450
Google is investing
in VR because we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.299
believe it's a potentially
transformative technology.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.840
And so we're always
thinking for ways

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.020
to apply that technology
outside of the most obvious

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.400
applications of games and
media, into the real world,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.180
into the businesses that
most of us run and support.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.090
And with that I'd
like to talk to you

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.250
about a specific insight,
a specific opportunity

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.810
we've been thinking about.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.180
So imagine you have
a travel website.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.800
Now, travel is a huge part of
internet search and commerce.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.850
People spend tremendous
amounts of time and money

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.670
when they try to
plan their vacations.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.860
And today, whether it's
an app or a website,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.310
we do the best we can
with the tools available.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.160
So if you want to tell
someone about Machu Picchu,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.990
we have a beautiful photograph.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.750
And we have text and copy that
tries to support that, maybe

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.250
some charts and graphs.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.670
But if you're traveling
to Machu Picchu

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.270
you'd really like
to know what it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.800
feels like to be on
top of the mountain,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.500
to look around the ruins.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.070
It'd be so much
more amazing if you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.450
could feel like you're immersed
in that space, physically

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.450
present.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.530
If you're planning a
trip to Machu Picchu

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.230
and you're like, ah, that's what
it looks like, it's so amazing,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.010
you might be more
likely to travel there.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.487
And this idea of
embedding immersive media

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:41.820
into more traditional websites
and applications we think

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.760
is actually a very
large opportunity,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.850
and not just for travel.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.520
For example, if
you're in real estate,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.550
maybe you're a home
builder, your whole business

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.610
is you have to sell homes
that haven't been built yet.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.870
And some people are going
to come to your office,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.880
and they're going to be
excited about your home,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.630
but they're going to walk out
the door because they have

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.170
a hard time buying
a house if they

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.760
can't look around
the kitchen and then

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.390
walk to the living room.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.310
Well, embeddable immersive
media could let you do that.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.300
If you're in retail,
or support retail,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.310
you want to have somebody design
a room, or look at a show room

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.230
without leaving the
comfort of their home.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.790
You can do that with
immersive media.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.330
Maybe you work in
news and you want

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.690
to really leverage the power
of VR as the empathy machine,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.460
to bring people into the stories
in a really remarkable way.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.640
Immersive media can
do that as well.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.777
And of course education
is another opportunity,

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:35.110
where if you want to take
your students on virtual field

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.730
trips, teach them about the
world, take them to places

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.430
they could never go that are
thousands or millions of miles

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.520
away.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.180
This is all possible.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.890
And so we know that
even though there's

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.080
this great potential most
businesses and most developers

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.450
don't have a large team
of VR experts on standby

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.670
just waiting for this
stuff to happen, right.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.300
Building a VR app from the
ground up is expensive.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.877
But we want to
make it accessible.

00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:00.460
And that's why I'm
here to talk to you

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.370
about a technology released
just a couple months ago

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.740
called VR Views.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.130
And I'll tell you about it
in a great deal of detail

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.960
over the next half hour.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.980
So it's much easier
to experience VR Views

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.630
than it is just to
talk about them.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.750
So if anyone has a smartphone,
I suspect a few of you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.079
have these crazy things
called smartphones,

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.000
there's a short URL
which will take you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.560
to a live version of this demo.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.970
So check it out.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.150
I'll leave the URL up
for just another second.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.459
It's pretty fricken cool.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.000
And bonus points if you actually
brought a Cardboard, or a VR

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.130
viewer of your choice.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.940
Even better.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.020
So the starting point for VR
Views is an embedded window.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.950
We know that most apps are not
going to start users in VR.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.750
You're going to start in 2D.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.640
And you want to bring this
window into an immersive world.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.260
You want to bring it to users
even before they've entered VR.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.040
In fact, we know
that, of course,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.280
not everyone has a Cardboard
with them all the time.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.465
And if you're going to
build this technology

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:03.510
and integrate it
into your site, you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.830
want it to work in
VR and outside of VR.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.880
The cool thing is that with the
embedded Magic Window on mobile

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.850
when you move your
phone around you'll

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.640
see that the picture
actually responds.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.190
It's alive.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.990
You're looking through
this magic window

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.070
into this other world.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.970
Now, from there you've
got a couple of choices.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.550
There's a full screen
button in the lower right.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.540
And if you press that
you get Magic Window,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.560
but in full screen.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.470
It's the most immerses you
can get without Cardboard.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.060
Now, of course, the best
option is the VR option.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.680
And if you press that you
get stereoscopic real time

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.590
viewing designed to
be compatible with all

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.400
of our Cardboard viewers.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.390
And the cool thing
about VR is it's

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.605
the most immersive, especially
if you have stereo 360 content.

00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:52.430
And we'll talk about how you
can capture your own stereo 360

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.230
content in just a little bit.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.570
So, of course, it's great to
talk about what it can do,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.891
but how do you use it, right.

00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.640
You're developers.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.098
You want to know,
how do I actually

00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:06.480
get this into my website
or into my application.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.260
And I'm really proud to tell you
that pretty much everywhere you

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.860
want to be VR Views
already supports.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.040
We have a web based
implementation that works

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.060
on desktop and mobile browsers.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.360
We have native
Android integrations

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.360
through our Google VR SDK, and
native iOS integrations also

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.110
through the Google VR SDK.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.670
So regardless of whether you
have an app or a website,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.220
whether you're a
desktop or mobile,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.700
you can use this technology,
use the same content

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.020
across all of those
services, and integrate it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.730
with a minimum of effort.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.170
In fact, one of the
hard parts with VR Views

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.350
is actually compatibility.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.520
Right, when you
talk about browsers

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.235
alone there's lots of
different browsers.

00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:50.300
Well, we support all of the
leading browsers across all

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.726
the major operating systems.

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:54.350
As long as you have a relatively
recent version of the browser.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.850
I'm sorry.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.960
IE6, not supported.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.320
But otherwise we're pretty good.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.490
On Android we have
support for everything

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.990
from KitKat and on up, and on
iOS everything from iOS 8.0

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.630
and up.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.713
It's a really, really wide
range of compatibility.

00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:10.830
The majority of the
users you want to reach.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.280
We've done the hard work
to do the compatibility.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.892
And not just the compatibility,
also the performance work,

00:07:15.892 --> 00:07:17.350
to make sure that
this doesn't just

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.740
work but it's fast
and responsive,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.030
which is super important,
especially in VR.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.770
So integrations are
fortunately super simple.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.550
If you want to integrate a
VR view into your website,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.630
it's basically like
integrating a YouTube video.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.274
You add an iframe.

00:07:32.274 --> 00:07:34.190
The most important field
is that source field,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.100
where you can reference
either scripts that we've

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.640
staged and hosted on Google
Cloud Storage, or scripts

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.030
that you host yourself.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.790
The web version is
all open source.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.770
So super simple.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.090
The GitHub link is at
the bottom of the page.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.640
And then you tell us where
to find the 360 degree image,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.680
and there you go.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.470
We do recommend that if
you're trying this out

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.580
for the first time using our
scripts that we host is great.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.890
But you'll run into things
like cross site cores issues.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.320
You'll have to
think about things

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.220
like browser compatibility
in a couple of cases.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.890
So if you host the script on
the same site as the content

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.710
it's much easier.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.430
We highly recommend you do that
in any production environment.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.200
On Android it's
also super simple.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.770
You'll add your view to
your layout XML file.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.450
In code you just
find that layout.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.830
In the case of an image you
create a new bitmap factory,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.240
tell it what file to open.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.110
And then you just need to get
the options for the VR view.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.010
In this case the
VR panorama view.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.270
Tell us whether it's a
stereo or a mono image.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.460
And then give the
raw bitmap data,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.789
hand it off to the widget.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.039
Just that simple.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.000
And iOS, very similarly
all you have to do

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.010
is allocate a new VR view,
tell it what image to load,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.930
and then add the VR
view as a sub view

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.730
to whatever your
larger container is.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.830
Again, super simple,
very idiomatic.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.080
We tried very hard to make
sure that this stuff is not

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.840
just simple but
expressed in a way

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.580
that's natural for the platform
that you're developing for.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.830
And, again, in all these
slides I've got GitHub links.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.160
Super easy to find.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.580
And I'll reference them
again at the end of the talk.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.080
So one of the questions we
get is it's like, OK, great,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.680
like VR view is awesome, and it
seems really easy to integrate.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.660
But how do you get the content?

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.795
Like even capturing in
360 is relatively new.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.170
Well, I'm happy
to say that there

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.140
are some extremely affordable
options on the market.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.740
And I'll walk through a
handful of them today.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.340
So before I talk about
specific capture solutions

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.400
I want to get a little
bit of terminology, which

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.850
was the difference between
inside out capture and outside

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.160
in capture.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.810
Everything we're going to talk
about today is inside out.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.260
Which means that the capture
is taken from a single point

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.520
looking outwards.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.700
And just like when you're
in VR in Cardboard,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.570
it's really good to be in a
point looking out to the world.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.940
Outside in is the
opposite of that.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.900
It's using a lot of like
scanning configurations.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.140
But for all of VR
View you really want

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.220
to be using inside out capture,
not outside in capture,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.410
and thinking about use cases
that are inside out rather

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.530
than outside in.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.990
As an example of that,
in retail something

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.980
like a showroom for home
decorating, that's inside out.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.720
You're standing in
the room looking

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.870
at the drapes and the couch.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.430
Something like
shopping for shoes

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.210
is more outside in, where
you want to look at the shoe,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.720
rotate it in your hand,
or you're effectively

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.420
moving around the object
rather than looking

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.690
from the inside out.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.970
So one of the cheapest,
because it's free,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.610
and awesome ways to capture
not just 360 but stereo 360

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.870
is to use our Cardboard
Camera app on Android.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.390
It's super easy to use.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.780
And it's one of the best ways
to capture 360 stereo imagery.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.070
There's a download link in
the short URL on the bottom.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.300
Now, if you want to use
the Cardboard Camera

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.180
app with VR View you need
to do a format conversion.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.320
Cardboard Camera is very clever
and it packs the left eye

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.130
and right eye data
together in a way

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.490
that you need to unpack in
order to use in VR View.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.737
So we have a really
simple website

00:11:05.737 --> 00:11:08.070
that we've put together that
lets you just drag and drop

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.890
an image from Cardboard Camera.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.580
We'll automatically convert
it and prep it for a format

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.520
that VR View can take.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.710
So, again, super simple.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.410
Use the app.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.160
Use the converter.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.940
And then you're ready
to go for VR View.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.650
Another great, really affordable
option is the Ricoh Theta.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.280
This is, I think, one of the
simplest 360 capture options

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.410
around right now.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.840
The only limitation is
that it's monoscopic.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.650
So in the way that Cardboard
Camera supports stereo 360,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.810
Ricoh supports only mono 360.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.700
But it supports capturing both
video and still photography.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.160
Now, of course, we've talked a
lot about real world contexts.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.930
But VR views are not actually
limited to the real world,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:52.740
right.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.220
CG is a great source.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.060
In fact, if you're that
hypothetical home builder who

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.410
wants to show people what
the home will look like,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.660
you're probably going
to be capturing your 360

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.760
views from renderers of
your architectural drawings.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.180
And there's a lot of great
plugins for everything

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.250
from game engines like
Unreal Engine and Unity,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.060
to more traditional
offline rendering

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.870
tools like Renderman and Maya.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.740
And these plugins generate
the same standardized format

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.745
that VR View supports.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.100
So let's talk a little bit about
the specifics of the formats

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.180
that work in VR View.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.729
So the most basic format we
support is a mono 360 pano.

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:33.520
It looks like that.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.720
Some people will call
it a lat-long image

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.327
or an equirect pano.

00:12:37.327 --> 00:12:38.910
It's a very, very
standardized format.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.110
Almost anything that can do
360 will output that format.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.200
And we also support its stereo
cousin, which you'll often hear

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.720
called an ODS, an
Omnidirectional Stereo.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.230
Which is really just two
panos, one for each eye,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.040
stacked on top of each other.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.710
So a stereo image looks very
much like a model image,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.210
except two eyes in one
image rather than one.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.220
We also support in the first
version both images and videos.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:09.690
So 360 stills, 360 videos,
and of course mono and stereo

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.120
of both of them.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.120
For images specifically, if
you have a mono 360 image

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.480
you want your aspect
ratio to be two to one.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.980
So, for example, 1,024 x
2,048 is a good baseline

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.770
for mono 360.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.320
In stereo it's one to one.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.350
It's a square.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.260
Because you're stacking a two by
one image on top of another two

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.230
by one image.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.310
For performance and
compatibility reasons

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.250
the maximum dimensions
are 4,096 x 4,096.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.190
That's especially
critical on mobile.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.930
And we support
both JPEG and PNG.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.210
Although generally we recommend
JPEG for faster download sizes,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.560
especially for anything that
looks very photographic.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.970
On the video side of
things we strongly

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:58.680
recommend you stick to MP4 H.264
with a 16 x 9 aspect ratio.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.660
One interesting
thing on video is

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.170
that the device
support for video

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.220
is much more varied,
especially on mobile,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.200
than it is for imagery.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.090
On pretty much any modern
phone a 4,096 x 4,096 texture

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.970
will work.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.470
What you'll find
though with video

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.620
is that some phones cap out
at 1080p, whereas other phones

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.520
will decode up to 4k.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.570
So what we recommend
generally is

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.120
that if you want one thing
that works everywhere

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.510
use a mono 1080p 16 x
9 video for your 360.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.040
However, if you want to
target higher end devices

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.940
and support stereo,
you may want to have

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.450
two versions, that simple
monoscopic version that

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.720
works everywhere and
then a higher fidelity,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.610
ideally 2160p version
for the maximum quality,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.470
deliver to devices that
you know support it.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.570
One last really funny
quirk with video

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.870
is that there's a wide variety
of resolutions that work.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.660
But you want to make
sure your dimensions,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.300
your length and your width,
are always divisible by 16.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.700
That's due to specifics
and how hardware decoders

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.830
work on mobile phones.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.730
So I think that's a
really great overview

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.250
of how all of this stuff works.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.780
We've talked about the
applications, whether you're

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.390
a home builder, or a
journalist, or in retail.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.210
And we've got a lot
of great resources

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.530
if you want to learn more.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.310
So we have a Getting
Started Guide

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.880
on developers.google.com/vr.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.820
And we have actually two really
great code labs here at I/O.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.380
So you've only got
a few hours left.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.336
But I highly encourage you to
check out one of the kiosks.

00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:32.710
They're really
well put together.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.690
But if you're not able to get
to it in time for today's I/O,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.200
they'll all be available online.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.110
And they really
help you understand

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.330
the basics of getting in
there, creating an app,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.500
creating a website,
and making it better

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.910
with embeddable VR media.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.850
So thank you so
much for the time.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.200
