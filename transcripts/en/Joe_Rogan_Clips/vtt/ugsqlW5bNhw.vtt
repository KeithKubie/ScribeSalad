WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
That. I'm a fan of that one. I'm not a fan of investment.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.750
What I have a question about is,

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
is there a some buddy in charge of what,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.670
what's permissible and what's not according to a certain code of conduct and do

5
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.590
they have a political agenda? So in other words,

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.760
so if I put out something that has profanity or maybe I'll stand up clip where I

7
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.780
want to get people in. It's,

8
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.740
it's a clip that is offensive to said person touched possibilities. Yeah.

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.870
They can go, Nope. We're stopping them from doing that. See with the,

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.150
with the dudes with their shirts off flex and shit,

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.810
when they're trying to get clients, that's fine. And they can promote,

12
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.930
reach other people outside their followers is what it should be. Yeah.

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.580
But if you have 100,000 followers,

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.690
it should reach all 100,000 then that's what's crazy to me. Yeah.

15
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.150
They're going to lose everybody. There's going to be a new Instagram.

16
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.880
If they started doing that shit and it gets out of hand, people just leave.

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.880
Well there's, you know, it's shadow banning is right. No,

18
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.440
there's a concept of shadow banning and I don't know if this is Jamie would be

19
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:56.700
able to speak to this better than me.

20
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.910
Is that ever been proved that they actually do shadow banned people?

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
What's that? Or is that it's they

22
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.940
[inaudible] is that if you say we're on Twitter and maybe you were conservative

23
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.480
and you said a lot of rude things about liberals that maybe they would decide

24
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.700
that although it doesn't violate the terms of service, what you do is, uh,

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.960
makes them uncomfortable.

26
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:23.070
They make a moral judgment and they decide to limit your engagement talking

27
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:26.610
about, yeah, this is somehow possible. This is possible.

28
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.500
But is that like a hater?

29
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
It's all in what you're saying with the paying of of post two.

30
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.930
It happens similarly there too. If you were an account that never paid.

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.600
Yeah. And once you pay, once you give him five bucks, you're,

32
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.370
you're like flag now as an account that will pay and change your engagement.

33
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.040
Twitter, it's Twitter. You don't across the board. Yeah.

34
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.740
You can pay on Twitter too. How do you pay on Twitter? Do you pay on Twitter?

35
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.330
You don't have to, but there's an option. You can pay promoted tweets.

36
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.970
It's a promoted tweet.

37
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.340
The top trending topic for the last year or two is a paid,

38
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.920
it says paid or promoted. Really? Yeah.

39
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.560
You just had to go into it because they get money now.

40
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.240
That's how they're called. Who's been banned from Twitter? A lot of people, man,

41
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.230
he fucking, the most famous Benjamin Benjamin's been banned from Twitter.

42
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.970
He has and more conservatives are conservatives, but liberals I've been to,

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.730
there's liberals that have put out death threats. They'd been banned,

44
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.500
but in general they should be lopsided.

45
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.410
I don't know. That's a good question. We should find out what is the,

46
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:34.700
what is the press should be banned being banned. That's a good question too.

47
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.773
Is it

48
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.280
[inaudible] the violate their terms of service and definitely if you incite

49
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.810
violence, that's definitely a no,

50
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.860
no racial slurs or no-no racist.

51
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.390
You can call someone a fuckhead. You can call someone a fuck head,

52
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:55.280
but you can't call them like a Guinea fuck head. There's like,

53
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.160
there's certain things you can say and certain things you can't say,

54
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.660
but it's a lot of it's, yeah. But then some of it's pretty black and white.

55
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.840
Like if you're like, man, I want to go socia blow up that fucking school.

56
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.130
Fuck those kids. Of course, the racist stuff. Yeah. Yes. All of that.

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.570
I think you gotta regulate the hate too.

58
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.740
If it's just bullying and shit like that. We just ban them. Well, it's like,

59
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.960
here's the question and this is who gets to decide who,

60
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.310
what's hateful and what's not.

61
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.010
And then the problem is they keep pushing it further and further and further and

62
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.960
then even just insults or hateful, even even like this guy is a dumb ass.

63
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.380
Yeah. That's hateful. Saying someone's a dumb ass. It's hateful.

64
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.340
I mean they're going to, there's only so far you can,

65
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.520
you could keep going down that road. Right?

66
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.520
You want to make sure that you have free expression and you don't get free

67
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.354
expression.

68
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.970
If you ban people from saying things that just don't seem that bad to me.

69
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.840
Well, I mean, Alex Jones, you think a Hispanic, I'd like to see what he says.

70
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.350
Sandy hook stuff. Sandy. But see, but here's the thing. Getting sued for that.

71
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.540
Anyway, here's the thing. Yeah. He was already getting sued for that.

72
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.520
Like what did he say that got him?

73
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.990
I think something happened that he did had nothing to do with even what he said.

74
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.930
He confronted them at some events. Right?

75
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:12.931
And he was yelling in the back and that happened after he confronted people in

76
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.420
Congress. Well, he's got a,

77
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:20.380
Alex Jones has a regular on a former CIA officer,

78
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.250
dr Steve [inaudible]. He has him on like once every six months.

79
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.400
That's where he got the Sandy hook information was from him.

80
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.090
That dude is on video as a CIA guy know about Sandy hook.

81
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:35.170
The fuck would he know that's a dumbest fucking thing that Alex Jones has ever

82
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:39.490
done. It's also a moral, and there's parents who said, fuck dr Steve,

83
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.830
that guy, fuck whatever. If he said it didn't fuck [inaudible] yeah.

84
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.950
You have to always wonder and you would you, I mean,

85
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.720
I'm not making any accusations,

86
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.000
but you'd have to always wonder when you hear a story like that,

87
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.970
why would someone say something so ridiculous?

88
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.950
And why would someone try to convince someone like Alex Jones of something so

89
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:03.090
ridiculous? And I think there'd be two reasons. One to discredit Jones.

90
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.540
If you could talk him into repeating what you said,

91
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.610
if you think he's willing to do, that's interesting.

92
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.420
You can easily discredit him and it would be a really good way to do it.

93
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.930
Like the best way to do it. Okay. Do you know what I'm saying?

94
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:17.600
Whether he's right or wrong, whether he's right or wrong,

95
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.530
doctors deep paternics said it several times on the show, so,

96
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.060
but he's not Alex for Alex to believe him. No, it started like this,

97
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.901
that crazy Eddie,

98
00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:29.420
he's hearing it from a guy who was in the CIA started like this.

99
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:32.570
It started out crazy for him to believe in a guy from, you know,

100
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.630
he may or may not be right, but it started with Alex actually saying, uh, uh,

101
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.580
he said, unfortunately he goes something to the effect of I saw it,

102
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.010
it was very sad. And then,

103
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.090
but unfortunately I've seen a lot of soap operas and I've seen a lot of and,

104
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.421
and,

105
00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:52.421
and I know an actor when I see one and that's where it started with him and he's

106
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:56.980
being, you know, he's being sued by Connecticut. He's in trouble,

107
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.980
be a good acting coach.

108
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.850
But remember he knows an act [inaudible] in court and they said, what the fuck?

109
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.650
Basically, what the fuck are you doing? He goes, listen,

110
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.380
I say a lot of things just for entertaining of course.

111
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.230
Like it's just for the during, is that his trial with his wife?

112
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.220
He did admit, he's like, uh, I don't believe it.

113
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.160
A lot of that I just say he's got a business. Yeah,

114
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.130
well that's the thing about all a lot of nutrition people,

115
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.730
a lot of these people is you make money. You make money in this,

116
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.130
in this business. And whether, whatever it is,

117
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:26.900
whether it's being a political pundit,

118
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.730
whether it's being attainment or an exercise guy, you make money having answers.

119
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.850
If you're somebody who's more scientific and says, I dunno, it depends.

120
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:38.660
Maybe you're not going to make money. When you say bone broth cures cancer,

121
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.240
you're going to sell books. When you say, uh,

122
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.860
my plant based diet is proven to do blah, blah, blah, whatever,

123
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:47.870
you're going to make money. If you say, I'm going to,

124
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.950
I'll help you lose weight and keep it off in four month, take my money,

125
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.520
you're not going to say, Hey, I'm a nutritionist guy.

126
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.770
It's going to take you two years. We're going to try to change life.

127
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.380
You're gonna have bounce backs. You're gonna have plateaus and being realistic.

128
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.520
Yeah, nobody's going to buy that shit.

129
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.530
This your Dawn guy has got a movement man. So, but with, uh,

130
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.690
with Alex Jones, is he banned for life or I don't know how a business, well,

131
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.800
I mean, he still has his website.

132
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.750
He's got a big lawsuit he's got gotta worry about,

133
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.800
but it shows they got rid of his show happen all the farmers. And shit. No,

134
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.070
the only thing that happened is they pulled him off of YouTube and they pulled

135
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:27.071
him off at Twitter and Facebook to an iTunes and he's got a major lawsuit with

136
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.610
law firm that doesn't compromise. There's tears. There's two guys,

137
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.950
there's two guys that are being sued over that. Uh,

138
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.550
Alex Jones and a guy name a Wolf gang.

139
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.870
Helbig he's also, he's also being sued. That guy,

140
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.970
his job was to prepare schools for, uh, school shootings.

141
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.290
So he came out and he started saying that too. So he's, he's breaking apart.

142
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.740
He started saying that San Diego, he's getting,

143
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.070
he's getting sued along with Alex Jones. Oh my God. Well,

144
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.090
but they didn't show up for when you went to court. They'd never showed up.

145
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.050
So they dropped the case. What about one thing about the law law?

146
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.650
It's kind of weird now that they're, they have,

147
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.280
why would Sandy hook be fake? Let's not talk about this stuff. Oh, I don't know.

148
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.120
I find it fascinating. Well, like why in the world would it be fake though be,

149
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.070
I know you get wrapped up like what's the conspiracy?

150
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.640
Zero zero thoughts that that is fake.

151
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.150
But I do have thoughts on why someone would try to get other people to say it's

152
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:29.540
fake. And this if there's any,

153
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.320
if there's anything that's ever going to convince you that conspiracy theories

154
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:37.640
are stupid, it's making up a fake conspiracy,

155
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.200
an easily provable fake conspiracy about a real tragedy. That's a nice,

156
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:45.470
simple psychological way to discredit people.

157
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.110
If I thought you were a dumb ass but you had a big voice,

158
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.350
I might talk you into saying some shit about something that's not real and have

159
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:56.280
you convinced it's real. So you spout it out, you look like a moron, right?

160
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.180
And that discredits everything else you said.

161
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.690
And you have to be really careful with a lot of these stories.

162
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:01.500
There's a lot of these,

163
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.860
these conspiracy theories that literally start out a joke.

164
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.690
They start out in four Chan and a lot of these chat rooms as trolls and then

165
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:10.501
before you know it,

166
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:14.010
it becomes a real thing that's said over and over and so said over and over

167
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.910
again and then morons get ahold of. But [inaudible] true, right?

168
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.640
Like he's a smart, we can all agree he's a, I don't agree.

169
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.490
What do you mean you don't think he's, I don't know to do what he's doing.

170
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:28.200
Listen, I don't ever talk about stuff [inaudible] no, no.

171
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.730
You would not say he's a dumb person. I don't know. I, I can't speak.

172
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:35.340
Pretty articulate. Yeah. He's not stupid. Like I'm very,

173
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.270
very sad that he said that Sandy hook isn't real. I fuck with him.

174
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.310
But I always enjoy being around that guy.

175
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.610
You would say he's articulate smart guy. Right? He's a fun guy too. Yeah.

176
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.350
So I'm just saying for him to,

177
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.230
it's not like you can just honey Dick and be like, dude, Sandy hook.

178
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:53.130
Like it would have to be something. He loves conspiracies, man. You know,

179
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.180
he really does.

180
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.230
And this is the problem with someone who likes hunts out conspiracies.

181
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.560
You're going to love them, you're going to, you're gonna look for them.

182
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.280
[inaudible] numerology and the Bible. You can find any pattern.

183
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.390
This is the problem is when you have a vested interest in them being real,

184
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.320
when it's your business, because there are a lot of them that are real.

185
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:17.400
So the problem is if you have a vested interest in them being real and you

186
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:21.540
exclude information that would point to them not being real and you use

187
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:25.830
confirmation bias and you fuck up and then you try to convince other people that

188
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:28.380
you're correct. This is something that people will fall.

189
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.760
[inaudible] I'd love to hear you on. You're super quiet about all this,

190
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.570
but if you're a conspiracy theory, which ones have been proven correct?

191
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.640
That many, right? There's plenty. Absolutely. There's big ones like Enron,

192
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.820
you know, there's big ones. There's big ones. You know, there's uh,

193
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.300
many documentaries and books have been written on the, the Enron conspiracy.

194
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.960
These guys got together and they figured out how to make a kajillion dollars and

195
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:53.970
fuck people over. And it was, it was,

196
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.390
it was breaking the law and they knew it was breaking law.

197
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.200
They conspire to do it and by names and phone so you can take, take them.

198
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.430
There's wise people to think the 2008 hires, housing crisis, that that was the,

199
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:09.510
that was all on purpose. These guys built this bubble up and it's proven though.

200
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.470
It's not proven. It's not proven. The housing bubble was,

201
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.440
there've been great books written on it by Michael Lewis's book, the big shorts,

202
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:20.790
a good book on it. Yeah. But you know, there's been a lot of research on that.

203
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:25.350
Too many bank. Is there any proven ones but it all depends.

204
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.860
Bread and despise again? No, no, no, no, no. And he knows his shit.

205
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.300
It all depends on how much circumstantial evidence, uh,

206
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.550
makes you throw up some red flags.

207
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.340
Like some people they just don't see the red flags and some people,

208
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.190
their red flags go up right away. So it all depends.

209
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:45.780
Like when you say is there any proof? Well, um, you don't need,

210
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.710
uh, I mean at,

211
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.130
at a certain point when you have circumstantial evidence,

212
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.110
at a certain point it adds up. You know, you know,

213
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:01.270
if I'm one of case, pretty suspect JFK suspect is fucked.

214
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.720
There's no look Jeff K's a perfect example, right? Yeah.

215
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.430
There's no actual proof of the conspiracy that there was a, you know,

216
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:14.410
multiple shooters or the CIA and the mob. There's no actual proof,

217
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.980
but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence. Right. So it all depends on,

218
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.390
it all depends on how much circumstantial evidence do you need for any

219
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.210
particular conspiracy theory where you go, Oh shit,

220
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.360
there's enough circumstantial evidence. Like if there was a murder, right,

221
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.540
and you were being accused and only one person said, you know,

222
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.020
I saw Brendan like four blocks away from the restaurant where his friend was

223
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.120
killed. If just that one person saw it.

224
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:40.810
That's one piece of circumstantial evidence. That's not enough to convict you.

225
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.160
But if a hundred people said they saw you two blocks away in the parking lot,

226
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.430
none of it alone, none of it standing alone will put you in jail.

227
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.730
But at a certain point, enough circumstantial evidence,

228
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.630
we'll put dudes in jail or if enough people tell the same story about you,

229
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.480
like with Cosby, it was the same story over and over.

230
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.280
It's like not all these women can't be,

231
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.030
they're all telling the exact same story about the same MOU. Well not only that,

232
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:08.170
Cosby had gone to court and had a lawsuit sealed and paid her woman off.

233
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.860
That's right. I get it. It already had been to the deposition so that, yeah,

234
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:15.340
so this was a part of the whole thing was that he had to come out and uh,

235
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.100
you know, the, the had to defend that in his most recent trial.

236
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.970
Bill Clinton too. I just got done watching those Monica Lewinsky tapes. Yeah.

237
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.190
Bill Quinn was a freak. Oh yeah. Dude.

238
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.550
Do you know that the only problem with like being but like it sounded like Alex

239
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.480
Jones who makes a lot of money off his conspiracies and things is that if once

240
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:35.740
he says something, I know a pretty good fan of his Alex. And um,

241
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.850
what the problem is once you say something and you have that big of a following,

242
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.130
right? So let's just say you float out of conspiracy,

243
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:43.810
but then you look at evidence and you start to realize,

244
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.510
maybe I overstepped my boss, we all say things we wish we hadn't,

245
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.433
or we all say things.

246
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.940
But now you've got a whole movement behind what you said now to try to pull back

247
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.140
with turn that 25% of the whoever it is against you.

248
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.120
And that can be a liability too.

249
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:00.910
So one of the things about being a public figure is you can say something and if

250
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:04.840
you're selling product and selling your show on, you better be all in.

251
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:05.770
You better stay all that.

252
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.120
So you become a prisoner to your own kind of first impulse or your own first

253
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:14.050
sort of like, no matter how Atlanta, especially if he's also an entertainer,

254
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.080
it's also this rush to say you'd know something when you don't know it is a rush

255
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:23.620
to say there's a rush to say, we absolutely know this happened.

256
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.360
We absolutely know that happened cause

257
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.400
[inaudible] to get it from somewhere. He has his sources.

258
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.630
What gets probably got information on on the, on these, you know,

259
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:37.570
these tragic events or something like that or you don't think there'll be,

260
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.130
I just looking at Brandon, listen, I think he has some people in trouble. No,

261
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:46.420
I'm not. Don't take your bait, Eddie. He's floating the fucking huge worm out.

262
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.160
[inaudible]

263
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.790
<v 1>come on this show and try not to talk about conspiracy theories,</v>

264
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:59.760
but I always get sucked back into them. I always get sucked back to,

265
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.150
I'm not, but look, look, he's there. Legit question. I don't know.

266
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.930
You're asking super crazy legit questions.
