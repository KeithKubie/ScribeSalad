This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Pacifico Beer.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.430
Ahhhhhh!

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:18.730
It’s Shark Week! Get on board.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.740
Happy Shark Week everyone, I'm Trace thanks
for tuning in to DNews. When you think of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:33.120
shark week, you think of this, but what is
happening when a shark does this?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.649
The Great White Shark is one of the most spectacular
specimens around. They can grow up to 26 ft

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.929
long (8m) and weigh as much as 7,300 pounds
(3,300 kg); that's more than 2 and a half

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.220
Honda Civics, by the way. Shark breaching
looks incredible, but they don't jump out

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.379
of the water just to please the camera. Sharks
are an ancient animal, even older than dinosaurs.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.030
Their evolution has slowly molded them into
these amazing, heavily muscled carnivorous

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.020
fish. They eat seals, rays, squid, bony fish,
dolphins, whales and even smaller sharks,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.590
and some of their prey is extremely quick
and agile. Seals can "sprint" as fast as 27

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.660
miles per hour (44 kph), and though the great
white can sprint up to 35, they don't have

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.080
the zippy agility of a smaller, seal.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.920
Great white sharks have fantastic eyesight,
their rod-to-cone ratio is similar to humans,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.640
but they have a reflective layer in the back
of their eyeball. This means they can see

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.280
in color, and in bright or low light. They
use that, plus their SUPER strong muscley

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.780
body to sneak up on seals swimming near the
surface. They come up underneath them and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.960
// same clip of breach

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
Yeah, it's pretty cray. A 2011 study in Marine
Biology Research looked at the physics of

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.600
this behavior by studying 121 breaching strikes.
The shark uses their incredible eyes (among

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.310
other senses like electrolocation) to pinpoint
a fur seal, and plan an attack. Coming up

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.850
from underneath hides their approach from
the seal, especially if the seal's head is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.579
above water. The great white will use its
muscular tail to accelerate, launching itself

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.209
jaws first at the unsuspecting prey on an
arc. The researchers measured an escape trajectory

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:29.749
for one shark of about 45º so they're coming
at a pretty strong angle. Their research found

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.420
the sharks could achieve almost 4 seconds
of hang time, again, remember, these things

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.090
are HUGE… This whole process takes only
a few seconds, which is why it's so difficult

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.090
to capture on film.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.510
According to the researchers, the breaching
behavior incapacitates the seal, and delivers

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.099
a catastrophic blow, but that's not all. They
also discovered, males breach more often than

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.860
females, but since females are actually LARGER
than males this might serve to antagonize

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.189
and intimidate other males, too.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.239
Okay, one more. *ernie laugh*

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.659
