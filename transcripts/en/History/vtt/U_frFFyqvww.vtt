00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.210
NARRATOR: On January 18, 2017,
at the National History Museum

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.170
of Transylvania, ancient
astronaut theorists Giorgio

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.120
Tsoukalos and Eric von
Daniken were offered

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.040
a rare opportunity to
get a firsthand look

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.290
at the Wedge of Aiud.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.040
Museum curator Anna Gruia
has taken it out of a storage

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.830
locker where it has
been deliberately

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.420
hidden from the public
since the early 1970s.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.920
OK, I'm just going
to put my gloves on.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.880
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
This is great.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.710
ANA GRUIA: So this is it.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.750
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Oh,
OK, this is strange.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.580
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
It's very heavy.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.040
Touch it.
Take it.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.420
It's heavy.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.920
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Wow.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.500
This was found at a
depth of 10 meters, which

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.750
is about 30 feet in the ground.
ANA GRUIA: Yes.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.000
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Yes, and here this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.040
is where they took
the sample out

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.290
in here to make the analysis.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.580
And here, you see two pieces
that are broken off sort of.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.420
So maybe it was attached or
something, but very strange.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.040
So what does the museum
have to say about this?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.620
This is a very strange piece.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.880
It is.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.750
It is a strange
piece for us as well.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.210
As historians, we do not
consider it a historical object

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.710
that we're used to.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.040
We don't know what
it was used for,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.250
and we acknowledge these
uncertainties about its dating

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.460
and its composition as well.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.540
ERICH VON DANIKEN: So for
what can you use this?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.620
It looks like a
hammer or a shovel.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.330
But, Giorgio, what is the
word in English [non-english]??

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.170
Oh, an excavator tooth.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.830
Well, it looks like this.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.330
It could have been
something like this.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.250
But these excavator tubes are
never made out of aluminium.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.580
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
No, it's too weak.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.120
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
Aluminium is too soft.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.080
They are made out of steel,
especially hard steel.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.960
So it could not be that.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.500
So we have a real mystery here.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330
But you see this patina
over this whole object?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.000
And this creates
another problem.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.170
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Yes, because
you cannot fake a patina.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.620
It's impossible to
artificially create a patina.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.830
NARRATOR: The patina is a
thin coating of various metal

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.330
compounds that
forms on the surface

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.670
of the metal during exposure
to atmospheric elements.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.830
The older the
object, the thicker

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.710
the patina layer will be.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.290
It takes hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.380
of years for a thick
layer of patina,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.880
as this apparently
is, for it to develop.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.040
Yes, we agree.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.790
There are two basic
problems-- one,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.040
that aluminum was not
invented at the age when

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.540
we presume this was in use.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.040
And second, it's the
patina, as you noted.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.540
ERICH VON DANIKEN: Which
speaks for the date,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.170
for the age of it.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.210
So we still have
a mystery here.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.540
Thank you very much for
showing us this object,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.750
because I know that there was a
time when nobody knew where it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.880
was, somewhere in a box in the
back, which means present-day

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.710
archeology has a problem.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.330
And they're doing
magnificent work.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.000
But when something like
this comes along, you know,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.330
we should investigate
this and not

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.380
put it in a box in the back.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.920
Definitely.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.210
It did depend on mentalities
and official position.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.000
ERICH VON DANIKEN: Yes.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.580
[chuckling]

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.920
It isn't currently
exhibited because we

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.040
have to admit as
historians that we do

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.000
not know more details about it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.040
For us, it's just
baffling at this point.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.210
But taking the logic further,
this conflicting information

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.290
could have just two
solutions so far--

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.790
one, that it is
really not so old.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.420
And the context is
irrelevant, and the patina

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.960
was somehow produced in
special circumstances.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.040
So it's a new object,
strangely preserved, let's say.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.290
And the second option
is, of course, that it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.790
not of terrestrial origin.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.460
In all of your
adventures, how does

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.920
this compare to some
of the other things

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.790
that are inexplicable?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.710
I am helpless.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.210
I have no idea.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.210
That says it all right
there, very bizarre.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.960
Bizarre.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.620
I've known about this thing
since the early 1990s.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.920
And I have to tell you that
looking at it in person

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.830
was a dream come true.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.670
And it's a very strange thing.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.330
I mean, how do you explain this?

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
It certainly looks as if it
was part of a larger object.
