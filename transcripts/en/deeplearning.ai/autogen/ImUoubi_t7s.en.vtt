in the audio clip so phonemes are the
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539
in the audio clip so phonemes are the
basic units of sound so for example the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
basic units of sound so for example the
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789

those and then you string together
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490
those and then you string together
phonemes to form individual words and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
phonemes to form individual words and
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499

in some of the intermediate components
 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.350
in some of the intermediate components
it turns out that one of the challenges

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360
it turns out that one of the challenges

that incentive learning is that you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
that incentive learning is that you
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.850
that incentive learning is that you
might need a lot of data before works

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
might need a lot of data before works
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.040
might need a lot of data before works
well so for example if you're training

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
well so for example if you're training
 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.500
well so for example if you're training
on three thousand dollars of data to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
on three thousand dollars of data to
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.180
on three thousand dollars of data to
build a stage recognition system then

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190
build a stage recognition system then
 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.040
build a stage recognition system then
the traditional pipeline there's full

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050
the traditional pipeline there's full
 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050

approach then suddenly starts to work

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600
approach then suddenly starts to work
 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.180
approach then suddenly starts to work
really well so when you have a smaller

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
really well so when you have a smaller
 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.729
really well so when you have a smaller
data set the more traditional pipeline

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870
large dataset 240 end-to-end approach
 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.070
large dataset 240 end-to-end approach
really shines and if you have a medium

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
really shines and if you have a medium
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.449
really shines and if you have a medium

neural network and then have some other
 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.569
neural network and then have some other
stages as well so there's be a step

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579
stages as well so there's be a step
 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.250
stages as well so there's be a step
toward end-to-end learning but not

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
toward end-to-end learning but not
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:30.720
toward end-to-end learning but not

the person approaching the gate and if
 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.470
the person approaching the gate and if
it recognizes a person then you know the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480
it recognizes a person then you know the

increasingly many offices in China and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920
increasingly many offices in China and
 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.650
increasingly many offices in China and
hopefully one more in other countries as

well you can just approach the turnstile

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150
well you can just approach the turnstile
 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.670
well you can just approach the turnstile
and if it recognizes your face it just

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680
and if it recognizes your face it just
 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.069
and if it recognizes your face it just
lets you through without needing you to

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079
lets you through without needing you to
 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.550
lets you through without needing you to
carry an ID badge so how do you build a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
carry an ID badge so how do you build a
 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.190
carry an ID badge so how do you build a
system like this well one thing you

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200
system like this well one thing you
 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.830
system like this well one thing you
could do is just look at the image that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
could do is just look at the image that
 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.140
could do is just look at the image that
the camera is capturing all right so I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150
the camera is capturing all right so I
 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.090
the camera is capturing all right so I
guess is my bad drawing but maybe this

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100
guess is my bad drawing but maybe this
 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.890
guess is my bad drawing but maybe this
is a camera image and you know you have

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
is a camera image and you know you have
 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.319
is a camera image and you know you have
someone very approaching the turnstile

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329
someone very approaching the turnstile
 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.030
someone very approaching the turnstile
so this might be the image

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040
so this might be the image
 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.280
so this might be the image
X billion zillion camera is capturing

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290
X billion zillion camera is capturing
 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.110
X billion zillion camera is capturing
and one thing you could do is try to

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
and one thing you could do is try to
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.630
and one thing you could do is try to
learn a function mapping directly from

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640
learn a function mapping directly from
 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.240
learn a function mapping directly from
the image X to the identity of the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250
the image X to the identity of the
 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.970
the image X to the identity of the
person Y but turns out this is not the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980
person Y but turns out this is not the
 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.820
person Y but turns out this is not the
best approach and one of the problems is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830
best approach and one of the problems is
 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.290
best approach and one of the problems is
that you know the person approaching the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300
that you know the person approaching the
 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.030
that you know the person approaching the
turnstile can approach them lots of

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040
turnstile can approach them lots of
 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.290
turnstile can approach them lots of
different directions so there could be

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300
different directions so there could be
 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.360
different directions so there could be
it's a green position to get of a blue

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370
it's a green position to get of a blue
 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.070
it's a green position to get of a blue
position you're and sometimes they're

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080
position you're and sometimes they're
 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.810
position you're and sometimes they're
closer to the camera so they appear

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820
closer to the camera so they appear
 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.910
closer to the camera so they appear
bigger and DMH and sometimes they're

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920
bigger and DMH and sometimes they're
 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.530
bigger and DMH and sometimes they're
already closer to the camera so their

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540
already closer to the camera so their
 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.260
already closer to the camera so their
face appears much bigger so what is

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270
face appears much bigger so what is
 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.090
face appears much bigger so what is
actually done to build these turnstiles

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100
actually done to build these turnstiles
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.950
actually done to build these turnstiles
is not to just take the raw images and

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960
is not to just take the raw images and
 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960
is not to just take the raw images and
feed it on your net to try to figure out

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
feed it on your net to try to figure out
 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.020

of software to detect the person's face

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830
of software to detect the person's face
 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.250
of software to detect the person's face
so this first the detector to figure out

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260
so this first the detector to figure out
 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.380

where is the person's face having

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390
where is the person's face having
 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.930
where is the person's face having
detected the person's face you then zoom

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940
detected the person's face you then zoom
 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:24.360
detected the person's face you then zoom
in to that part of the image and crop

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370
in to that part of the image and crop
 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.060
in to that part of the image and crop
that image so that the person's face is

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070
that image so that the person's face is
 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.510
that image so that the person's face is
centered then it is this picture so I

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520
centered then it is this picture so I
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.370
centered then it is this picture so I
guess I drew here in red this is then

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380

they're actually two reasons for that

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770
they're actually two reasons for that
 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.350
they're actually two reasons for that
one is that each of the two problems

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360
one is that each of the two problems
 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.580
one is that each of the two problems
you're solving is actually much simpler

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590
you're solving is actually much simpler
 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.580
you're solving is actually much simpler
the second is that you have a lot of

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590
the second is that you have a lot of
 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:12.110
the second is that you have a lot of
data for each of the two sub toss in

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120
data for each of the two sub toss in
 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.750
data for each of the two sub toss in
particular there is a lot of data you

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760
particular there is a lot of data you
 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.480
particular there is a lot of data you
can obtain for face detection for toss

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490
can obtain for face detection for toss
 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.820
can obtain for face detection for toss
one over here where the toss is to look

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830
one over here where the toss is to look
 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.290
one over here where the toss is to look
at an image and figure out you know

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300
at an image and figure out you know
 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.880
at an image and figure out you know
where is the person's face in the image

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890
where is the person's face in the image
 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.120
where is the person's face in the image
so there is a lot of data but there is a

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130
so there is a lot of data but there is a
 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.430
so there is a lot of data but there is a
lot of label data X comma Y where X is a

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440
lot of label data X comma Y where X is a
 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.830
lot of label data X comma Y where X is a
picture and Y shows the position of the

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840
picture and Y shows the position of the
 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.990
picture and Y shows the position of the
person space so you could build a neural

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000
person space so you could build a neural
 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.060
person space so you could build a neural

network to do task one quite well and
then separately there's a lot of data

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510
then separately there's a lot of data
 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.370
then separately there's a lot of data

off there are many many steps you then
 

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:06.290
off there are many many steps you then
output say a translation of the English

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300

for machine translation and that's
 

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.559
for machine translation and that's
because today it is possible to get a

estimating a child from an x-ray is less
 

00:09:57.149 --> 00:09:58.639
estimating a child from an x-ray is less
dramatic than just crime scene

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:58.649

developing normally but a non end-to-end
 

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:10.189
developing normally but a non end-to-end
approach to this would be revoking an

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:10.199
approach to this would be revoking an
 

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:12.470
approach to this would be revoking an
image and then you segment out or

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480
image and then you segment out or
 

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.749
image and then you segment out or
recognize the bones so know just try to

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:14.759
recognize the bones so know just try to
 

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.730
recognize the bones so know just try to
figure out where is that bone segment

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740
figure out where is that bone segment
 

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.049
figure out where is that bone segment
where at that bone segment where at that

00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:18.059
where at that bone segment where at that
 

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:20.749
where at that bone segment where at that
bone segment and so on and then knowing

00:10:20.749 --> 00:10:20.759
bone segment and so on and then knowing
 

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.490
bone segment and so on and then knowing
the length of the different bones you

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500
the length of the different bones you
 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.559
the length of the different bones you
can sort of go to a lookup table showing

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:24.569
can sort of go to a lookup table showing
 

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:26.749
can sort of go to a lookup table showing
the average bone lengths in a child's

00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:26.759
the average bone lengths in a child's
 

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:29.780
the average bone lengths in a child's
hand and then use that to estimate a

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:29.790
hand and then use that to estimate a
 

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.280
hand and then use that to estimate a
child's age and so this approach

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:31.290
child's age and so this approach
 

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.410
child's age and so this approach
actually works pretty well in contrast

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420
actually works pretty well in contrast
 

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.360
actually works pretty well in contrast

to their child's age then you would need

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940
to their child's age then you would need
 

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.660
to their child's age then you would need
a lot of data to do that directly and as

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:41.670
a lot of data to do that directly and as
 

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.240
a lot of data to do that directly and as
far as I know this approach does not

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.250
far as I know this approach does not
 

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.220
far as I know this approach does not
work as well today just because there

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.230
work as well today just because there
 

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.320
work as well today just because there
isn't enough data to train this toss

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.330
isn't enough data to train this toss
 

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.640
isn't enough data to train this toss
into end fashion whereas in contrast you

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:52.650
into end fashion whereas in contrast you
 

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.800
into end fashion whereas in contrast you
can imagine that by breaking down this

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:54.810
can imagine that by breaking down this
 

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.470
can imagine that by breaking down this
problem into two steps step one is a

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480
problem into two steps step one is a
 

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.030
problem into two steps step one is a
relatively simple problem maybe you

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040
relatively simple problem maybe you
 

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.560
relatively simple problem maybe you
don't need that much data read only

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:00.570
don't need that much data read only
 

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.900
don't need that much data read only
damning x-ray images to segment out the

lessons of that without too much data

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860
lessons of that without too much data
 

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.980
lessons of that without too much data
so there's multi-step approach it seems

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:12.990
so there's multi-step approach it seems
 

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.260
so there's multi-step approach it seems
we are promising maybe more promising

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.270
we are promising maybe more promising
 

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.670
we are promising maybe more promising
than the end-to-end approach at least
