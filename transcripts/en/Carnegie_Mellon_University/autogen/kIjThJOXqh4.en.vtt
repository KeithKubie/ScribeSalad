the software allowed us to kind of zoom
 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.330
the software allowed us to kind of zoom
in amongst these tiled images and and

you that don't know this is not to scale
 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.630
you that don't know this is not to scale
and this does represent our solar system

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:41.640
and this does represent our solar system
 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.940
and this does represent our solar system
so you know here's here's us here's the

our targets we're not going to go out to
the main asteroid belt any time real

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.590
the main asteroid belt any time real
 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.030
the main asteroid belt any time real
soon but we'll talk about it so going

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.040
soon but we'll talk about it so going
 

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.800
soon but we'll talk about it so going
back to Mars a little bit what's our

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:10.810
back to Mars a little bit what's our
 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.469
back to Mars a little bit what's our
next step as I was talking to people at

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479
next step as I was talking to people at
 

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:18.060
next step as I was talking to people at
lunch you know it was maybe not a common

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.070
lunch you know it was maybe not a common
 

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.340
lunch you know it was maybe not a common
understanding of our plan because NASA

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.350
understanding of our plan because NASA
 

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.170
understanding of our plan because NASA
barely has a common understanding of our

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.180
barely has a common understanding of our
 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.110
barely has a common understanding of our
plan because this is actually pretty

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120
plan because this is actually pretty
 

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.930
plan because this is actually pretty
recent we just cut a deal where NASA and

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:27.940
recent we just cut a deal where NASA and
 

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.000
recent we just cut a deal where NASA and
the European Space Agency have agreed to

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.010
the European Space Agency have agreed to
 

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.579
the European Space Agency have agreed to
a joint Mars exploration investment

a joint Mars exploration investment
 

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:34.909
a joint Mars exploration investment
program which is really good because

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919
program which is really good because
 

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.380
program which is really good because
Europeans do some some wonderful stuff

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:37.390
Europeans do some some wonderful stuff
 

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.779
Europeans do some some wonderful stuff
and so we're combining investments and

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:39.789
and so we're combining investments and
 

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.670
and so we're combining investments and
combining vehicles and systems and we've

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680
combining vehicles and systems and we've
 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.020
combining vehicles and systems and we've
got some wonderful things in the

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.030
got some wonderful things in the

about that but I am going to talk about
 

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.270
about that but I am going to talk about
this one which is called the Mars

Island you know they were there for a

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:03.339
Island you know they were there for a
 

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:04.949

three-hour to wear these were there for
 

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.809
three-hour to wear these were there for
a three-month tour and they never left

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:08.819
a three-month tour and they never left
 

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:11.639
a three-month tour and they never left
right so they're still there they're

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:11.649
right so they're still there they're
 

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:14.249
right so they're still there they're
still operating one of them's dug a hole

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:14.259
still operating one of them's dug a hole
 

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:15.990
still operating one of them's dug a hole
for itself and it just kind of sitting

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000
for itself and it just kind of sitting
 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.889
for itself and it just kind of sitting
around the other ones still moving and

more like the Humvee right that's that's

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:46.660
more like the Humvee right that's that's
 

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.420
more like the Humvee right that's that's
what they're shooting for and you know

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.430
what they're shooting for and you know
 

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.100
what they're shooting for and you know
it has all the right words right its

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.110
it has all the right words right its
 

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.790

nuclear powered and you know really big

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800
nuclear powered and you know really big
 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.819
nuclear powered and you know really big
and beefy one of the key things here is

00:09:56.819 --> 00:09:56.829
and beefy one of the key things here is
 

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.590
and beefy one of the key things here is
again we're going to have one of these

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600
again we're going to have one of these
 

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.210
again we're going to have one of these
masks and robotic cameras and lo and

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.220
masks and robotic cameras and lo and
 

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.119
masks and robotic cameras and lo and
behold you know it's called am a scam

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:06.129
behold you know it's called am a scam
 

00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:08.670
behold you know it's called am a scam
and and we're going to use it to take

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680
and and we're going to use it to take
 

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.129
and and we're going to use it to take
big panoramas we're going to use it to

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:11.139
big panoramas we're going to use it to
 

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:14.460
big panoramas we're going to use it to
take big three deep aneurysms and we're

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.470
take big three deep aneurysms and we're
 

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.869
take big three deep aneurysms and we're
going to use it to take something that

00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:15.879
going to use it to take something that
 

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:19.679
going to use it to take something that
we haven't done before which is not

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:19.689
we haven't done before which is not
 

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:23.340
we haven't done before which is not
often noticed we don't take video has

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.350
often noticed we don't take video has
 

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.549
often noticed we don't take video has
anybody noticed that NASA does not take

00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:26.559
anybody noticed that NASA does not take
 

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:29.189
anybody noticed that NASA does not take
video we do it in low Earth orbit don't

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:29.199
video we do it in low Earth orbit don't
 

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:32.240
video we do it in low Earth orbit don't
get me wrong but we've never taken video

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.250
get me wrong but we've never taken video
 

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.480
get me wrong but we've never taken video
on another planet why is that well

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.490
on another planet why is that well
 

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.160
on another planet why is that well
because video tends to be much much

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.170
because video tends to be much much
 

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.439
because video tends to be much much
lower resolution that the technology

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:40.449
lower resolution that the technology
 

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:43.170
lower resolution that the technology
really wasn't there you know you could

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.180
really wasn't there you know you could
 

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.809
really wasn't there you know you could
bring back a canister a film but you

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:45.819
bring back a canister a film but you
 

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:46.559
bring back a canister a film but you
know if you wanted to take a

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:46.569
know if you wanted to take a
 

00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:50.429
know if you wanted to take a
high-definition video in the past it had

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:50.439
high-definition video in the past it had
 

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:52.650
high-definition video in the past it had
to be you know photographic plates it

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:52.660
to be you know photographic plates it
 

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.350
to be you know photographic plates it
was not something you do and you just

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360
was not something you do and you just
 

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.420
was not something you do and you just
couldn't pull the emmitt the data off

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.430
couldn't pull the emmitt the data off
 

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.730
couldn't pull the emmitt the data off
the pixel off the the ccd quick enough

00:10:59.730 --> 00:10:59.740
the pixel off the the ccd quick enough
 

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.740
the pixel off the the ccd quick enough
right now you can that's common

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:01.750
right now you can that's common
 

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.019
right now you can that's common
technology you've got these HD cameras

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:04.029
technology you've got these HD cameras
 

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.480
technology you've got these HD cameras
that you can buy so NASA is basically

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:06.490
that you can buy so NASA is basically
 

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.929
that you can buy so NASA is basically
flying one of these I think it's five

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:09.939
flying one of these I think it's five
 

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:12.269
flying one of these I think it's five
frames per second at a high res and 15

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279
frames per second at a high res and 15
 

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.799
frames per second at a high res and 15
frames per second we think at a lower

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:13.809
frames per second we think at a lower
 

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:16.379
frames per second we think at a lower
res so we're actually going to have the

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:16.389
res so we're actually going to have the
 

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:19.469
res so we're actually going to have the
ability to actually capture dynamic

00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:19.479
ability to actually capture dynamic
 

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.899
ability to actually capture dynamic
information on the surface of another

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:21.909
information on the surface of another
 

00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:23.849
information on the surface of another
planet I think that's tremendously

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:23.859
planet I think that's tremendously
 

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:26.249
planet I think that's tremendously
exciting at high res right now we take

00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:26.259
exciting at high res right now we take
 

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:29.549
exciting at high res right now we take
snapshots as quickly as we can and we

00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:29.559
snapshots as quickly as we can and we
 

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:32.189
snapshots as quickly as we can and we
can't kompas them together and and run

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:32.199
can't kompas them together and and run
 

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:34.559
can't kompas them together and and run
them and hope nobody notices but it's

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:34.569
them and hope nobody notices but it's
 

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:40.289
them and hope nobody notices but it's
not video okay so going from Mars where

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:40.299
not video okay so going from Mars where
 

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.309
not video okay so going from Mars where
we're going to have some really cool

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:41.319
we're going to have some really cool
 

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:45.469
we're going to have some really cool
camera imagery how else is now so using

00:11:45.469 --> 00:11:45.479
camera imagery how else is now so using
 

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:48.389
camera imagery how else is now so using
images to explore well I want to give

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399
images to explore well I want to give
 

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.829
images to explore well I want to give
you a little bit of a step through here

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839
you a little bit of a step through here
 

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:53.689
you a little bit of a step through here
just so that we are all on the same page

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:53.699
just so that we are all on the same page
 

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:58.049
just so that we are all on the same page
when I'm talking about where else we're

00:11:58.049 --> 00:11:58.059
when I'm talking about where else we're
 

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.269
when I'm talking about where else we're
talking about going one of the places is

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279
talking about going one of the places is
 

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:02.579
talking about going one of the places is
an asteroid now to be specific i'm

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:02.589
an asteroid now to be specific i'm
 

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:03.960
an asteroid now to be specific i'm
talking about what's called a near-earth

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:03.970
talking about what's called a near-earth
 

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.189
talking about what's called a near-earth
asteroid and what i mean by that is its

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:08.199
asteroid and what i mean by that is its
 

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:10.799
asteroid and what i mean by that is its
orbit around the sun is in the vicinity

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:10.809
orbit around the sun is in the vicinity
 

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:13.979
orbit around the sun is in the vicinity
of the orbit of the earth and they align

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:13.989
of the orbit of the earth and they align
 

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:15.869
of the orbit of the earth and they align
every now and then so that it's

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:15.879
every now and then so that it's
 

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.079
every now and then so that it's
relatively close 10 20 million miles

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:18.089
relatively close 10 20 million miles
 

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:22.199
relatively close 10 20 million miles
okay about 20 to 40 times the distance

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:22.209
okay about 20 to 40 times the distance
 

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:24.239
okay about 20 to 40 times the distance
between the Earth in the moon okay so

00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:24.249
between the Earth in the moon okay so
 

00:12:24.249 --> 00:12:27.329
between the Earth in the moon okay so
that's that's close and in our land but

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:27.339
that's that's close and in our land but
 

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:29.849
that's that's close and in our land but
when we're talking about the scale of

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:29.859
when we're talking about the scale of
 

00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:32.219
when we're talking about the scale of
the object right here's the limb of Mars

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:32.229
the object right here's the limb of Mars
 

00:12:32.229 --> 00:12:34.710
the object right here's the limb of Mars
here's a main belt asteroid Ceres which

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720
here's a main belt asteroid Ceres which
 

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.869
here's a main belt asteroid Ceres which
is really kind of a micro planet here's

00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:36.879
is really kind of a micro planet here's
 

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.119
is really kind of a micro planet here's
Vesta we're actually sending a mission

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:39.129
Vesta we're actually sending a mission
 

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:41.759
Vesta we're actually sending a mission
to those it's now called dawn that'll

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:41.769
to those it's now called dawn that'll
 

00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:44.339
to those it's now called dawn that'll
get up get there in the in the next year

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:44.349
get up get there in the in the next year
 

00:12:44.349 --> 00:12:46.199
get up get there in the in the next year
and we'll get some much better than

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:46.209
and we'll get some much better than
 

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:50.339
and we'll get some much better than
these blurry images there's a small rock

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:50.349
these blurry images there's a small rock
 

00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:53.519
these blurry images there's a small rock
here called arrows and a mission called

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:53.529
here called arrows and a mission called
 

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:56.969
here called arrows and a mission called
near went to that that it was a NASA

00:12:56.969 --> 00:12:56.979
near went to that that it was a NASA
 

00:12:56.979 --> 00:12:59.460
near went to that that it was a NASA
mission and it looks like this when we

00:12:59.460 --> 00:12:59.470
mission and it looks like this when we
 

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.769
mission and it looks like this when we
got a close and that's kind of like the

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:01.779
got a close and that's kind of like the
 

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.389
got a close and that's kind of like the
best imagery we have of it right now to

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399
best imagery we have of it right now to
 

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.639
best imagery we have of it right now to
be quite candid and then the Japanese

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:05.649
be quite candid and then the Japanese
 

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:09.149
be quite candid and then the Japanese
are really fabulous 12 a small rock and

00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:09.159
are really fabulous 12 a small rock and
 

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.919
are really fabulous 12 a small rock and
these are just scale I didn't just lose

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:10.929
these are just scale I didn't just lose
 

00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:13.229
these are just scale I didn't just lose
the image that little thing down there

00:13:13.229 --> 00:13:13.239
the image that little thing down there
 

00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:16.529
the image that little thing down there
is eat ikawa which is another near-earth

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:16.539
is eat ikawa which is another near-earth
 

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:18.929
is eat ikawa which is another near-earth
asteroid that the Japanese went to and

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:18.939
asteroid that the Japanese went to and
 

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.659
asteroid that the Japanese went to and
they're very proudly showing their data

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:21.669
they're very proudly showing their data
 

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:23.110
they're very proudly showing their data
and it looks like

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120
and it looks like
 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.890
and it looks like
this kind of a weird broken peanut now

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:26.900
this kind of a weird broken peanut now
 

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.610
this kind of a weird broken peanut now
just for scale this is the biggest thing

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:30.620
just for scale this is the biggest thing
 

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.540
just for scale this is the biggest thing
we've ever built in space and this

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:34.550
we've ever built in space and this
 

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.450
we've ever built in space and this
little thing is you know the Orion

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:37.460
little thing is you know the Orion
 

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.220
little thing is you know the Orion
spacecraft which kind of looks like a

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.230
spacecraft which kind of looks like a
 

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.100
spacecraft which kind of looks like a
fat Apollo spacecraft right so if we're

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.110
fat Apollo spacecraft right so if we're
 

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.390
fat Apollo spacecraft right so if we're
talking about sending a manned mission

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:43.400
talking about sending a manned mission
 

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.400
talking about sending a manned mission
to an asteroid this is a baby and this

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.410
to an asteroid this is a baby and this
 

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.670
to an asteroid this is a baby and this
is what it would look like okay now the

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680
is what it would look like okay now the
 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.430
is what it would look like okay now the
Japanese the mission was called hayabusa

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440
Japanese the mission was called hayabusa
 

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.450

there they collected some some really

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320
there they collected some some really
 

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.670
there they collected some some really
fabulous data and again remember NASA

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680
fabulous data and again remember NASA
 

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.910
fabulous data and again remember NASA
and most of the other spacefaring

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920
and most of the other spacefaring
 

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.010
and most of the other spacefaring
nations when we talk about exploring a

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:09.020
nations when we talk about exploring a
 

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.310
nations when we talk about exploring a
space we explore in pictures we have no

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320
space we explore in pictures we have no
 

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.660
space we explore in pictures we have no
choice but to explore in pictures

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:13.670
choice but to explore in pictures
 

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.340
choice but to explore in pictures
because how else are we going to do it

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.350
because how else are we going to do it
 

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.760
because how else are we going to do it
you know it's it's some visible spectra

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:21.770
you know it's it's some visible spectra
 

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.130
you know it's it's some visible spectra
or some spectrum that we then map back

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:24.140
or some spectrum that we then map back
 

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.660
or some spectrum that we then map back
to a visible spectra so that we can

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:25.670
to a visible spectra so that we can
 

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.360
to a visible spectra so that we can
understand it were visible creatures so

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:28.370
understand it were visible creatures so
 

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.079
understand it were visible creatures so
if you look at the neck in between here

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:32.089
if you look at the neck in between here
 

00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:34.960
if you look at the neck in between here
sorry the neck part and between the two

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:34.970
sorry the neck part and between the two
 

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.210

lobes of this kind of weird

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:37.220
lobes of this kind of weird
 

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.510
lobes of this kind of weird
potato-shaped asteroid they were looking

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:40.520
potato-shaped asteroid they were looking
 

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.180
potato-shaped asteroid they were looking
for a good place to actually do a sample

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.190
for a good place to actually do a sample
 

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.160
for a good place to actually do a sample
where basically the spacecraft was going

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.170
where basically the spacecraft was going
 

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.620
where basically the spacecraft was going
to fly bump into the surface and then

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:47.630
to fly bump into the surface and then
 

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.600
to fly bump into the surface and then
hopefully some particulates would come

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.610
hopefully some particulates would come
 

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.030
hopefully some particulates would come
up they would close a latch and they fly

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040
up they would close a latch and they fly
 

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.070
up they would close a latch and they fly
it back and they have indeed limped back

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.080
it back and they have indeed limped back
 

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.910
it back and they have indeed limped back
to earth did they did a fabulous job

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920
to earth did they did a fabulous job
 

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.050
to earth did they did a fabulous job
getting home but we don't know if

00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.060
getting home but we don't know if
 

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.910
getting home but we don't know if
there's any any samples yet but they

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920
there's any any samples yet but they
 

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.410
there's any any samples yet but they
were targeting this and they were

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:02.420
were targeting this and they were
 

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.970
were targeting this and they were
looking at all these various outcrops

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:03.980
looking at all these various outcrops
 

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.280
looking at all these various outcrops
and you can see how flaky it is right

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:06.290
and you can see how flaky it is right
 

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.970
and you can see how flaky it is right
the lighting is very weird it's a rubble

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:09.980
the lighting is very weird it's a rubble
 

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.320
the lighting is very weird it's a rubble
pile basically is what it looks like so

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.330
pile basically is what it looks like so
 

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.690
pile basically is what it looks like so
what they got is they got limited

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:16.700
what they got is they got limited

at 80 meters you could see this here's

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:21.230
at 80 meters you could see this here's
 

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.890
at 80 meters you could see this here's
the kind of meter scale bar and this is

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:23.900
the kind of meter scale bar and this is
 

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.699
the kind of meter scale bar and this is

there now one of the things that they're

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480
there now one of the things that they're
 

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.720
there now one of the things that they're
doing is they're actually attempting to

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:43.730
doing is they're actually attempting to
 

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.730
doing is they're actually attempting to
put this into full mosaics they haven't

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:45.740
put this into full mosaics they haven't
 

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.590
put this into full mosaics they haven't
got there yet we're trying to negotiate

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600
got there yet we're trying to negotiate
 

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.629
got there yet we're trying to negotiate
to get access to some of the data to

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639
to get access to some of the data to
 

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:53.410
to get access to some of the data to
allow that to occur but you can see and

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:53.420
allow that to occur but you can see and
 

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.210
allow that to occur but you can see and
they're also going back I should be

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.220
they're also going back I should be
 

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.249
they're also going back I should be
careful to say they're going back with a

00:15:57.249 --> 00:15:57.259
careful to say they're going back with a
 

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:01.090
careful to say they're going back with a

lunar map and we've got a thing called

00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659
lunar map and we've got a thing called
 

00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:17.330
lunar map and we've got a thing called
the Lunar mapping and balling project

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340
the Lunar mapping and balling project
 

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.070
the Lunar mapping and balling project
that's doing that and you know just to

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080
that's doing that and you know just to
 

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.049
that's doing that and you know just to
give you an idea you know when they went

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059
give you an idea you know when they went
 

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:25.879
give you an idea you know when they went
to the moon they had this very nice

00:24:25.879 --> 00:24:25.889
to the moon they had this very nice
 

00:24:25.889 --> 00:24:27.950
to the moon they had this very nice
camera here this Apollo mapping camera

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960

and you can go to this site where

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460
and you can go to this site where
 

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.019
and you can go to this site where
there's

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:30.029
there's
 

00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:33.019
there's
archive of the digitized version of a

00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:33.029
archive of the digitized version of a
 

00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:35.930
archive of the digitized version of a
lot of the the images and they're being

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940
lot of the the images and they're being
 

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.239
lot of the the images and they're being
restored and and and being properly

00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:38.249
restored and and and being properly
 

00:24:38.249 --> 00:24:40.279
restored and and and being properly
correlated and then we're using that raw

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:40.289
correlated and then we're using that raw
 

00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:46.339
correlated and then we're using that raw
material and putting it all together so

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:46.349
material and putting it all together so
 

00:24:46.349 --> 00:24:49.159
material and putting it all together so
like I said we're basically taking what

00:24:49.159 --> 00:24:49.169
like I said we're basically taking what
 

00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:51.889

were separate snapshots and doing a big

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:51.899
were separate snapshots and doing a big
 

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:53.690
were separate snapshots and doing a big
transect in creating a big gig of an and

transect in creating a big gig of an and
 

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.959
transect in creating a big gig of an and
that allows us a big 3d gigapan and that

00:24:56.959 --> 00:24:56.969
that allows us a big 3d gigapan and that
 

00:24:56.969 --> 00:24:59.869
that allows us a big 3d gigapan and that
allows us then to overlay these things

00:24:59.869 --> 00:24:59.879
allows us then to overlay these things
 

00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:02.930
allows us then to overlay these things
so that you know you've got the kind of

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940
so that you know you've got the kind of
 

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.209
so that you know you've got the kind of
the traditional moon imagery that you've

00:25:05.209 --> 00:25:05.219
the traditional moon imagery that you've
 

00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:06.769
the traditional moon imagery that you've
pulled together wrapped around the globe

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:06.779
pulled together wrapped around the globe
 

00:25:06.779 --> 00:25:08.389
pulled together wrapped around the globe
and now we've got a very high resolution

00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399
and now we've got a very high resolution
 

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:12.320
and now we've got a very high resolution
swath of what's going on and and you

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.910
which is the next mars rover i talked
about earlier that will be launching

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920
about earlier that will be launching
 

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.770
about earlier that will be launching
later this year and getting to Mars so

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:28.780
later this year and getting to Mars so
 

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.950
later this year and getting to Mars so
we did all this data collection did

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960
we did all this data collection did
 

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.500
we did all this data collection did
these various recons and geo tagged the

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:34.510
these various recons and geo tagged the
 

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.720
these various recons and geo tagged the
heck out of it right and so we ended up

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:36.730
heck out of it right and so we ended up
 

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.329
heck out of it right and so we ended up
with you know a representation of a nice

right there composite them all together
and we did a whole set of citizen

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:38.020
and we did a whole set of citizen
 

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.460
and we did a whole set of citizen
science with that we're excited my next

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:41.470
science with that we're excited my next

the field test where we had this gigapan

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:47.980
the field test where we had this gigapan
 

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:52.260
the field test where we had this gigapan
on the lunar rover and we basically they

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.270
on the lunar rover and we basically they
 

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.180
on the lunar rover and we basically they
went out we tried added a number of

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.190
went out we tried added a number of
 

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.960
went out we tried added a number of
things where we took just a boatload of

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:56.970
things where we took just a boatload of
 

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.510
things where we took just a boatload of
Giga pans put it on this site and said

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520
Giga pans put it on this site and said
 

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.940
Giga pans put it on this site and said
you the citizen go out tell us where we

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:02.950
you the citizen go out tell us where we
 

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.280
you the citizen go out tell us where we
should explore what do you see what do

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:05.290
should explore what do you see what do
 

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.290
should explore what do you see what do
you find what's what's useful to you and

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:07.300
you find what's what's useful to you and
 

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.470
you find what's what's useful to you and
they helped inform so we got public

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480
they helped inform so we got public
 

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.300
they helped inform so we got public
input into the final plan they helped

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.310
input into the final plan they helped
 

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.010
input into the final plan they helped
inform what the exploration would be

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.020
inform what the exploration would be
 

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.840
inform what the exploration would be
where was the interesting outcrop where

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:15.850
where was the interesting outcrop where
 

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.190
where was the interesting outcrop where
was a little widget you wanted to look

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200
was a little widget you wanted to look
 

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.500
was a little widget you wanted to look
where was the cool rock what was this

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:19.510
where was the cool rock what was this
 

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.840
where was the cool rock what was this
stuff you could care less about and that

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:21.850
stuff you could care less about and that
 

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.790
stuff you could care less about and that
was basically through the GigaPan org

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800
was basically through the GigaPan org
 

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.920
was basically through the GigaPan org
site you know we partnered with that and

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:25.930
site you know we partnered with that and
 

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.140
site you know we partnered with that and
that worked at exceptionally well we got

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.150
that worked at exceptionally well we got
 

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.830
that worked at exceptionally well we got
a huge number of hits we've got a huge

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:30.840
a huge number of hits we've got a huge
 

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.870
a huge number of hits we've got a huge
amount of interest from the public

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880
amount of interest from the public
 

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.730
amount of interest from the public
telling us hey this is kind of

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:35.740
telling us hey this is kind of
 

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.290
telling us hey this is kind of
interesting you know I didn't know NASA

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:37.300
interesting you know I didn't know NASA
 

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.900
interesting you know I didn't know NASA
did this this is like you know Jamboree

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:39.910
did this this is like you know Jamboree
 

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.560
did this this is like you know Jamboree
for roboticists and it was but now you

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:43.570
for roboticists and it was but now you
 

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.680
for roboticists and it was but now you
allow a lot more people to join in that

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:46.690
allow a lot more people to join in that
 

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.020
allow a lot more people to join in that
exploration with you and you know the

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:49.030
exploration with you and you know the
 

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.480
exploration with you and you know the
goal is that when we go to a planetary

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:51.490
goal is that when we go to a planetary
 

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.160
goal is that when we go to a planetary
surface this is again the type of

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.170
surface this is again the type of
 

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.410
surface this is again the type of
capability that you have online for

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:55.420
capability that you have online for
 

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.090
capability that you have online for
everyone to get access to so it's not

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.100
everyone to get access to so it's not
 

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.830
everyone to get access to so it's not
just you know by reading the latest news

00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:58.840
just you know by reading the latest news
 

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.080
just you know by reading the latest news
paper you see the latest picture right

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.090
paper you see the latest picture right
 

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.180
paper you see the latest picture right
you actually get access to the real data

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:03.190
you actually get access to the real data
 

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:08.030
you actually get access to the real data
to the real cool stuff so to sum up

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040
to the real cool stuff so to sum up
 

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.650
to the real cool stuff so to sum up
basically one of the reasons I like

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.660
basically one of the reasons I like
 

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.830
basically one of the reasons I like
working for NASA I told some people

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:13.840
working for NASA I told some people
 

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.420
working for NASA I told some people
earlier this morning you know I'm an

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.430
earlier this morning you know I'm an
 

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.550
earlier this morning you know I'm an
engineer I'm one of those aerospace

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560
engineer I'm one of those aerospace
 

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.230
engineer I'm one of those aerospace
engineers computer science is kind of a

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240
engineers computer science is kind of a
 

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.020
engineers computer science is kind of a
hobby right then there's the computer

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.030
hobby right then there's the computer
 

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.060
hobby right then there's the computer
scientists and space is kind of their

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.070
scientists and space is kind of their
 

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.580
scientists and space is kind of their
hobby right the intersection works out

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:26.590
hobby right the intersection works out
 

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.940
hobby right the intersection works out
really well and that NASA and is is one

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:29.950
really well and that NASA and is is one
 

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.130
really well and that NASA and is is one
of the very unique organizations that we

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:32.140
of the very unique organizations that we
 

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.620
of the very unique organizations that we
generate some of them

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:33.630
generate some of them
 

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.519
generate some of them
most heterogeneous diverse weird data

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:37.529
most heterogeneous diverse weird data
 

00:39:37.529 --> 00:39:40.130
most heterogeneous diverse weird data
you would ever get just comes from out

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140
you would ever get just comes from out
 

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.410
you would ever get just comes from out
of this world it comes literally from

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420
of this world it comes literally from
 

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.569
of this world it comes literally from
everywhere and so we get these multi

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579
everywhere and so we get these multi
 

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:47.200
everywhere and so we get these multi
scale multi type multispectral data sets

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.210
scale multi type multispectral data sets
 

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.839
scale multi type multispectral data sets
we gathered from the micro sometimes

00:39:50.839 --> 00:39:50.849
we gathered from the micro sometimes
 

00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:53.150
we gathered from the micro sometimes
down to the to the nano scale all the

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160
down to the to the nano scale all the
 

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.819
down to the to the nano scale all the
way to the macro scale and we want to

00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:55.829
way to the macro scale and we want to
 

00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:57.859
way to the macro scale and we want to
reference it and one of the key powerful

00:39:57.859 --> 00:39:57.869
reference it and one of the key powerful
 

00:39:57.869 --> 00:39:59.839
reference it and one of the key powerful
things here is that the relative or the

00:39:59.839 --> 00:39:59.849
things here is that the relative or the
 

00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:02.799
things here is that the relative or the
location context of where the images are

00:40:02.799 --> 00:40:02.809
location context of where the images are
 

00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:05.329
location context of where the images are
relative to each other and to other

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339
relative to each other and to other
 

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:08.329
relative to each other and to other
systems tells you information in and of

00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339
systems tells you information in and of
 

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:11.029
systems tells you information in and of
itself it's tremendously powerful it's

00:40:11.029 --> 00:40:11.039
itself it's tremendously powerful it's

covering do you guys know it's a it's a

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:21.819
covering do you guys know it's a it's a
 

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:23.940
covering do you guys know it's a it's a
pretty high percentage of covering so

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:23.950
pretty high percentage of covering so
 

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.920
pretty high percentage of covering so
there's a lot of overlap it basically is

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:25.930
there's a lot of overlap it basically is
 

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.160
there's a lot of overlap it basically is
doing a polar orbit and and so they're

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:29.170
doing a polar orbit and and so they're
 

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.349
doing a polar orbit and and so they're
taking these nice swathes and we're

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359
taking these nice swathes and we're
 

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.819
taking these nice swathes and we're
trying to get as much overlap as you get

00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:32.829
trying to get as much overlap as you get
 

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:33.930
trying to get as much overlap as you get
right now it looks kind of like an

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:33.940
right now it looks kind of like an
 

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.020
right now it looks kind of like an

more opportunities that will be to fill

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:43.150
more opportunities that will be to fill
 

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.790
more opportunities that will be to fill
it in and flush that out so it's going

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800
it in and flush that out so it's going
 

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.910
it in and flush that out so it's going
to be very very high-resolution data

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920
to be very very high-resolution data
 

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.109

it's very impressive stuff I mean you

00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119
it's very impressive stuff I mean you
 

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:53.040
it's very impressive stuff I mean you
can actually see I don't know I didn't

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.050

solid technical answer I can give you my
 

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.910
