00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.460
I think the climate change issue has
been politicized from the very beginning

change which personally I don't think it

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410
change which personally I don't think it
 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.180
change which personally I don't think it
is it is one of many I don't think it's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190
is it is one of many I don't think it's
 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.420
is it is one of many I don't think it's
the only one but by having concentrated

you look how much water you need in

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860
you look how much water you need in

order to produce one liter of biodiesel

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909
order to produce one liter of biodiesel
 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.010
order to produce one liter of biodiesel
it's 9100 litre of water to produce one

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020
it's 9100 litre of water to produce one
 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.280
it's 9100 litre of water to produce one
liter of biodiesel it is four thousand

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290
liter of biodiesel it is four thousand
 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.200

one liter of pure ethanol if you see
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.389
one liter of pure ethanol if you see
those figures if your then see that one

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399
those figures if your then see that one

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
people didn't have enough to eat you
 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.600
people didn't have enough to eat you
start to ask yourself whether those are

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
start to ask yourself whether those are
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.240
start to ask yourself whether those are
the right decisions and I think a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250
the right decisions and I think a
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.949
the right decisions and I think a
several of those decision has been made

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959
several of those decision has been made
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.870
several of those decision has been made
on a political scene without really

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
on a political scene without really
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.710
on a political scene without really
thinking it through what it means the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
thinking it through what it means the
 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.710
thinking it through what it means the
whole process has come under questioning

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
whole process has come under questioning
 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.370
whole process has come under questioning
and I think that's what really happened

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380
and I think that's what really happened
 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.440
and I think that's what really happened
in in in Copenhagen it was a political

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
in in in Copenhagen it was a political
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.880
in in in Copenhagen it was a political
failure it was not for me at least an

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
failure it was not for me at least an
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.110
failure it was not for me at least an
issue I think the issue is there I think

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
issue I think the issue is there I think
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.460
issue I think the issue is there I think
it is wrongly presented

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
it is wrongly presented
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.130
it is wrongly presented
I think climate change is much more

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
I think climate change is much more
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.280
I think climate change is much more
complex than just co2 and you see that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
complex than just co2 and you see that
 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.620
complex than just co2 and you see that
now for example finally people

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
now for example finally people
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.850
now for example finally people
understand that madam is almost 20 times

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
understand that madam is almost 20 times
 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.090
understand that madam is almost 20 times
more aggressive than co2 and then you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
more aggressive than co2 and then you
 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.800
more aggressive than co2 and then you
will see their lot of other greenhouse

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
will see their lot of other greenhouse
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.290
will see their lot of other greenhouse
gases may reminder that there was once a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
gases may reminder that there was once a
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.020
gases may reminder that there was once a
Montreal agreement before there was a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
Montreal agreement before there was a
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.360
Montreal agreement before there was a
kyoto agreement where we also talked

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
kyoto agreement where we also talked
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.550
kyoto agreement where we also talked
about the greenhouse gases so and then

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
about the greenhouse gases so and then
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.140
about the greenhouse gases so and then
climate change had happened in the past

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150
climate change had happened in the past
 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.680
climate change had happened in the past
and will happen in the future so if we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
and will happen in the future so if we
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.960
and will happen in the future so if we
look at the big ports of the Roman

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
look at the big ports of the Roman
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.360
look at the big ports of the Roman
Empire they are today all of them about

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
Empire they are today all of them about
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090
Empire they are today all of them about
20 kilometers inside okay they are not

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
20 kilometers inside okay they are not
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.080
20 kilometers inside okay they are not
anymore at the sea so one could even see

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
anymore at the sea so one could even see
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.790
anymore at the sea so one could even see
could say well hopefully there would be

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800
could say well hopefully there would be
 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
could say well hopefully there would be
a little bit of an increase of the water

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
a little bit of an increase of the water
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.230
a little bit of an increase of the water
level because as I said we lost about 20

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240
level because as I said we lost about 20
 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.709
level because as I said we lost about 20
kilometers down
