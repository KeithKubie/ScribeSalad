00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:10.426
&gt;&gt;It's actually putting
its DNA into your cells,

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:13.716
and so unless all your infected
cells get killed you're just going

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:14.296
to keep making it.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So we can--
very good, amazing.

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:20.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students in
Blair's class are learning

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:22.576
about physiology and multimedia.

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:27.496
&gt;&gt;You need to find a good picture of
an antibody binding with an antigen.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When class is over
they walk just across the hall

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:32.356
where they study art with Jeff Robin.

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:36.326
&gt;&gt;Jeff: An easy way of making
it look three dimensional is

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:39.426
to give everything a little
bit of a shadow like on the arm

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:40.926
and on the blood, everywhere, okay?

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students are working
on one project in both classes.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:45.866
&gt;&gt;Blair: We found good sources?

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, we have
ten sources right now.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And it's all about blood.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:51.336
&gt;&gt;Gabby: All of our classmates
are studying different aspects

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:55.976
like the art of blood and blood in
religions and, you know, like AIDS.

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.316
&gt;&gt;Blair: The blood
project is something

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:00.096
that students will specialize in.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:04.046
Doing art around it, doing
research around it and presenting

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:07.456
that research in an
audio-visual format on DVD.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:08.136
&gt;&gt;What's going on here?

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.046
&gt;&gt;That's a fat that builds up.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students are
creating multimedia exhibits

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:15.136
that will be displayed
at a local art gallery

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:16.936
and will promote blood donation.

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:20.436
&gt;&gt;Ramona: So let me tell you a
little bit about the blood bank.

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:23.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: San Diego Blood Bank
Director Ramona Walker visits the

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:25.796
class to provide background
information.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:25.996
&gt;&gt;Ramona: Yeah?

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.206
&gt;&gt;Gabby: Has there ever been a time

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.566
where the blood supply
has been really low?

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.836
&gt;&gt;Ramona: Well you
know, yes, actually.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:33.526
About three years ago-

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.916
&gt;&gt;Gabby: It's much more
engaging when you do it this way

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:39.366
and when you actually get to do
the project and create something

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.746
at the end and not only teach
ourselves, but teach the community.

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:45.166
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Maybe you could put what
it's about in that same kind

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.906
of text here, here and there-

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:47.476
&gt;&gt;Gabby: Oh I see what
you mean, okay.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:47.976
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: To balance it out.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:51.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Robin makes sure students
get their hands on every phase

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:53.726
of the project guiding
them through the design

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:55.656
and construction of the dioramas.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.196
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: So you can come
in and come in sideways.

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.486
&gt;&gt;JThis is something that
I think is real life.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:03.056
If they're going to get a job when
they first get out of college,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.626
it's going to be doing
something visual.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:08.246
It will be something to do with the
computer, and they're going to have

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:11.126
to do something for their bosses
to put together a presentation

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:12.816
and that's what this is about.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.006
&gt;&gt;Did Blair approve
those writing things?

00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:16.086
&gt;&gt;Student: Our scripts?

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:16.446
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Yeah.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.296
&gt;&gt;Student: He hasn't
looked at it yet but I mean-

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:20.026
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Show it to him before
you start writing on this.

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:23.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This complex project
has many interlocking assignments

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:24.926
and deadlines to keep track of.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:26.876
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: It's so complicated

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.846
and planning it just making
a calendar what you're going

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:33.026
to do every single day for a
whole semester, with this you have

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:36.046
to be right on it or
all hell breaks loose.

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:39.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Hatch posts the
curriculum on the school's website

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.806
and students turn in their work as
part of their digital portfolio.

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:46.126
&gt;&gt;Blair: They don't hand it to me.

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.506
They post it and they keep it
in their sort of virtual locker.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.726
The advantage of that for me is
that at the end is you're going

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.956
to see what this student did
week two, three, four, five,

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:58.716
six all the way down the line
so it's real process-oriented.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:02.156
They'll send me a link to
their DP every two weeks.

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:03.886
It's the same link, but by sending it

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:07.646
to me they're saying they've updated
it and they're ready to be assessed.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:11.026
So I assess it by going and
finding the things that are due.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:12.026
That's how we communicate.

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.296
That's how I keep the
student accountable.

00:03:13.506 --> 00:03:15.906
&gt;&gt;They're going to meet with
you on Wednesday for posters.

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:16.276
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: right.

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.076
&gt;&gt;Blair: And then meet with me
on Thursday for visual scripts.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.246
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Oh that's right, tomorrow-

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:22.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Hatch and
Robin meet every morning

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:23.406
to coordinate the project.

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.596
&gt;&gt;Rob: The fact that
we have teachers coming

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:30.196
in here an hour a day before their
kids is the unseen structural feature

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:32.036
that really makes this place work.

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:35.186
&gt;&gt;We're trying to create
an environment where all

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.896
of our adults are engaged
in and learning together.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.246
&gt;&gt;Blair: You like the
way the poster is.

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:40.406
Therefore we have the art.

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.356
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: To get him to want to
be partners with me and to do this,

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:47.386
I learned about iron and oxygen
so most teachers don't go out

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:50.106
and learn another subject
area but you have to do

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:53.506
that when you do this team
teaching project based learning.

00:03:53.626 --> 00:03:55.856
&gt;&gt;Blair: The heart has
to pump constantly.

00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:58.416
&gt;&gt;So it's important that you know
what the other guy is teaching

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:01.226
but that makes you a
lifelong learner as well

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:03.416
and then that's a good role
model for students to see.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.946
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Yeah, I like how
it bounces back and forth.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.936
&gt;&gt;Blair: I've learned a lot
about my own teaching practice

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:13.036
by being interdisciplinary and
thematic with another professional.

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:16.506
It's creative so it
keeps me on my toes.

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:19.666
