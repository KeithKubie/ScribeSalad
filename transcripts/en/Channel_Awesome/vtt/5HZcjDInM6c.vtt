00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.200
God dammit

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360
Nostalgia-ween

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.980
Look out

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.120
There's bullshit about

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.180
[evil laugh]

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.980
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.060
I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.740
Guess what I just saw a trailer for

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.760
[collective boo]

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.120
That's right the next, and pray to god, last of the Paranormal Activity movies

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.260
[BACKGROUND] F*ck you entertainment I don't have to see

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
Now, if you're like me

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.420
you probably rolled your eyes like the majority of the audience that saw this trailer

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.920
which is funny because before

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.260
Paranormal Activity was the movie you had to fight to see

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960
You had to call up your movie theatre to have it played there in an ingenious marketing campaign

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.920
Now, we've seen it so damn much that we're sick of it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.160
and for many, we're also sick of found footage films

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.540
Everyone I've talked to says they're done with it

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.980
There's just nothing left

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.280
It's not a genre; it's a gimmick

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.060
and it needs to go out of style

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.460
Most people can't take the motion sickness camera in TWO dimensions

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.980
but now we're going to add THREE to it?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.840
Dude, this needs to stop.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.040
But then again, there must have been something that drew us to this

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.660
for such a long period of time

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.860
Were these really just cheap ways to make horror films

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.020
with just a person holding a crappy camera?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.780
To answer this, we've gotta go back to where the whole found footage thing started

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.880
...or at least when it started to get popular

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.360
and that's with 'The Blair Witch Project'

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.900
Now chances are this kind of idea had been done before

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.800
but this is the first time it became a worldwide phenomenon

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.240
The hype for this movie was insane

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.000
But even from day one people were split about it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.280
Some say it was one of the scariest movies ever made

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.920
others say there were no scares at all

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.880
Some praised it as a new form of film making

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.820
others saw it as a lazy shaky cam mess

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.380
Whatever your thought process, the film was a big hit

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.480
inspiring dozens of other films trying something similiar

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.200
and ironically the sequel being nothing like the first one

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600
You all know the setup

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.380
The whole film is being told from the point of view of a person holding the camera

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.500
And while it's debatable whether or not Blair Witch holds up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.440
Depending on who you ask

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.640
You can't ignore what it inspired

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.220
We went from two cameras to multiple cameras,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.860
quick edits to shots that take up the entire night,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.540
crappy quality to really high end quality

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.220
So this means that the art form must have evolved, right?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.660
Well again, it depends on who you ask

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.840
While the imagery looked better,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.940
Many say that the quality of the scares was getting predictable,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.020
and the limitations too frustrating

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.660
There's always shaky cam

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.960
There's always people reacting to the camera like they've never f**king seen one before

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.460
There's always a ton of comedy in the first half

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.980
And, of course, the characters always have to unrealistically film everything

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.060
Well, maybe not so unrealistically nowadays

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.820
but still, this is pushing it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.580
It's understandable why people would start to get sick of this

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.040
Still, a large part of any genre is the limitations and the discipline you assign to it

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.780
In film noir, you know you're going to get heavy shadows and a dark, mysterious story

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.140
In romances, you know you're always gonna get two people who share their emotions and their feelings to grow closer

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.880
So, why can't these limitations work for the genre of found footage?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.640
Now true, this has been used in comedies and dramas

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.260
so it's probably more appropriate to call it a sub-genre

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.680
but it's still a distinct style with a distinct look that many film makers have added their own touch to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.220
On top of that, while repetitive in many areas, it has opened up a new variety of scares

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.820
The Paranormal Activity movies, despite the stories and characters becoming less developed

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.820
do still offer new ways of scaring people

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.100
Yeah, we get those fake out jumpscares that are always awful, but

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.100
then there are ideas like the camera going back and forth slowly revealing the scare

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.320
or literally dangling a knife off-screen never knowing when it's going to fall

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.500
or even just moving spots, f**king MOVING SPOTS can suddenly become terrifying

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.240
It's this kind of simplicity that can get the biggest frights with the subtlest of actions

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.320
One of my favourite edits is in Paranormal Activity 2, when the daughter thinks something has taken over her mother

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.980
We get a scene of the mother about to confront her in her room

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.280
and then we just cut to the daughter crying on the phone asking for help

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.800
We have no idea what happened in between but our imagination is much more disturbing than anything it could have shown

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.200
And seeing how a lot of found footage is very much less is more, it allows clever touches like that to shine the best

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.640
When it has to work through the limitations by being clever

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.880
It's like shooting an entire movie in a coffin, or a whole film on a chairlift

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.780
When you take away the usual distractions, it allows you to focus more on the meat of the story

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.360
and it can only be done well by truly smart film makers

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.600
But with that said, a lot of times the style can be the distraction

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.800
The master of zombie films, George A. Romero took his stab at the found footage style and failed miserably

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.600
Nothing ever looked like actual found footage

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.360
It was too well shot, too nice sounding and too much acted like a Hollywood film

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.560
Something like this makes you realise not only is there a right way to do found footage,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.400
but there's a logical reason for why it can work

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.400
What do horror movies, as well as most movies try to do?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.020
They try to make you feel like you're in the films

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.300
so you can identify more with the situation

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.800
But where most movies need to film a main character,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.920
with found footage the main character is the one that's filming

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.440
so it's much easier to make you feel like you're the one in the situation

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.620
When it works, it can get some of the biggest scares you can imagine

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.740
But the downside is, people are much more critical and rightfully so

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.380
Not believing the environment or characters in a found footage movie

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.480
is ten times worse than if you don't believe it in any other genre

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.940
because the whole point is to make you feel like you're really there

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.780
and if the story, characters or acting are so far fetched that it knocks you out of that illusion

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.100
the film falls apart

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.420
The majority of the Paranormal Activity movies have good scares

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.940
but because they had to make them so fast...

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.760
(one every year)

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.620
...the stories got too silly for most people and the character's choices became unrelatable

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.500
This is why the next film looks so bad

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.040
because rather than convincing us that they fixed the problems

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.100
they're throwing more gimmicks and more distracting visuals that they're just looking fake now

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.920
They're trying to go bigger in a series that thrived on minimalism

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.400
But with that said, sometimes new twists can come from the most unlikely of places

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.780
'Unfriended' spends the whole movie on a girl's computer screen

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.200
This limitation allowed us not only to see the cost of living too much on social media,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.460
but also how unlikable most dumb teens in horror movies are

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.960
At first, you think you're supposed to like these people like in most scary movies,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.740
but by the end you realise not only are you supposed to find them all revolting,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.840
but that teens in most scary films are usually revolting

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.740
It's a good way to use satire while also moving your story forward and upping the atmosphere

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.080
Again, using very little to achieve an awful lot

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.120
And speaking of mixing comedy and horror, who'd have thought M. Night Shyamalan would be able to mix the two so well?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.220
'The Visit' was a hit with both critics and audiences

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.060
and while it still has his awkward writing all over it,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.720
it did manage to create a scenario where you're both screaming and laughing both at the same time

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.700
Well even though there's a ton of holes in the movie, like how is that tiny camera that good quality,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.600
or how are their non-existent mics picking up everything

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.500
the weird atmosphere it creates manages to be both charming and disturbing simultaneously

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.820
And the found footage style helps that;

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.060
there's a scene where the grandma chases the kids under the house

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.380
and it's scary because you see literally what they see and therefore fear what they fear

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.120
But when you're further away from it like they are you see that she was just playing a game

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.240
Oh yeah, I guess we're kinda jumping to conclusions...

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.160
...Right?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.860
The point of view of the camera blurs that line throughout the majority of the film,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.120
leaving the mystery tougher to figure out

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.460
'The Last Exorcism' was another great blend of horror and comedy

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.440
as a film group follows an exorcist who claims he's a sham,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.580
and we laugh at his clever ways of convincing mentally ill people that he's getting demons out of them

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.620
But when he comes across one that seems too real, even for him,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.840
it's left to the viewer to decide whether the girl is actually possessed or not

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.460
There's no flashbacks, close-ups or inner monologues to give you any clues,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.600
it's only what the camera picks up

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.140
It's another layer of limitation that actually helps the mystery of the storytelling...

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.860
...that is until the bullshit ending, but let's not go there

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.300
No, really, I'm telling the film not to go there, you were so good until then!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.860
Many of these movies I'm talking about are years old but some of them are rather recent,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.540
meaning there are still possibilities that can be done with this type of film making

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.420
Can it get annoying? Yes

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.040
Do the limitations stump the growth at times? Certainly

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.600
But clever film making is clever film making

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.700
and if someone has a twist on a popular idea there's no reason to stop them

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.680
And if you can never get into them and the motion sickness is just too much for you, it's completely understandable

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.780
Everyone's gonna have a style or genre that's just not gonna grab them

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.740
But I think for most of us it's like watching a trailer from Wes Anderson or Quentin Tarantino

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.880
You always kinda say you're done with that style and it's the same thing over and over but,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.160
then when you see them do something really really good with it

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.160
you remember that style can help a story and you're reminded of why you started to watch it to begin with

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.240
Found footage is more than just a person holding a camera,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.380
it's a surprisingly complicated method of film making that allows fewer mistakes than many would expect

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.100
More elements have to gel together to please the audience for a found footage film

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.440
than, say, the audience for a Michael Bay film

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:02.480
Because there's less distractions, you have to be sure what you have is convincing while still telling an engaging narrative

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.220
Horror is already difficult on it's own so throwing in these limitations makes it even tougher

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.980
But when it works, it can really work

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.000
and lead down new avenues that didn't exist before

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.100
it's hard to say whether or not the new Paranormal Activity will be any good,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.960
but it's not worth condemning a style of film that can, and has, given some memorable scares for it

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.780
Is there gonna be crap with it? Sure

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.860
Just like any genre has a lot of crap

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.440
But for those who know how to not only work within this realm but also evolve it to a new level,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.620
the possibilities are just too intriguing to turn down

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.280
I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.180
I shake the camera so you don't have to

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.620
Okay, seriously, stop that-

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.300
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout out

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.000
and this week we are doing DuPagePads

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.720
This is an organization that specializes in helping people who are homeless

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.980
They help find shelters, they help them get resources,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.840
they are done mostly through volunteers; a lot of volunteers

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.400
are younger people and teenagers

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.280
They like to start them young, showing that it's good to help people who do not have a home

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.340
and it isn't just adults, there's many families and young children

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.940
all of these people need a home and they specialize in a place where the weather can just be brutal

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.480
This is in DuPage County, and the weather can either get extremely hot or it can get extremely cold

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.720
as many of you know, we have really bad storms here

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:51.240
and it can just get so tough so this is an organization that tries it's best to help give people a home

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.600
just a shelter, just something away from the harsh conditions that there can be out there

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.660
and they try everything they can to try and get these people get back on their feet

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.620
and try to find good resources and good people that can help them out

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.280
and they do everything that they can and they have all sorts of fund raisers and events

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.040
they do something where they have a run; a run for home as they call it

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.180
They also have an action called Taste of Hope where all sorts of wonderful restaurants come in

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.900
and donate their time and food and I've been to a lot of these restaurants; they're good stuff

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.140
So this isn't just the bare minimum, they try everything they can

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.320
to try and get these people a warm place where they can feel safe and they can feel secure

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.960
and you can definitely make a big difference in that any little amount helps; please, definitely check out their website

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.060
They contribute to people who really deserve a warm place to feel safe
