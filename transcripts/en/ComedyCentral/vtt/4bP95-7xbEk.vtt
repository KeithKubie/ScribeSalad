00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.337
There is a nineteen year
old girl, Mary Phelps Jacob,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.839
setting out to go
to a debutant ball,

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:12.145
and she is like, "Ugh,
I got this beautiful silk dress

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.681
and I have to put this
dumb piece of shit on,

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:20.019
stupid corset
with whale bone inserts.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:24.557
Ugh, this is so Goddamn dumb.
All right, I'm out. I'm out.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.060
I can't take this.
Marie!", her maid.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.829
"Marie! Get me
two handkerchiefs,

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.433
some silk cording, ribbons,
and a sewing kit."

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:38.605
She sews together
two handkerchiefs onto herself

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.974
and goes to a ball.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.150
All the girls are like, "What
is going on with you, girl?

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.785
You look better
than you've ever looked."

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:54.954
And she says,
"Yeah, I just made this

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.356
(bleep) out of some
handkerchiefs."

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.959
The girls go crazy,
and she's like,

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:03.262
"My boobles are free to roam."

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.998
And they all say, "I want one."
"I want one." "I want one."

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.700
"All right, whatever,
I'll make you some.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.602
I'll make you my new thing,
whatever,

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.870
with some handkerchiefs."

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.272
Then, she gets a letter
in the mail

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.008
from someone
she's never met saying,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.879
"Hey, I'll give you a dollar
to make me a bra."

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:23.082
And then she realizes,
"Oh, this could be a business."

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.319
So, she goes
to the patent office,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:31.157
and she said, "Hey, I've made
this thing. It's a brassiere."

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.959
The patent office guy was like,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.629
"Everyone's had boobs
for Goddamn forever,

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:39.265
I understand that you
think you made something,

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:43.202
but you fucking didn't."
And she said, "No, I did.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:47.707
The last piece of shit patent
flattens your tits

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.744
into nothing but one boob.
Do you want one boob?"

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.779
And he's like,
"I don't, I can't even,

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.414
I don't even know
if I can answer this."

00:01:55.447 --> 00:02:02.188
"No, you want two fucking boobs.
They separate and lift.

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.991
Give me the patent
for the backless brassiere."

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.694
And he says, "Yeah, okay,
all right. I've never seen that.

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:10.863
I will give you a patent. Slam."

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:15.868
He gives her a patent. Oh, God.
I'm not gonna throw up,

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:20.173
but I am,
I'm pretty gonzo bonzo.

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.112
So she opens the Fashion
Form Brassiere Company.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.582
Meanwhile, she marries this guy,
Harry Crosby, and Harry says,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.618
"Hey, babe, because you're gonna
be my wife, Crosby,

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.654
I feel like you
should have a C name,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.823
so it's like C Crosby,
I would really like it

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.826
if you'd change your name
to clitoris."

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.297
It's fucking true.
And she says, "What?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.700
No, I'm not gonna change
my name to clitoris."

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.268
And he's like,
"No, it's with a Y."

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:53.406
"Still, sorry,
I love you, man, honey,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.109
but not even with a Y,
will I name myself clitoris."

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.711
"What about caress?"

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:01.581
"That's better than clitoris.
Certainly."

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:05.985
He says to her, "Hey, Caress."
She's now Caress.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.721
"You're kinda bored
with the bra business,

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.656
and it's not taking off.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.859
I'm kinda rich,
why don't you just let it go?"

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.028
She says, "All right. Fine."

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.967
She sells her patent to the
Warner Brothers Corset Company

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.702
for fifteen hundred dollars.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:26.372
She's like, "I'm out.
I'm good. Had fun."

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.141
So, wait,
I have to fast forward.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.476
I also have to pee.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.877
Which one are you
gonna do first?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.145
No, I have to pee.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:34.413
Okay, well, then pee.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:39.986
I'm gonna. In 1929,
the bra took hold.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.090
Everyone bought bras.
The corset was dead.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.425
The Warner
Brothers Corset Company

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:51.964
makes fifteen million dollars
off of her patent alone.

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:53.700
That's a lot of titties.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.537
Here's the thing
about Mary Phelps Jacob,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.339
she never give a shit.
She was like,

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:05.478
"Oh, okay. I sold the patent.
Not gonna dwell on it.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:07.246
I'm gonna open
a publishing company

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.117
that publishes every modern
writer known to man.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.454
Hemingway, James Joyce,
Henry Miller, Edgar Allen Poe."

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.891
There's so many more.
Someone look it up on an iPhone.

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:23.129
You'll see.
Then, was writing pornography.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:26.266
For money.
And she was great at it.

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:29.568
And at the end of her life,
somebody asked her about like,

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:36.108
"Hey, who invented something?"
And she was like, "Yeah, yeah.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:40.046
My invention, it wouldn't
take the place in history

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:45.418
of something like the steamboat,
but yeah, I invented the bra.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.323
The bra is kind of
a big fucking deal.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.258
No one gives a shit
about a steamboat.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.561
Do you know anyone
who doesn't have a bra?"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.770
Okay, so the story,
we start in 1915.

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.972
Yes, in Chicago.

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:08.974
Bessie Coleman,
she's twenty-three years old.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.310
She's a young thing.
She's a manicurist in Chicago,

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.612
and she is the best.
Hands down, the best.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:16.082
She's doing the nails
of the upper crust,

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.850
elite,
black people in Chicago.

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:19.218
And all the right
people are like,

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:21.654
"Hey girl, hey.
Do my nails, girl."

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.089
And she's like,
"Okay, girl, I got you."

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.124
And they're like, "Girl."

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.526
While she's there, she's reading
the Chicago Defender,

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.628
which is a black
owned newspaper.

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:32.131
She's reading about World
War One and what's happening.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.100
So, she's like,
"Yo, one day I hope

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.835
I get to be like
a motherfucking pilot."

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.636
People at the nail shop,
the people are like, "Girl, you

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.838
wildin' out."

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.607
She's like, "No, I'm gonna be
a fucking pilot. Relax."

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.410
And she says to herself,
she's like, "Self, I'm not dumb.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:46.912
I know that I have to like train

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.381
and go to school
to become a pilot."

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.483
So, she's applying
to aviation schools

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.351
and she's being rejected
left and right,

00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:54.220
because of nothing besides
the fact

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.655
that she's a black woman.
She's black and Cherokee.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:58.257
If this was a drink
of Hater-ade,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.528
their glass was full
and they were like, "Hating."

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.029
That was them.

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:06.799
And she's like, "Yo, fuck each
and every one of you."

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:10.136
And she's like, "Fine, like,
whatever, like, you said no,

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.971
but I'm gonna keep saving
my money."

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:14.140
Then she meets Robert S.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.709
Abbott, and he is the owner,
it turns out to be,

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:19.311
of a, duh ta da,
Chicago Defender.

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:20.579
And he's like, "Hey, girl."

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:22.848
And she's like,
"I love your paper.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:26.118
Your paper inspired me to even
want to be a fucking pilot.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.587
I really wanna fly, however,
I'm having trouble

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.823
getting into
aviation school in America.

00:06:30.856 --> 00:06:33.859
America is not having me because
I'm black and I'm a woman."

00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:36.162
[(burp) 00:06:35]
Excuse me.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:38.164
So, Robert's like, "Yo, you're
[inaudible 00:06:38]

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.633
out if you think you gonna be
a part of America right now,

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.934
because it's not gonna happen."

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.703
And he was like, "My advice
to you would be to go to Europe.

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:47.106
Go to France,
you have a better chance there."

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.441
And he was like,
"If you go there,

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.677
I'm gonna also sell some papers
talking about you in my paper.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.179
If you go and really do this,

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:56.415
I will not only pay for you
to get to France, bitch,

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:58.985
I will pay for your entire
schooling. Boom."

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:02.555
So, she was like, "Fantastical."

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.331
So, she took him up on his offer
and she applied and got accepted

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:16.569
to the most elite
French school for aviation.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.370
Bessie's like,
"Holler at me, bitch.

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.407
I'm at Cardeau du Crotoy."

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:25.244
Aviation was a scary thing
back in the day.

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:27.580
Planes were like,
"Girl, we don't have seat belts.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.482
Girl, we don't have seats.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:32.685
Girl, we don't have leather
and we don't have cup holders."

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.187
So, Bessie was learning
how to fly in France.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.223
People were flying
with the assumption

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.757
that they would be okay,
but no

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.493
[inaudible 00:07:39]
safe.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:42.762
No what?

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.731
No security that
they would be safe.

00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:48.501
They were like, "My legs is out
the bottom, Flintstone style."

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:56.709
They're like,
"[inaudible 00:07:51]."

00:07:57.442 --> 00:07:59.879
Because a lot of people
died in France.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:07.487
[inaudible 00:08:03]
and then they was dead.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.823
But as she was watching
people die, she stressed out,

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:13.025
but she gets her international
piloting license

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:14.360
in seven months,

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.729
which, by the way,
I will say for her,

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.932
she was the first female
American to get this

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:23.436
and it's extra explosive
because she was black. Boom.

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:32.211
Our story begins
in the year 1963.

00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:36.215
Gloria Steinem was a graduate
of Smith College.

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:40.319
Very smart, she's twenty-eight
years old and she's journalist.

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:42.321
And Show magazine was like,
"Hey, Gloria,

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:45.524
we have a story for you.
We want you to go undercover

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:47.693
at one of
Hugh Hefner's Playboy Clubs."

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:51.931
Playboy Clubs were advertising
themselves at the time

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:55.000
as being in a real life
version of Playboy.

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:57.002
They would have
beautiful women everywhere

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.537
and drinks and food
and dude stuff.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.772
Yeah.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:04.176
Boobies and vaginas.
And Gloria was like,

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.744
"I don't think
this is what I want.

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:07.646
I want people
to take me seriously."

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.847
And her editor was like,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.517
"I think this could be
your chance to call Hugh Hefner

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.419
out on his Goddamn bullshit."

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:17.957
And she was like, "You're right.
I'm in. Lets fucking do it."

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.728
What was I talking about?

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:25.431
So, she says yes to thing,
to the assignment.

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:29.201
So, she goes to the audition,
which is at a Playboy Club.

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:31.203
She's this alias
she's created for herself,

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:33.806
which is Marie Catherine Oakes,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.674
and the woman
that she goes up to says,

00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:37.376
"Take off your coat,
let me see your body."

00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:40.813
Gloria was like, "Um, okay."
And took her coat off.

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:44.817
The woman was like, "You look
a little old for twenty-four.

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.852
But your body's great.

00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:49.589
Come back on Saturday
for a fitting."

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.359
So, Gloria comes back
a couple days later.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.661
She sees this woman
named Sheralee, she's like,

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:58.497
"I'm the Bunny Mother."
She goes and she gets sized.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.400
She puts on this leotard
and she's like, "This fits."

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:02.801
And they're like,
"No, it doesn't."

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:06.171
And they keep going in and in,
and Gloria's like,

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:08.808
"I think that's tight enough,
I can hardly breathe."

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:13.178
You okay?

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.180
An ice cube just assaulted me.

00:10:15.213 --> 00:10:17.450
You got ice-est.

00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:23.522
So, the Bunny Mother, Sheralee,
is explaining to the bunnies,

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.090
"There's all these things
that they can take

00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:26.392
your money away for.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.662
Like, if your ears are on
crooked, that's a demerit.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.498
If your bunny tail's dirty,
that demerits.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:36.001
If you're not smiling enough,
that's a bunch of demerits."

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:38.170
They also give her
this Bunny Manual,

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:40.939
which is a list of all the rules
that you have to follow.

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:42.841
In the Bunny Manual,
it says,

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:45.244
"You're not allowed
to date any customers."

00:10:45.777 --> 00:10:50.115
Then they were told, "Unless
they hold the special key."

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:53.519
The special key members
were allowed to do

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:57.423
whatever they want.
"Eww. That's fucked up."

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:02.761
Anyway, so, they're like,

00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:04.697
"Great, you're all set,
you're gonna start work soon,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.665
we just need you
to complete your physical."

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:08.534
And Gloria's like,
"What do you mean?

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:11.336
I'm gonna be a waitress."
"Oh, we just need you

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.605
to complete a physical
with this doctor

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:15.040
and then you'll
be fine to start."

00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:16.275
That's gross.

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:17.476
Yeah.

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:21.313
That's just gross.
So, she goes to the doctor.

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:24.817
She sits on the table
and she sees there's stirrups.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.088
And a doctor walks in and the
first thing he says to her is,

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:34.026
"So, you wanna be a bunny?",
which is alarming as a doctor.

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:37.463
He exams her, which to a woman
means, you know.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.831
Pat smear?

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:40.132
Did you say pap, pat schmear?

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:41.333
I never had one.

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:44.269
It's not a bagel, Derek.
It's a -

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:46.805
I'm from New York
[crosstalk 00:11:45].

00:11:46.838 --> 00:11:49.608
[crosstalk 00:11:45]
pap schmear.

00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:51.544
So, she finishes the exam,

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:55.914
and she goes the next day
to train for this job.

00:11:55.947 --> 00:11:57.783
That's a fancy word for,

00:11:57.816 --> 00:12:00.152
"You're gonna work
and not get paid any money."

00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:04.223
She's training as a Table Bunny.
They teach her that she just

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.159
has to follow
the other bunny servers around.

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.328
She's going around
asking these people like,

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:12.498
"Hello, I'm Bunny Marie,
what can I get for you?"

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:14.600
And they would say things like,
"Yeah, girl,

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:17.870
let me see your titties.
Open it up."

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.739
Which is bullshit.

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:23.041
She's working all these shifts,
and she's like, in her journal,

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:24.810
she's writing
all these injustices.

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:26.678
They're working
these long hours,

00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.280
they're not making any money.

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:31.316
On top of that, it's basically
a prostitution ring,

00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:34.153
and after working in the
Playboy Clubs for four weeks,

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.420
Gloria was like,

00:12:35.453 --> 00:12:38.357
"Fuck this shit,
I have enough in my journal,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.060
I'm gonna publish this shit.
I'm out."

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.030
It's just all this stupid,
sexist, dumb ass bullshit.

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.167
She just wanted
to get the fuck out.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.902
So, she quit.

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.338
Gloria writes an expose
on these Playboy Clubs.

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:56.508
She's like, "These women
were not making as much money

00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:57.976
as they told
they were gonna make,

00:12:58.009 --> 00:13:01.613
it's insane hours, they're being
grabbed all the time,

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.749
they're treated
like prostitutes.

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:06.051
They're basically
being used as a tool

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.921
for the male
sexual revolution.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:12.257
But, the women themselves don't
get to own their sexuality.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.993
That's shitty.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.836
They publish the story
in the magazine.

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:29.575
The world reads this article,
and to his very tiny credit,

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:31.310
Hugh Hefner says,
Wow.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.912
Yeah, maybe they won't
have to go

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:37.216
to these physical exams anymore,
and you know what,

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:39.685
I'm gonna stop making them
have to give

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:43.255
so much of their money to us
if they make a mistake."

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:46.358
Which is a really cool thing
that Hugh Hefner did,

00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:51.897
but also, not as cool as always
treating them that way.

00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:56.135
This article made Gloria Steinem
a household name.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:00.873
She went on to be
this huge feminist icon.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.641
It's tough, but I swear to God,

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:04.243
if it weren't
for Gloria Steinem,

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.578
I wouldn't be able to be on TV.

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:10.015
It's very hard to be a woman
that's like, "I love sports."

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:13.719
And you have stuck to your guns
ever since you started

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:16.055
and that is what
-

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.123
You cried.

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:19.859
I'm sorry.

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:24.997
Can I get somebody else
to do this?
