ALEX TAPSCOTT: That
was really cool.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.961
I kind of want to try that out.

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.010
Everybody, give me a big cheer.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.950
[CHEERING]

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.150
Wow.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.250
That power is seductive.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.735
Thanks for joining me today.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.610
Great to see a
standing-room-only crowd here.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.422
There must not be a
lot going on this week.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.020
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.700
I've been reflecting on
this whole Brexit issue

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.790
and thinking about where to
make sense of the disruption

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.350
and turmoil that's going on.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.240
And I think that there might
be an answer in technology.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.610
Because in addition of this
political revolution that's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.540
kind of going on
right now, we also

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.260
have a technological revolution
that's happening as well.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.460
And this is by far the
most sophisticated crowd

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.130
I think I've spoken to.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.550
So everyone here is
obviously familiar with all

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240
these big technological
trends that are going on.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.430
But it's our view
that the technology

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.010
likely to have the greatest
impact on the world

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.840
for the next 20
years is actually

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.280
not the mobility, big data,
cloud computing, machine

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.740
learning, AI, et cetera.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.990
It's the technology behind
cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.220
and it's called the blockchain.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.410
And after a few
years of research

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.130
and the writing for
this book, we've

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.180
basically become convinced
that this technology represents

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.720
nothing short of the second
generation of the internet.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.550
So when you use
the internet today

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.030
to send or move or
share information,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.990
you're not actually
sending an original.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.030
You're sending a copy, and
you're retaining an original.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.620
And generally
speaking, that's OK.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.310
In fact, it's one of the
great benefits of the internet

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.040
is that we have this
publishing platform

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700
for the democratization
of information.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.132
So all you need is an internet
connection and some kind

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:50.590
of internet-enabled
device, and you

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.960
can access Google
and Wikipedia and all

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.190
these wonderful resources.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.880
But when it comes
to value, things

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.110
like money, stocks, bonds,
other financial assets,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.570
sending a copy is
actually not a good idea.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.520
You see, if I send you $20
in payment for something,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.210
it's really important that you
know that you have that $20,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.950
and I don't.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.080
Because if I could
send the same $20

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.450
to every single person in
this room, then that $20

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.680
becomes worthless, and the
global economy collapses,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.660
and I go to jail.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.630
And these are all
really bad things.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.310
So it's OK to have a printing
press for information,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.202
but it's not OK to have a
printing press for money.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:32.910
And this is something
that cryptographers

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.467
have been trying to figure
out for a very long time.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.050
It's called the
double-payment problem

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.100
or the double-spend problem.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.760
And the first iterations
of digital cash

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.310
were actually developed
20, 22 years ago

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.360
by Nick Szabo, a cryptographer.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.860
There was another
one too, developed

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.560
by a guy named Adam
[? Chom. ?] And it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.950
was very close to being part
of the initial integration

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.210
into the Netscape
Navigator, but they

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.010
couldn't do it because they
couldn't figure out this issue.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.450
So it turns out
that we need help.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.440
We need help establishing trust.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.650
We need help
verifying the identity

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.890
of parties in a transaction.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.849
We need help with the
clearing and the settling

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.264
of those transactions,
and we need

00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:12.580
help with the record keeping.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.740
And what we turn to for all
of those important functions

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.450
of commerce online
are middlemen,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.340
basically-- Intermediaries.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.080
And these intermediaries take
different shapes and forms.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.590
People are familiar,
obviously, with banks.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.420
But also increasingly, from
the digital revolution,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.900
we've got big conglomerates,
digital conglomerates,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.880
like Google, who act as
arbiters in the middle

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.440
of a lot of transactions
online-- Facebook, Uber, Apple,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.187
et cetera, but also
governments too.

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.020
And generally speaking,
these intermediaries

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300
do a pretty good job.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.540
But they have
certain limitations.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.880
For one, many of them
are very centralized.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.790
And anything that's centralized
is vulnerable to hacking

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.230
or to attack or to failure.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
And we see this with
regularity-- Twitter, LinkedIn,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.480
Home Depot, Target, including
financial services firms

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.120
like Morgan Stanley, JP
Morgan, and even governments,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280
like the NSA and the
State Department.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.680
If the NSA can't secure
its systems, then who can?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.490
They tax the system, especially
in financial services.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.180
In the case of sending
money overseas, for example,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.390
it can cost anywhere
between 9% and 18% just

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.630
to make a cross-border
transaction,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.820
a cross-border payment, which is
crazy when you think about it,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.500
the idea of a
cross-border payment.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.600
Nobody ever talks about
a cross-border email.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.820
And it's just data, really,
when you think about value.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.414
They exclude a whole bunch of
people from the global economy.

00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:34.580
There are 2 and /12 billion
people in the world that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.860
don't have access to financial
services of any kind,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.160
and there are lots
of reasons for that.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.880
And they slow things down.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.150
In the case of Google,
not so much, actually.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.760
They make things fast.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.450
But in the case of the
financial services industry,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.019
the technology systems that
we run to manage things

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:54.310
like payments and clearing
and settling of transactions

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.650
are actually like
30, 40 years old--

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.680
the swift system, the
automated clearinghouse system,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.160
and other types of
settlement transaction layers

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.020
run mainframes from the
'70s and '80s and are older

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.160
than most of the
people in this room.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.020
So you could argue
that as a result

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.000
of this issue of establishing
trust and identity online,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.580
that intermediaries
still capture

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.330
an asymmetric amount of the
value of commerce, perhaps

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.540
even more so than they did
in the pre-digital age.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.510
So what if there were a
vast global distributed

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.850
platform that ran a ledger,
basically like a spreadsheet,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.730
that everyone could see, that
didn't run on one system--

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.980
one bank system, one
government system-- but ran

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.980
on every single computer
around the world

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.350
and wasn't only open to a few,
but was open to everybody?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.800
Where not just information, like
emails and PDFs and websites

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.590
and voice over IP,
but literally anything

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.850
of value, so of course,
money and stocks

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.810
and bonds and financial assets,
but also titles and deeds,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.370
intellectual property,
scientific discoveries,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.680
even votes in an
election could be

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.090
moved, stored, and managed
privately and securely,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.000
and where trust was not
established by an intermediary

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.120
but rather through mass
collaboration, clever code,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.390
and cryptography.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.650
And I think that's what
we've gotten with blockchain.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.110
So in 2008, the global
financial system

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.860
was on the brink of collapse.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.390
Everybody remembers
that pretty well.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.930
Some of you might
been in high school.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.800
But somewhat propitiously,
right around that time,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.950
an anonymous person or group
of people under the pseudonym

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.160
Satoshi Nakamoto
outlined in a white paper

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.990
cash for the internet-- digital
cash, which is basically

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.350
to say a way to make payments
peer to peer without using

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.940
an intermediary, kind of like
the way you would go down

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.550
to the coffee shop, and
with a five quid note,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.377
pay for coffee and a donut.

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:48.210
There's no intermediary
in that transaction.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.040
That didn't really
exist for the internet.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.790
We've always had to
rely on intermediaries

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.010
to make payments.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.160
And they launched it
shortly thereafter.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.260
And since then,
it's caught a spark.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.802
It's traveled like wildfire
to the world of computing,

00:07:01.802 --> 00:07:03.760
financial services, which
is the area that I've

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.180
spent some of formative
years of my career,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.140
but also into business
generally, media,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.210
and including government.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.690
So bitcoin is many things
to different people.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.070
Some people think of
bitcoin as an asset.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.900
It goes up.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.445
It goes down.

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:18.070
You can buy it.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.353
You can sell it.

00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:19.720
You can make money on it.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.920
And that's certainly true.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.060
And actually it's
increasingly being

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.180
viewed as sort of an
uncorrelated asset

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.050
and a safe harbor,
in some respects.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.120
So Brexit referendum
vote, bitcoin went up 20%.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.400
When the Chinese
People's Bank of China

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.630
wants to devalue its currency,
bitcoin usually rallies.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.010
And that's interesting.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.630
But more interestingly,
it's a cryptocurrency,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.190
which is to say a currency
that's not issued or controlled

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.450
by a nation state or by a
supernational organization,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.990
like the European Union.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.760
And that's very interesting if
you're in a part of the world

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.830
where the local currency is
very unreliable, where there

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.630
are strict capital controls, if
you're part of diasporas living

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.940
abroad, and you send money
home to your families,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.220
and you normally pay 10%.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.550
These are all opportunities
for bitcoin as a cryptocurrency

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.500
But most interestingly is it's
based on this technology called

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.930
the blockchain.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.580
So for the first time
in human history,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.590
two or more parties need not
know nor trust one another

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.270
to transact or do business.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.460
You've got trust
rather than being

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.960
the domain of the intermediary.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.160
The controlling role
of the intermediary,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.140
it's actually native
to this technology,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.950
which is why we call
blockchain the trust protocol.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.710
So people here, doubtless, are
familiar with all of this stuff

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.740
to some degree.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.248
And so you know full well that
there's the bitcoin blockchain.

00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:41.789
There are other
types of blockchains.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.724
Some are public, like Ethereum
is another public blockchain.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.390
And then there are
others that are not--

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.223
private blockchains
that are being developed

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:49.910
by banks and enterprise
and government

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.060
and these different things.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.870
So not every
blockchain looks like.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.200
But this is generally
the way they work.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.330
So it starts with a
distributed ledger,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.160
which is not running on
one computer or one system.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.615
It's running on every single
system that has access to it.

00:09:05.615 --> 00:09:08.560
Transactions that are constantly
happening on the network

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.597
are validated by a
community of participants.

00:09:11.597 --> 00:09:13.180
In the case of the
bitcoin blockchain,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.910
they're called miners, not
like : "minors" miners,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.370
but like pick axe miners,
who commit large computing

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.500
resources to solve
a difficult problem,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.660
after which they reach
consensus, essentially,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.880
on what has occurred.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.470
And in reward for reaching
consensus on what's occurred,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.470
they're rewarded
with a new bitcoin.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.854
And every so often these
transactions on the network,

00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:37.270
kind of like the heartbeat,
are captured into these things

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.390
called blocks.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.100
And then each block,
once it's validated,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.086
must refer to the
preceding block

00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:43.460
in the blockchain
and every block

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.210
all the way back to
the beginning of time.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.585
So what that means
effectively is

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:48.290
if I wanted to
rewrite a transaction,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.990
like send the same $20
twice in the first example

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.480
that I gave, I would
not only have to go back

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.810
and just move a number
in a spreadsheet,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.210
hack one transaction, I'd
have to go back basically

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.860
and rewrite the entire history
of commerce on the blockchain

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.220
all the way back to
the beginning of time

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.320
on the blockchain, and do
so in a very short window,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.770
fighting against one of
the most powerful computing

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.320
resources in the world.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.900
One blockchain
startup CEO, who also

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.840
was a partner at
Andresen Horowitz,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.270
estimates that the
computing power

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.260
that this network marshals
to validate transactions

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.650
is about 100 times
as big as Google.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.940
So that's very big, because you
guys know how big Google is.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.300
Maybe you don't.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.170
And of course, each
block is time stamped,

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.544
which means any
attempt to change

00:10:35.544 --> 00:10:38.650
when a transaction's occurred,
is sort of identified

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.930
and stopped.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.840
So that's the way bitcoin works.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.570
But it's open source, so it's
created this sort of Cambrian

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.220
explosion of innovation,
which has led

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.090
to new types of blockchains.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.305
So just to show of hands, who
here has heard of Ethereum?

00:10:52.305 --> 00:10:53.430
So most of the people here.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.656
So I'm very proud of
Ethereum because it's

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:58.907
a little Canadian success story,
and I'm from Toronto, Canada.

00:10:58.907 --> 00:10:59.990
Any Canadians in the room?

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.916
[CHEERING]

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:01.416
Yes!

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.110
Yeah, we're now
worried about Quebexit.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.630
So Ethereum was started by a
Canadian college dropout named

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.450
Vitalik Buterin, who was
a big fan of bitcoin,

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.060
but in it he saw
certain limitations.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.530
He wanted to build applications.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.900
He wanted to do smart
contracts, complicated tasks

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.605
that he thought bitcoin was
limited in its ability to do.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.480
And so he created this
thing called Ethereum.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.710
He wrote a white paper, put it
on Reddit, put it on GitHub,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.800
and said, who wants
to fund my project?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.940
And he ended up
raising 19 million US

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.286
dollars in a matter of four
weeks to fund this project.

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.160
And they basically went
down and got to work.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.210
And 12 months later,
Etherium launched.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.450
And it's now worth around a
billion and a half US dollars,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.940
and it's being used by
Microsoft, Deloitte,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.670
UPS, and a whole bunch
of other very big firms.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.770
One of the things that
it does is, I mentioned,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.090
smart contracts, which is
kind of what they sound like.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.649
A software program that mimics
the logic of a contract,

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:08.440
but where the enforcement
and the execution

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.680
is done automatically,
and where it also

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.180
has a payment
mechanism that assures

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.960
everyone gets
compensated regularly

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.410
without the need for lawyers
and escrow agents and bankers

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.410
and all these other
kind of friction points

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.220
in traditional contracting.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.390
And we kind of
suggested in the book

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.490
that this could create whole new
kinds of business models, where

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.330
a lot of the roles that we
normally reserved for people,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.340
could be automated through these
things called smart contracts.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.340
Who here has heard of this
thing the DAO-- D-A-O?

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.720
OK, so everyone.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.250
You know that it's all good.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.910
No problems with the DAO.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.241
It's all good.

00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:46.740
No.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.130
So in the book we said
there's this thing

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.169
called the distributed
autonomous enterprises is what

00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:53.710
we call these
companies that wouldn't

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.050
have people doing normal roles.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.900
And we at the time
we thought, god, this

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.690
is a little bit far out there.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.069
A company without
people-- people

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:04.110
are going to think that
we drank our own Kool-Aid

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.050
or that we're toking up
or something like that.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.580
But we said, let's do it.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.746
Let's put it into the book.

00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:10.870
And we'll see where we get.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.530
The day the book launched
this thing called

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.760
the D-A-O. came into existence.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.470
And it looked a lot like the
D-A-E that we had suggested

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.900
could happen with the book.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.320
It has no management.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.170
It has no staff in
the traditional sense.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.050
It has no board of governors.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.300
It's an investment
vehicle that was

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.020
designed to make investments
into the blockchain industry.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.192
And its first task was
to raise some money.

00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:35.650
And in the first few weeks, it
managed to raise at its peak

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:42.380
165 million US dollars, which,
just for financial services,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.535
is a huge breakthrough.

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:45.439
So forget of the
DAO works or not.

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:47.480
What does it mean when an
entrepreneur or a group

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.200
of entrepreneurs can
basically gain access

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.200
to tens of thousands
of individual investors

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.624
and do a peer-to-peer crowd
sale without the need for VC,

00:13:57.624 --> 00:13:59.290
without the need for
an investment bank,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.540
without the need even for
Kickstarter or an Indiegogo?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.970
$162 million is a lot of money.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.390
I mean, that's like the bread
and butter for late stage

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.510
VC for a lot of IPO
markets around the world.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.010
So this is going to have a big
disruptive force on finance.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.570
Of course, the DAO, like
any good blockchain startup,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.440
has problems, namely
that there was

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.670
a flaw in this contract
that enabled someone

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.280
to exploit it momentarily
to siphon off some money

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.290
into a separate account.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.050
And that's an issue that's
being resolved right now.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.220
We'll get back to that.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.820
So going back to
financial services,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.290
does everybody know
what this thing is?

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.130
It's called a Rube
Goldberg machine.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.338
It's the kind of thing I'd
expect to find in a Google

00:14:44.338 --> 00:14:46.230
lobby, actually.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:51.770
Guests wear like a boxing glove
and hit something, and hilarity

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.520
ensues.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.420
This is kind of how
the financial services

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.660
industry works,
actually, which is

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.414
that a whole bunch of
complicated things happen.

00:15:01.414 --> 00:15:02.830
And in the end, a
very simple task

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.290
is solved, like an egg is
cracked or a door is closed.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.760
London just introduced the
TAP cards in the taxis, right?

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.442
And you tap your
card, and you feel

00:15:13.442 --> 00:15:14.900
like that's a
seamless transaction,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.483
that the value might
be going directly

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:18.760
from you to the cabdriver.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.530
But it's not.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.488
It's going through a
series of intermediaries--

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:25.060
your bank, his bank,
cab company's bank,

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.327
a processing firm,
the Visa network,

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.910
if you're using Visa,
the AMEX network

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.160
if you're using
AMEX, and usually,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.770
some kind of a clearinghouse
or some kind of systems.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.570
So you're talking about half a
dozen different intermediaries.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.820
And the money doesn't
land immediately.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.350
It actually takes
five to seven days.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.100
And it's not free.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.960
It costs usually anywhere
between 2% and 10%,

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.960
which is why cab drivers hate
taking credit cards, right?

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.280
And that's actually an
efficient example of the way

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.240
the financial services
industry works.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.830
In the book we
identified sort of what

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.980
are the eight things that this
industry does in the economy

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.170
to try and better understand
how blockchain would impact it.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.610
And it turns out in each of
these different functions,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.120
there's a big opportunity
to fundamentally transform

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.780
the nature of the industry.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.040
So everything from how
we fund and invest,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.920
which would be, say, the DAO,
how we connect entrepreneurs

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.250
with investors who are prepared
to give growth capital, how

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.230
we access credit, how we
just store and move value,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.220
et cetera.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.620
So given the potential
of this technology,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.035
it's no small wonder
why a lot of media

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:30.160
outlets and big stakeholders
are waking up to this.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.440
So "The Economist" ran this
cover story on blockchain

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.330
in October of 2015, last year.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.970
And they said
blockchain is not one

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.310
of the most important
developments of the past 20

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.810
years.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.976
They said it's one of the
most important innovations

00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:50.020
of the past 200 years, along
with double-entry bookkeeping

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.030
and the joint-stock corporation,
which admittedly are not

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:59.580
the sexiest things in
the world-- double entry,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.090
no, so boring.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.276
But kind of important,
because without

00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:05.650
double-entry bookkeeping and
the joint-stock corporation,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.525
there'd be no Google.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.877
There'd be no skyscraper.

00:17:07.877 --> 00:17:08.960
There'd be no electricity.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.293
There'd be none of these things.

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:12.780
There the basis of
the economic order.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.810
So given all that, this
is the conversation

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.069
that's happening a lot
of times in companies,

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.050
increasingly, from
financial services,

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.050
but also in
government, et cetera.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.300
By the way, Dilbert is usually a
pretty good harbinger of things

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.460
to come.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.040
And in 1993, they ran
a cartoon about Unix,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:46.790
where the boss confused Unix
with eunuchs, but anyway.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.240
So what does this mean
for you and for us,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.190
and why should you care?

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.740
So in the book we
identified sort

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.700
of a half a dozen ways
in which blockchain

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.250
will be transformative.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.380
And the one I'd like
to share with you today

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.639
is this idea of
prosperity, which

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:04.430
is that the internet
has been a great tool,

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.000
and it's changed
the way we live.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.640
But on certain metrics it has
a bit of a mixed track record.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880
On the report card
for prosperity,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.880
this idea that the
rising tide of technology

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.860
lifts all boats, that some can
succeed much more than others--

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.270
you know, Larry Page, Sergey
Brin, and all of you--

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.920
but that generally
everyone gets ahead.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.690
Well, if you look at
the big social issues

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.870
in a lot of parts of the world,
social inequality and income

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.330
inequality is kind of number
one in almost every OECD

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.680
country, with the exception
of the UK, where it's Brexit.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.810
But actually, if you look
at the origins of Brexit,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.990
you could argue
that big social ills

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.510
have exacerbated the tension
which may have led to the vote.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.380
And it could also be the reason
why you see this populist surge

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.660
in places like France--
Marie Le Pen-- and in the US

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.310
with Donald Trump, et cetera.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.440
So could blockchain
help us to build

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.840
a more prosperous economy,
more inclusive economy?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.100
We think so.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.790
So in the book we identify
eight transformations.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.700
The first couple are really
low-hanging fruit-- inclusion.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.190
2 and 1/2 billion
people the world

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.890
don't have a bank
account or any way

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.010
to make payments or store money.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.370
And without that, their economic
mobility is severely limited.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.610
They really have no way
to participate fully

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.620
in the global economy.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.680
And it turns out that the
reason that banks can't really

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.314
offer services to these
people, in addition

00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.730
to them not really having a
balance that would justify it,

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.230
is that they don't
have an identity.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.010
If you don't have an identity,
you can't prove who you are.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.060
Then a bank's never
going to service you.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.570
So they don't have a driver's
license, birth certificate,

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.640
et cetera.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.230
Blockchain startups are
trying to solve this problem

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.180
by not looking at it
as a banking question

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.340
but looking at it as
basic financial services.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.250
So when you think about what
retail banks actually do,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.550
they basically give people
way to move money, which

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.610
is to make payments and transfer
funds, a way to store money,

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.760
a way to reliably capture your
savings somewhere, where it's

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.640
not stored in a pig or a
cow or something like that,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.970
and a way to get
access to credit--

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.750
so to get a loan to buy a
house or get an education

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.500
or to start a business.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.990
And the barriers to entry for
new startups in this space

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.800
are dropping significantly.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.845
There's a company in
Kenya called M-Pesa,

00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:25.720
which I'm sure many of
you are familiar with,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.600
which doesn't use blockchain.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.250
It just leverages
a telecom network,

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.160
which everyone's got a phone.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.050
Nobody has a bank account.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.000
Everyone has a phone.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.560
And it's been able to push 40%
of the GDP through this system.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.380
Now, unfortunately, you want
to talk too big to fail.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.170
If 40% of the GDP is
moving through one company,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.560
that's a problem.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.800
And also because it's localized
to whatever their coverage is,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.360
it's inherently limited.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.620
It's a Kenya-based thing.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.510
So what if we could do
that on a global scale?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.700
There's a very famous
Peruvian economist

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.210
named Hernando de Soto,
who says the biggest

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.520
barrier to upward
mobility is not actually

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.790
financial inclusion.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.180
It's land titles.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:11.120
70% of people in the world who
think they own land, actually

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.470
have a very unforeseeable
claim to it.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.480
And this plays out
all over the world.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.600
The Rio Olymics-- they basically
evicted tens of thousands

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.732
of people from favelas
to build stadiums.

00:21:20.732 --> 00:21:23.190
Some of them were squatters,
who'd been there for 50 years.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.920
Others actually had a title
that said they owned the land.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.964
It didn't matter.

00:21:26.964 --> 00:21:28.630
They said actually
our government system

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.830
says that we own the land,
and we're evicting you

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.520
from this piece of property.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.100
It happens in places
like Honduras,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.540
where the most recent
president was actually

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.060
ousted in a bloodless coup for
doing this exact same thing.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.600
He expropriated
land from peasants

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.100
and said that his
friends in government

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.350
and his other cronies owned it.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.849
Well, now the
government of Honduras

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:51.090
is working with a blockchain
company called Factum to try

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.050
and solve these problems.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.056
And it's happening in other
places too-- in Georgia,

00:21:56.056 --> 00:21:58.430
in Europe, they're working
with a company called Bitfury.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.410
| has also announced a pilot.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.240
The idea is pretty simple.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.620
You need good data, to
start, of who owns what.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.416
Because if you put garbage
in, you'll get garbage out.

00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:10.040
But if everyone can agree on who
owns what property and it goes

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.630
into the system, that
means that no single entity

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.930
can unilaterally
change who owns what.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.450
No dictator or tyrant
can mess with it.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.090
And it also means that the
security of that information

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.680
is much stronger.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.970
I was at a blockchain conference
with the former prime minister

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.980
of Haiti.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.260
And he said that
after the earthquake

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.430
they lost all of their records
because everything was stored

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.080
either in paper or in a
central computer system

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.790
in one single building in Port
Au Prince, which collapsed.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.420
And the entire government's
history of people and buildings

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.170
were wiped out in
one single blow.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.860
Could we use blockchain to
create a true sharing economy?

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.290
Companies like Uber
and Lyft and TaskRabbit

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.890
are called part of this
so-called sharing economy.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.680
But we actually think
they don't really

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.760
have that much to
do with sharing.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.110
In fact, we think they're
actually successful precisely

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.030
because they don't share.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.570
Uber is a $65 billion
service aggregator.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.710
That is it acts as a
centralized intermediary,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.350
aggregating drivers
and cars through

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.480
a centralized
aggregator, and then

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.900
pushing it out to
an open market.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.680
In the process, they capture
a big chunk of the fee-- 20%,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.790
25%.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.520
But they also capture all
of the value. $65 billion's

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.290
the big prize, not
the 20%, right?

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.240
So there are new ways
to distribute ownership

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.450
across companies, kind
of similar to the DAO,

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.650
where anybody with as little
as $1 can become a shareholder.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.150
And instead of
having a corporation,

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.200
you could have a
drive-around cooperative.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.250
Where many of the functions
of what Uber does-- identity,

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.390
reputation, contracting,
and payments basically,

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.360
that's about 80%
of what they do--

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.200
can be automated using
blockchain technology

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.874
and smart contracting
technology.

00:23:56.874 --> 00:23:59.040
And we could actually create
a true sharing economy,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.030
where the creators of value
get to participate more fully.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.980
$600 billion a year moves
from developed countries

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.490
into developing countries.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.870
It's the biggest flow of funds
into the developing world,

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.380
more so than direct foreign
investment or foreign aid.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.870
And it costs around 10%,
according to the World Bank.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.370
And it's something that directly
affects some of the poorest

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.210
people the world.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.340
So in Haiti, 25% of the GDP, the
whole country, is remittances.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.390
In the Philippines,
which is a big country

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:34.230
with a diverse economy,
it's still 13% of the GDP

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.351
is remittances.

00:24:35.351 --> 00:24:36.850
So there's a
housekeeper in Toronto.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.350
Her name's Annalee Domingo.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.240
And for 25 years, she's
been sending money dutifully

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.596
home to her mother in Manila.

00:24:42.596 --> 00:24:44.220
And I joined her in
one of these trips.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.220
So she gets her paycheck--
physical paycheck--

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.140
from her boss.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.216
Goes to the bank, deposits
it, withdraws cash.

00:24:49.216 --> 00:24:51.090
Gets on a bus, goes to
the other side of town

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.840
from where she lives to a
Filipino supermarket, which

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.570
also is a Western Union counter.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.310
It's payday, so 50 other
people have the same idea.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.050
We wait in line for an hour.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.710
She gets to the front of the
line, fills out a paper form--

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.220
the same form she's filled
out every month for 25 years--

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.990
and hands over physical cash.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.650
The money doesn't
arrive the next day

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.785
or even two days later.

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:12.820
It arrives five to
seven days later,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.027
and it costs anywhere
between 9% and 10%.

00:25:16.027 --> 00:25:17.610
Her mother, who's
70, in Manila, never

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.400
knows when it's going to arrive,
and this is a point of stress.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.590
Will she go and pick it up?

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.310
When does she have
to go and pick it up?

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.400
And there's a cottage industry
in places like the Philippines,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.730
where stickup artists just hang
around Western Union locations,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.080
waiting for people to get
cash, and then they rob them.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.270
So this is a very inefficient
system and one that's

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.400
unfair to vulnerable people.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.480
Now Annalee uses an
application called Abra, which

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.640
is based out of Silicon Valley.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.724
And what it does is allows
her boss or her employer

00:25:46.724 --> 00:25:48.890
to pay her directly through
her bank-- she's banked.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.620
She's not unbanked-- through her
bank account into the Abra app.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.270
She's able from
there to send money

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.302
to her mother in
the Philippines.

00:25:56.302 --> 00:25:58.760
What they do is they use the
bitcoin blockchain, basically,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.600
as a payment rail to move the
value from her to her mother.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.760
But her mother's 70, and she's
50, and they're not tech savvy.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.550
So what Abra's done
to make it easier

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.740
is that Annalee only
sees Canadian dollars,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.700
and her mom only
sees Filipino pesos.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.440
There's no bitcoin
in this transaction,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.880
and it doesn't cost 10%.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.120
It cost 1/4 of 1%.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.370
Now, Mum's in the Philippines.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.259
She wants cash.

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:22.550
She goes to the market in cash.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.160
She pays her rent in cash.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.460
So what Abra's has done
is put on top of it

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.920
a teller network, sort
of like Uber drivers,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.590
where someone will meet
you in exchange for a fee,

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.670
and swap for your virtual
for your physical pesos.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.710
And they set the price.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.590
So 2%, they get a five
out of five-star rating.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.320
Her mom meets this person,
and they swap the cash.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:49.760
The whole thing takes half an
hour and costs 1 and 1/2% 2%,

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.794
rather than taking seven
days and costing 10%.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.920
They didn't quite get
the proportions right

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.260
on this image.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.530
I have a big head,
but it's not that big.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.200
One of the interesting things
about the first generation

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.060
of the internet is that the
asset class, the most important

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.270
asset class of this
economy, is data,

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.710
kind of like industrial
plant in the industrial age,

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.950
and land in the agrarian age.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.104
But individuals don't own it.

00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:21.520
It's actually owned
and controlled

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.370
by powerful intermediaries--
Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber,

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.340
your banks, your governments.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.550
And there are some
issues with that,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.330
namely, that it prevents
individuals, a lot of times,

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.120
from using it to
manage their affairs

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.630
or to monetize that value
and that data in some way,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.910
but also, in the
most extreme cases,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.470
can lead to people's
privacy being undermined.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.420
So there are now companies
that use blockchain

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.950
to create a virtual you, like
a personal black box, where

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.430
in it, you've got different
shades of your identity-- me

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.400
the citizen, me the
employee, me the consumer,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.040
me the user of social media,
me the customer of a bank.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.120
And you decide
how that data gets

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.909
used in each
individual situation,

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:07.450
and you only relinquish
what you need

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.530
to relinquish to gain
access to a certain service.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.200
So you want to make a payment?

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.550
You want buy something?

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.860
Nobody really needs to know
who you are, necessarily.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.170
If you go buy a hot
dog downstairs--

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.810
do they sell hot dogs in the UK?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.660
Yeah, you go down
to get like a scone

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:32.020
from the scone stand,
the guy running

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.680
the scone stands doesn't ask
for your driver's license.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.340
He just wants to know you've
got the money for the scone

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.170
and the jam and
the clotted cream.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.760
So there's an opportunity here
to change the relationship

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.150
that people have with
who they interact with.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.950
Now, it's actually not
necessarily a negative

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.930
for companies like Google.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.527
You guys love data, big data.

00:28:56.527 --> 00:28:58.110
But maybe you could
get even more data

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.930
if you ensure that consumers
kind of got a cut of the value.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.480
Instead of being just passive
recipients of your services,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.579
they were "prosumers,"
they were giving you

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.120
information that was valuable
to you, and in exchange getting

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.820
some kind of value, other than
the brilliant amazing, free,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.790
utility that is Google.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.320
Could we ensure that
artists get compensated

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.680
fairly for the content
that they create?

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.830
Who know Imogen Heap here?

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.140
She's English.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.320
I'm very disappointed
in the rest of you.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.550
So artists have
always had a bad deal,

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.110
ever since the days
of Medici, really.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.900
And during the record
label era, they

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.840
fought for a few percent
royalties on every single song

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.090
that they released.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.410
And through the
internet era, which

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.509
was supposed to solve
this to a certain degree,

00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:50.300
to put more power in
the individual's hands

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.980
and less reliance
on intermediaries,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.162
it actually made things
worse, because music,

00:29:54.162 --> 00:29:56.370
which was an asset turned
into a free commodity which

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.190
could be duplicated and
shared with everyone.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.640
And so a new set
of intermediaries

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.320
stepped in to try and
solve this-- Apple

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.570
with digital downloads and
now Spotify with streaming.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.840
But it's only gotten
worse for artists.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.480
So if you were a songwriter
on a hit single in the '80s,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:17.330
and it sold a million copies,
you would get about $45,000.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.350
The same song today, if it's
streamed a million times

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.240
on Spotify, the
songwriter can expect $36.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.640
So $45,000 to $36,
which in London

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.180
doesn't get you very far.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.760
I've tried over the
past couple of days.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.940
So there's something's
gotta give kind of feeling

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.900
to it, right?

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.400
So now artists are
looking for a way

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.300
to put more control into
the hands of creators.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.320
So Imogen Heap has a startup
in London called Mycelia, which

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.030
takes the song, which
is normally just music,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.050
and gives it intelligence.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.730
So within the song are
licensing rights and royalty

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.020
rights built in.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.500
So whatever the song's consumed,
let's say it's streamed,

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.740
and it's half of a cent.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.610
That half of a cent will
get split immediately

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.870
amongst whoever has the
royalties on that song--

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.670
the artists,
producers, et cetera.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.697
But if it's downloaded
for $1, the royalty regime

00:31:14.697 --> 00:31:16.780
might be the same, but the
licensing is different.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.690
So it's $1.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.560
And if it's played
in a TV commercial,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.850
it's a different
licensing regime.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.420
If it's sampled for a ring
tone, it's a different one.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.200
But every time it's consumed,
however it's consumed,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.330
the value moves directly from
whoever's paying directly

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.820
to the artist, rather than
going through this system

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.200
of intermediaries.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.650
So that assures that
artists get paid first.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.270
It doesn't solve the
you-can-duplicate-music issue.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.010
But if the pie is
shrinking, it just

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.820
makes sure that more
of the smaller pie

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.210
is going to people who
actually deserve it.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.360
So in the book that's
an example of what

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.470
we call the metering
economy, which

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.030
is that we have all this value--
our data, maybe an autonomous

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.800
vehicle not too
far down the road,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.410
which we should be able
to meter out to the world

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.830
and receive value for it.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.720
Maybe it's a solar panel
on the roof of your house.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.950
This is an example of
what NASDAQ is doing.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.492
NASDAQ, we think of as a market
maker or a technology provider

00:32:10.492 --> 00:32:11.950
to the markets and
stocks and bonds

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.330
and other financial assets.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.580
They view themselves as a
technology firm whose core

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.270
competency is markets.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.620
So what could blockchain do
to expand the idea of markets

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.340
to other types of asset classes?

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.222
One of them is electricity.

00:32:24.222 --> 00:32:26.430
So they're working right
now with a distributed power

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.730
company in Silicon
Valley, where if you've

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.850
got a panel on your roof
and you generate power

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.940
in excess of what
you need, you can

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:38.990
sell it not into the grid at a
wholesale rate to the utility,

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.490
but rather peer to peer,
to your neighbor or someone

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.470
on the other side of town at
a market rate, a retail rate.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.962
And you can create much
more value for yourselves.

00:32:47.962 --> 00:32:49.420
What NASDAQ's doing
is allowing you

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.190
to basically bundle
kilowatt hours

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.360
into assets that can
be traded like stocks

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.820
across a marketplace
peer to peer,

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.480
which I think is fascinating.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.060
This is a guy
named Ronald Coase.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.230
Among other things,
I'd like to know

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.270
what he ate for breakfast
every day because he

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.530
lived till he was 103.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.970
But he basically asked
a very simple question.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.420
He said, why do we have firms?

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.100
Why are there corporations?

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.990
If the best way to allocate
resources and organize

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:23.450
capability is using a
market-- you know Adam Smith,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.240
free market-- then
why isn't everyone

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.430
an independent contractor?

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.580
How come all of
you work for Google

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.705
and you're not all transacting
with each other peer

00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:32.830
to peer in your
respective roles?

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.550
And he pointed to
one specific thing.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.080
He said, transaction costs.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.930
And he won a Nobel
Prize for saying this.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.430
So long as it's
cheaper to do things

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.960
inside the boundaries of
the firm than outside, then

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.326
firms will continue to grow.

00:33:43.326 --> 00:33:44.950
And he pointed
specifically to the cost

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.060
of search, coordination,
contracting, and establishing

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.920
trust.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.210
So Henry Ford knew this,
which is why the Ford Motor

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.250
Company had not
just a car plant,

00:33:55.250 --> 00:34:00.170
but it had a rubber plantation,
a timber mill, a steel plant,

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.950
because he knew that keeping
everything inside the firm

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.050
would be cheaper through
economies of scale.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.530
The internet changed that
somewhat-- unbundling

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.170
certain things from the firm.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.609
So we can rely increasingly
on offshoring and outsourcing

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:14.650
because we have communication
tools that allow us

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.130
to connect over long distances.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.560
You know the motto
"focus on what

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.110
you do best, outsource the
rest" came out the '90s, right

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.477
around the internet era.

00:34:23.477 --> 00:34:25.310
But now we think there
are new models, where

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.770
you can have
radically distributed

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.360
modes of production,
where, as I mentioned,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.360
you can kind of begin to
unbundle the vertically

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.610
integrated firms.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.510
Because everyone doesn't need to
know each other to build value,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.770
because we've got a technology
that establishes trust.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.030
People don't need to do
everything inside of firm,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.120
organize capabilities,
we can contract

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.500
pretty seamlessly for
relatively little cost

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.500
through smart
contracts, And things

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.440
like search, if you have
a record of everything,

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.570
and you know it's true
because it's immutable,

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.000
then you're able to find
valuable information that you

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.235
know is valid much more easily.

00:35:00.235 --> 00:35:02.840
And in the book we talk
about new business models,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.820
specifically the distributed
autonomous enterprise, which

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.190
is highly automated and complex
and uses this technology.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.010
So to conclude on
the transformations,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.240
let's talk about
government, because I

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.410
think this is a very
topical thing right now.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.090
These two books came
out when I was a kid,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.910
in '92 and '93,
"Reinventing Government"

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.510
and "The Gore Report on
Reinventing Government."

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.300
And in it they said we can
bring the tonic of the market

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.390
to bear on government.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.310
We can do government
better, faster, cheaper.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.310
We can use digital
technology to transform

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.860
the relationship between
government and citizens.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.400
You look back on government,
how it's changed,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.380
or how it is not change
over the past 25 years,

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.330
and I think at best, what we've
done is just pave the cow path.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.820
We've taken stuff that we
did in the pre-digital age

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.640
and made it digital,
without actually

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.810
changing the underlying
nature of government.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:03.670
And that, among other things,
is causing a real rift,

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.490
I think, between
governments and citizens,

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.948
where I think a
lot of people don't

00:36:06.948 --> 00:36:10.690
feel like their government
acts in their best interests,

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.440
and where they feel like
they're being left behind.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.320
And this is playing
out all over the world

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.970
in various different forms.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.760
So what could
blockchain do to A,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.850
restore legitimacy in
government institutions, and B,

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.300
just improve the way the
government deliver services

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.390
to people?

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:36.840
Well, on the first point, right
now, especially in the US,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.800
politicians are not
beholden to citizens.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.799
They're beholden to
powerful interests that help

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:42.550
to get them elected, basically.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.820
92% of people in the US believe
there should be a background

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.020
check on firearms,
according to a poll that

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.560
came out a week ago.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.570
Congress cannot pass a law that
reflects the will of the people

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.630
because they are captured
by these powerful forces.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.300
So why would you have
any faith in government

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.080
when it can't do anything to
reflect the will of the people?

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.940
Well, imagine if a
politician got elected

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.830
with a smart contract that
stipulated that they actually

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.276
had to abide by
their commitments,

00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:15.650
otherwise they
wouldn't get paid?

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.330
Or maybe a little
less severe, they

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.030
don't get the
appropriations to pay

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.850
for their projects they want
to pay for unless they actually

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.650
hit milestones that have
been pre-determined based

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.470
on the view of the electorate.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.270
The goal is not to
create direct democracy.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:41.650
The referendum last week sure
told us that that's a bad idea.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.855
But it is to help
empower individuals

00:37:43.855 --> 00:37:45.730
to have more active role
in government, which

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.970
I think is healthy,
within the context

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.870
of democratic institutions.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.180
In terms of delivering
services, well, gee, it

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.510
would be a lot easier if you
could procure taxes and pay out

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.900
benefits peer to
peer, without having

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.850
to rely on all the
paper and intermediaries

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.100
that we traditionally rely on.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.664
That's kind of
low-hanging fruit.

00:38:04.664 --> 00:38:06.080
And a lot of
governments have said

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.650
that-- the Bank of England.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.400
The Canadian Senate
came out with a report

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.426
saying that just the
pure delivery of services

00:38:11.426 --> 00:38:12.550
could be done a lot easier.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.360
So there's an opportunity
for government as well.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.050
So I'm bullish, obviously,
on all this stuff.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.080
But I don't believe that it's
going to happen on its own.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.930
Technology is not a solution
to the world's problems,

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.790
and blockchain is
certainly not a panacea.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.560
In fact, in the book we
identify there are so

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.030
many things that have
to go right for this

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.760
to actually reach its potential.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.580
We dedicated a whole
chapter to the things

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.920
that could go wrong-- "The
Showstoppers" chapter-

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.040
everything from can this
technology really meet

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.950
the demands that
we expect of it?

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.780
Can it animate the
internet of things

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.590
or be the backbone of financial
services or digital rights

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:51.090
management?

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.760
That's a big question.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.950
Is the energy consumed
unsustainable?

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.160
It takes a lot energy to
secure a network of that size.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.044
Could that be its
ultimate downfall?

00:39:00.044 --> 00:39:01.460
There are social
issues, like what

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.850
happens if vast automation
causes structural unemployment

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:06.400
and puts people out of work?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.010
What happens if governments
try to control it or stifle it?

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.630
That can happen anywhere
really, but especially

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.790
in places like China
and Russia, and Iran.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.820
Could powerful forces end up
just usurping it, controlling

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.910
it, and preventing this
peer-to-peer promise

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.550
that we expect?

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.530
And they're all
significant challenges.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.590
But in the book we
asked ourselves,

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.910
is it a reason that
blockchain's a bad idea,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.400
or is it an
implementation challenge

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.670
that deserves to be
addressed and overcome,

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.010
because the opportunity
is significant?

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.960
And for each of these,
we went with the latter.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:47.050
It's an implementation
challenge.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.870
So it's one of
those things where

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.400
we're at the brink of
a new era, we think.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.280
The technology genie has been
unleashed from the bottle.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.720
At our disposal, once again,
to transform the economic power

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.310
grid, the old order
of human affairs

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.190
and maybe if we get
this right to build

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.020
a more fair and inclusive
and prosperous world,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.440
but it won't happen on its own.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.700
We need leadership.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.130
I don't need to tell
you about leadership.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.130
You know everyone's
self-selected by being here.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.046
You're all rock stars.

00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:18.880
You work at Google.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.020
Leadership usually
doesn't come from the CEO

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.290
level or the president level
or the prime minister level.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.970
It comes from just
about anywhere.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.580
So I encourage you
to read the book,

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.352
to treat this is the first
step on a long journey.

00:40:32.352 --> 00:40:33.810
This technology,
I think, will come

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.330
to play a big part in
a lot of your lives.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.570
So join the
revolution, as we say.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.888
So thank you very much.

00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:44.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.550
SPEAKER 2: So we have
some time for questions.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.050
What do you think
will be the killer

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.609
application that breaks through
in kind of the Western world,

00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:54.150
do you think?

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.510
Because we don't do the money
transfer in the same way.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.218
Do you think there's
an application where

00:40:58.218 --> 00:40:59.990
my mom and dad will
start using it,

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.950
for example, even if
it's in the background?

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.500
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Well, I think
the second point of the question

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.697
is great, which is
that in a lot of ways,

00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:08.030
I think people will use this
technology without actually

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.350
realizing that they're
using the technology.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:14.070
So maybe your mom and
dad listen to music

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.220
or they read the
newspaper online, right?

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.549
And they might not
know this, but what's

00:41:19.549 --> 00:41:22.090
happening in the background is
that the articles that they're

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.440
reading are creating
microtransactions that directly

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.220
compensate the journalist.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.220
Rather than having to pay
a subscriptioin model,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.890
they might pay a microfee model.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.990
Same thing could
apply for music.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.200
When they go to the
bank, maybe they

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.520
use internet banking, for
example, or mobile banking.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.480
When they go to
make a payment, they

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.110
won't have to take a
photograph of a check

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.300
in order to send the money in.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.470
which they might
do-- the might not-

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.500
because there's a way to do
that transaction peer to peer.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.190
Right now you take a
picture of a check.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:55.144
It has 130 touch points
before it actually settles.

00:41:55.144 --> 00:41:57.060
It goes through 130
different sort of systems.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.300
|

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.480
Within the government
democracy, maybe they're

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.490
deliberative polling.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.740
Maybe your mom and dad,
prior to the Brexit vote,

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.610
wanted to participate in a
poll where the results were

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.979
not just tabulated by
some polling company,

00:42:13.979 --> 00:42:16.270
but rather accrued to a
blockchain, which gave everyone

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.160
a very accurate representation
of what everyone thought,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.660
which could have maybe swayed
the vote one way or the other.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.670
So that's just a few
of the top of my head.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.128
SPEAKER 2: And you
see a time scale

00:42:25.128 --> 00:42:26.790
when we might see
that happening, two,

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.637
five years, sooner?

00:42:27.637 --> 00:42:28.470
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Yeah.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.400
Well, I view the
future as not something

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.870
to be predicted rather
something to be achieved,

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.530
which might sound like a
cop out of the question.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.900
But I think we'll start
seeing big changes

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.530
in the deep architecture
of financial services

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.940
within a year or two
and then more broadly

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.120
within the next five years.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.560
AUDIENCE: So I worked
for a bank for 14 years.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.410
And I always work like
10 years in the past.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.940
How do you think this
kind of revolution

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.080
will come to banks,
to big banks?

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.100
Do you think they will
lose to the small guy that

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.050
will become bigger using this?

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.177
And then when they see, oh,
we don't have Chase anymore.

00:43:07.177 --> 00:43:08.760
Then they break, and
there's a new guy

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.160
that came from this technology.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.580
Do you think there
is a chance that they

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.020
start using this somehow?

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.330
ALEX TAPSCOTT: It's
a great question.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:22.810
When I started the research on
this about 2 and 1/2 years ago,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.999
no bank had expressed any
real interest in this.

00:43:25.999 --> 00:43:28.040
And even big consulting
firms, when I asked them,

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.000
like what are your big
bank clients saying,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.875
they're like, well, it's
kind of interesting.

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.610
We're not really keen on it.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.950
Now today, every single
bank in the world

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.690
has either made a pronouncement
that they're doing stuff,

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.710
or they're actually like heavily
invested in this technology.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.167
But not all banks are equal.

00:43:45.167 --> 00:43:47.250
And I think generally
speaking they fit into three

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.560
different categories.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.980
So category one are the
ones who don't really

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.780
understand what it is
or what it could mean.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.010
But they know that
it's a big deal.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.280
And so they're kind
of afraid of what

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.080
it means to their business, and
they're trying to learn more.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.510
Increasingly, more
banks fit into category

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.700
tow, which is they're viewing
this as a huge opportunity

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.940
namely to cut costs out
of the existing business.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.030
Because if you're a market
maker in a kind of stock

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.720
or a bond whatever it is and
you can assure that settlement

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.900
clearing happens
instantly, you don't

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.037
have to pay for clearinghouses
and transfer agents and escrow

00:44:22.037 --> 00:44:24.120
agents and all these
different intermediaries that

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.370
add friction to your business.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.430
So Santander, which
is a big bank,

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.460
said that just from public
equity clearing and settling,

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.477
banks could cut $20
billion of costs.

00:44:33.477 --> 00:44:35.310
And obviously, banks
to a lot more than just

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.030
public equity,
clearing, and settling.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.040
So that's a logical
perspective for a bank to have.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.300
If you're a bank
today, you're thinking

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.000
global growth is slowing down.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.230
The regulatory cost of
business is increasing,

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.660
and there's more competition
from fin-tech companies.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.660
All of that combined basically
means my revenue's probably not

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.080
going to grow very much.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.820
So how do I drive
return on equity?

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.820
How do I drive my share price?

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.847
The only way is to cut costs.

00:44:59.847 --> 00:45:01.680
So if they can cut costs
from their business

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.084
by using this technology,
then they're happy.

00:45:04.084 --> 00:45:05.750
And we're seeing lots
of implementations

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.300
that try and do that.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.910
R3 is a big consortium of 50
banks based out of the US.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.190
Hyperledger a project
being run by IBM

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.832
that has a dozen or
so banks as signed up.

00:45:15.832 --> 00:45:17.540
There's a company
Digital Asset Holdings,

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.210
which was started by the former
head of JP Morgan's investment

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.280
bank, Blythe Masters,
which is servicing stock

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.760
exchanges and big banks.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.270
and they're trying to capture
that side of the market.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.530
However, there is
a third category.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.470
And this is where I think most
banks and incumbents generally,

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.000
whatever industry
you're in, should

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.410
be more focused on, which is
to look at it strategically.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.010
Because what good is
cutting $20 billion

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:46.260
from public equity trading
when the process by which value

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.900
moves and gets
exchanged no longer

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.850
becomes something
that banks do at all?

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.170
What if that market disappears?

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.850
You can't have $20 billion from
a market that doesn't exist,

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:55.690
right?

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.600
So to think about
it strategically

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.580
is to say maybe I might
lose out in areas where I've

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.255
traditionally acted as this
intermediary, an arbiter,

00:46:04.255 --> 00:46:06.380
but could this technology
create new opportunities?

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.580
So like NASDAQ's move with
this distributed power grid,

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.790
I think is a good
example of that.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.202
Someone's got to go after
2 and 1/2 billion people

00:46:15.202 --> 00:46:17.160
in the world that don't
have access to banking.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.430
Someone's got to figure out
this remittance rip off.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.055
And right now the
only companies really

00:46:21.055 --> 00:46:23.000
that I think are
focused on big growth

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.050
are actually, as you mentioned,
startups-- new companies

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.757
that are trying to solve of
these intractable problems that

00:46:28.757 --> 00:46:30.340
have nothing to do
with cutting costs.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.756
They have everything to do
with transforming the industry.

00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:35.780
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.610
My name is Alfred.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.318
Thanks very much.

00:46:37.318 --> 00:46:39.730
It's really informative,
and you've sold me.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.790
You You've sold it to me.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:41.520
I'm happy with this.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.740
I want to go to
join the bandwagon.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.890
ALEX TAPSCOTT: You're
already wearing a red shirt,

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.230
so join the revolution.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.160
AUDIENCE: That's it.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.500
So the question is,
me as a mere mortal,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.520
how do I contribute to this?

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.880
How do I get involved?

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.680
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Do
you work at Google?

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.640
AUDIENCE: I do, yes.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.510
ALEX TAPSCOTT: You
are not a mere mortal.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.347
You're a superhero, right?

00:46:59.347 --> 00:47:00.680
How do you get involved in this?

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.150
Well, I think the one
thing that everybody can do

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:08.200
is to go to the App
Store, download a wallet,

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.420
buy some bitcoin, and just start
fiddling around with paying

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.160
with bitcoin, moving bitcoin.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.320
Because we can talk about
how the technology works

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.570
till the cows come home,
but you just use it, do it.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.430
You'll instantly get it, right?

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.080
And that'll just help you
with your understanding.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.420
More broadly, I would think
about how this technology could

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.630
apply to whatever business
that you might be in, right?

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.580
So Google, I don't want
to get out of my depth

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.080
because you guys
are all experts.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.360
But if you could
target consumers better

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.160
with advertising,
that's something

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.800
that you would explore, right?

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.580
Maybe you can mine data
that people volunteer,

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.920
and you can sign people up as
co-producers of Google content.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.830
And you could solve some
big issues in that way.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.652
Another way, the one specific
Google example that I actually

00:48:01.652 --> 00:48:02.610
think about is YouTube.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.401
So the digital rights
management for people

00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:07.790
who post content to YouTube
is a total nightmare.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.360
There are accounts at
Google where money just

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.990
accrues because you run ads
in front of a show or a song,

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.550
but nobody knows who owns it.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.720
And eventually, I think you
just keep it for yourself.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.450
So maybe don't want
to change that.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:25.110
But people who create content
would be a lot happier

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:29.750
with YouTube if they were able
to get paid directly every time

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.880
someone [INAUDIBLE] content,
and if you had a DRM system that

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.337
used this technology.

00:48:34.337 --> 00:48:36.670
Now, a lot of labels and tech
firms are working on this.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.940
But the place where
people consume

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.480
music the most in the world,
it's not Spotify or Apple.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.645
It's YouTube, right?

00:48:42.645 --> 00:48:44.270
So why not be a leader
in figuring that

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.056
out-- something like that.

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.180
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.200
This is really interesting.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.700
This is an
old-world-meets-new-world

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.930
question, and
excuse my ignorance.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.920
But what is the impact on
privacy and confidentiality

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.960
as it relates to the original
asset, or the original value

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.180
of the asset or service
and also as it relates

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.920
to margin that's applied on that
through added-value services?

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.070
Like you mentioned
the cash payment

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.930
of 2% margin or the 0.25%.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.810
So what's the impact
if that is clear to us

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:23.550
the whole chain of
the transaction?

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.960
ALEX TAPSCOTT: So
the systems are

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.450
transparent in that you can
see that money is moving

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.210
and that value is moving.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.170
But you can't see who's
moving that value.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.642
So you can see with
clarity whether or not

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.350
a transaction occurred
and whether or not

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.119
someone got paid.

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:43.160
But you don't necessarily
know who that person is

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.920
or who the sender is.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.270
So that obfuscates the
individual's identity,

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.255
which in a lot of situations,
is a very good thing.

00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:52.380
The other question though
that's really interesting

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:56.350
that you mentioned is the
origination right of the asset

00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:00.830
and how do you secure privacy
for whatever that asset is.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.300
And this is an interesting
point for the financial services

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.120
industry.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:04.990
We have bitcoin.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.630
We have ether.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:06.838
These are public blockchains.

00:50:06.838 --> 00:50:10.700
But if all financial assets,
like stocks and bonds,

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.410
are going to move
onto this platform,

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.120
someone's got to issue them.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.440
Maybe it's the Bank of England
issues a digital pound,

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.854
or Apple issues a
digital share certificate

00:50:19.854 --> 00:50:20.770
using this technology.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.103
But someone's got to issue them.

00:50:22.103 --> 00:50:26.440
So the interesting thing there
is that intermediaries are not

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:26.940
going away.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.040
Maybe intermediaries just
change their name to originators

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.420
because someone's got to
start building this platform--

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:37.425
or rather moving assets into
a native digital format.

00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:39.300
And actually I think
that's a big opportunity

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.710
for big financial firms
to do, essentially

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:43.799
So they're not going away.

00:50:43.799 --> 00:50:44.840
Banks are not going away.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.670
SPEAKER 2: It just want to
get two, three quick ones in.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:47.680
Maybe from the back.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.763
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Yeah, so
I'll do a lightning round.

00:50:49.763 --> 00:50:53.320
AUDIENCE: You recently
touched on the event that

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.300
happened at the DAO-- D-A-O.
I just wanted to kind of say

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.240
I'm pro blockchain,
and I just wondered

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.760
how you think that
event is going

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.570
to change people's perceptions,
especially when you

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:14.920
refer to the technology
that establishes trust?

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.930
Is there an element that people
are being a little bit too

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.780
Utopian at this stage about
what the blockchain is

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.860
and how it works?

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.346
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Yeah, so
on the Utopian side, yes.

00:51:25.346 --> 00:51:26.720
In terms of the
hype cycle, we're

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.240
starting to heat up
quite a bit here.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.823
And now people are
saying blockchain's

00:51:29.823 --> 00:51:33.050
the solution to all
of whatever ails you.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.904
And that's not a good
thing, generally.

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:36.570
People eventually
realize that it's not,

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.800
and that causes disillusionment.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.860
But on the question of
the DAO specifically, this

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.410
is a question of
communication and perception.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.880
Because Ethereum, which is the
blockchain on which the DAO is

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.550
built, was not hacked.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.550
So there's nothing about
the immutability or security

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.170
of the platform that's
been put into question.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.600
Basically, a company,
an organization

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.320
that uses the
technology, was breached.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.682
And new information is
coming out on this every day,

00:52:05.682 --> 00:52:07.140
so we may actually
find out that it

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.360
was one of the
original developers who

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.930
built a loophole into this
thing so that he could hack it.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.340
We don't know.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.590
But I think the DAO
will be a great use

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.380
case on how do you
govern an asset that

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.330
doesn't own by a company or
controlled by a government.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.921
How do you resolve
these issues when

00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:28.170
you're kind of outside of
the court system and outside

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.740
of the corporate world?

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.640
And that'll be
really interesting.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.180
My view on whether
or not it will

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.110
impact growth and
development in the industry

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.510
is that it probably will not.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.190
Things will continue
to move along.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.380
Stuff happens.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.980
Lots of startups fail,
let alone startups

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.910
that have radically new business
models, let alone startups

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.030
that don't have people.

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:54.830
So I think that in five years
time, the mysterious case

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:58.160
of the DAO will be a
Harvard Business School case

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.370
study on just how the hell you
deal with something like this.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.249
But I don't think it'll impact
the growth of the industry.

00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:07.540
AUDIENCE: So if I can come
back to the privacy question

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.800
from a different angle,
I think might have

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.049
different backgrounds on this.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.400
An awful lot of sort
of investigative work,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.040
in terms of the criminality,
which you alluded to earlier,

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.050
is following the money.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.020
Are we just going to accept
that we can't follow the money

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.190
anymore in the new world?

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.890
ALEX TAPSCOTT: Well,
actually I think

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.973
that it helps you to follow
the money much better.

00:53:24.973 --> 00:53:28.500
$2 and 1/2 trillion a year
of crime is done with cash.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.250
And cash is the ultimate
bear instrument.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:31.490
You know, it's a paper bill.

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.080
You can't trace back cash.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.920
It's harder to track payments
made in bitcoin than it is

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.670
to, say, Visa
payments or something.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.080
But it's a lot easier
than it is with cash.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.890
And because you have this
unbroken record of where money

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.840
is moved, generally
speaking, you

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.500
combine that with
other policing,

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.350
and you can actually stop
crime much easier than you can

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.460
with cash, which is why like
Mark Carney in his mansion

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.690
house speech last two
weeks ago said that this

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.460
could help to reduce crime.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.432
Because the less cash
there is in the system,

00:54:01.432 --> 00:54:03.790
the less opportunities
there are for criminals.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.010
But also after the Mt.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.390
Gox and the Silk Road issues,
law enforcement agents

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:14.080
in the US began to call
bitcoin prosecution futures

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.450
because you could actually
kind of identify down

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.250
the road when you could
catch someone based on when

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:21.590
the transaction occurred.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.560
So not to say that
criminals won't use it.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.130
Malware happens now
increasingly with bitcoin

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.450
more so than any
other payment method.

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.540
And that'll be an
issue, but it's actually

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.660
a superior alternative.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.726
And I think if law
enforcement's engaged

00:54:35.726 --> 00:54:38.100
and intelligent on the issue,
it could be a tool for them

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.317
as well.

00:54:39.317 --> 00:54:41.150
SPEAKER 2: So I was
emailed a question ahead

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.440
of time, which I
promised I would ask,

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.670
perhaps a more technical one.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.260
Can I ask about how bitcoin
is decentralized versus

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.432
distributed?

00:54:48.432 --> 00:54:50.890
My reading of it seems to show
that it may be decentralized

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:53.070
but isn't distributed
in any meaningful way,

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.730
and that that makes it a
less scalable technology.

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:58.841
So how is bitcoin distributed
versus decentralized, and what

00:54:58.841 --> 00:55:00.090
are the implications for that?

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.170
ALEX TAPSCOTT: It's
a great question,

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.336
and it's at the heart of
the governance issue that's

00:55:03.336 --> 00:55:05.750
happening in the bitcoin
world right now, which

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:10.120
is that there's a fight about
how big the block size should

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.620
be.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.870
So that basically, the bigger
the block size, the more

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.950
transactions you can put
in it, the more scalable

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:15.970
the network is.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:19.040
But the bigger the block size,
the bigger the computer systems

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.380
you need to manage
the blockchain, which

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.520
means increasingly power will
concentrate into the hands

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.330
of huge mining pools.

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:32.020
And it is a good question
because I don't view bitcoin

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.850
specifically as
fully distributed

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:36.910
because most of the compute
power that helps to support

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:41.340
this network are in the hands
of a dozen or so big mining

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.530
pools that control a lot of
the validation on the network.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.770
There are all sorts of really
interesting technical solutions

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.660
that are being proposed
and implemented

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.470
that could try and resolve this.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:57.680
There's a company in Silicon
Valley called 21, Inc.,

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.860
which basically
says if everybody's

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:04.500
a node on this network, like
your Android cell phone has

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.750
a chip in it that
also acts as a miner,

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:10.810
then we can help to redistribute
the computing power away

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:11.920
from these mining pools.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.250
Others are saying you can have
a routing network in the bitcoin

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:19.002
network that allows transactions
to only use a few nodes rather

00:56:19.002 --> 00:56:20.210
than having to use every one.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.043
And that could help
with this issue as well.

00:56:22.043 --> 00:56:25.920
But they are questions that
to this day remain unsolved.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.020
And they go into the
implementation challenge

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:29.520
bucket.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.895
SPEAKER 2: Please join me in
a massive round of applause.

00:56:31.895 --> 00:56:32.988
Thank you, Alex Tapscott.

00:56:32.988 --> 00:56:36.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
