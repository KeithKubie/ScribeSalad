00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.062
But in spite of their time

00:00:02.062 --> 00:00:03.610
they lived in and everything.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.453
But given the time they lived in,

00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:07.219
they were even more exceptional,

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.386
and I think that they also had a large

00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:15.077
amount of children to take care of

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:16.736
and to watch over,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.841
and I tried to point out in the book

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:22.816
a little bit about how Mother,

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:24.733
and Dad too, very much,

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:31.702
sort of steered us in the
direction, and made it very clear

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:35.637
that we had a responsibility
being in America

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:38.913
to do something for our country.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.909
That was very very clear.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.639
And that was number one.

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:43.951
And I think it's a thing, you know,

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.843
because my brothers are so famous now,

00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:49.201
and I think they were
certainly driven by that.

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.462
And Dad was a very loving
parent, but he was also strong.

00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:56.321
When he said something,
you got the message.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.022
- (laughs) You did it, right?

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.189
- (laughs) So I think that
they were unusual that way,

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:07.304
and they always kept us interested.

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:10.899
It wasn't a big labor of oh
dear, we have to do that again,

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.791
or something like that,
that's so difficult, you know.

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:16.041
It was always interesting.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.041
The news is interesting.

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:21.996
Most of the time.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:23.904
- Very interesting these days, Ambassador.

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:26.132
- I know. (laughs)

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:28.061
So I think the children, and they did,

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:29.722
we all enjoyed (mimics discussion).

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.511
Because we had different
opinions, and they always listened

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.423
to what Jack thinks we should
not go into the war either,

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:39.590
this is world war, but if he
goes, do we all have to serve?

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.279
Do we all have to serve?

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:45.041
Do girls and everyone
will get in the Army?

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.159
You know, all that sort of--

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.304
but it was all very interesting, you know.

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:50.549
And as the younger, as
the number eight of nine,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.552
it was very interesting to listen

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:55.683
to these different opinions,
depending on the age,

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:58.352
and of course our older
brothers Joe and Jack,

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.625
particularly because they were the oldest,

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.157
were very interesting with
particularly my father.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.671
You know, they could make
terrific conversation about

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.153
why are we holding back, and
why shouldn't we get in there,

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:12.985
you know, and making points.

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.329
And I think, you know, it
sticks with you forever,

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.291
if you get it at an early enough age.

00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:20.383
So it made a huge impression
on me and all of us I think.

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:23.058
And I try and do a little
bit with my children as well.

00:02:23.058 --> 00:02:23.891
- Well I was going to ask you that.

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:24.993
- Steve certainly did.

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:26.946
- Steve, did you feel that, did you feel

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.287
the same atmosphere in
your house growing up,

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:30.020
that the Ambassador just--
