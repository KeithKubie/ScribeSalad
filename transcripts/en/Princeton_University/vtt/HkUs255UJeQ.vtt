00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:12.939
My name is Mary Weatherford,

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.723
I graduated from Princeton University

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:20.011
in 1984 with a degree in visual arts

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.579
and art history.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:26.913
I loved museums from the time I was

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:28.907
a little girl, but my father would pick me

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:31.977
up like this and just hold me in front of

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:33.854
a painting for as long as he thought it

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:35.536
would take to soak in.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.968
I remember very, very clearly in front

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:39.776
of "Crows Over a Wheat Field,"

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.496
so I was sort of helpless, I couldn't turn

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:44.897
anywhere, and he held me there and he

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:46.768
said to me, "This is the most frightening

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:48.322
painting I've seen in my life."

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:51.794
And I had to kind of take that in like

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:55.872
"Why would a painting of birds over

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.081
a wheat field be frightening?"

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.833
I sewed every piece of clothing that

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.216
I wore from the time I was twelve years

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:06.944
old until I graduated from high school.

00:01:06.944 --> 00:01:09.569
I designed it, I thought it up, I sewed it

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.240
so I was just like a walking fashion show

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.640
like every day I had done a lot of work

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.240
in the theater in high school.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.946
So I went to Princeton on a theater

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.265
scholarship. I joined eXpressions dance

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.002
troupe, so I was in eXpressions, and

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.235
on team theater.

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.475
What happened was I thought, well,

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.674
"I don't know what I'm here for, but

00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:34.689
it's time to get serious and to get some

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.935
kind of a serious career, right?"

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:40.320
I was in the architecture department in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.730
the beginning and I thought, "Oh, okay,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.832
this is what I'm going to do."

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.513
Which is sort of some kind of cross

00:01:44.513 --> 00:01:45.762
between thinking and making art.

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.522
I enrolled in Jerry Buchanan's beginning

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:51.361
painting class. He was so great.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.896
Jerry taught me about careful looking.

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:57.506
Then the next painting class I took was

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:58.593
with Heidi Gluck.

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:00.768
Heidi taught me about color.

00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:03.811
You know, when I left Princeton, I knew

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.394
I wanted to be an artist. I moved to

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:06.688
New York and I started working for

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:08.465
galleries and I always lived in a tiny

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.689
apartment. I had my first exhibition

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:15.436
in 1989, a solo project room show at

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:18.897
P.S.1. which is very unusual.

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:20.449
I was twenty-six years old.

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.106
I sold everything in that show, and then

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:26.738
took the money and rented a studio and

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.834
then worked for another year and then had

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:32.930
my first gallery show and sold everything

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.251
in a week. I was very popular for about

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:42.498
two years. When I paint, I paint by myself

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:44.849
and no one can be here. So I come down

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.650
here and I make some coffee and I sweep

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.131
the floor and I procrastinate and I read

00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:52.322
the paper and I start mixing colors.

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:55.569
Right now I have pieces of neon in the

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.049
work. On the days that we're doing neon,

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.865
I have a full house. I have like three

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:03.826
guys here and Maurice here and it's really

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.995
fun. We have music and lunch.

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.210
It's a great time.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.940
I wanted to make urban paintings.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.793
I wanted to make paintings about people's

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:18.561
lives. And then, when I stumbled upon

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:21.793
using the light, then that became clear

00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:25.473
to me. It was a way of making paintings

00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:30.935
about some kind of representation of

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:37.553
the complex symphony of human experience.

00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:41.975
This is my presentation for Frieze London

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.851
2015, which is an art fair. I will be

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:48.113
showing ten paintings. They're very much

00:03:48.113 --> 00:03:52.134
about outside experience. This one I made

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.406
on the Fourth of July. There were a lot of

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.962
neighborhood fireworks going off. I went

00:03:56.962 --> 00:04:00.018
down to San Diego, I was on a steep beach

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:04.038
and the wave would come in and then hit

00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:07.940
the beach and then make another wave

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.151
coming back while this first, and then

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.961
another wave would come and then the

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:13.846
waves would come and hit each other like

00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:15.913
this. Like you could you see through the

00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:18.098
wave bodies falling through the wave.

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:21.634
It was an incredible experience. My work

00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.874
has over the years looked very

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:26.484
different, one piece from the other. And I

00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:29.282
always thought that this will make sense

00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:31.492
when you look back over twenty years.

00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:33.812
It makes sense looking back on it now.
