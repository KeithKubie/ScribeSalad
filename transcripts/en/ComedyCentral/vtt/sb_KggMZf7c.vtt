And I'm telling you right now,
if I don't trust a used condom

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:10.075
with a regular human woman,

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:13.379
you'll be goddamned if I just
give it to a homeless lady,

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.548
and just like, "Hey, don't do
anything weird with this."

Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome this next comic,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.115
the host of the "Punch Drunk"
sports podcast,

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.418
give it up for Mr. Ari Shaffir,
everybody.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.585
Let him hear it!

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.722
[cheers and applause]

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.593
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:02.995
[laughs]
Thank you very much.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.131
All right, this story is
what my friend said

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.500
was the gayest thing
that's ever happened to him.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.302
[chuckles]
I, uh...

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.972
I don't really like
that kinda talk, but whatever.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.641
So it starts--I was having
sex with a girl--

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:19.445
excuse me, a woman--
and, uh...

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.114
That's one of those things
where feminists are right,

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:25.951
like, yes, absolutely,
I was a grown person.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.987
And I used a condom for once...

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.489
[laughs]

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.424
I don't know how you guys
feel when you use a condom.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.427
I feel like a champion for,
like, the rest of the month.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.297
I'm always like, "Not part of
the problem today...

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.300
this one time!"

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.034
And if you wear a condom,
that means you don't have to

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.370
wear a condom
the next nine times.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.505
'Cause it cancels out.
That's just how it works.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:47.973
That's just science, you guys.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:50.343
If you disagree,
you don't know science.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.978
It's like when you have
a salad for lunch,

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.180
you can have a whole
pizza for dinner.

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.717
So anyway,

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.885
what do you guys do when you're
done having sex with a condom?

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.488
What do you do
as soon as you're finished?

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:03.656 align:start position:0%
- Pull it off.
I don't know.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.291
- What? Pull her off?

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.159
That's great, man, yeah,
that's a number one thing.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.694
You're absolutely right.
You'll be like,

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:10.063
"I'm finished now.
You should leave.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.199
"Leave my dick.
It's, like, done.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.536
I feel it shrinking
inside of you."

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.404
[laughter]

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.374
Like, "You wanna pull out?"
"It'll come out on its own."

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.913
That's how you know
winter is over.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.716
It just gets smaller
and smaller.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.521
[laughs]

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.024
Fucking great answer, man.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.694
Yeah, you pull her off you.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.895
And then you take
the condom off,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.330
and you gotta throw
the condom off--

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.497
you gotta throw it away.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:46.833
Yeah, first of all,
you gotta pull it off,

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.234
'cause at some point

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.902
you lay there for
a minute or two, you know,

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.570
before you pull it off.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.275
You don't be like fucking--
Uhh--then fucking take the--

00:02:55.275 --> 00:03:00.012
You know, it's like, grenade!
Get it outta here!

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.681
But she's lying on your shoulder
and you realize,

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.250
you're like--once your dick
is completely limp,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.118
it's like this isn't
sexual anymore.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:11.424
And you realize, like, you've
just been basting in jizz.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:15.128
Your dick is like a Haagen-Dazs
dip cone of semen.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.433
Yeah. It's got, like, reverse
Benjamin Button or something.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.934
It's gonna prune up

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.103
like you're in the shower
too long, you know?

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.938
I don't want my dick looking
like it's got progeria,

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.374
so you gotta take it off.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.610
And a lot of people get up
and throw the condom out,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.445
uh, which, that's cool
if you got the energy.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:36.582
I fuck hard--I don't have
that kind of energy.

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.718
So, uh...

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.753
yeah, I go for it
if you're gonna go for it.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.288
So I'll take the condom off

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.889
and I'll just throw it
by the side of the bed.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.824
I don't know if you guys
ever do that move?

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:47.993
It's a classic.
You've never done that?

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.461
Oh, 'cause you're black.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:51.430
Black people don't use condoms,
that's why.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.499
You're like, "What? I don't even
understand this whole story.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.468
"What are you talking about?
You have to explain to me

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.304
"why would you invest
in real estate

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.974
when you're talking
to this girl?"

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.311
Yeah, so you dump it
by the side of the bed.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.347
You get it the next morning.
That's what I was gonna do.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.315
I'll tie it off--you don't,
like, just drop it,

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.416
'cause then
it'll all leak out.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.952
So you gotta like,
tie it off.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.186
Especially if you got dogs.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.122
If you got dogs,
you gotta tie that off.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.657
They'll go for it.
Dogs will go for it.

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.325
They don't know.
They don't know about sexuality.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.795
They just know protein.
They just know protein.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.096
Yeah, a dog will, like,
go for it.

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.665
You can yell at 'em.
Be like, "Stop!"

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.333
And the dog'll be like,
"I think you're wrong here.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.769
"'Cause...why...
why would I not eat--

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.836
"Why did you cover it
in protein

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:33.038
if you don't want me to eat it?"

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:35.041
So, yeah,
for sure tie it off.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.344
And the morning came
and I got up to throw it away.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.179
I don't--I was gonna flush.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.948
I don't like to throw away
condoms at women's places

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:47.487
'cause, like...
part of me worries, like...

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:51.790
This might be crazy
but, like...

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.293
Yeah, well, hold on.
It's not completely crazy

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:56.696
if you all kind of know
what I'm about to say, right?

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.364
[laughter]

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.133
- Yeah, it's not completely
off the wall nuts

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:03.002
that she's gonna, yeah,
undo the condom

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:07.005
and then put it up there
and fuckin' scoosh it in

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:10.510
and have a baby the old
fashioned way through trapping.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.981
Yeah, so I was like, all right,
I'll flush it in the toilet.

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.649
But then I got to her toilet
to flush it,

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:21.487
and the toilet didn't look like
it could for sure handle it.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.689
I was like, I don't wanna
be here for two hours, you know,

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.391
so I was like, "Fuck it,
I'll just go outside.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.193
I'll throw it out outside
in the Dumpster."

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:29.728
So, yeah--so I'm going
down her steps

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:32.531
to her apartment building
holding this used condom.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.600
This used no love condom
hoping not to

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.069
pass of her neighbors.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.070
Like, "Good morning,
Mrs. Johnson, enjoy church.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.107
Uh...sorry about this."

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.275
And then I got outside.
I was about to throw it out,

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:47.613
and then, uh...there was
a homeless lady in the Dumpster.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.249
Yeah, a homeless woman
just rootin' around in there.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.684
I guess that's for sure
not a lady,

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.285
but, uh...

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:55.588
Yeah, just a homeless woman
lookin' for--

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.089
I don't know, her meal
or whatever.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.925
I don't know
what they do in there.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.927
And I'm telling you right now,
if I don't trust a used condom

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:04.596
with a regular human woman,

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:08.734
you'll be goddamned if I just
give it to a homeless lady,

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:12.205
and just like, "Hey, don't do
anything weird with this."

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.375
I mean, that is a cash win
for a homeless person.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.277
That is child support
for the rest of her life.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.447
That is a lot of--she'd be
crazy not to try it, really.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.715
She'd be crazy to not
be like, oh...[mumbles]

00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:26.386
The seed of a man with a job?

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:32.425
She'd be like--
you ever hear that story

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.494
about, like, God sending
a--like the guy drowning...

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:37.897
'cause--anybody religious here?
- Yes.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.131
- You know
what I'm talking about?

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:40.399
- Amen.
- Amen!

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.634
Hell yeah, lady.
Hell yeah.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.402
We have "ah, men,"
but that's okay.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.137
I know what you're saying.

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:47.306
Yeah, where the man was drowning
and he prayed to God

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:48.807
to save him--
in like the ocean,

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:50.843
and then a rowboat came by--
you know this one?

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:53.145
And then, uh, he's like--
the rowboat guy's like,

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.413
"Hey, get in."
He goes, "No, no, no.

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.081
God's gonna save me.
Beat it."

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.516
And the rowboat guy's like,
"All right."

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:59.618
And then later, like,
a bigger boat came by

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.186
and he's like, "Get in."
He's like, "No.

00:07:01.186 --> 00:07:03.021
Fucking God's gonna save me.
Get outta here."

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.590
Probably didn't curse
as much as I am,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.460
but then a giant ship came by
and they're like,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.860
"Get in, you're gonna drown."
He goes, "No,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.429
God is gonna save me."
And then he left

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.432
and then the guy
just fucking drowned.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.533
He just sunk and drowned.
Then he got to heaven

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:16.168
and he's like,
"God, why didn't you save me?"

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:17.636
And God's like,
"What are you talking about?

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:20.105
"I sent a rowboat,
and a medium-sized ship,

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:21.774
and a big ship for you."

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:25.144
So that's this homeless lady.
She got to heaven.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.015
She'd be like,
"How come you never gave me

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.116
a hand up?"
And God's like,

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:34.052
"I gave you a fuckin' vile...

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:37.657
"of semen of a man
with a home.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.525
"What else do you need me
to do?

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.727
"Put some of it in now,
and save the other half

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.862
for when you're ovulating."

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:46.132
So I was like, well, I can't
throw it out in this Dumpster.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.699
And I was like,
"Well, what am I supposed to do

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.034
with this condom?"

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:50.536
So I was like,
"Fuck it, I'll just--

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.805
"I'll just take it home
and I'll throw it out...

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:55.307
when I get home."

00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:57.009
Yeah, it was frustrating
not to be able to

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.812
deal with this
stupid condom.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.380
So I get in my car.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.817
I put it in the little--
the side trashcan of the car.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:07.553
You know?
You don't know?

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.256
That's what it's for.
It's for like owner's manuals

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.724
or maps,
but nobody uses that.

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.727
It's for when you're done
with a CHEETOS bag.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.729
You're like, "What am I--
I'll just fuckin'..."

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.999
So I put it in there
and I start driving home.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.500
And I pass--
on the way home I pass

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.735
my friend at the bus stop,
Jayson Thibault.

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:26.672
Yeah, he's my co-host
in that "Punch Drunk" podcast.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.108
And I pulled over.
I was like "What are you doing?"

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.709
He said, "Well,
I'm going to work."

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:32.411
And I was like,
"Well, fuck it, man, get it.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.513
I'll give you a ride."
He's like, "Really?"

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.048
I'm like, "Yeah.
I'm in a great mood.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:38.784
Absolutely.
Yeah, I don't mind."

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.719
So we start driving--
he gets in we start driving

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.688
and he goes--he goes,
"Where you coming from?

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.590
Why are you
in such a good mood?"

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.626
And--
Okay, now, right here...

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:50.429
I probably could have
just told him.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:53.766
But I thought, like,
show him, you know?

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:02.908
It's a way richer way
of telling a story.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.910
Like in grade school,
they didn't have "Tell."

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.046
They had "Show and Tell."

00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:12.150
So he was like,
"Where are you coming from?"

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.955
so I just reached in
to the little trash can,

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.456
and I got the knot
in the condom

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.258
like right between
my thumb and my forefinger.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.561
I just kinda felt for it,
and then I grabbed it,

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.664
and then--and then I hit him
in the face with it.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.800
Yeah, I came around that way.
I didn't want to go this way,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.635
'cause it might hit me,
you know? Eew!

00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:32.504
And I went around--
and it was going fast.

00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:34.907
The thing stretched
when it was coming around.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:37.910
Like, it got wider,
and then it hit him like...

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.812
coming forward.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.849
It made like a--
like a that kinda sound.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.185
Like a big slap.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.655
I remember his seatbelt locked.
I remember that.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:53.759
Yeah, as it hit him
it was like...

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:56.529
And then the thing
was just dangling there...

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.165
And he, uh,
he was not happy about it.

00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:01.367
No, he was pretty upset.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.368
I've definitely
seen him happier.

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.471
Yeah, he was mad.
He starts yelling.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:08.007
He goes,
"Did you just hit me...

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.676
with a full condom?"

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.849
- And I was like, "I mean,
I don't know about full.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:22.021
"Just the little bottom part
is full.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.323
"If that's a full condom,
you have a very positive way

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.225
of looking at the world."

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.565
He was mad.
He goes,

00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:36.335
"That's the gayest thing
that's ever happened to me."

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.337
And I go,
"Don't say that."

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:39.738
Not 'cause of homophobia
or anything.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:41.840
He was using it
in the right context--

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.375
it was to mean homosexual.

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.744
And I'm like, "It wasn't gay.
It wasn't homosexual.

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:48.480
If you ask me--
If you ask me I didn't hit him

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.484
with the inside of the condom.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.884
If I turned it inside out,
sure.

00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.753
That's the part
that had my dick in it

00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:57.556
and where all the jizz
and stuff was.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:00.893
I hit him
with the outside of the condom.

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:04.997
That came straight from
touching a vagina.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.665
It got all up in the vagina

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.200
and then hit him
across the face.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.734
If anything...

00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:11.736
it's the most heterosexual thing

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:14.206
that's every happened to him.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.607
Yeah, it's been 12 years,

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:18.777
and he still does not
see it my way.

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:21.080
All right, I'm done.
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.581
That's my story.
