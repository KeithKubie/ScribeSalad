00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.930
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm Jennifer Van
Fossen, and today we

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.930
are so lucky to have a group
of actors and actresses

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.340
with us from "Tully."

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.350
Please join me on stage.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.310
We have Charlize
Theron, Mackenzie Davis,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.820
Ron Livingston, and
director Jason Reitman.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.160
We are so glad to have you
all here with us today.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.260
CHARLIZE THERON: Are you?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.300
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.520
We really are.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.670
Well, I saw the film last
week with my husband,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.910
and gosh, there were so many
things that I could relate to,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.980
being a parent, being a mom.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.430
And the one thing that
struck me in particular

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.920
is there's this one
scene, Charlize,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.430
where your character, Marlo,
is pulling into the parking lot

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.310
and trying to act like
everything is great and OK,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.140
and she's struggling
with her kids.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.230
And she walks, and I think it's
to the principal, and says,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.209
oh, it's just such a blessing.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.260
CHARLIZE THERON: Yeah.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.510
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: And
this really is for all of you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.790
but I'd love to
start off just by--

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.325
tell us about the importance
of that authenticity

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.200
in the characters that
you have in this film.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:19.960
CHARLIZE THERON:
I mean, I guess--

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.622
I don't want to speak for
all of us, but I will.

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:23.566
[LAUGHING]

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.910
RON LIVINGSTONE: If I must.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.993
CHARLIZE THERON: I think--

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.390
I mean, we definitely
all discussed just

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.020
how raw and honest this was,
this portrayal of parenthood.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.750
That is definitely not
something that I've ever

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.250
read in a script.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.650
And in my over 20
years of doing this,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.810
I've might've partaken in that
false portray of motherhood

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.160
on film.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.490
I think there was something
about this that was just so--

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.100
and maybe it's also different
now that I have kids.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.400
I can't imagine making
this film before I had kids

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.110
because there was
so much of this

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.500
that I could just feel
inside my own bones.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.880
And through all the
horror of the truth

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.430
of what it takes to
be a parent, there's

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.210
this utter beauty
that comes with it.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.310
And I think that's what
definitely drew me to it.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.740
I mean, Jason was a
really negative part

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.422
of deciding to do this
film, but the story really--

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:29.380
JASON REITMAN: Yeah,
it's one you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.190
CHARLIZE THERON:
Yeah, it was-- yeah,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.660
it was like the
story's good enough

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.019
that I can deal
with Jason again.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.310
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Yeah, so--

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.460
JASON REITMAN: You're so brave.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.630
CHARLIZE THERON: Yeah, I--

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.604
nobody knows how brave I am.

00:02:42.604 --> 00:02:44.270
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Well, to that point

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.950
of dealing with
Jason again, this

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.010
is your third film
in what some have

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.530
said is even sort
of a trilogy, Jason,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.280
with "Juno" and "Young Adult,"
which you did with Charlize.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.320
JASON REITMAN: It's like
"Lord of the Rings."

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.150
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Just like that.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.590
JASON REITMAN: Yeah.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.290
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Yeah, so what's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.600
important to you about
these three films

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.160
and the sequence
of them together?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
JASON REITMAN: I mean, when
I met Diablo over a decade

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.370
ago now, I don't think I
could have ever guessed

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.700
that we were starting this
trajectory with each other,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.700
that somehow we were going to
be in a kind of storytelling

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.450
marriage.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.599
And now, of course, I
just hope it continues

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.390
for the rest of our
lives, and that we keep

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.335
on making movies like this.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:25.835
I think--

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:27.590
RON LIVINGSTONE: Do you
remember your anniversary?

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.923
Because that's a big part of it.

00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:31.100
JASON REITMAN: Oh, fuck.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.880
I blew it already.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.254
I remember the
first time we met.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.930
We met at this place called
the Father's Daughter

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.930
over on Fairfax near the Grove,
and they have a bar in there.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.760
And she ordered a dirty Martini.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.290
I ordered a Diet
Coke, and it was

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.100
just very on par for our
relationship going forward.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.080
But "Juno" was a movie
about growing up too fast,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.430
and "Young Adult" was a
movie about growing up

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.360
a little too slow.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.970
And this is a movie about
that moment when you realize

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.160
that you have to grow up.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.140
And you have to turn
a chapter on your life

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.920
and create room so that your
child can occupy the space

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.917
that you were occupying.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.000
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: And
tell us a little bit more

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.339
about what attracts you to
this and to Diablo's writing.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.694
JASON REITMAN: You know,
it's funny, Charlize, Diablo,

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.110
and I are all
around the same age.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.327
And although we came
from different places,

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:25.910
there's some sort
of connective tissue

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.280
that, when Diablo
writes a script,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.950
she's articulating things
that we've all been feeling.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.840
And there's something that
Diablo does really well,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.440
where she writes about an idea
that we can all relate to,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.420
which is not knowing
where you're supposed

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.330
to be in the arc of your life.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.990
I think we all often have this
feeling like, am I behind?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.590
Am I ahead?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.006
Am I doing this
at the right time?

00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:52.030
What was I supposed to
do by now at this age?

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.516
Whether it's work, with family,
have you bought a house yet?

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.640
Have you done this or that?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.190
And so much of her
writing is about that,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.120
and for whatever reason, I
think it connects all of us.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.440
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Yeah, so to that point,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.590
I'd love to speak to the
dynamic between the two

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.740
characters of Marlo and of
Tully, Mackenzie, which you

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.000
play, and the dynamics that you
explore in those relationships

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.360
between women.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.870
There's episodes of judgment or
younger self versus older self

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.750
kind of feelings.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.740
So tell me about the dynamic
between these two women.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.770
MACKENZIE DAVIS: I mean,
it was an interesting role

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.100
to play because of the space
that it occupied in somebody

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.470
else's life and
trying to find out

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.830
how you can be your own shoulder
to cry on and support system

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.100
without becoming like a
really malevolent force

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.579
in that person's life.

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:53.120
I don't know.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.146
I thought it was--

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.520
I mean, I think we'll just
reiterate the same things over

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.860
and over, but just a really
honest approach to how lovely

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.230
and shitty it can
be to be female.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.270
And I haven't had
kids, but I have

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.530
been a woman my whole life.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.760
And there were so
many things that it

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.460
felt like Diablo was telling
secrets from my own life,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.970
and you were like
how do you know that?

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.920
And yeah, I just thought it was
a lovely female friendship that

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.750
was really honest
and not sugary sweet.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.621
But-- do you want
to say anything?

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:34.620
CHARLIZE THERON: I mean,
having been the younger

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.661
one in the relationship--

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.180
[LAUGHING]

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.200
No, you said it so beautifully.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.600
I totally agree with you.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.150
I mean, I think Diablo doesn't
know how to not write honestly,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.320
and I think she loves
that space where we all

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.030
live, whether you're
a woman or a man,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.100
that's maybe not so pretty.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.920
And I know for myself,
I'm very much--

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.840
I'm fascinated by that space.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.520
And so to have a writer
and a filmmaker who

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.340
really wants to go and explore
that space, it's really--

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.020
it's heaven to get a job like
that where all of us get--

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.800
we get to live in the
skin of real people who

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.250
are going through maybe not
so nice things and maybe

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.980
are not behaving in
the best possible ways

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.940
that they could
in those moments.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.130
But it's human, and it's
exploring that human condition,

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.977
and I love that.

00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:34.060
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: One--

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.190
another moment, I
remember from the film

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.400
is there's an episode
in a coffee shop

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.030
where you are clearly
very, very pregnant,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.541
and you're ordering a decaf.

00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.040
And yet--

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.300
CHARLIZE THERON: How dare I?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.800
How dare I?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.258
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
And yet you're

00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:50.860
facing all this judgment from
this woman who's giving you

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.580
dirty looks, and can you talk
about that judgmental part

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.090
that you explore there, that
women do face pretty constantly

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.660
in society?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.743
CHARLIZE THERON: Oh, yeah.

00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:04.840
Yeah, I mean, I think that
we definitely live in a world

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.200
where we're just so hard,
especially on parents,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.750
because all of a
sudden, they're carrying

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.107
this other little human.

00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:13.690
And I feel like the
world almost feels

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.120
like they can step in and have
a judgment because it's not

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.750
really you.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.910
It's that little person
that they don't even

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.860
know that's living
inside of you.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.300
And I definitely
have been with--

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.130
I didn't have
pregnancies myself,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.340
but just with my adopted kids.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.230
I remember a mom
pulling me aside,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:34.090
and she was like you should
not be using formula,

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.799
and I can hook you up with
some real breast milk.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:43.690
And it was just like,
[SIGH],, and my kids

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.270
are fine as of right now.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.440
They're still good.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.540
They're doing OK on the formula.

00:08:52.647 --> 00:08:54.230
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
So I'd love to go

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.800
a little bit deeper on that
because the last movie that I

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.410
saw you in was "Atomic
Blonde," very different

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.860
type of a female character.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.276
CHARLIZE THERON:
Little bit, yeah.

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.170
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Yeah, it
was a real super, kick-ass spy

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.970
movie.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.670
And you have a production
company, Denver and Delilah,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.770
that was written up
in "Variety" not long

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.710
ago for really backing those
powerful female-centric

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.610
stories.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.300
So can you talk a little bit
about how you pick your roles

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.170
and how your company
decides on its projects?

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.420
CHARLIZE THERON: Yeah, we have
a cool little thing going on

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.950
with Denver and Delilah.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.650
We're definitely fortunate
enough to be in a place

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.590
where we do have
a little bit more

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.470
of a luxury, where we
can greenlight things

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.070
that might not get greenlit.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.210
A film like "Atomic
Blonde" very easily

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.840
could have been a
male-driven film.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.845
And to be able to have
a little bit of that,

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.720
to be in that position
where you can actually

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.890
take a film like that and
get a studio like Universal

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.740
to back it, that's a
really nice place to be in,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.980
and I don't ever take
that for granted.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.740
We're also trying to--

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.960
we do a lot of
television and film,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.120
and so we're really trying to
not just, with female stories,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.490
but really paying
attention to bringing women

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.899
into the positions that they're
just very strong in right now.

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:27.440
And so we have a
lot of projects that

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.140
are maybe not
directed by females,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.710
but they're all
female producers.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.130
And so I think being in
that position where you

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.770
can put your foot down, and--

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.110
I was just on a film that we
produced, and I walked on,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.900
and our sound department
didn't have one woman on it.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.120
And we had a bunch of
female actresses on it,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.150
and I was like, guys, what-- no.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.845
We need a lady here to be
dealing with the bra straps.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.310
It's just a nice place to be
in, and for me as an actor,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.980
it's not necessarily always
so that I can star in it.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.210
It's nice that I can
take ownership and guide

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.450
a little bit of the stuff
that I do want to explore,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.180
that you do get tired of
kind of waiting around

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.577
for a filmmaker or a writer
to come around and hand you

00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:15.410
something like that.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.780
So you can kind of step
in and develop things

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.570
that you're interested
in, and I love that.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.620
And I like that it can-- that
I can be as diverse as I want

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.060
to be, and that, I think, is
one of the hardest things--

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.890
or was for me in my career.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.220
You have garnered some
success in some genre,

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.860
and then that's all
everybody wants you to do.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.950
And having a production company
gets me to do different things

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.580
and not regurgitate the same
thing over and over and over.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.380
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Yeah, that's--

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.680
that seeking of diversity
in creativity and thought

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.390
and female centric is something
we really value at Google,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.690
and I do on my team as well.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.930
So thank you.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.259
CHARLIZE THERON: Oh, cool.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.300
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Ron?

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.760
RON LIVINGSTONE: Yes?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.343
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
You're from Iowa.

00:12:00.343 --> 00:12:01.430
RON LIVINGSTONE: I am.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.410
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: And this
is personally important to me

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.951
because my husband's
in the audience,

00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:06.320
and he's from Iowa as well.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.898
So shout out to the Hawkeyes.

00:12:08.898 --> 00:12:10.564
RON LIVINGSTONE:
[INAUDIBLE],, go Hawks.

00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:12.730
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
You have two daughters.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.646
RON LIVINGSTONE: I do.

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.580
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: So tell
us from a male perspective--

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.620
so what's important to
you about this title?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.160
And, Jason, I know you have a
daughter as well, I believe?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.680
Yeah?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.590
So I'd love to hear from you all
about what's important to you

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.990
about the female empowerment
from your perspective, too?

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.760
And Drew is Marlo's
husband in the title.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.640
RON LIVINGSTONE:
Yeah, obviously,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.620
because I'm raising two girls
to enter into the world,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.150
I'd like the world to be
a welcoming and nice place

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.540
for them to be.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.060
And I want them to
be valued, and I

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.180
want them to be empowered, and
I want them to feel strong.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.680
They're pretty strong right now,
so I feel really good about it.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.860
Yeah, and then the rest of
the stuff, I guess we'll--

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.650
I guess we'll get to.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.400
What I like about this--

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.960
the way that this set up
is-- and you talked about

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.410
the authenticity--

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:18.080
is I feel like there's a
husband mold of what husbands

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.550
do in the child-rearing area.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.460
And in real life, the
bar is a lot lower

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.810
than what you see in the movies.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.210
In the movies, it's
like we give them

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.670
a lot of the benefit of
the doubt and credit.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.480
And so this
character is really--

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.050
he's contributing closer
to what husbands generally

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.563
actually contribute and think
they're doing a great job.

00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:51.650
So I don't know how that relates
to the female empowerment

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:59.380
element overall, but
it's a wife part.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm playing a wife part,
is what they would call it.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.470
And it's kind of great
that it's flipped around

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.370
because I know my wife has
played a lot of wife parts

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.810
and made some wonderful
things out of them.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.480
So that was a really
good challenge,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.860
of I've got to take this
guy who's in a supportive

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.445
functioning role and figure out,
well, how can we make it real.

00:14:24.445 --> 00:14:26.820
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Anything
you would add there, Jason?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.403
JASON REITMAN: I
mean, the funny thing

00:14:28.403 --> 00:14:31.350
is that I'd really like to
make a movie for my daughter.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.440
But I've made eight
movies so far,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.390
and she hasn't seen any of
them because they're all rated

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.760
R or about teen pregnancy.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.050
So I have a lot of
conversations waiting for me.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.670
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Got it.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.080
Well, another thing I'd like
to touch on with you all is

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.580
you've--

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.746
and you've mentioned a
little bit of this, Charlize.

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:56.670
You've both done small
screen and big screen work,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.190
and in my role here
at Google, I work

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.680
quite a bit with
the film studios

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.860
and also the broadcasters.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.890
So I think it's
interesting what's

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.040
going on between small
and big screen these days,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.260
and also, I think
it's really important

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.570
that these kind of stories make
it to the big screen still,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.800
and it's not just a world
of sequels and blockbusters.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.094
So I thought maybe
you all could talk--

00:15:19.094 --> 00:15:20.760
JASON REITMAN: Though
this is a trilogy.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.830
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Yes, that's true--

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.650
well, that's true.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.860
That's true, but with
unique characters, yeah.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.952
So I'd love to just talk
about how do we encourage

00:15:28.952 --> 00:15:30.660
and make sure that
these types of stories

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.229
are told on the
big screen as well.

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:35.770
RON LIVINGSTONE: I
mean, the best way

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.120
to do it is to make them.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.990
I mean, that's, I
think, the first step.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.320
And that's-- thank
God you're doing that.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.510
I don't really feel that there's
that much of a difference.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.301
The camera's the same
size in any case,

00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.300
but whether it's a big
screen or a small screen,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.480
that stuff all comes later.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.570
I feel like when--

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.530
you're probably maybe
thinking about that,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.620
but when I show
up to work, it's--

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.350
I'm not thinking
about the screen.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.480
And I think people have
a great relationship--

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.220
I feel like the
difference-- and people

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.570
have some pretty big screens
in their houses now, too.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.460
JENNIFER VAN
FOSSEN: That's true.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.540
RON LIVINGSTONE: And there's
going to be a lot of people who

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.805
watch this on-- they'll
download it or--

00:16:18.805 --> 00:16:19.930
JASON REITMAN: Their phone.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.305
RON LIVINGSTONE: Yeah, or
they'll pirate it or something.

00:16:22.305 --> 00:16:23.850
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.340
So yeah-- to me,
I think it's more

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.040
of a thing of when
the big screen still

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.369
has that place for
this is an event.

00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:33.910
We're going to give
this our evening.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.410
We're going to get
out of our house.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.900
We're going to go sit down,
buy expensive popcorn,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.150
and we're locked into this.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.110
We can't flip the channel
if we don't like it.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.790
We can walk out, but that's
a very dramatic thing.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.660
So it's-- yeah, it's nice
that we're giving adult fare,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.886
I think, I guess,
if you're an adult.

00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:55.510
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: So it's not
so much about the screen then.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.070
It's about the
projects getting made

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.559
and the stories being
told regardless.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:03.100
JASON REITMAN: I hope we hold
onto the collective experience.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.970
That's the important thing.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.553
I think there's a
lot of conversations

00:17:05.553 --> 00:17:08.861
about screens and sound, and
that's all well and good.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.319
It's nice, although I find I
go to the movies all the time,

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:15.050
and I think, man, why
won't they turn this up?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.050
I wish they would play
movies louder in theaters

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.480
and change the bulbs in
the projectors more often,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.920
but I'm also a nerd.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.560
But what I think is important
is the collective experience,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.376
is you go to the movies, you're
with a bunch of strangers,

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:34.000
and you're all laughing together
or you're all crying together.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.333
You're all being moved together.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.270
You're all realizing
something together,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.060
and that is a very
rare experience.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.050
I think it's an
important experience.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.770
I mean, it certainly has
been throughout my childhood.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.170
I love movies.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.628
I try going to the movies as
many times a week as possible.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.190
And by the way, I love
television, and I watch a lot,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.570
and I binge a lot as well.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.512
I think it's a great
form of entertainment.

00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:57.970
What I'd hate to lose, though,
is the collective experience

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.990
that doesn't only happen for
movies like "Black Panther,"

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.360
but also happens for tiny movies
that can really change minds

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.760
and move us because there's
something different about

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.280
watching a movie at home alone
and having that experience--

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.590
which is moving,
but it's alone--

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.596
and having it as a community
with people you don't know.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:18.970
You all showed up
at this theater

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.674
from maybe all
parts of the city.

00:18:20.674 --> 00:18:22.090
You all come from
different lives,

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.400
and now, you're all
laughing together.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.870
And I think the thing that I
fear losing the most is that.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.620
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
That's a great point.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.661
So if the audience
wants to get ready,

00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:34.535
I think we're going to
do a little bit of Q&amp;A

00:18:34.535 --> 00:18:37.040
if you guys want to
get ready for that.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.980
And I'm curious,
Jason, is there a movie

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.030
that was like that for you?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.252
Can you think back?

00:18:44.252 --> 00:18:46.335
JASON REITMAN: I mean, a
movie theater experience?

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:47.120
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Yeah, that collective--

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.828
JASON REITMAN: I mean,
there's a hundred,

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:52.610
but I remember lining up
to see "Pulp Fiction,"

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.740
and I was in high school.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.134
And that was one of the
great nights of my life.

00:18:58.134 --> 00:18:59.800
I mean, I think about
that night the way

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.430
that people think about
lining up for some show

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.260
at CBGB's in the
'70s or something.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.700
That was a life changer.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.310
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: Yeah.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.100
How about the rest of you?

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.100
Can you think of a title
that was really moving?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.430
CHARLIZE THERON: I just--

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:19.201
I was sharing this with Jason,
and I think my friend is here

00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.450
who's a producer on this, too.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.750
Beth Kono and I went to
go see "Shape of Water,"

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:29.812
and we're both kind of
dead inside as people.

00:19:29.812 --> 00:19:31.940
We don't have a lot of emotion.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.532
And I started crying
so uncontrollably.

00:19:36.532 --> 00:19:38.990
I was literally, like, oh, my
god, this is so embarrassing,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.060
and then I just looked
over, and she was crying,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.625
and I was like, thank you.

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:44.510
Thank you.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.680
I'm not a weirdo.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.110
But it's like Jason said.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.800
I could have never
experienced that at home,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.820
and it's nice to have that
conversation after, too.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.490
The credits start rolling,
and you start talking about it

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.130
collectively, and there's
something nice about that.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.490
And I do think sometimes people
have experiences-- they watch

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.044
films at home, and they don't
have the same experience

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.460
that you do when you're in
that theater with other people.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.286
Something happens.

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:15.660
Maybe it's the
expensive popcorn.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.440
I don't know, but something
definitely happens.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.910
For me, it did.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.460
I'm not dead, turns out.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.320
JASON REITMAN: OK.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.080
[LAUGHING]

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.850
RON LIVINGSTONE: I saw "Star
Wars" as a fifth grader,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.040
and it kind of rocked my world,
not only just the spectacle

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.065
and the way it just
kind of exploded.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.460
There wasn't anything
like that before, and then

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.850
all of a sudden, there was.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.300
But I feel like just the--

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.810
all the mythical stuff,
it's like a primer

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.130
in eastern philoso--

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.580
Taoism basically, and zen.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.820
And that has lasting effects.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.920
I think it's cheesy to say
I think it changed my life,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.962
but yeah, it had to have.

00:21:04.962 --> 00:21:06.920
CHARLIZE THERON: "Star
Wars" changed your life.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.620
RON LIVINGSTONE: "Star
Wars" changed my life.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.746
CHARLIZE THERON: I get it.

00:21:10.746 --> 00:21:11.870
MACKENZIE DAVIS: My local--

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.460
this is not like that at all.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.400
My local movie theater is
this really old dingy place,

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.610
and I think it's where they
shoot those night vision

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.800
examples, where they do
screeners of scary movies,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.966
and people are throwing
their popcorn up

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:25.620
because they're so scared.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.310
And I saw "It" there, the
one that just came out,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.480
and I had to wait in line
that wrapped around the block.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.370
And it was a 30-minute wait,
and then it was just 11-

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.140
to 17-year-olds.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.870
And we all watched "It"
together, and it was so--

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.982
it felt religious,
where everybody screamed

00:21:43.982 --> 00:21:46.190
at the same time, and then
you'd turn to the stranger

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.220
and be like, [LAUGHING].

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.760
It was so fun to be
in that space again,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.060
and it just reminds
you, you don't--

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.580
because all you get at
home is sort of like, mm,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.870
but not the full cathartic
scream and communal energy

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.370
thing.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.745
JASON REITMAN: There's something
about a scary movie when

00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:08.690
the person next to you is
scared, the energy transfers.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.815
MACKENZIE DAVIS: And you do--
the scream-to-laugh ratio is

00:22:11.815 --> 00:22:14.810
on par, and it's so fun and
weird because you're like

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.908
[LAUGHING].

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.889
CHARLIZE THERON: So
shall we open it up now?

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:22.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.420
I was able to watch
the film earlier today,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.940
and while I'd like to think that
the magic of Diablo's script

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.750
was part of this,
I'm really curious

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.570
for Mackenzie and Charlize.

00:22:34.981 --> 00:22:36.730
It has an-- I don't
want to spoiler alert,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.300
but it has such an
unusual twist at the end.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.520
I was not expecting
it, and I just

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.280
thought you two
were so separate,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.510
but then so connected.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.220
How did you develop that?

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.340
Because that magic just
wasn't in the script.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.440
CHARLIZE THERON: We
slept with each other.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.570
MACKENZIE DAVIS: And it
was awkward at first,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.975
but then it just broke down
this barrier right away.

00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:00.100
CHARLIZE THERON: It helped.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.480
MACKENZIE DAVIS: Yeah.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.780
To know someone's
body like that is--

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.490
CHARLIZE THERON:
Especially that body.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.040
There's a lot to explore there.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.940
I've been very lucky.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:23.105
Jason is really, really
good at casting, obviously.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.070
No, but seriously, he's
just so good at casting.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.750
I remember when we did "Young
Adult" together, he only

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.910
brought up one name, and
it was Patton Oswalt.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.890
And I didn't know who
Patton Oswalt was,

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.440
so I was a little bit
like, ooh, who's this?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.080
And then he showed me some
stuff, and I was like, really?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.250
And then we got on set, and
it was like, oh, god, that's--

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.392
you just see something.

00:23:48.392 --> 00:23:50.350
And so this time around,
it was the same thing.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.470
The only name that was ever
brought up was Mackenzie,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.480
and I mean, for me, when I
read the script, because it

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.340
was so intricate, this
relationship between us,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.390
I definitely read
it in that sense.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.580
And so I was like, that's
going to be interesting.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.621
What do you do with this?

00:24:11.621 --> 00:24:13.760
And Mackenzie showed
up, and it was just

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.690
so beautifully weird and odd.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.050
And pretty much from the
moment that I met her,

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.760
I was just like this, and so
it was perfect for the film.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.080
And then she ends up--

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.050
she's a cool girl, so it was
nice to be on set with her

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.780
and to share this
experience with her.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.040
MACKENZIE DAVIS: Thank you.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.373
CHARLIZE THERON: You're welcome.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.030
MACKENZIE DAVIS: Yeah, I feel
like we didn't plan anything

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.820
out too much.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.235
We just talked a bit about--

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.610
I remember that
breakfast that we

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.040
had in that weird hotel
in the Sutton Hotel,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.270
where we just talked
about getting older

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.790
in a really normal way.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.470
I don't know.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.210
We have the same
body type, and what

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.544
it's like to be used to
the way your body behaves

00:25:01.544 --> 00:25:02.960
for your whole
life, and then what

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.459
happens when it starts behaving
in a different way, and just

00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:10.580
simple things that can bond
you to someone quite easily

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.239
and make you--

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:11.780
I don't know.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.840
There's certain-- this
sounds like something that

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.720
"Cosmopolitan Magazine" would
say, but there are something--

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.240
certain secrets of being
female that can make you

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.030
feel very close to
someone immediately

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:27.947
without needing to map out
a whole plan right away.

00:25:27.947 --> 00:25:30.530
CHARLIZE THERON: I think she's
also one of the funniest people

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.790
I've ever been around, and
so that's just so disarming.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.490
And I think, instantly, we
really connected on that.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.920
I was just-- every time
I was around, I was--

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.080
because I was not the
funnest person on the shoot.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.630
I dealt with depression for
the first time in my life,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.260
and my body was just not
happy, and my mind was unhappy,

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.670
and my soul was unhappy.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.680
And being around her was just
real joy, and I think we--

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.930
I definitely got-- whether
she liked it or not,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.390
I got close to her through that.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.660
I was very happy when she--

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.718
Ron, I was happy when
you were there, too.

00:26:05.718 --> 00:26:07.060
RON LIVINGSTONE: OK, it was OK.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.310
CHARLIZE THERON: I was happy
when you were there, too.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.190
RON LIVINGSTONE: Sure.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.689
CHARLIZE THERON:
In a different way.

00:26:11.689 --> 00:26:13.040
RON LIVINGSTONE: Yeah.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.565
CHARLIZE THERON: I love Ron.

00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:14.160
RON LIVINGSTONE:
Different body type.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.515
CHARLIZE THERON: I--

00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:15.350
[LAUGHING]

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.725
MACKENZIE DAVIS:
Different body--

00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:18.250
you don't know what it's like.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.750
CHARLIZE THERON:
Ron is, by the way,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.820
the nicest person you will ever
meet on the face of the earth,

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.260
hands down.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.550
Way nicer than you.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.302
So I'll just point
out you guys' best--

00:26:30.302 --> 00:26:31.385
MACKENZIE DAVIS: As foils.

00:26:31.385 --> 00:26:32.260
CHARLIZE THERON: Yes.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.420
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Go ahead, Emma.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.086
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:26:38.086 --> 00:26:40.840
I'm just curious, was it
hard to get this movie made,

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.300
given that it's a
movie about motherhood

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.950
and being a new parent
and multiple kids?

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.010
Was this a hard one to pitch?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.260
Or do you feel like there's
an appetite for that right

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.750
now, how much we're
exploring motherhood,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.740
and you're seeing it
more in shows and films?

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.272
JASON REITMAN: I don't think--

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:01.230
they're traditionally
not easy to get financed,

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.300
and I don't think they're--

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.060
I have not heard of any
studio out there saying,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.400
you know what, let's look
for more real human drama,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.360
particularly female human drama.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.880
That's-- although you're right.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.330
There's a lot more of that
happening in television now.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.660
I think-- frankly, a
company called BRON Studios

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.750
up in Vancouver
financed this film.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.020
And they came in early,
and they came in strong.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.910
They liked the script.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.020
They loved this cast, clearly,
and they backed the film.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.840
And they were amazing
start to finish.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.020
There was never any kind of--

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.700
I never felt them trying to
bend it into something that it

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.660
wasn't.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.084
The people that were
already big fans

00:27:44.084 --> 00:27:45.500
of "Juno" and
"Young Adult--" they

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.990
got the tone of what we wanted
to do, and we got it made.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.990
But I feel lucky about that.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.490
I think we're very
fortunate that we

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.760
got to get this film made.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.740
There's a lot of
films like it that

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.156
are trying to get made that
are not getting the financing.

00:27:57.156 --> 00:28:01.190
If only we were at a company
with a limitless amount

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:07.010
of funds that could invest
into movies of tomorrow.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.040
I would think if they
really cared about women,

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.960
they would start investing money
into female-driven independent

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.740
film.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.240
Huh.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.448
CHARLIZE THERON: I like that.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.460
AUDIENCE: My question goes to
Jason because I'm an aspiring

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.920
filmmaker, and I'm--

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.650
I haven't got a chance to see
the movie yet because it's

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.240
released on May 4th--

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.860
May the Force be
with you, by the way.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.360
Anyway--

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.526
JASON REITMAN: It's within
the "Star Wars" universe.

00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:38.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, pretty much.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.330
CHARLIZE THERON: It's
a Tolkien crossover.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:40.913
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:43.997 --> 00:28:46.580
I'm just really curious to know
what your directing process is

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.710
like, from getting the script
in your hands to development,

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:56.150
pre-production, post-production,
to distribution--

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.560
how much was changed?

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.050
What was left--
what was left in?

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.700
What was left out?

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.470
And how-- and through
those changes, how

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:12.798
did you define the characters
from point A to point B?

00:29:12.798 --> 00:29:17.120
And what was it like to
pick out the color palette

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.810
for cinematography and
choosing the appropriate lenses

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.950
to tell the story?

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:22.450
I'm sorry.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.158
JASON REITMAN: These
are a lot of-- these

00:29:24.158 --> 00:29:25.530
are all great questions.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.640
It's a lot of them,
and I think if I

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.742
were to answer all of that,
it would take a while.

00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:32.450
And I'm going to.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.760
So-- no.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:40.220
So I'll just say a
couple of brief things.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:48.240
One, what's unique about Diablo
is that she is a pure writer

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.800
and does not use index
cards or treatments.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.240
She has an idea.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.236
She called me at
one point and said,

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:58.110
I have this idea for a
movie, and she kind of

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.940
told it to me in two sentences.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.360
And then six weeks later,
she had a screenplay,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.920
and it was a first draft, but
it was also our shooting draft.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.300
And she just writes.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.820
She sits down and starts
at the first scene, then

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.760
the second scene, and she
lets the movie tell her

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.320
what its going to be.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.890
And that's how she's
written all her films.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.557
And as another writer,
it's infuriating.

00:30:22.557 --> 00:30:24.890
I mean, it took me seven years
to write "Up in the Air."

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.440
I don't know-- I don't
know how she does it.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.070
But her screenplays are
very clear on the page,

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.090
and it's not to say
that they are loaded

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.294
with long paragraphs of detail.

00:30:34.294 --> 00:30:35.210
They're very succinct.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.290
They're very short--

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.760
100-page scripts.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.200
But you can't help but read
it and know what she's saying

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.120
and what she's referring to.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.750
I feel like it's my job not to
tell the actors how to do it.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.310
It's to find people
who I think have

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.590
connective tissue with the
characters on the page.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.240
Not that they're the
same human being,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.460
but there's something inside
them that connects them

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.215
to this character that I know
is going to come to life.

00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:02.090
And then they bring it
to life, and I'm there

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:09.410
to help shape and keep us
all within one tonal world.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.950
But it's up to them,
and we don't rehearse.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.350
We-- and it's funny
you brought that up.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.190
We had one lunch before
we went because I'm lucky.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.822
I get to work with brilliant
actors, and I know, on the day,

00:31:22.822 --> 00:31:23.780
we're going to find it.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.988
And we're going to find it
over a few takes, or maybe

00:31:25.988 --> 00:31:28.580
a few more takes, but it's not
going to be anything crazy.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.750
And when that magic
happens, when two actors--

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.780
when two really talented actors
suddenly connect and have

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.719
chemistry, and the
lines come to life,

00:31:38.719 --> 00:31:40.260
there's nothing like
it in the world.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.830
I mean, it's really an exciting
thing to watch happen live,

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.871
and when it happens, I
want the cameras to be on.

00:31:44.871 --> 00:31:46.862
I don't want to be in
a rehearsal studio.

00:31:46.862 --> 00:31:49.070
So that's a little bit of
how the process was, and it

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.524
certainly is how this
movie came together.

00:31:51.524 --> 00:31:53.815
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN: I think
we have one more question,

00:31:53.815 --> 00:31:55.706
and then we'll wrap up.

00:31:55.706 --> 00:31:57.580
AUDIENCE: So Charlize
and Ron, I think of you

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.992
both as really funny
people who play characters

00:32:00.992 --> 00:32:02.950
with a lot of pain, but
really funny characters

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.550
with a lot of pain.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.540
But you also do some
wackier characters,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.520
and I'm sort of curious,
as artists and performers,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.680
do you feel like that
balance is important?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.180
Or do you lean one
way or the other,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.596
that it's important
to you to play

00:32:18.596 --> 00:32:21.813
characters who have some sort
of non-comedic painful depth?

00:32:21.813 --> 00:32:24.609
RON LIVINGSTONE: Wow,
that's a great question.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.525
You want to take that?

00:32:25.525 --> 00:32:27.750
Or--

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.500
CHARLIZE THERON: No,
I could go after you.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.502
RON LIVINGSTONE: All right.

00:32:30.502 --> 00:32:31.918
You know what, I'm
going to assume

00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:33.810
my male privilege to go first.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.784
[LAUGHING]

00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:36.450
CHARLIZE THERON: I'm
handling it to you.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.950
RON LIVINGSTONE: I-- it's like--

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.410
I think the pain is--
everybody has pain.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.890
And so if it's useful to
bring it to the thing,

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.710
then that's great.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.310
As far as the wacky, I just--

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.010
I think I'm just kind of goofy.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.250
There's an element of
me that's kind of goofy.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.280
And there was a while-- there
was five years when I was

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.910
trying to be a matinee idol
and wear the leather jacket--

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.260
I mean, like I have on now.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:14.050
And it was just really hard not
to make a face because there's

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.100
something about it that
strikes me as a little silly.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.780
And then that's the part that
I like about it, is OK, what's

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.640
the silly part?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.615
But I think it's all the same.

00:33:26.615 --> 00:33:27.490
You know what I mean?

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:34.000
It's like people who are only in
pain or only trying to be funny

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.120
tend to be really infuriating
people to hang out with,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.560
so you just throw
it all together

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.250
and see what comes out of it.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.240
CHARLIZE THERON: Yeah, I
mean, I agree with Ron.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.940
I don't believe that
people are only one thing.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.320
I think that--

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.750
I think that's also what
makes this writing feel

00:33:55.750 --> 00:34:03.610
so great because it deals with
some very serious and hard

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:07.340
subject matter, but
through real people.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.750
And I think real people--

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.330
I think we can all
relate to that.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:15.800
I've had shitloads of
tragedy, but nobody is just

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.699
that one thing.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:19.270
And I think a lot of people
who have had a lot of tragedy

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:23.380
in their life tend to veer
more towards the silly

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.530
and the light-heartedness
of it in order to survive.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.190
I mean, this is why
I'm dead inside.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.550
Didn't work for me.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:38.760
But I think there's a
sense of humor about this

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.949
that feels very real.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.300
That's not just a joke for the
sake of a joke or to be funny.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.969
I think a lot of the
humor of this film

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.060
comes from very
real places, and I

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.210
know for myself,
raising my kids,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:55.530
it is a horror movie and
a comedy with Will Ferrell

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.590
and "Star Wars."

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.490
It's everything.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.600
It's literally
every day, I'm like,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.360
I don't know what
movie we're in today,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.220
but can't wait to go on the
ride, see where it lands.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:08.950
I don't know.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:09.630
Does that-- is that--

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.952
RON LIVINGSTONE: That was great.

00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:10.630
CHARLIZE THERON: That
was a bullshit answer.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.260
JASON REITMAN: I
thought it was good.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:11.430
CHARLIZE THERON: I don't--

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.750
RON LIVINGSTONE: Yeah.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.020
JASON REITMAN: I'm satisfied.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.270
CHARLIZE THERON: I don't know.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.942
I don't know.

00:35:14.942 --> 00:35:15.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]--

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.108
CHARLIZE THERON: You just
do what he says, basically.

00:35:18.108 --> 00:35:20.449
That's really what happens.

00:35:20.449 --> 00:35:21.490
AUDIENCE: Me, personally?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.140
Or just--

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.520
CHARLIZE THERON: No,
what Jason [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.228
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:35:24.228 --> 00:35:26.510
JASON REITMAN: Yeah, we've
been waiting for you to--

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.218
CHARLIZE THERON: Yes,
I'm waiting for you

00:35:28.218 --> 00:35:30.120
to tell me how to respond.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.550
JENNIFER VAN FOSSEN:
Reminder, May 4, everyone,

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.260
please take your friends.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.630
Go see "Tully" in theaters.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.445
Thank you so much
for making this film.

00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:40.028
CHARLIZE THERON:
Thanks for having us.

00:35:40.028 --> 00:35:42.380
[APPLAUSE]
