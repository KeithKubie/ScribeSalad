00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.879
Jacob: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
my name is Jacob Clifford

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.679
Adriene: and I’m Adriene Hill. Today we’re
going to talk about monopolies! Which are

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.860
terrible, illegal, and only serve to exploit
helpless consumers, except when they’re

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.250
delivering essential services that competitive
free markets kind of fail to deliver.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.350
Jacob: So, are monopolies are good? Or bad?
Or?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.470
Adriene: Both.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:30.020
[Theme Music]

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.540
Jacob: When some people hear the word “capitalist”
they picture the robber barons of the 19th century.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.120
Cutthroat monopolists, like Andrew Carnegie,
JP Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.180
They dominated industries like oil, railroads, banking, &amp; steel and would do anything to crush their competitors.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.780
After all, in Rockefeller’s words “The growth of a
large business is merely a survival of the fittest.”

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.240
Now, it’s true that market economists love competition, but monopolies are the antithesis of competition.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.660
In most cases, economists want to prevent monopolies, not celebrate them. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble:

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.140
Adriene: A pure monopoly is a market controlled
by one seller with a good or service that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.220
has no close substitutes. But the true power
of a monopoly comes from its ability to keep

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.470
competitors out of the market. Monopolies
are able to erect obstacles that economists

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.229
call barriers to entry. If a company starts
offering a brand new product in a market with

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.780
low barriers, they won’t maintain market
power for very long.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.530
Take gourmet food trucks. In the last decade,
gourmet cooks started moving into the street

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.970
food business, competing in a market historically
associated with lower-quality options like

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.390
hot dog vendors. These food trucks were a
hit. Demand was high and the barriers to entry

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.670
were relatively low, so more and more competitors
jumped in. Now food trucks are kind of everywhere.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.810
And that’s exactly how capitalism is supposed to work. People wanted more street food options and profit-

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.020
seeking entrepreneurs gave them what they wanted. Incentives and competition made society better off.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.800
But imagine a city where there are a limited
number of licenses for food trucks, and I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
own all of them for my fleet of artisanal
macaroni and cheese trucks. I also know the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.540
mayor, since he’s a big fan of artisanal
macaroni and cheese. If I can convince the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.410
mayor to ban traditional push cart food vendors,
with their shwarma and their bacon-wrapped

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.880
hot dogs, I’ll have a monopoly on street
food.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.550
I’m not increasing profit by producing more
stuff. I’ve influenced government regulations

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.910
in such a way that anyone who’s hungry,
but doesn’t want to enter a building, has

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.170
to buy food from me. This is sometimes called
crony capitalism, and it’s a big reason

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.700
many economists call for government transparency
and accountability.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.800
Jacob: Thanks Thought Bubble. Companies don’t have to have a literal monopoly to exercise monopoly power.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.220
When a single company has a huge market share
in its industry, like Google does in search,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.900
they wield a lot of the same power that a
pure monopoly would.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.860
Now, when few firms have a large majority
of market share, it’s called an oligopoly.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.260
The market for mobile device operating systems is a good example with Google’s Android and Apple's iOS.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.280
The point is that one company doesn’t need to have 100% market shares to operate like a monopoly.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.680
In the example of the anti-food-truck ordinance,
the barrier to entry was government regulation,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.620
but what some other ways companies maintain
large market shares?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.840
Well, there’s also control of resources,
like DeBeers once had 90% of market share

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.180
in diamonds because they controlled the world’s
diamond mines.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.440
Another barrier is high start up costs. You
may want to build a nuclear power plant to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.150
compete with your power company but you need
a whole lot of money to get in the game.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.760
Adriene: Monopolies can restrict output and
charge higher prices without worrying about

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.700
competitors. This is why most economists support
anti-trust laws that promote competition and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.910
outlaw anticompetitive tactics.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.980
They’re called antitrust laws because monopolies
used to be called “trusts”. In 1890, the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.090
US passed the Sherman Act, named for Senator
John Sherman. Sherman argued, “If we will

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.490
not endure a king as a political power we
should not endure a king over the production,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.140
transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries
of life.”

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.540
The Sherman Act outlaws any monopolization or attempted monopolization. Court rulings and later laws

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.840
gave the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission greater authority to prevent monopoles.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.340
If the Coca Cola company wanted to purchase
PepsiCo, it’d be a tough regulatory sell.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.740
In the US mergers and acquisitions need to
be approved by the government agencies.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.760
Economists call the act of buying companies
that produce similar products horizontal integration.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.000
Like, AT&amp;T tried to buy T-Mobile, but failed
because regulators believed the new company

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.480
would control too big a share of the wireless
communications market.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.940
Vertical integration, on the other hand, is when a company directly owns or controls its supply chain.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.680
For example, in the 1920s, the
Ford Motor Company owned much of the entire

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.640
supply chain needed to make cars. It owned
iron and coal mines, and made its own steel,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.970
glass, tires, and even paper in the massive
River Rouge factory complex in Michigan.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.040
Vertical integration is complicated, and it’s
not always illegal. When a company just expands

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.040
its business to insource part of its supply chain,
that’s usually not subject to antitrust regulation.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.880
Companies can run into some trouble when
they try to vertically integrate via mergers.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.740
Antitrust regulations can also prevent companies
from making anticompetitive deals with their suppliers.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.040
In the late 1990s, Microsoft was accused of
pressuring PC manufacturers to pre-install

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.240
Microsoft’s web browser, Internet Explorer, and
exclude their main browser competitor, Netscape.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.680
Regulators busted them, and almost
busted up the company.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.860
Even Toys R Us! It’s gotten in trouble for
conspiring with toy suppliers, like Hasbro

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.010
and Mattel, to stop the manufacturers from
selling certain toys to other stores.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.730
So monopolies and monpolistic behavior are
bad, right? Well, it turn out that sometimes

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.090
they’re useful. Look at patents. A patent
grants an inventor exclusive rights to profit

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.360
from a specific product or process.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.700
In the US, it is actually written into the Constitution.
Patents and other intellectual property rights

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.700
encourage innovation. Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars each year developing drugs,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.139
and patents allow them to recover those research
and development costs and, ideally, earn profit.

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.599
A patent essentially guarantees their right
to be a monopoly, but not forever.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.720
After a certain amount of time, usually about 20 years,
a patent expires, which lowers the barriers to entry.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.880
Competition moves in, prices fall, and
companies look for something new to patent.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.740
Intellectual property law and patents are really complex. And Stan, he’s actually done a whole series about 'em.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.760
Jacob: Natural monopolies are special situations
where it is more cost effective to have one

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.639
large producer rather than several smaller
competing firms.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.830
The best examples are public utilities in
markets such as electricity, water, natural

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.430
gas, and sewage. They may be privately owned
or publicly owned but either way, they remain

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.639
a monopoly because the government limits competition.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.120
I mean, if there were three competing electric
power companies in one city, that would mean

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.860
building three different power plants, and running
three sets of power lines through the streets.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.760
The result would be higher costs. So, in
this case, it would be cheaper to have one

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.880
electric company because they have economies
of scale. The monopoly can still raise prices

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.100
and abuse its position, so the government
often regulates prices and fees.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.389
Now, of course there are debates over when
the government should interfere and which

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.290
markets justify natural monopolies.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.900
Nike has about 90% market share in basketball
shoes, but it’s not a natural monopoly.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.440
It’s a non-coercive monopoly. There are
plenty of other shoe manufacturers and people

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.050
aren’t forced to buy Nike shoes. So there’s
no reason for the government to get involved.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.030
But that’s not always the case. Up to the
1970s AT&amp;T was given natural monopoly status,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.780
which gave it nearly complete control of the
telephone industry.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.030
In 1974 an antitrust lawsuit was filed by
the Department of Justice, and the end result

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.790
was the largest corporate breakup in American
history. AT&amp;T dissolved in seven regional

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.190
telephone companies, and other companies like
Sprint and MCI quickly jumped into the market.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:08:00.000
This process called deregulation, and it’s happened in many markets from delivering mail to airlines.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.860
Adriene: So let’s step back, here. Why are so worried about monopolies? Well, a lot of this has to do with pricing.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.860
For one, monopolies can charge more for their products than they could if the market was competitive.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.400
They can also engage in a practice called
price discrimination. Price discrimination

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:20.730
is the practice of charging different consumers
different prices for exactly the same product.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.540
In fact the earliest regulation of railroads came about because they were engaged in price discrimination.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.540
They charged different rates
to haul freight. This gave an advantage to

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.970
companies that shipped more freight and helped
to force smaller producers out of business,

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.890
creating even more monopoly power in the economy.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.290
But price discrimination isn’t just for
monopolies, and it’s not always illegal.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.530
To pull off price discrimination, a business
needs to be able to segregate the market

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.860
based on consumers’ willingness to pay.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:55.620
The airline industry does this using time: charging
those that book early less than those that book late.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:02.180
A price-sensitive student might only be able to pay $200 so she books a seat weeks or months in advance.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.380
A time-sensitive businesswoman that
needs to be at a board meeting tomorrow,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.960
might be willing to pay $800 for that
same type of seat on the same flight.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.740
The point is, charging a single price wouldn’t
generate as much profit as charging different prices.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.580
Price discrimination happens more
often than you might think.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.040
Discounts based on age or
occupation are good examples.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.400
Price discrimination works best when firms
have a large share of market power.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:34.060
If there were hundreds of airlines it is unlikely that any one of them could price discriminate without losing customers.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.280
Like a lot of things we look at here at Crash
Course, monopolies and pricing are complicated.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.780
Generally, competition is a good thing. Except when it isn’t. Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next week.
