00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.369
there is a sort of funny thing that you

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
there is a sort of funny thing that you
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.740
there is a sort of funny thing that you
hear people say that the time doesn't

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
hear people say that the time doesn't
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.959
hear people say that the time doesn't
actually exist and and it's something

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
actually exist and and it's something
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.110
actually exist and and it's something
that physicists argue about and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
that physicists argue about and
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.630
that physicists argue about and
physicists actually have symposia on the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
physicists actually have symposia on the
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820
physicists actually have symposia on the
subject of is there such a thing as time

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
subject of is there such a thing as time
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.670
subject of is there such a thing as time
and it's also something that has a

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680
and it's also something that has a
 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.230
and it's also something that has a
tradition in philosophy going back about

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
tradition in philosophy going back about
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.070
tradition in philosophy going back about
a century but I think it's fair to say

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
a century but I think it's fair to say
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.040
a century but I think it's fair to say
that in one sense it's a ridiculous come

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
that in one sense it's a ridiculous come
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799
that in one sense it's a ridiculous come
it's a ridiculous idea how can you say

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
it's a ridiculous idea how can you say
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020
it's a ridiculous idea how can you say
time doesn't exist when we have such a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
time doesn't exist when we have such a
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450
time doesn't exist when we have such a
profound experience of it first of all

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
profound experience of it first of all
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299
profound experience of it first of all

can't get through this sentence without
referring to time I was going to say we

referring to time I was going to say we
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729
referring to time I was going to say we
couldn't get through the day without

couldn't get through the day without
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.139
couldn't get through the day without
discussing time so obviously when a

physicist questions the existence of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
physicist questions the existence of
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.660
physicist questions the existence of
time they are trying to say something

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670
time they are trying to say something

contemporary offers a vision of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
contemporary offers a vision of
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.260
contemporary offers a vision of
space-time as a single thing as a

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270
space-time as a single thing as a
 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.719
space-time as a single thing as a
four-dimensional block in which the past

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
four-dimensional block in which the past
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020
four-dimensional block in which the past
and the future are just like spatial

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
and the future are just like spatial
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179
and the future are just like spatial
dimensions they're just like north and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
dimensions they're just like north and
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.840
dimensions they're just like north and
south in the equations of physics and so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
south in the equations of physics and so
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.530
south in the equations of physics and so
you can construct a view of the world in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
you can construct a view of the world in
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.010
you can construct a view of the world in
which the future is already there and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020
which the future is already there and
 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.679
which the future is already there and
you can say and physicists do say

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
you can say and physicists do say
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.800
you can say and physicists do say
something very much like this that in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
something very much like this that in
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870
something very much like this that in
the fundamental laws of physics there is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
the fundamental laws of physics there is
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969
the fundamental laws of physics there is
no distinction between the past and the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
no distinction between the past and the
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.620
no distinction between the past and the
future and so if you're playing that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
future and so if you're playing that
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.289
future and so if you're playing that
game you're essentially saying time as

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
game you're essentially saying time as
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.190
game you're essentially saying time as
an independent thing doesn't exist time

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
an independent thing doesn't exist time
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.929
an independent thing doesn't exist time
is just another dimension like space

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
is just another dimension like space
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.380
is just another dimension like space
again that is in obvious conflict with

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
again that is in obvious conflict with
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750
again that is in obvious conflict with
our intuitions about the world we go

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
our intuitions about the world we go
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.620
our intuitions about the world we go

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630

acting as though the past is over and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
acting as though the past is over and
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.870
acting as though the past is over and
the future has not yet happened and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
the future has not yet happened and
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.250
the future has not yet happened and
might happen this way or it might happen

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
might happen this way or it might happen
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.090
might happen this way or it might happen
that way we could flip a coin and see we

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
that way we could flip a coin and see we
 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.040
that way we could flip a coin and see we
tend to believe in our gut that the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
tend to believe in our gut that the
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960
tend to believe in our gut that the
future is not fully determined and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
future is not fully determined and
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.370
future is not fully determined and
therefore is different from the past but

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380
therefore is different from the past but
 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.390
therefore is different from the past but
physicists will say and it's certainly

physicists will say and it's certainly
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920

true that a lot of things that we feel

true that a lot of things that we feel

true that a lot of things that we feel
in our gut turn out not to be right you

scientist came along and told you that
no you're actually on the surface of a

no you're actually on the surface of a

you'd have to you'd have to do some

you'd have to you'd have to do some
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.940
you'd have to you'd have to do some
radical readjustment of your

radical readjustment of your

radical readjustment of your
understanding of the universe to accept

that your first intuitions weren't
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.840
that your first intuitions weren't
correct and so if a physicist comes to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850
correct and so if a physicist comes to
 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.070
correct and so if a physicist comes to
me and says do some readjustment face it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
me and says do some readjustment face it

the future looks different from the past

physicists do argue about these things

it's an argument that I take a position

it's an argument that I take a position

recommend to readers of science fiction
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.290
recommend to readers of science fiction
