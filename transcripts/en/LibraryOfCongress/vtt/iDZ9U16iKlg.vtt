00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good afternoon,
my name is Georgette Dorn

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.090
and I am the Chief of the Hispanic
Division and I'm very pleased

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.390
to welcome all of you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.680
to this wonderful event
despite the horrible rainy day.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.980
It is my pleasure to
introduce Catalina Gomez,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.500
a reference librarian and
specialist in Hispanic literature.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.760
Catalina Gomez.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.280
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Dr. Charlotte
Rogers is assistant professor

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.460
of Spanish at the University
of Virginia.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.940
Her book Jungle Fever
exploring madness and medicine

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.910
in 20th century tropical
narratives was published in 2012.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.470
In 2014, she was a Kluge fellow
here at the Library of Congress

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.820
where she researched her new
book, Project about the Legend

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.090
of El Dorado in contemporary
literature of the Americas.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
In 2015, Princeton University
awarded her the library research

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390
grant to study its archive
of Mario Llosa paper.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.510
Please join me in welcoming
Charlotte Rogers.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.850
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers: Thank you very
much Catalina for your warm words

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.260
of welcome and thank you everyone

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.110
for coming here today
despite the rain.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.210
I'm really honored to be here,
particularly in this room

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.750
because I hope you have a chance
to look around while you're here.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.530
There's some [inaudible]
over there in the corner

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.990
and while we were setting up for
this event they were playing them.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.510
Because I have to kind of give
them a good workout every once

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.810
in a while.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140
Also, the Library of Congress
is a very special place

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.240
and I have loved it ever since
I was a Kluge fellow here

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.110
and I particularly fell in love

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.140
with the Hispanic Division
and its resources.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.430
So for all of those reasons it's
a very special privilege for me

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.460
to speak to you today
about Alvaro Mutis.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.490
As a Colombian poet and novelist
Mutis was often overshadowed

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.980
by his friend and compatriot,
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.130
Scholars often compare them even
though their work is completely

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.960
different just because they were
from the same place and they ended

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.950
up living next-door to each
other in Mexico City in exile.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.560
So what I'm going to
propose to do here today goes

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.200 position:56%
against that tradition of constantly
comparing Mutis and Garcia Marquez.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.740
I'm actually going to do a sort of
literary contrapuntal or a point

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.180
and counter point that compares
not Mutis and Garcia Marquez,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.350
but actually Mutis and
Miguel de Cervantes,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.230
perhaps a much more
surprising comparison.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.930
So I've chosen this musical
contrapuntal structure

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.050
for a couple of reasons.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.350
First, the juxtaposition
between Cervantes and Mutis,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.790
who is shown here with
a cocktail which I love.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.460
I hope my next book has a name of
a cocktail in the author photo.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.160
So in comparing these two great
authors I want to pay homage

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.500
to Mutis and really put him on
the same level with Cervantes,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.060
which I think is a bold claim.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.160
Second, I am paying a very
personal tribute to Edith Grossman

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.330
who is the translator of adventures
and misadventures of Maqroll,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.660 position:56%
as well as Don Quixote by Cervantes.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.990
And so as Catalina
mentioned, you have the chance

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.950
to buy the Adventures of Maqroll,
which is Edith's translation.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.920
But the last and most
important reason why I want

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.950
to compare these two authors is
that there are many affinities

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.130
between Mutis and Cervantes
both biographical and literary.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.220
This is so much the case that I
think that Mutis actually wrote

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.640
with Cervantes in mind and I'm
going to point out a couple

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.680
of places here today where I
think we can see Mutis thinking

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.600
about Cervantes.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.250
So this contrapuntal is designed
to highlight those enduring values

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.620
and the contemporary
relevance of Alvaro Mutis.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.210
Also, I really just want to
provide points of departure

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.520
for our question-and-answer period

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.540
because I think that's always
the most illuminating part

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.400
of the talk for me.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.650
So to begin due to these accidents
of birth should state the obvious

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.130
and these two men clearly belong
to different nations and eras.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.330
But Alvaro Mutis was born in
Bogota in Columbia in 1923.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.460
He took up residence in
Mexico City in the late 1950's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.620
where he died on September
22nd, 2013.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.210
So this is also really a tribute

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.080
to him just a few short
years after his passing.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.860
So and of course, I'm sure most of
you know Cervantes lived in Spain

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.940
and died in Madrid in 1616.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.280
But despite these differences, the
men share biographical elements

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.420
that marked their literary
production.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.610
So I'll give you just
a few examples.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.190
First, both authors showed a really
early preference for writing poetry

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.430
and a penchant for more
colorful activities.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.810
Cervantes once wounded
a man in a dual

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.230
and Alvaro spent his
free time playing pool,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.230
so much so that he actually
never graduated from high school

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.530
because he spent a lot of time

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.920
in the billiard hall
and reading novels.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.600
He said Dickens was
one of his favorites.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.000
More importantly, the sea also
plays a large role in the work

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.420
of both men and their lives.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.310
Cervantes famously lost an arm in
the 1571 naval battle of Lepanto,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.900
which earned him the epithet
El Manco de Lepanto, you know,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.720
the one armed man from Lepanto.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.170
Now in a less military way water
imagery is an essential part

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.480
of Mutis' prose in poetry.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.210
Throughout this talk I'm
going to point out a couple

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.490
of aquatic motifs, I think
that really marked Mutis.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.120
And we're going to start
doing that by listening to one

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.200 position:56%
of Mutis' poems that features water.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.860
So you're going to have to bear
with me here as I sneak out.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.500
We're going to listen to
a poem called Nocturno,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.900
there it'll show here.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.400 position:56%
So this poem is called Nocturno from
Los trabajos perdidos from 1965.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.530
And as Catalina mentioned, all of
this is available on the website

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.680
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.890
So we're going to just play
right off the internet here.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.630
And I should mention I'm going
to be reading translations

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.600
of Mutis' prose work, but I've left
his poetry in the original Spanish.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.930
So I invite you to close
your eyes and listen to Mutis

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.510
as he reads his own
work, this is Nocturno.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:08:12.150
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:18.770
So I hope that you can hear
that cascade of water, you know,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.130
falling over the coffee
plants in the poem

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.500 position:56%
and that brings a very cleansing
[foreign language] knowing the words

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.960
of Mutis.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.270
So water also appears in
Mutis' prose, you know,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.530
always as a cleansing
or liberating image.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:44.700 position:56%
In fact, Mutis' most famous literary
character is also a sailor right.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.970
The peripatetic and melancholic
mariner named Maqroll el Gaviero.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.920
And I think that there is
a great similarity there,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.740
actually between Cervantes
and Mutis in the sense

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.790
that both men created a literary

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.470
or a fictional person
who outlives them right.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.230
You all know about Don Quixote
he's become an iconic figure,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.340
but I argue that Mutis' character
Maqroll should be just as famous.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.410
So Maqroll appears in a series
of seven short novels collected

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.400
in English as we mentioned
as the Adventures

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.440
and Misadventures of Maqroll.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.220 position:56%
And in those novels the eponymous
protagonist travels the world right,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.730 position:56%
on a variety of unsuccessful quests.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.700
So I think you can see
some similarities already

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.140
between Maqroll el
Gaviero and Don Quixote.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.940
But I think we should
go a bit deeper,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.800
so let's start looking very closely
at his name, Maqroll el Gaviero.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.510
Maqroll Mutis stated in lots

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.590
of interviews is actually
his own invention,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.920 position:56%
it's a made-up name though he wanted
to give a vaguely Scottish flavor,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.660
which you can hear with
the Maq in the Maqroll.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.670
Yet Maqroll is also intended to
be of inscrutable origin right.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.940
Mutis never reveals
his country of birth.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.880 position:56%
He speaks multiple languages and the
reader learns only that he traveled

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.590
on a fake passport
from Cypress right.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.420
So it gives you an idea of a
shady past in his background.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.290 position:56%
In reality, I like to argue that his
[foreign language] is the sea right.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.510
Now his nickname el Gaviero is also
an explicitly nautical reference.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.770
The gavia in Spanish
means the jib right,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.330
it's one of the sails
on a large ship.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.460
And the gaviero is the
sailor who manages it often

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.910
from a very high point
up on the mast right,

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.340
so it's kind of a lookout
point as well.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.250
So in her translation Edie Grossman
has very ghastly rendered Maqroll's

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.630
nickname el gaviero as the lookout.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.080
A title that refers explicitly
to that sailor who perches

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.150
up on the crow's nest of the ship
and scans the horizon for dangers.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.360
In fact, this position at the top
of the mast was also known formerly

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.020
as the carajo if you'll excuse my
rather vulgar language here okay.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.330
So being in the carajo was
not very highly desired

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.540
because of the wind and the rain.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.460
And that and this may
be a folk etymology,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.280
but as far as I've been
able to tell that post,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.720
that nautical post gave rise to
the expression vete el carajo,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.710
which now has the meaning that all
of you are thinking of right now.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:38.230
So when we take these two aspects
of the name together Maqroll

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:44.690 position:56%
and gaviero evokes a traveler with
a capacity for self-invention right.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.990
He's employed in a rather
antiquated profession

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.030
and he contemplates the
vastness of the ocean

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.950
and the depths of human folly.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.120
So Maqroll and Don Quixote
in this counterpoint

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.410
that I'm doing are
actually very similar.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:06.590 position:56%
If we remember that Alonzo Quijano
also invents himself as Don Quixote.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.340
He too takes up an
antiquated profession right,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.220
that of knight errant
and he also travels

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.730
over the vast landscape
of La Mancha.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.210
In another sense I think that
both characters are really

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.190
from nowhere right, in the sense
that Maqroll has no fixed home.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.090
Don Quixote is from La Mancha,
which is so arid and boring

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.500
that it's like being from nowhere.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.370
But I think great things
can come from nowhere.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.520
And each character always sets out
right to perform these great feats

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.870
and so that's what makes them
similar in their uniqueness.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.540
So let's turn back
now to our authors.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.490
The most significant biographical
similarity between Cervantes

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:53.380
and Mutis is they both spent a
formative period of time in jail.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.050
They were imprisoned for what
we would call today white-collar

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.630
crimes right.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:02.430
Cervantes was involved in
disputes in his very odious job

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.920
as a tax collector and as a result
he was incarcerated several times.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.000
In 1956, Mutis was working in
public relations for Standard Oil,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.840
which is now known as Exxon.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.260
When he was accused of embezzling
company funds he fled to Mexico.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.340
And from there Mutis fought
the extradition process back

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.730 position:56%
to Columbia, but the Mexican
officials detained him for 15 months

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.230
in what is known as the --
oh sorry, there's the books

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.690
that we're working with here.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.540
So he was detained for 15
months in the black palace

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.050
of the Lecumberri also
known as El Palacios Negro.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.560
It's one of the most notorious,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.770
it was one of the most
notorious prisons in Mexico.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.560
And since 1978 it's actually
housed the archives in Mexico,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.570
so I think there's an amazing
coincidence there between writing

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:02.210 position:56%
in the written word and
imprisonment, which often gives rise

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.790 position:56%
to really great works of literature.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.150
So the charges against
Mutis were later dropped

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.800
and they were largely attributed
to the political wrangling

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.340
of the Colombian dictator,
Gustavo Rojas Pinilla at the time.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.600
But nevertheless, Mutis spent 15
months in Lecumberri and I think

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.790
that that had a very powerful
effect on his later literature.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.120
So in fact, these harsh
experiences turned out to be a boon

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.960
for both men's literary creations.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.730
Cervantes writes in the prologue
to part one of the Quixote

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.190
that the idea for his
great work came to him

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.680
in the jail of Seville right.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.640
Any of you have seen The Man of
La Mancha the music you'll know

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.950
that it starts with
Cervantes in prison.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.710
But Mutis also found
inspiration there.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.260
He published a few short vignettes
about his time in Lecumberri

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.880
and it's called Lecumberri Diary.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.670
The best image that Moody's
Mutis creates in that diary is

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.410
yet again an aquatic motif right.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.260
He envisions a torrential rain
similar to the one we heard earlier

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.360
that will flood the prison
and it fills him with hope.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.060
In this instance water imagery
indicates freedom right.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.900
Seas, rivers, rains all
symbolized liberty for Mutis.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.250
And he hopes that it will
carry him out floating

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.270
onto the vast floodwaters and it
will and I quote from the diary,

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:36.990
leave behind judges,
ministers, scribes, guards,

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.240
and all the other beasts
that cling to human flesh

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.230
and blindly beat their
heads against us

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.530
in a furious attempt to destroy us.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.000
So in the rest of his life's work
Mutis would deplore the injustice

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.110
and the incompetence of
bureaucratic ordeals.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.700
Cervantes similarly critiqued the
holy brotherhood and the suffering

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.310
of the galley slaves in the
Quixote if we can recall.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.620
These bleak prison stints turned

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.030
out to be what Mutis calls [foreign
language] okay [foreign language].

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.810
Fertile misery for both men

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:22.390 position:56%
because their novels exhibit a very
deep sympathy for single individuals

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.580
and an equally deep skepticism
towards the possibility

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.470
of justice in human society.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.810
So in addition to formative
prison time both men turned away

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.640
from poetry and towards prose
very late in their life.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.260
In fact, their masterpieces
came when they were

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.520
in their late 50's and early 60's.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.300
Cervantes was 58 when he published
the Quixote, Mutis was in his 60's

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.790
and retired from publicity work
at that multinational corporation

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.820
when he wrote that seven
series of novellas.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.380
And I find that very inspiring
right, for all of us to think

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.230
that we all have a great literary
masterpiece inside us that may come

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.550
out when we're, you know, retired.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.020
You know, getting closer
towards the last portion of life.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.940
So up to this point I talked about
the biographical similarities

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.240
between Cervantes and Mutis.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.610
Yeah, I think the more important
question is really do they share a

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.780
literary vision.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.920
I argue that yes and we can see
their common esthetic in two ways.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.130
The first one and they're both --
they're related elements right.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.220
The first one is a
very keen perception

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.680
of the folly of human endeavors.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.880
The second is a profound
sense of disillusionment

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.000
or [foreign language] as
it's known in Spanish.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.120
These contrasting sentiments,
a dark humor

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:54.230 position:56%
and an ironic wistful bitterness are
really two sides of the same coin.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.620
So that underneath
the traveling romps

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.700
of their protagonists lies a harsh
and biting critique of the era

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.470
in which each author lived.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.100
And a reflection on the fleeting
nature of human existence.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.000
You know, both of them
having suffered so much.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.910
But first let's start
with the fun stuff.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.800
So we're going to look
at human folly okay.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.600
Cervantes I'm going to ask you to
remember or imagine the Quixote

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.910 position:56%
and just in case you haven't read it
we don't have that for sale today,

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.850
but I think you can find a few
copies here in the library.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.640
So let's look at folly.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.240
You can think a very famous scene
in the Quixote in a roadside inn,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.050
which features a hunchbacked
girl named Maritornes

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.690
and she's a servant.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.220
And Cervantes says she is
the [foreign language] right.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.670
So he says she's blind in one eye

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.640
and care barely see
out of the other.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.420
However, Maritornes in addition
to being a servant is supposed

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.450
to offer her nocturnal services
to a mule driver who is staying

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.410
in the same room as Don
Quixote and Sancho in the end.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.860
So when Maritornes comes into the
room it's dark and she stumbles

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.040
around and she suddenly ends
up in the arms of Don Quixote.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.900
Now she's wearing burlap
and she smells

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.780
of rotten salad [foreign
language] right.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:23.110
But the night errant, you
know, in his madness believes

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.050
that she's a beautiful princess
and he starts wooing her fervently

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.940
in the middle of the night.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.730
This wakes up the mule driver
who goes into a jealous rage

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.270
and beats Don Quixote
to a pulp right.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.820
In the meantime Maritornes
is hiding under the bed

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.370
and when Sancho discovers her
she beats him up again right.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.010
So there's a lot of very
physical comedy in the Quixote,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.120
but really I think
Cervantes is pointing out as

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.350
with Mutis the ridiculous
ironies of male desire right.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.480
And the ability to suspend
your disbelief right,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.040
in pursuit of desire.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.020
So let's look at how Mutis
does the same thing okay.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.640
I want to highlight Mutis'
perhaps his most famous novel

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.060
from the Maqroll series it's
Ilona Llega Con La Lluvia okay.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.730
Ilona comes with the rain.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.380
It was also made into a
motive, which is very famous.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.620 position:56%
And again, I want to point out we
can see the importance of water here

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.040
in the alliterative title of the
book Ilona Llega Con La Lluvia.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.260
So the Ilona of the title is
Maqroll's companion and lover

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.210
who he happens to reencounter
in Panama

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.840
after a long time they spent apart.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.220
Ilona convinces Maqroll that they
should start a brothel in order

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.880
to make enough money to
leave Panama and to continue

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.040
on her adventures together.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.410
Now what's special about this
brothel according to Ilona,

00:20:54.410 --> 00:21:01.860
is that the prostitutes all appear
to be foreign airline stewardesses

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.170
on a layover in Panama okay.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.320
So I teach this novel to my
undergraduates they're scandalized,

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.310 position:56%
but the most important thing is that
they understand since they were born

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.880
in the late 90's right, they
don't understand why stewardesses

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.590
or [foreign language] were seen
as something exotic or desirable.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.130 position:56%
So for me the hardest part of
teaching this that I have to explain

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.920
to them that air travel used to be
seen as this pleasant luxury right

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.460
and that having sex workers look

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.170
like stewardesses actually
lent a very cosmopolitan

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.720
and sophisticated air to
what is really a very sordid

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.610
and ancient commercial
enterprise okay.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:53.370
So Ilona in particular gleefully
exploits male gullibility.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.900
She spends a lot of time
fabricating these uniforms.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.370
She concocts exotic back stories
for these very average employees,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.960
they're all local girls,
but they pretend

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.910
to be from more exotic places.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.770
I mean everyone enjoys
playing a role

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.060
in some way I think we see some
echoes of Don Quixote here.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.900
So that's how Mutis
really highlights the folly

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.960
of male desires.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.660
Yet, I'd like to talk about one
more very serious similarity

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.660
to Cervantes in this novel.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.030
So one of Ilona and Maqroll's
employee named Larissa has gone

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.210
completely insane.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.730
She has been driven
mad by reading right.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.310
For several years prior

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.760
to her employment she
constantly read stories

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.830
about the Napoleonic era.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.230
And now in the novel she believes
that she is visited every night

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.840
by French and Italian soldiers
to whom she makes love.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.520
Now it is clear in the narrative

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.300
that these soldiers are
actually ghosts right

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.360
and that she is tormented
and she eventually --

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.890
well I won't spoil the ending
for you, but it doesn't end well.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.230
So in essence, she
has been driven mad

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.080
by literature just
like Don Quixote right.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.680
So Alonso Quijano before he's
Don Quixote, Alonso Quijano reads

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.880
so much that and I'm quoting
here from Edie's translation,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.810
his brains dried up and his
fantasy filled with everything

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.460
that he had read in his books.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.790
Now Mutis is clearly thinking of
Cervantes here in creating Larissa.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.810 position:56%
The similarities between Don Quixote

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.950
and Larissa are made even
more obvious by the fact

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:40.350
that Larissa lives on a
houseboat called El Lepanto right,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.720 position:56%
which recalls that same naval battle
where Cervantes lost his arm on.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.240 position:56%
Moreover, Maqroll is also a
quixotic figure because he too stays

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.670
up all night reading medieval
histories of French battles

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.520
and he declares that he
is and I quote living

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.790
in a time completely alien
to my interests and tastes.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:10.010
So for both Maqroll and Don Quixote
literature is more compelling

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.520
than reality okay.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.080
Now, I mentioned that both writers
exhibit a sense of disenchantment

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.590
with their current
societies, so that's sort

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.060
of the darker side of things here.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.230
For example, in Ilona arrives
with the rain Maqroll grows bored

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.920
of running the brothel when
he realizes that and I quote,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.220
prostitution is just as
conventional as marriage.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.780
This is again where my
students kind of explode

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.780
and they have a really hard
time discussing this okay.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.340
So why are they the same?

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.600
Maqroll says both are made
up of suffocating routines,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.010
trivial stories and
calculated meanness.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.160
Now I think that Maqroll has
become a beloved Latin American

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.460
literary figure.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.760
I can't tell you how many

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.750
of my scholarly friend sign
their e-mail signatures

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.840
with a Mutis quote right,
from some Maqroll story.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.100
Things just like-- mine
though does not prostitution

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.440
as conventional as marriage.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.960
I think my husband he would
probably try to translate that

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.790
and I don't think he'd
appreciate that very much.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.760
But this is why we love
Maqroll right, he rejects all

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.990
of the accepted morays, he
hates geographical fixity,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.050
he despises bourgeois mentality.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.370
So if we want to live like
Maqroll how we can avoid these

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.500
suffocating routines.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:40.220 position:56%
Mutis indicates Maqroll's refusal to
stay in one place and his rejection

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.020
of material goods frees him right.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.430
Just much like Don Quixote he's
able to travel as he pleases.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:53.020
Mutis' early poetry also shows the
same thirst for new experiences.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.680
So right now I'm going to read one

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.960
of his early prose
poems called Los viajes.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.400
I'm going to read it in Spanish
so you can hear the rhythms

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.500
and if you don't speak
Spanish you can think

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.600
about maybe learning while
I read this out loud.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:14.130
No, but really you can listen to
the rhythms of Mutis' poetry here.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.510
So [inaudible].

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:56.160
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.550
So you can hear there some

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:03.050 position:56%
of the same aquatic motifs I was
mentioning, but I think we also hear

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:08.370 position:56%
from this poem, which is from 1993
before Mutis went to prison or lived

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.610
in exile you can hear its
youthful excitement right.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.870
It's wonder at imaginary
and natural worlds there.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.800
It's also a meta-literary
poem because those of you

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.130 position:56%
who have studied French or Hispanic
literature know that it sounds a lot

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:30.540
like Charles Baudelaire Les Fleurs
du mal right, the flowers of evil.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.850 position:56%
There's a famous phrase one of those
poems that says go out in search

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:40.280
of the unknown right, it doesn't
matter if it's hell or heaven go

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.580
in search of the unknown.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:47.590
So I hear a strong echo of
that 19th century poet here.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.230
So in fact, I would say that
the inspiration for travel,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.140
for adventure, for Maqroll and also

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.810
for Don Quixote always
comes from reading right.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.880
There's a very close
relationship between the text

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.270
and the voyage here okay.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.090
So I'd like to mention one other
way in which Mutis pays homage

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.850
to Cervantes in some
meta-literary homage.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.710
In the Snow of the Admiral
or La Nieve del Almirante,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.830
which is the first in
the Maqroll series.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.730
Mutis eludes to Cervantes
in the very way

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.290
in which he structures
the narrative.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.530
So at the beginning of
the novel we're thinking

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:31.060
of La Nieve del Almirante a frame
narrator finds Maqroll's diary

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.770 position:56%
and it's written on scraps of paper.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.130
These old scraps of paper
have been tucked into a volume

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.140
of French history,
which the narrator finds

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.110
in an antiquarian bookstore
in Barcelona okay.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.360 position:56%
So this complicated narrative device
is called the found manuscript.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.930
And it echoes the way that
Cervantes frames the Quixote very

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.230
famously right.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.800
In the Quixote the narrator ends
up buying a part of the novel

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.430
that we read on, which is
actually been written in Arabic

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.140 position:56%
and we read it in translation right.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.250
And it's been written in Arabic
on the backs of old papers right,

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:13.010
in a particular neighborhood
in Toledo, in Spain.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.840
So again, we can see very clearly
that Mutis is making a reference

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.900
to Cervantes here in a
meta-literary beginning.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.950
And he does this because Mutis
like Cervantes wants to say

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.100
that his tale is as much about
literature itself as it is

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.180
about the idea of travel
right and adventure.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.370 position:56%
So to wrap up this portion I want to
say that both authors are fascinated

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:44.550
by that active storytelling
because it shows off the capacity

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:49.280
of literature to transport
and transform us right.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.000
Transform the authors,
the protagonists

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.520
and the readers altogether.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.710
So reading is a transformative
experience.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.940 position:56%
So let's return now to that sense of
disenchantment or [foreign language]

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.300
that I mentioned earlier.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.650
Both Maqroll and Don Quixote
would rather live in literature

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.310
than in their contemporary
reality and some

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.720
of us may feel the same way.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.550
As a result, when the literary
characters are confronted

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.520
with this yawning chasm
between their literary reveries

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.280
and their quotidian realities
they become nostalgic

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.600
for an imagined past right.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.070
They're nostalgic not for
what they've lived before,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.610 position:56%
but what they have read about right,

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:39.440
they want to live in
a literary world.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.380
There's also a sense that both
authors think their protagonist's

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.910
best days are behind on.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.660
I think that may come
from the late time in life

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.270
in which both authors
wrote their works.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.530
So the second part of the Quixote,
which was published in 1615 right,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.750 position:56%
portrays Spain in [foreign language]
right, the decline of Spain

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.630
with a wasteful aristocracy
and a bureaucracy.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.530
And even right before he dies
Don Quixote comes to his senses

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.960
as Alonso Quijano and he suffers
an extreme form of disenchantment.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.070
He repudiates all of
his adventures okay.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.670
So he is disenchanted
with the notion

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.790
of performing great feats right
and it's a very sad ending.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.990
And the reader is also left with
that sense of disillusionment,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.700
with the Spanish Empire,
with adventure,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.120
with literature, and altogether.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.230
Now in a similar fashion
in the Snow of the Admiral,

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.850
La Nieve del Almirante
Maqroll is very skeptical

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.330
about the values of
the contemporary era.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.150
He decries and I quote, people
dedicated to working like mules

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:51.770
for that empty thing
they call progress.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:56.790
Most disheartening of all
Maqroll is an adventurer in an age

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.460
without new places
to discover right.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.060
When I think of Google Earth I
realize there are very few places

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.740
now that we can't just zoom in on
and get a close satellite photo of.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.040
So in the Snow of the Admiral the
mariner confesses and I quote,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.510 position:56%
a growing discouragement and lack of
interest in travel and life itself.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.210
I think this is why John Updike in
one of his excellent book reviews

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:26.280 position:56%
in the New Yorker wrote that Maqroll
was a latter-day Don Quixote.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.460
So Maqroll and Don
Quixote are both wanderers

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.210
who ultimately critique the
societies that they live in.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.400
Indeed Maqroll's disillusionment
is a very contemporary form

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.170
of Cervantian [foreign language]
and I think that is the hallmark

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.420
of Mutis' literary aesthetic
despite all the ridiculous folly

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.600
and adventures he has, you know,
at heart there is a very deep place

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.820
of sadness and disenchantment
there right.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.420
Ultimately, Don Quixote
and Maqroll are thwarted

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.940
in their attempts to travel.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.160
They don't accomplish
the great feats

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.180
of bravery that they set out to do.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.500
I think that each author depicts a
society, be it 17th-century Spain

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.930
or late 20th-century Latin America

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.140
in which great adventures
are impossible

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.970
and even ridiculous right.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.090
Don Quixote is literally loaded
onto a cart and driven home

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.510
at the end of part one right.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:26.590
Maqroll too repeatedly embarks and
adventures that lead to failure.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.820
When Maqroll is left penniless
and hopeless after one

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.510
of these adventures he
concludes and I quote,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.060
I spent my whole life setting
out on this kind of adventure

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.020
and finding the same
disillusionment at the end.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.100
Although I console myself with
the thought that the reward was

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.670
in the adventure itself and there's
no reason to search for anything

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.750
but the satisfaction of trying
every one of the world's roads.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.500
They all start looking
suspiciously alike.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.980
And yet they're worth
traveling if only

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.760
to stave off tedium
in our own death.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.090
So this is one of the
enduring values

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.270
in contemporary relevance
of Cervantes and Mutis.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:13.360 position:56%
They both recognize that travels and
readings just serve to distract us

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.930
from the inevitability of death.

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:20.900
In fact, many of Mutis' poems
confront the subject of death

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.170
and I'm going to conclude here
today by analyzing just one of them

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.900
as a way to remember
Mutis' passing in 2013.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.480
So we're going to look
at three lines

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.320 position:56%
from a poem called Poema de lastimas
a la muerte de Marcel Proust.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.120
So as the title suggests
the poem laments the death

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.930
of the French poet Proust,
the French novelist excuse me,

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:45.720
Marcel Proust who suffered
from asthma

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.930
and died of pneumonia in 1922.

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:53.490
This poem was written in the
Lecumberri prison in 1956

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:58.120
and Mutis is undoubtedly
contemplating his own demise

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.420
as well.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.510
Mutis describes Proust's last
asthmatic breath here when he says.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:14.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.330
So I am haunted by this image
here and I hope you are too

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.230
of the poet attempting to
free himself attempting,

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.510
attempting to breathe while
a gravestone is pressing

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.490
down on his chest right.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.260
So you have that connection
between asthma and the, you know,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.480
the proximity of death
symbolized by the grave.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.620
It's very powerful.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.330
Mutis further envisions death
for Proust as a nostalgic limbo

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.300
where his literary creations,
which he calls criaturas

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.950
or creatures here are
waiting for him.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.040
So here he says and
he's thinking of Proust,

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.510
but I think he's thinking
of himself here too.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:36:06.370
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:10.210
So we readers right are
left thinking of Maqroll

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:15.940
as the creature awaiting Mutis
on the shores of time right.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.920
Just like Proust created his
novelistic creations we also

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.640
have Mutis.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.560
The richness of Mutis' novelistic

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.010
and poetic worlds are our
consolation as readers right.

says of Proust we're devastated by.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:47.020
So Mutis' tribute to Proust I
think expresses what we as admirers

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.730
of his work now feel for
the Colombian author right.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:56.030

this writer's legacy lives on.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.860
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers: Thank you Tom.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.500
Tom was an excellent
reference librarian

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.290 position:56%
who helped while I was a Kluge
fellow here working on a book I have

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.450
in progress about the
Legend of El Dorado

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.700
in contemporary Latin America.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.880
And as a matter of fact, Mutis is
one of the authors that I study

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.020
in my book project
called Morning El Dorado.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.690
Because in the Snow of the Admiral,
one of the novels I mentioned,

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:08.090 position:56%
Maqroll travels up a river in search
of a sawmill that he thinks is going

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.930
to make him a lot of money.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.930
But the interesting thing
about the sawmill is

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.850
that it is described
using language similar

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.880
to what the Spanish conquistador
several hundred years earlier used

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.540
to describe El Dorado.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.960 position:56%
So it has a golden halo, it glimmers
and shimmers in a distance, it hums,

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.730
and it's completely inaccessible
and he's never allowed in

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.710
and he's shipped off back downriver
without completing his quest right.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.270
So I think that there are
echoes there of Cervantes,

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:43.120
but also of the notion of the
search for a terrestrial paradise,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.110
a more general idea of
utopia or that no place

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.700
where perfection exists kind
of in Thomas Moore's idea.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.590
So yes, Mutis in La Nieve
del Almirante is just one

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.750
of those unsuccessful quests where
we also see the notion of the quest

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.620
for El Dorado as a failure.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.080

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.360
Yeah, no I think you're touching
on some important points,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.090
especially the universality
of the human --

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:39.740
the idea of the quest right that
we see in all different kinds

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.420
of literature from the
Odyssey up into, you know,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.890
Mutis I would say is a very
post-modern look at the quest.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:52.390
And many critics also read Mutis as
an existential hero in many ways.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:57.450
There's one point in Ilona Llega
Con La Lluvia and Ilona comes

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:03.180
with the rain where Ilona looks
at Maqroll and says to him

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.320
in French [foreign language]
right, which the die has cast.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.230
Which is also the title of a very
famous play by John Paul Sartre.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.330
So I have seen some great
student papers comparing Maqroll

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:17.030
to Sisyphus right and the idea
of that existential crisis

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.250
of even though that we
know that we're all going

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:24.280
to die how are we going to
make our lives meaningful right

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.620
and how are we going to
continue in that struggle.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.940
And I think that's why
Maqroll continues his journeys.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.660
And it's knowing that --
he has a line about knowing

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.350
that no matter what happens you're
always going to accept your destiny

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.360
and make something of it,
you know, while you're going.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.470
And so I think that for
Maqroll and I think for Mutis

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.900
in some ways living well was
part of that resistance to death.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.880
I was talking with Edith Grossman,
his translator, who knew him well

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.840 position:56%
and said that he always had the best
food, the best liquor, you know,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.960
he would have these
long literary evenings

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.250
in Mexico City with Garcia Marquez.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.820
So I think that, especially
for someone who has suffered

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.700
in prison or, you know,

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.360
has confronted political
exile I think the notion

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.630
of living well is a
form of resisting death.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.630
So that's what I would
certainly take from Alvaro.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.010

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.610
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.830
&gt;&gt; So I'm curious about this
relationship that Mutis had

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.930
with water [inaudible] such a,
you know, [inaudible] rivers

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.780
and the two oceans [inaudible].

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:38.000
Where in Columbia, where did
he travel around the country

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.360
and if this encounter with
so much water [inaudible].

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:48.990
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers: Yeah,
I think that we see water

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.520 position:56%
in several different ways, you
know, both with the sea and Maqroll,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.180
but also in particular with the
rain that we hard in Nocturno

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.480
and especially the rain

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.750
on the [foreign language],
on the coffee plants.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.310
Which I think that because
Mutis grew up in his early years

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:08.090 position:56%
in Brussels because his father was a
diplomat I think there was something

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.280
about a rediscovery
of the Colombian earth

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.110
and the Colombian waterways
in particular.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.130
For example in La Nieve
del Almirante,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.120
in the Snow of the
Admiral, Maqroll travels

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.260
up a fictional river
called the [inaudible],

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.260
but there's a very well-known Mutis
scholar named Consuelo Hernandez

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.950
who is at American
University who has identified,

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.750
you know, which river that is.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.780
But I don't think it's a
particularly Colombian motif

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.580
and that's because Mutis traveled
-- I think he traveled, you know,

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.200
30 or 40 weeks a year when he
was working in public relations

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.880
and so he has written
about the Baltic Sea.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.900
And he has written about Trieste,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.560
he's written about the
Mediterranean, you know,

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.670
I think that he's a writer you
have to read with a map in hand.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.280
And so the aquatic
metaphor comes up not just

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.510 position:56%
in Columbia, but all over the place.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.220
Although, I think the most
interesting thing about Maqroll,

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.250
however, is that all of his
adventures happen on land.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:12.410 position:56%
You know, because he remembers times
being at sea, but if you're going

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.450
to have adventures he
attempts to be more earthbound.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.710
And that's what he's
looking to escape right,

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.030
to get back on the river.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.540
So that's a great question though
I would love to see more written

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.210
about water in the Maqroll series.

&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers: Right.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:54.270
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible], so I was
wondering these critiques

about novels [inaudible].

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:05.760
How do their historic contexts
[inaudible] use the word postmodern

How are their historical
contexts [inaudible]?

&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers:
Yeah, thank you very much.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.240
Ryan is an excellent
scholar of Mutis as well.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.720
So I would actually love to hear
him answer the question too,

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.250
but I'll go first.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:31.790
So in all the different
critiques and analyses of Mutis

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:33.420
that I've seen there is a divide.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.600
Some people really see him
as a pre-modern hero right,

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.900
especially when he says he lives

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:46.100
in a time that's [foreign language]
right, which is alien to him.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.780
So some people see him

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.520
as a pre-modern old-school
hero in that sense.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.820
I totally disagree.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.270
Actually, I do think
that he is postmodern,

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.470
especially because if we look
at like Francois Leotard's idea

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:07.080
of being disenchanted
with the material

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.730
and economic gains of modernism.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.100
That didn't happen right
much of Latin America.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.900
And so I think Maqroll and sorry,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:19.290
Mutis shows through Maqroll a
deep sense of disenchantment

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:23.770
with people working
like mules right,

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:25.490
for that thing that
they call progress.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.710
So I see in a very Latin
American context a disenchantment

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.440
with the idea of [foreign
language] as Brazil says right,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.920
the idea that that's
just not happening.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.370
Now Mutis is not unique in that
sense, I think he's writing

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:43.770
in a long tradition of critiquing
with failed promises of modernity.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.810
With Cervantes I think
that the context is

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.320
of course, very different.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.900
I think that Cervantes --
most people see Cervantes,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.810
especially the second
half of Don Quixote

00:48:53.810 --> 00:49:00.270
as critiquing the bureaucracy
and aristocracy in Spain.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.600
Spain was deeply in debt
to other European countries

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.020 position:56%
and there was the sense that the
country was running into the ground.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:12.760
Now I think that that may be an
easy reading in hindsight to make

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.430
and I don't know if that was
really what Cervantes was feeling

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.730
at the time.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.260
But I mean I think all great
authors critique the moments

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.560
that they live in right.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.600
I have a hard time thinking of
any author who doesn't right,

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.090
whose work we still read today.

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:30.230
I mean Voltaire does the same
thing for France, you know,

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:34.560 position:56%
has a similar quest narrative there.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.710
So I think that we can paint with a
broad brush in saying that there's

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.970
that sense of disenchantment, but
I agree that it's good to look

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:48.460
at their specific historical
consequences and circumstances.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.540
So do you want to -- do you have an
answer for your own question there?

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.340
What do you think?

00:49:54.340 --> 00:50:00.050
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.030
Oh he's famous for
doing that I know.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.340
Right.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.470
&gt;&gt; And so just kind of curious

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:11.280
about how he goes back a period
long before Cervantes himself,

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.580
that's his own [inaudible].

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:20.480
But it seems like the novels
are very much about [inaudible].

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:28.770
And it's interesting to think about
the idea of the nation as Mutis

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:33.810
as well because there
really isn't [inaudible].

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.640
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers:
No, no it's okay.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:46.720
I do think that Mutis is
famous for proclaiming himself

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.920
to be monarchist whenever
he's asked about politics.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:55.560
And I think that idea comes
from his [foreign language] idea

00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.100
like that's why he says that
marriage is or prostitution is just

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.930
as conventional as marriage right,
he wants to shock people and go

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:06.030
against their accepted
idea of what's going on.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.880
I think he also wants to avoid
talking about politics there,

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.450
especially living in
exile in Mexico City.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:17.510
I think he also wants to
echo Maqroll who for him was

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.860
like another person in his life
when he says that he's living

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.030
in a time that's alien
to his interest.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.980 position:56%
I think that's a crystallization and
perhaps exaggeration of that idea.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.730
So yeah, I mean Maqroll himself
is certainly against the notion

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.880
of power dominating him right,
he wants to be a communist.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.550
But yeah, it's a good quote.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.540
So thank you.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:47.430
&gt;&gt; I just want to say [inaudible]
make sure you're holding

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:48.730
on cocktail.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.140
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers: Okay,
thank you very much Tom.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.940
&gt;&gt; It's quite the academic
[inaudible] too.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.240
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers:
Yes, I'll be sure --

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.230
well I don't know about that,
but thank you very much.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.400
&gt;&gt; Last question.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.730
&gt;&gt; What was his personal life like?

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.030
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Rogers:
Well, I mean I know

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.610
that he was married
and had children.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.770
I know that he worked for
his entire life in publicity

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.070
and that was why -- one

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:16.850
of the reasons why he
traveled around so much.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.570
And I think that is an
important part of his literature.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:25.270
But he's also unlike a lot of
the very famous boom writers

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.230
who are able to make a living
off of their writings right.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.460
Like I said, Mutis didn't retire
until he was in his 60's and that's

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.760
when he wrote his novels.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.680
He had been famous for being a
poet before, but he had a 9 to 5

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.030
or more just like a lot of us.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.810
So I think that's an inspiring
biographical detail, you know,

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.520
that we should all keep
working on our novels

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.700
and poetry in our off hours.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.200
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] thanking Charlotte
for this wonderful lecture.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.510

you, thank you all for coming.
