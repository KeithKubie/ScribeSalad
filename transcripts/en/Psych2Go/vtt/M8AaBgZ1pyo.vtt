Watch the video to the end for books that we recommend

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.935
As creatures of habit, what we do becomes

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.715
the embodiment's of who we are. It's misleading

00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:28.995
to think that every success story blossoms from talent.

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.825
Although talent is a necessary component,

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:34.615
it only makes up a small portion of what is required.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:37.205
So what does the rest of success entail?

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.755
Here are 5 habits of highly successful people

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:43.995
1. They are self-disciplined and commit to their

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.305
goals.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:48.305
Successful people don't rely on instant gratification.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:51.315
They understand the importance of sticking to their goals if they want to

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.315
accomplish them.

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.745
Discipline is practiced on a daily basis,

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:58.205
so setting healthy boundaries is a habit commonly exercised.

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:01.255
It's not about being rigid or inflexible.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:04.205
Instead, discipline means learning not to waste your time

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:07.145
and motivating yourself to keep going, even if the journey

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:08.975
isn't fun at times

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:11.955
Successful people adapt to the healthy mindset that downfalls and

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.975
fulfilling undesirable tasks are only temporary

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:17.875
They know that in the long run it'll all be worth it

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.815
2 They focus on the big picture

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.235
and take small steps every day to paint it

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:26.775
It's a common misconception to think that you have to plan big

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:28.695
in order to succeed

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:30.795
In reality big projects are accomplished from taking

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:32.845
small strides every day

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.645
Successful people know how to pace themselves

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.735
and learn not to be misguided by the frustrations they face

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.365
On details that won't matter 10 years from now

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:43.285
If you want to be successful

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.235
always take time to reflect and

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.095
focus on why you're doing  this will help you hold

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:48.635
on to your sense

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:51.355
of purpose if at any point you begin to feel lost or

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:52.355
unmotivated

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.125
3 They are patient and flexible with their plans of action

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:59.500
Successful people understand that it's not always about work

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.485
Sometimes it's about making time to unwind and

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:04.595
relax. Strive for that

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.835
balance between life and work to ensure you're also having fun

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:10.845
This prevents you from feeling burnt out and you'll be ready to

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:13.395
tackle your challenges for the next day again.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.815
It's a common misconception to think that the more you work

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:17.495
The more you'll be ahead of the game

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:19.655
When you work yourself into a state of exhaustion

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:22.215
You put yourself in an unproductive, miserable mood

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:24.675
that can cause you to create your worst quality of work.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:27.955
4 They practice resilience and view their

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.895
bad days as learning experiences. It's easy to

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.775
get bogged down when something isn't going right but resilience is key

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:35.785
if you want to keep going

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:38.595
Famous people might make their success look easy when you see them in

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.635
polished suits smiling for the camera

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:43.005
But there's no such thing as overnight success

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.855
They had to fail many times before being recognized

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:48.075
for their hard work. Sacrifices were made

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:50.985
and many nights of uncertainty, doubt, and insecurity were

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.985
experienced, but one common habit all successful people

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:56.665
practice is resilience. Learn to

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:59.485
reflect on your bad days and find value in them. Growth doesn't

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.225
happen during the good moments. Instead it comes

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.435
from experiences of finding the calm within the storm.

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:09.695
5 They are not afraid to carve a path of their own

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:13.205
Successful people don't always stick to the status quo

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:16.065
and are great strategists when it comes to achieving their dreams.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.235
They don't necessarily follow someone else's footsteps and

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:22.255
make their own rules if they have to. When you want to succeed it's

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:25.605
important to remember that staring over can be beneficial in the long run

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.395
It may seem daunting at first to abandon months or even

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.645
years worth of effort, but if your system isn't helping you grow

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.785
then it's probably a good idea to invest your time in another plan.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.435
There's a difference between something that will eventually work and something

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:39.985
that's bound to never work

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.665
Use your judgement wisely and strategize effectively.

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:47.205
What habits do you have to help you succeed in life?

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:49.095
Please share your thoughts with us below.

00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:02.245
Nowadays, it's so hard to find time in our

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:04.275
busy lives to take a moment to sit

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:07.305
to learn something new or something we are curious about

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:10.235
Most people enjoy reading, but struggle in finding the time

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.945
to do so. But with the help of blinkist

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:16.175
you can change that entirely. Blinkist is an app

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:18.985
that takes the most important and useful information

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:21.465
from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:24.495
it down in 15 minutes, in which you have the choice to read

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:26.655
or listen to at any time

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:31.065
Currently, there are 8 million users using Blinkist

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.975
that are actively exposed to a great selection of topics

00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:36.735
ranging from self-help, business, health

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.675
and even history books. I've used Blinkist

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.215
during my commute to work and love it because

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:45.085
everything you need to know about something is available in less than

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.175
15 minutes. I've listened to "The Power of Habits"

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.935
by Charles Duhigg and "The Seven Habits of  Highly Effective

00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:54.005
People" by Steven Covey. I highly recommend

00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:57.025
you sign up. The first 100 people to go to

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.145
