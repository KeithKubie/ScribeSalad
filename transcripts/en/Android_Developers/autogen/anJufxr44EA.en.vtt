00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.440
 [Funny Music] 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.640
 Abdul Rahman Al Sayed: We established this company 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.320
 In 2012. 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.760
 Then, if you want to read Arabic news on mobile 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.360
 It was very confusing. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.800
 We decided to solve this problem 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.480
 Create a custom Arabic news reader application 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.520
 He can collect all the news 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.160
 And submit them to the right person 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 Depending on the person's preferences and location. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.640
 Abdullah Al Sayed: Android has a majority 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.120
 Market share of smartphones in the Middle East 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.360
 So we realized that deploying the Nabd application "pulse" on Android 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.800
 Was a key factor for our success. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 Since we launched the Nabd application "Pulse" on Google Play 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.200
 We noticed widespread application spread in a very short time. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.000
 Currently, 60% of users use the primary Android system. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.440
 The number of daily installs for our Android app has increased 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.000
 As compared to other basic systems. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 The rate of user interaction with the application of Nabd "pulse" has increased significantly. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.600
 Users can share news and add it to favorites 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.040
 Or comment on them from within the Nabd Forum "Pulse". 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.240
 Every three months, more than 7 million stories are available 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.560
 Shared across social networks 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680
 Through Android users and we discovered that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040
 The average number of stories shared per user 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.480
 20% higher on Android compared to other platforms. 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 One reason for increased interaction on Android is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.000
 Apply what is known as "multidimensional design". 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 When the multidimensional design was announced 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.960
 We were impressed by the new visual style 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.120
 And the possibilities offered by this design. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.040
 It took us three months to redesign the entire application 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.840
 Moving to a three-dimensional design. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.120
 One major change is the new version 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.520
 In adding formatting to multidimensional design tabs. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.760
 A section has also been moved from the side menu 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.920
 To format the tabs we discovered that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 Number of users who have discovered 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.280
 This section doubled by 400%. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 After the redesign of the application 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 We've used our store listing experiments 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.120
 To discover the best screenshots 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.560
 The best order for screen shots 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.960
 So that the largest number of application installations are acquired. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.680
 We also found that there was a video in the app install card 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.360
 The number of conversions increases by 8%. 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.320
 Multidimensional design has a great impact 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.720
 In user behavior. 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.240
 For us, the happiest thing is knowing 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.800
 Five-star ratings have tripled 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.600
 After the new version. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.960
 We constantly use Google Analytics to identify 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.000
 Behavior of users and how they interact with the application 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 Based on our analysis, we improve application design 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 For best results. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.240
 Abdul Rahman Al-Sayed: Three years ago, 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.640
 There was no application named Nabd "Pulse". 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.560
 Today, we have more than 25 people across 4 offices 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.440
 In Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Egypt 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 And very soon in Turkey. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 This is great. 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.360
 I feel the joy and enthusiasm I can not really describe.
