00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.210
A relatively recent addition to
the set of copyrightable works

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.110
consists of fictional characters.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.990
A character described in
a larger fictional work,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.390
such as a novel or a movie, now enjoys
copyright protection independent

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.820
of the work in which he or she appears.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.330
The primary practical
implication of this principle

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.990
is that no one without permission may
write a sequel to a fictional narrative

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.730
that includes one or more
of the characters who

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.810
appeared in the original.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.220
To be sure, not all fictional
characters get this protection.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.170
To qualify, a character
must be important.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.970
US courts have articulated
two different tests

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.100
for determining which
characters are shielded.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.110
The first test, commonly
known as the Sam Spade Test,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.120
was announced long ago by the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.730
To be protectable under this
approach, a character must,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.107
"constitute the story being told."

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.690
The facts of the case that
prompted the Ninth Circuit to adopt

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
this restrictive approach were
as follows-- Dashiell Hammett,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.080
the author of the classic
detective story, The Maltese Falcon

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.870
assigned the copyright in
the story to Warner Brothers,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.900
which made a film based on the book.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Subsequently, Hammett granted the
copyright to the Sam Spade character,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.910
older than his incarnation
in The Maltese Falcon to CBS.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.470
Warner Brothers brought suit,
contending that Sam Spade already

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.340
belonged to Warner Brothers.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.060
The Ninth Circuit eventually
rejected this argument,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.530
announcing the Story Being
Told Test and suggesting

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.300
that Sam Spade did not satisfy it.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.010
So that's the first approach.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.560
The Ninth Circuit has never
expressly repudiated it, however,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.009
in several recent opinions,
the court has implicitly

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.500
distanced itself from
that approach, moving

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.640
toward the rule applied in all
other US jurisdictions, which

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.660
is simpler and more lenient.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.480
Under the second approach a character
is protected under copyright law

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.120
so long as he or she is well delineated.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.420
Here's a relatively
recent controversy that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.050
suggests the scope of this doctrine.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190
Sylvester Stallone,
as you probably know,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.380
wrote the scripts for each of
the first three Rocky movies.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.360
He then also played the role of
the title character, Rocky Balboa.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.660
In each of the three
movies, Rocky is depicted

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.830
as an under appreciated,
sullen, but heroic boxer.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.950
In 1982, Stallone and
MGM were considering

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.860
producing yet another,
fourth, movie in the series.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.650
An unaffiliated author by
the name of Timothy Anderson

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.640
wrote a script for such a fourth movie.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.430
The central figure in the
script was, of course, Rocky.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.870
This time, Rocky is depicted
as fighting a Russian boxer

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.380
in a contest with strong
nationalist overtones.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.740
MGM apparently seriously
considered using Anderson's script,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.910
but eventually decided not to do so.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.390
When MGM and Stallone eventually
produced their own version

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.700
of Rocky IV in which Rocky is
depicted as fighting a Russian,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.210
Anderson brought suit, contending
that his copyright in his script

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.860
was infringed by the MGM Rocky IV movie.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.620
The district court rejected
Anderson's argument

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.030
on several grounds, one of which
is central to the issue before us.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.270
In the court's judgment,
the character of Rocky

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.480
clearly satisfied both the old Sam Spade
Test and the modern Well Delineated

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.920
test.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.390
Indeed, in the court's
judgment, this was obvious.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.420
The Rocky character,
"has become identified,"

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.840
says the court, "with
specific character traits

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.430
ranging from his speaking mannerisms
to his physical characteristics."

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.080
Presumably, the court is here referring
to Stallone's famous physique, which

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.030
is more or less the same
in all four of the movies.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.160
Anderson's script,
the court pointed out,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.230
appropriated the character
of Rocky without permission.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.170
Indeed, says the judge, the
character was "lifted lock, stock,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.360
and barrel from the prior Rocky movies."

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.740
As a result, Anderson's
script constituted

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.830
an infringing derivative work.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.890
In US copyright law,
infringing derivative works

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.530
are denied copyright
protection, at least

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.100
if the material taken
from the plaintiff's work

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.780
pervades the infringing derivative.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.090
The net result was that even if
the MGM Rocky IV movie closely

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.680
tracked Anderson's
script, Anderson could not

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.370
prevail because his script was
tainted by its unauthorized inclusion

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.470
of the copyrighted
character, Rocky, and thus

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.185
did not, itself, enjoy
copyright protection.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.650
Application of these principles is
reasonably straightforward in cases

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.670
like Anderson's in which the character
at issue is stable and well-etched,

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.090
and in which the defendant
appropriates that character verbatim.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.260
But many monitor modern
controversies don't fit this pattern.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.310
For example, some of the most
famous fictional characters

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.010
evolve over the course of
their commercial careers.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.040
An important example would
be Superman, whose depiction

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.150
in the original comic
books changes as he becomes

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.080
more popular, as the narrative
associated with his character shifts,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.960
and finally, when he becomes
associated in the minds of the public

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.200
at large with the face and
body of Christopher Reeve.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.420
Which, if any of the
Superman incarnations,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.430
thus enjoys copyright protection?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.250
Difficult to say.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.230
Here's another complicating
factor-- it's sometimes

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.270
said that a fictional character
is more likely to enjoy protection

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.410
if he or she is presented visually-- as
in a comic book or movie-- than if he

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.290
or she is described in prose.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.680
But this advantage could
become a disadvantage

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.100
if more than one actor plays
the part of the character,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.000
thereby blurring the
character's characteristics.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.480
The premier example is
James Bond, who has now

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.730
been presented by six different actors.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.420
Tuxedos and a British
accent can only go so far

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.220
in obscuring the differences
among these depictions.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.410
In circumstances of these two sorts,
in which the character changes

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.140
significantly over time, or in
which the character is associated

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.420
with several different actors, does the
character forfeit copyright protection?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.080
Typically, no.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.630
Modern courts are quite forgiving
of indeterminacy of these sorts.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.490
Pretty much the only
kind of character who

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.660
will fail to qualify
for copyright protection

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.600
nowadays is a lightly sketched,
so-called stock character.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.330
In other words, a simple
or familiar stereotype.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.430
This exclusion, you
will probably notice,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.450
is a cousin of the Scenes
A Faire doctrine, which

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.140
we discussed in lecture
number one, which

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.440
denies copyright protection
to an image or scene that

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.745
has become standard in a genre.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.870
This exclusion doesn't
much matter, however,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.285
because there's usually not much point
in appropriating stock characters.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.840
So to return to the main line, a crucial
implication of the protectability

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.190
of fictional characters
is that almost all fan

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.660
fiction, which is increasingly common
nowadays, is legally problematic.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.355
Now, I hasten to add that fan
fiction may escape liability

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.980
under one of the affirmative
defenses to copyright infringement

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.940
that we'll discuss in detail
in lecture number nine.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.740
But the fact that fan
fiction almost always

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.710
lifts one or more character from a
famous work creates a legal risk.
