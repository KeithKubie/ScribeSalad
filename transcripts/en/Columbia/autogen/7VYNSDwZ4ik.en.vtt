00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540
that was the first idea and then he did
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.220
that was the first idea and then he did
you kill no I did not I guess it was not

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230
you kill no I did not I guess it was not
 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.220
you kill no I did not I guess it was not
sexy

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230

it was not really not fun you know and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070
it was not really not fun you know and
 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.240
it was not really not fun you know and
and so I guess he's reliable

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250
and so I guess he's reliable
 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.130
and so I guess he's reliable
so he told me he told me I think when I

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140
so he told me he told me I think when I
 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.660
so he told me he told me I think when I
say that because he actually he was

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670
say that because he actually he was
 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.310
say that because he actually he was
actually the one who coined the phrase

limo initials because who wanted to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
limo initials because who wanted to
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.690
limo initials because who wanted to
entitle a lot of these shows but the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700
entitle a lot of these shows but the
 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.470
entitle a lot of these shows but the
order of things which is a

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480
order of things which is a
 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.960
order of things which is a
mistranslation but it was not possible

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970
mistranslation but it was not possible
 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.720
mistranslation but it was not possible
for juridical reason and nobody shows

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730
for juridical reason and nobody shows
 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:15.580

was a novel so we had to coin another

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590
 
 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.950
 
and so I said what would be greatly that

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960
and so I said what would be greatly that
 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.620
and so I said what would be greatly that
you have way ash in the title and I said

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
you have way ash in the title and I said
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.740
you have way ash in the title and I said
well why ash the thing is one of the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750
well why ash the thing is one of the
 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.940
well why ash the thing is one of the
claims of the book is that there is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950
claims of the book is that there is
 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.470
claims of the book is that there is
discontinuity between traditional

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480
discontinuity between traditional
 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.340
discontinuity between traditional
writing and anthropology so if Y as in

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350
writing and anthropology so if Y as in
 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.230
writing and anthropology so if Y as in
the book then it has to be you know sort

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240
the book then it has to be you know sort
 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.770
the book then it has to be you know sort
of critical way only just to be denied

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780
of critical way only just to be denied
 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.050
of critical way only just to be denied
so I don't want to call it that founded

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060
so I don't want to call it that founded
 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.780
so I don't want to call it that founded
well yeah and maybe she's still an

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790
well yeah and maybe she's still an
 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.219
well yeah and maybe she's still an
illusion to leave the school because at

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229
illusion to leave the school because at
 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.750
illusion to leave the school because at
the end of it you have this famous

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760
the end of it you have this famous
 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:06:05.960
the end of it you have this famous
summation and you solutions so

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970
 
 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.150
 
and you insist in the book on the fact

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160
and you insist in the book on the fact
 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.730
and you insist in the book on the fact
that the division between these two

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740
that the division between these two
 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.080
that the division between these two
books and the way that they are

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090
books and the way that they are
 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.720
books and the way that they are
configured is not always the same for

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730
configured is not always the same for
 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.100
configured is not always the same for
you death the different authors that

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110
you death the different authors that
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.960
you death the different authors that
you're looking at and that the function

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970
you're looking at and that the function
 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.060
you're looking at and that the function
of the second book is not always the

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070
of the second book is not always the
 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.670
of the second book is not always the
same you want

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680
same you want
 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.760
same you want
yeah yes this is something important

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770
yeah yes this is something important
 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.600
yeah yes this is something important
because I mean first of all the

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610
because I mean first of all the
 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.779
because I mean first of all the
treasurer of the per second book fairies

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789
treasurer of the per second book fairies
 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.680
treasurer of the per second book fairies
I mean it can be any more big it can be

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690
I mean it can be any more big it can be
 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.180
I mean it can be any more big it can be
some sort of surrealistic the I really

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190
some sort of surrealistic the I really
 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.480
some sort of surrealistic the I really
like lastly contour it can be very

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490
like lastly contour it can be very
 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.640
like lastly contour it can be very
conventional traveler like Mexico

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650
conventional traveler like Mexico
 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.400
conventional traveler like Mexico
yeah my sister it can be very fun to

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410
yeah my sister it can be very fun to
 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:07:01.950
yeah my sister it can be very fun to
chronicle so the second book are not all

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960
chronicle so the second book are not all
 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.800
chronicle so the second book are not all
similar and but all of them I still

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810
similar and but all of them I still
 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.659
similar and but all of them I still
explicitly connected to the scientific

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669
explicitly connected to the scientific
 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.810
explicitly connected to the scientific
counterpart and I think it's important

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820
counterpart and I think it's important
 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.879
counterpart and I think it's important
because it's you know all those pairs

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889
because it's you know all those pairs
 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.110
because it's you know all those pairs
don't line up together and it's

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120
don't line up together and it's
 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.210
don't line up together and it's
important because it prevents from

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220
important because it prevents from
 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.670
important because it prevents from
reducing the relationship between the

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680
reducing the relationship between the
 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.610
reducing the relationship between the
two books to usual divide the objective

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620
two books to usual divide the objective
 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.260
two books to usual divide the objective
on the one hand the subjective on the

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270
on the one hand the subjective on the
 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.450
on the one hand the subjective on the
other hand narration on the one hand

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460
other hand narration on the one hand
 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.500
other hand narration on the one hand
description on the other hand

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510
description on the other hand
 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.630
description on the other hand
explanation on the one hand

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:38.640
explanation on the one hand
 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.820
explanation on the one hand
interpretation so that's why it's really

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
interpretation so that's why it's really
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.750
interpretation so that's why it's really
I mean that's this is an important yeah

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:45.760
I mean that's this is an important yeah
 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.490
I mean that's this is an important yeah
an important point I want my mother to

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:47.500
an important point I want my mother to
 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.540
an important point I want my mother to
make and so it it shows that you need to

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.550
make and so it it shows that you need to
 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.500
make and so it it shows that you need to
really locate each of these fairs in a

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.510
really locate each of these fairs in a
 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.540
really locate each of these fairs in a
new geological context in a historical

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:00.550
new geological context in a historical
 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.610
new geological context in a historical
context and not take for granted any

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620
context and not take for granted any
 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.749
context and not take for granted any
given division between

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759
 
 

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.249
 
okay and that's actually precisely the

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259
okay and that's actually precisely the
 

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:11.510
okay and that's actually precisely the
next thing that I wanted to ask you

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520
next thing that I wanted to ask you
 

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.070
next thing that I wanted to ask you
about is the the review in the Moldavia

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080
about is the the review in the Moldavia
 

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.809
about is the the review in the Moldavia
emphasizes the ambitions of the project

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819
emphasizes the ambitions of the project
 

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:20.929
emphasizes the ambitions of the project
and part of the that the ambitious

00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:20.939
and part of the that the ambitious
 

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:23.029
and part of the that the ambitious
nature of the project is the general

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039
nature of the project is the general
 

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:25.129
nature of the project is the general
reflection that you start with about

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139
reflection that you start with about
 

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:27.350
reflection that you start with about
these big categories of science and

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360
these big categories of science and
 

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.149
these big categories of science and
literature and how they are configured

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159
literature and how they are configured
 

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:31.700
literature and how they are configured
at different periods in literary history

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:31.710
at different periods in literary history
 

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.319
at different periods in literary history
and in the history of science and so one

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:36.329
and in the history of science and so one
 

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:37.639
and in the history of science and so one
of the things that struck me in reading

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:37.649
of the things that struck me in reading
 

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.649
of the things that struck me in reading
the book is that

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:38.659
the book is that
 

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.779
the book is that
you say that in dealing with these

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:40.789
you say that in dealing with these
 

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.189
you say that in dealing with these
there's certain challenge methodological

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:42.199
there's certain challenge methodological
 

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:44.170
there's certain challenge methodological
challenges in dealing with these big

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.180
challenges in dealing with these big
 

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.509
challenges in dealing with these big
categories that are sort of historical

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519
categories that are sort of historical
 

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.030
categories that are sort of historical
historically changing categories and you

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040
historically changing categories and you
 

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.379
historically changing categories and you
say that you take a lesson from the

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:50.389
say that you take a lesson from the
 

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:52.840
say that you take a lesson from the
ethnographer himself I guess in most

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:52.850
ethnographer himself I guess in most
 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.960
ethnographer himself I guess in most
cases here to apply it to your own

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:55.970
cases here to apply it to your own

you want to tell us about about that and

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:01.490
you want to tell us about about that and
 

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.820
you want to tell us about about that and
perhaps reflect more generally

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:03.830
perhaps reflect more generally
 

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.340
perhaps reflect more generally
yeah well nudge where I just say that in

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.350
yeah well nudge where I just say that in
 

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.600
yeah well nudge where I just say that in
the beginning of the book that the

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:07.610
the beginning of the book that the
 

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.329
the beginning of the book that the
danger I talked about the Denver of the

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:10.339
danger I talked about the Denver of the
 

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:13.000
danger I talked about the Denver of the
projecting categories on the two books

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.010
projecting categories on the two books
 

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.960
projecting categories on the two books
and again we have nice trying to

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:16.970
and again we have nice trying to
 

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.560
and again we have nice trying to
