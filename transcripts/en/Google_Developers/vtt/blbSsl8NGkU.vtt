00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
Hello, everyone.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.070
I'm Shreyas Doshi.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.680
I'm a product manager
here at Google.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.160
And I work on various
parts of AdWords,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.910
including the AdWords API.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.270
So let's get started.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.220
Today, I want to basically
leave you with three key

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.810
messages with regards
to the AdWords API.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.400
The first one is that we've
actually been very busy since

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.880
we launched the AdWords API.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.540
But the key thing I wanted you
guys to walk away with, key

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.010
message, is that you need to
start taking advantage of

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.260
these new features.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.840
We've actually taken into
account a lot of your feedback

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.880
and incorporated that in these
new versions of the API.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.960
Second is that since we've
launched these versions of the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.600
API, it basically implies that
the old versions of the API

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.810
had to go away.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.630
And so there's a migration
coming up.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.390
For instance, we are going to
start sunsetting the remainder

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.350
of v13 and v200909 as these
new versions launch.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.960
And the third key message is
that, while we've improved the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310
API, we realize that there are
a lot of other problems that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.830
you face that aren't
yet addressed.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.150
So let's start with what's
new with the AdWords API.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.350
The first one is preferred
AdWords API pricing.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.520
So that is something we launched
for agencies and SEMs

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.350
in May of this year.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.100
Preferred pricing is a way in
which you can get basically

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.860
unlimited use of the API.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.100
So it's an application
process.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.320
You apply with us.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.990
And then as long as you meet
certain requirements, we will

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.790
basically give you unlimited
use of the API for free.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.640
Second one is v13 is gone.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.250
It's not really gone.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.980
It's almost gone.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.260
There are about three services
that remain.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.300
And so I will talk about what
we're going to do with those

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.790
three services.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.570
And the third is we've launched
v201003, as well as

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.810
v201008 more recently.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.830
And so let's look at the new
features that we've released

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.960
in these versions.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.450
So the first one, and the one
that I'm very excited about,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.640
is the ReportService.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.080
So this is the new version
of the ReportService.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.530
The key thing about this
version is that it's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.460
significantly faster than
the v13 ReportService.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.110
Because it's built on our new
architecture, it will enable

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.690
us to expose features much
faster, so expose new fields

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.920
much faster than we've done in
past versions of the API.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.250
Second one is these exciting ad
formats, product ads, which

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.840
is essentially product listing
ads and product extensions.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.120
And these are actually ads-- and
you see they have images

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.660
associated with those
products--

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.690
on Google Search.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.080
It's a compelling ad format,
and we launched support for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.150
this in v201008.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.780
Another feature is
remarketing.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.240
This is a very interesting
feature.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.990
And essentially, what it lets
you do is it lets people who

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.930
browsed your site, who probably
did not buy something

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.007
or basically end up in a
conversion event, it lets you

00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:22.676
target those users.

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:26.450
Because by definition they would
be more engaged and more

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.650
interested in your products.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.145
And so we've exposed a new
service called the

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:34.050
UserListService, which
essentially lets you target

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.770
users and converts browsers
and searchers

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.980
into buyers for you.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.720
Bid simulator is a feature which
we launched in v201003.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.310
And we also launched AdGroup,
a big simulator in v201008.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.300
And essentially, what that
lets you do, as the name

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.820
indicates, it lets you simulate
what your traffic

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.330
might have been for different
values of bids.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.660
Ad sitelinks.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.607
Sitelinks are another compelling
new ad format.

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:11.150
And they look a lot like
just general text ads.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.941
But what you see is they
actually have forward links at

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.920
the bottom of the ad.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.230
So what that lets you do is it
no longer limits you to the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.120
landing page or the home page
or whatever it is that you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.490
have in the destination URL.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.150
But you can actually take the
user to specific locations

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.320
within your web site and
hopefully get better

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.296
conversions that way.

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:36.530
This is a feature that a lot of
advertisers have been very

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.350
excited about.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.465
And it's also available
in the API.

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.330
Phone extensions.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.740
This is very relevant for, say,
the local use case where

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.260
a lot of times advertisers have
told us, look, a click on

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.150
my website or for my website
is interesting.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.750
But what I really care about
in some cases is

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.370
a call to my business.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.750
And so what this lets you do
is it lets you associate a

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.280
phone number with your
ad as an extension.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.390
And with that, you can actually
include that phone

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.500
number in the text ad.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.063
And it'll show up when the user
is using a hybrid mobile

00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:14.660
device like an iPhone,
for instance.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.370
There's a ton of other
new stuff.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.860
We've launched a new traffic
estimator service.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.700
There are a couple of other
things like enhanced CPC,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.150
target CPA.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.840
And all of the information about
this is available in the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.260
docs, of course, and
also on the blog.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.525
And then we have some
beta features that

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:35.230
we've launched recently.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.910
So one is AdWords Campaign
Experiments.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.640
This is a feature that
advertisers have been asking

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.530
for for a very long
time from AdWords.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.840
What it does is it lets you
run live A/B tests.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.440
Basically, instead of trying to
guess what would happen if

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.300
you set your bid to a certain
value, you can actually try it

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.920
as an A/B test and then see what
performs better and more

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.570
in concert with your
advertising goals.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.690
Change history.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.310
This is a feature which
basically lets you download

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.560
changes that happened to
specific accounts.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.210
And so in the past, you guys
have told us, look, every

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.770
night, I have this job
that downloads the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.170
entire campaign structure.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.750
And sometimes it's a waste
because maybe only a few

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.500
things in the campaign have
actually changed.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.580
We've heard that feedback
in the past.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.910
And we have been working on
exposing this service.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.450
What it does is it lets you
query within the API for

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.270
specific entities that
have changed.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.220
And so you can say, give me a
list of changes that have

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.560
happened since a particular date
or in this time range.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.920
And then it will give you the
IDs of those entities.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.100
And then you can only pull
those entities instead of

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.320
pulling your entire
account structure.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.900
And then the last beta feature
is a partial failures support.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:06.440
The idea is, let's say you
submit 1,000 operations to us.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.230
And 10 of them somehow fail
for one reason or another,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.590
maybe they violate
some policy rule.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.670
Instead of your entire call
failing, what this will do is

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.050
it will only fail the
faulty operations.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.220
So this is only exposed in
one service right now.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.225
But over time, we'll start
exposing it in

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:27.475
more and more services.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.090
So again, the key message that
I want to convey is that you

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.830
should start using and taking
advantage of these features as

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.680
soon as you can.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.440
So when you go back, I would
encourage you to talk to

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.890
various people in your
organization and get these

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.110
features on your roadmap so
you can take advantage of

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.060
better automation, more features
in the API, and more

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.310
efficiency.
