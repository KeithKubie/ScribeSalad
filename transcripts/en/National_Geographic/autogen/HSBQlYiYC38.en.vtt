the science which was actually the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

methodology should I say of science
which was shown in the documentary it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
which was shown in the documentary it
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.720
which was shown in the documentary it
was quite clear during the documentary

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
was quite clear during the documentary
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760
was quite clear during the documentary
that we were deeply frustrated that much

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
that we were deeply frustrated that much
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.110
that we were deeply frustrated that much
of the science that we were working

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
of the science that we were working
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.839
of the science that we were working
towards was tantalizing at our

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849
towards was tantalizing at our
 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.600
towards was tantalizing at our
fingertips and we hadn't quite lit the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
fingertips and we hadn't quite lit the
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.080
fingertips and we hadn't quite lit the
victory cigar however the science has

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
victory cigar however the science has
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.850
victory cigar however the science has
continued over the last few months

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
continued over the last few months
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.860
continued over the last few months
and I think it will continue probably

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
and I think it will continue probably
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.010
and I think it will continue probably
until I'm a very old man because this is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
until I'm a very old man because this is
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840
until I'm a very old man because this is
a fossil that's worthy of such study

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
a fossil that's worthy of such study
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.180
a fossil that's worthy of such study
because it is a remarkable mine of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
because it is a remarkable mine of
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.370
because it is a remarkable mine of
information and that is what I'm going

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
information and that is what I'm going
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.930
information and that is what I'm going
to take you on this journey this evening

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
to take you on this journey this evening
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550
to take you on this journey this evening
however painful it might be it's like

however painful it might be it's like
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.070
however painful it might be it's like
trauma counseling for me and you're

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
trauma counseling for me and you're
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.650
trauma counseling for me and you're
going to share this pain with me because

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
going to share this pain with me because
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.680

excavating it from underneath so we had
 

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.220
excavating it from underneath so we had
a much depth of sediment as possible but

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:49.769
organic acids probably freeing up a lot
 

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:51.019
organic acids probably freeing up a lot
of the chemicals which were sort of

which were being dissolved by weak acids
within the ground waters which suggests

00:20:57.139 --> 00:20:57.149
within the ground waters which suggests
 

00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:59.029
within the ground waters which suggests
we had a lot of plant material giving

00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039
we had a lot of plant material giving
 

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:01.460
we had a lot of plant material giving
these acids and so this environment is

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:01.470
these acids and so this environment is
 

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.289
these acids and so this environment is
probably not very far from what we were

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299
probably not very far from what we were

and cut right through the fossil itself

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:36.909
and cut right through the fossil itself
 

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.169

seeing in our model that's rather useful

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.050
seeing in our model that's rather useful
 

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.380
seeing in our model that's rather useful
so we decided to apply a model to

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.390
so we decided to apply a model to
 

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.540
so we decided to apply a model to
bipedal animals our early models were

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:37.550
bipedal animals our early models were
 

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.490
bipedal animals our early models were
very primitive and we used what we

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:39.500
very primitive and we used what we
 

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.230
very primitive and we used what we
called pointy soros it's quite

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240
called pointy soros it's quite
 

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.609

goes on and it's going to take several
 

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.290
goes on and it's going to take several
years to do that but what we have here

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:50.300
years to do that but what we have here
 

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.330
years to do that but what we have here
is probably one of the most accurate
