JONATHAN ALFERNESS: So anyway.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.951
Real quick, I'm John Alferness.

00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.860
I work here at Google, and
I've been here for a long time.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.750
But more excitingly is David
Lebovitz, whose here with us

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.369
today.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.160
I'm really fortunate
to be able to do this,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.410
because David's actually a
really good friend of mine.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.550
My wife and I have known
David since the early days

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.050
where my wife was
a food blogger.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.910
And David certainly, being one
of the most quintessential food

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.340
bloggers out there, is somebody
that we got to know early on.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.160
David, for those of
you who don't know,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.720
is just quite an
illuminary in this field.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.890
David worked at Chez
Panisse as the pastry chef

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.720
for about 13 years.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.340
He pivoted then
in the late '90s,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
I think roughly 1999, where
he started writing more,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.060
starting with blogs.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.880
And if you, I mean
I know for us,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.660
probably 1999 felt like
blogs were in full swing.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.910
But David was really one of the
first food bloggers out there,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.971
and remains one of the most
influential food bloggers

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:04.970
that we continue to see.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.340
Flood bloggers.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.830
David's written, I don't
know how many books.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.690
Probably more than
a half dozen or so.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.000
It's somewhere in
the back pamphlet

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.740
of this book, of which I've
used more than a couple

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.654
to actually bang out
some great recipes.

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:22.070
His ice cream book, if you
haven't bought it and tried it,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.060
kicks ass.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.780
It's really, really awesome.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.220
Anyway, David's now been living
in Paris for the last 10 years

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.690
or so.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.230
He does tours of Paris,
he's introduced us

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.680
to our favorite chocolates
here in all the world,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.360
and showed us your wonderful
shop, which unfortunately

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.087
had a big fire recently.

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:41.170
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Explosion.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.045
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Explosion, and then fire.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:44.910
But she's OK, Denise is OK.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.040
Anyway, David is
here with us today

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.167
to answer a few of my questions.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.500
But then more importantly,
answer all of your questions,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.670
probably ask you guys some
questions too about Google

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.990
and what we can do for David.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.330
But really, this is just
a huge pleasure for me

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.530
and I think for all of us.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.890
So let's take a quick
second to welcome David.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.210
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well, thanks.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.450
Everybody, I have
friends-- Cindy

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.340
over here, who tested
recipes for the books,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.097
works at Google for the book.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:16.680
But whenever I have
Google [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.167
they go oh, that's
not my category.

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.750
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
We're really going

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.041
to evading questions at Google.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.042
So we'll see how good you
are evading questions.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.416
DAVID LEBOVITZ: As a blogger,
I'm getting better at that.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:28.380
Actually, I need to get
some tips on that too.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.820
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: So let's
do the history little bit.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.570
I mean, Chez Panisse,
if you ask me,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.050
is one of, if not the most
quintessential California

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.490
restaurants.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.290
I think it really
changed the pace

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.310
of how Californians
think about food.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.534
And it just kind of keeps going.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.700
Anybody who's eaten there
over a long period of time

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.199
knows the consistency that's
there, and the qualities there.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.950
What was it like working as a
pastry chef at Chez Panisse?

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.200
I know you have all kinds
of great anecdotes to share.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.847
Maybe you could
just share a couple.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.930
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well, I
started there, actually it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.900
was right when California
cuisine was just taking off.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.030
And I was actually working
upstairs in the cafe.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.960
And nobody knew at the
time what radicchio

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.435
was, what goat cheese was.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:14.400
And people were coming
in and saying like oh,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.597
is it like tofu?

00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:16.930
I was like no, it's goat cheese.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.790
And they're like,
what's goat cheese?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.830
And people didn't know.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.589
And it's kind of funny
how it's evolved.

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.172
People used to ask us how we got
the oranges red, because they

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:25.950
were blood oranges.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.860
And it was kind of funny,
and it just kind of took off.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.835
And now radicchio
you take a flight,

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:33.210
or you go to
Disneyland, and they

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.900
have radicchio on the salad.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.680
And I just had lunch here,
if Chez Panisse didn't exist,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.980
you guys would probably all be
eating Egg McMuffin sandwiches

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.850
rather than all
the beautiful food.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.630
So I give Chez Panisse
a lot of credit,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.370
but it was a very
exciting time in America.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.950
Also coincidentally,
with the rise of Google

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.930
and technology, people being
much more aware of what they're

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.120
eating, what they're doing,
what they're thinking,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.995
what they're sharing.

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:00.590
And that was also the
birth of food blogs.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.680
When we all, I
started in 1999 when

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.240
the word "blog"
didn't even exist.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.730
And people thought I was crazy.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.060
My friends who wrote
books thought I was crazy.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.059
But getting back to the original
question of Chez Panisse,

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.600
it's actually been
really interesting

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.410
seeing how the Bay
Area once again,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.540
has been so innovative
in promoting food,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.260
promoting technology.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.969
But we sort of tend to make
it really useful and relevant.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.260
So instead of just being this
movement and for the sake

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.000
of having a food
movement, it was like no.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.208
This is about feeding people.

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.240
This is about having farms.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.820
I mean you think the idea of
having a farm outside of New

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.030
York City. is so crazy.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.430
But now it exists, and you
have this farmer's market

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.970
with all local produce.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.500
And you go to Safeway and
they have local Straus Milk

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.330
and stuff.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.210
And that's all really
pretty radical still.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.690
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.930
And recent.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.240
It works here in the Bay Area.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.375
We all kind of embrace it, but--

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:56.900
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Who'd
have thought it?

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.060
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: --it's
amazing how much it's spread,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.330
right?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.996
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
never would've thought

00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:03.030
that I'd have kale in my teeth.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.250
I'm like-- we used to eat
iceberg lettuce salad.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.560
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Just to
riff off that for a second,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.670
do you think California
and the Bay Area

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.930
continues to be one
of the main places

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.890
where food is sort of
innovated from like the quality

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.750
of ingredients, and
freshness, and organic,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.595
and everything else?

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:22.220
What do you see as you, I mean,
you get around the world a lot.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.600
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Right.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.430
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Do we have competition

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.730
that we should be worried about?

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.330
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
I don't think so.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.371
I think actually San
Francisco and the Bay Area's

00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.200
actually very conservative
in terms of food.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.672
People don't like trends here.

00:05:32.672 --> 00:05:34.130
I'm not going to
mention any names,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.717
but there's been a lot of
molecular gastronomy stuff.

00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:38.550
And the people have
come through and they've

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.620
sold out audiences in
theaters, and so forth.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.490
But nobody, if they had
opened restaurants here,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.800
nobody would have liked them.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.680
Because people really appreciate
very simple, basic food.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.130
Going through the
cafeteria here,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.750
everybody's eating
grilled asparagus.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.870
It's not fancy,
there's no foam on it,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.530
there's no, there's not turkey
and clam ice cream on the side.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.460
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: No
stir fried lamb brains,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.376
or anything like that.

00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:07.080
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's a
very conservative food

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.520
community here,
but in a good way.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.972
And I think it's really,
like you go to Zuni,

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:14.180
and you get a really good
hamburger or roast chicken.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.860
And you're making this face,
people think about that--

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.980
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Sorry, I love Zuni.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.730
But you know that.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.530
That's where we go.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.110
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah, you
think about that food,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.220
and you just go wow,
it's really good.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.720
And it doesn't need to be fancy.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.800
Just let the ingredients
speak for itself.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.290
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: It's one of
the reasons I love living here.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.980
DAVID LEBOVITZ: But quality
always speaks for itself.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.800
There's a lot of stuff out
there as everybody knows;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.130
you work for search
engine company.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.464
The good stuff rises to the top.

00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:38.754
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Well,
that's why Alice can get away

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:41.617
with serving a bowl of fruit as
her main dessert course, right?

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:43.450
Some of the best fruit
that you'll ever eat,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.570
but completely undressed,
completely naked.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.340
What was it that,
what was your pivot?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.290
What made you say well,
I'm an amazing pastry chef

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.770
and I love doing
this, but damn it.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.710
I want to write full time, and
I want to make this my career?

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.950
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I turned 40.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.200
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Ah, I see.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.540
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Restaurant
work is really hard.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.780
And during that whole
California cuisine movement,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.400
I guess it was the '80s, '90s.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.700
Everybody wanted to be a chef.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.180
And I still hear
that from people.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.720
When I worked in the kitchen
at Chez Panisse's, people

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.011
who are lawyers who used to
come in the kitchen and go,

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.092
I would love to do this.

00:07:12.092 --> 00:07:13.550
And you're like,
do you really want

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.440
to do this for minimum wage?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.450
And do you really want
to peel apples all day?

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.950
Yeah.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.430
Maybe have dinner parties and
subscribe to Martha Stewart,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.234
build a nice kitchen, and
we all live hand to mouth.

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:28.650
So there was a lot of people
who are getting into cooking,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.660
myself included at the time,
we worked really, really hard.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.330
Somebody recently
asked me on Twitter,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.084
how do I get to do what you do?

00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:37.000
I was like, you stand
at the back of a kitchen

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.780
and you roll dough for 30 years.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.310
But when I hit 40
I was like, what

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.720
am I going to do with
the rest of my life?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.550
I couldn't stand up all day.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.160
I was just tired.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.810
I was really, I'd done the
same thing over and over.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.030
And one thing, one
equality Americans

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.640
have that I've learned
from living in Europe,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.884
is we're really good at
reinventing ourselves.

00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:03.300
We're very good
at saying you know

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.070
what, I'm tired of
being an architect.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.760
I want to open a cupcake shop,
or let's start a search engine,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.390
I'm going to write a book.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.410
We do that, and we just
say I'm going to do it.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.770
And if it doesn't work, it's OK.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.080
But we're not
afraid to try stuff.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.670
So I just thought you know what?

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.890
It's time to turn the Etch a
Sketch over, give it a shake,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.970
and start again.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.630
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Is that what,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.510
was it sort of the break
in switching to writing

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.620
and your pseudo midlife crisis
that sent you to Paris as well,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.169
or was it-- I mean, I know
you've always loved Paris.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.799
And I'm not surprised
that you live there now.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.761
What brought you to Paris then?

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:40.260
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
don't really know.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.676
I didn't have
anything to do here.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:44.847
I'd lived in San Francisco
for 20 something years.

00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:45.930
I was like, you know what?

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.740
I want to go somewhere else.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.490
And I thought, well Paris--
I was never a francophile.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.760
I wasn't like oh my God, my
dream is to live in Paris.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.010
Audrey Hepburn.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.321
I just wanted to go, I thought
it'd be an interesting place.

00:08:59.321 --> 00:08:59.820
And it was.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.650
It's a really good
place to write,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.570
because nobody bothers you.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.690
People, you can stay in your
apartment for weeks and months,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.080
and nobody thinks that's weird.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.960
Cindy's laughing
because she lived there.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.140
And it's true.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.270
You could sit in
a cafe by yourself

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.540
and you're not distracted.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.300
And also for me, I
developed as a writer there.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.097
Because everything
I do there, if I

00:09:21.097 --> 00:09:23.430
go out and get a loaf of
bread, if I open my front door,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.670
there's material.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.430
There's a story.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.480
Everything I do, buying
shoelaces, getting

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.110
yelled at, buying
cheese, whatever.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.130
Coming up with a recipe.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.470
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: You've
shared a lot of those stories--

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.570
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Too much.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.320
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
--with me and my wife.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.630
I don't know that they're
all appropriate for a work

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.231
audience, but are there
a couple anecdotes

00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:43.980
that you can share
just to sort of comment

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.942
on the quirkiness
of living in Paris?

00:09:47.942 --> 00:09:49.650
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well,
it was interesting.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.090
I recently went
out to where they

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.690
harvest the salt off
the Atlantic coast.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.160
And if you look
at a map of France

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.010
from the air, Google Earth, you
can see all these salt marshes

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.250
that have been around
since Roman times.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.630
And the people hand harvest
this salt, and it's amazing.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.170
You go to a store here
and you buy, and it's $12.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.250
And we went there.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.708
We spent a weekend
because I wanted

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:11.380
to see the salt being harvested.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.390
And we're sitting in this
restaurant right on the coast.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.250
Beautiful salt marshes,
beautiful piles of salt

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.470
that they'd all faked.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.260
And on the table
is industrial salt.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.255
The worst salt in the world.

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.505
And I said to the waitress
I said, it's kind of funny.

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:27.762
It's right out, you have it.

00:10:27.762 --> 00:10:29.294
And they're like, oh.

00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:30.710
They just didn't
even notice that,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.090
because it didn't
even occur to them.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.850
So that kind of stuff, being
an outsider is actually funny.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.890
Because my partner's French,
and he's pretty funny.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.839
Have you met Roman?

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.880
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I've
heard a lot about Roman.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.254
I don't think
we've ever met, no.

00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:48.820
DAVID LEBOVITZ: And so
I get motivated by him.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.339
He thinks I'm funny
too, most of the time.

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:53.380
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: That's
good, because you are.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.790
The other one that
I'll throw out there,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.020
I don't know if David remembers.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.395
He'll remember the place that
we were eating at in Paris.

00:10:58.395 --> 00:11:01.160
But we get to, what was the
name of the restaurant, again?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.535
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
The black plates.

00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:05.515
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: We're going
to the ketchup on lobster.

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:06.390
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.790
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: So you're
going through an exquisite meal

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.910
in Paris, and David
and I will have

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.674
rack brains for the
name of the place.

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.340
But it was one of the
places on the list

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.150
that my wife knew that
she wanted to go to.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.691
And of course, you
meet up with David

00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:20.982
and you magically get
into these places.

00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:22.440
And we're working
through the meal.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.355
Really elegant, fancy, high end,
three star sort of French food.

00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:28.730
And we get to the
lobster course.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.730
And everybody's excited
about the lobster course

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.380
because the three
of us love lobster.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.270
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Lobster's
very expensive in France.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:34.670
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
That's right.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.520
And it can be really good.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.110
I mean, the French
know how to cook

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.730
lobster, which is
not overcook it.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.884
But then that lobster
was drenched in a,

00:11:42.884 --> 00:11:44.300
and how would we
say it in French?

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.591
What was the name of the sauce?

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:49.450
I it was straight up, it
read as, "cat soup sauce."

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.550
And I'm like, what
the hell is this?

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.260
And it was just
straight ketchup.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.177
And the waiter comes
out, and is really,

00:11:56.177 --> 00:11:58.510
really proud of the sauce
that they put on this lobster.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.870
Because it was ketchup
that was made specially

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.712
by this friend of his,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:04.920
And the three of us are
eating it trying to enjoy it.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.580
But again from an outsider
perspective just going, well

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.080
shit.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.590
They just put ketchup
on my lobster.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.990
I don't know, just I
can imagine all kinds

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.550
of fascinating
stories like that.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.840
Let's pivot a little
bit to the book.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.450
I want to make sure
we give folks a chance

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.530
to ask questions, as well.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:19.790
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Sure.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.248
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
This is, you've

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:22.590
written a whole bunch of books.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.930
You've largely focused more
specifically on cookbooks.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.450
Now, you're taking
a pivot to more

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.940
of what I would kind of deem
a memoir cross cookbook.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.500
What was it the sort of
motivated you to do that?

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.764
Why the bigger journey, the
more work, the, I don't know.

00:12:38.764 --> 00:12:40.180
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
More work is the--

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.760
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Yeah, you just

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.800
wanted to do the more work?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.440
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
Do the harder way.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.856
Yeah, it's the
Chez Panisse thing.

00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:47.180
I always find the
harder way to do it.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.500
I'd written a memoir,
when I moved to Paris,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.542
my blog kind of took off.

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.083
And a lot of people
were saying well,

00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:54.820
you should write a
book about your story.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.320
So I wrote a book at the time,
which was very well received.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.200
And it was kind of funny,
and very young and fresh.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.430
And we change.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.200
People look at my old recipes,
I had a chance to revise a book.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.860
And I was like oh, I don't make
the brownies like that anymore.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.454
I do this now.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.620
And that changed, so that
changed, and that changed.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.520
My life has changed a lot.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.145
So I'd proposed a
book to my publisher,

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:17.370
who I love, Ten Speed Press.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.220
Just a book about France,
another book about stories.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.090
And the publisher,
Aaron, who's great,

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.440
said it needs to have recipes.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.726
I was like [CRYING].

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:29.100
And I'd spent eight months
working on the proposal, which

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.820
is what you normally
do when writing a book.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.400
And he said well, we
need to have recipes.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.740
And to make a long story
short, I realized he was right.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.850
Because as a cook, my
story is through recipes.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.330
My story's through cooking.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.070
I cook all day, and
that's who I am.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:46.570
I'm a cook.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.970
I've been a cook since
I was 16 professionally.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.650
Well, I was a dishwasher in a
restaurant-- dishwasher bonanza

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.910
sirloin pit, and
then the guys who

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.540
tended the meat in the naugahyde
aprons used to terrorize me

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.330
with the flaming
stakes and stuff.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.369
We're going to throw
you on the fire.

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:06.910
And now I'm like,
where are they now?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.098
I'm in Google.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:12.204
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Come, join me.

00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:13.870
Last question that
I'll ask, and then we

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.200
should turn it over to
friends in the audience.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.170
I've heard that you
had an opportunity

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.080
to redo your kitchen.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.297
I know your kitchen for
your already small Parisian

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.505
apartment was not very large.

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:25.422
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Right.

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:26.796
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
I don't know.

00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:29.020
Talk to us a little bit
about the kitchen remodel.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.802
What you did, what
you're happy about.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.510
DAVID LEBOVITZ: OK,
well the short answer

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.280
is when I started the remodeling
project, a friend of mine

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.988
in Paris said, promise
me you won't write

00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:39.680
a book about
remodeling in France.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.360
I said, OK.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.624
And then that all the stuff
happened, and it was pretty,

00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.540
it was very difficult.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.123
I was working on the
book at the time,

00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:49.045
and actually if anyone here has
ever bought a house in America,

00:14:49.045 --> 00:14:50.950
it takes 30 days.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.410
And France takes about
a year, just to close.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.620
It's really stressful, and
it's all very difficult.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.800
And then it needed
to be remodeled.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.094
And I thought, I've
done remodeling here.

00:15:04.094 --> 00:15:05.760
I'm like well, let's
just put this here,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.790
and this here, I want
a nice big kitchen.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.340
And to condense
the story, people

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.340
were walking by
like on the street.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.050
They were looking
and they were like,

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.320
are you building
a restaurant here?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.075
I'm like oh, that's the kitchen.

00:15:16.075 --> 00:15:17.710
They're like--
because I have a big,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.037
I was like I want a
big area to cook in.

00:15:20.037 --> 00:15:21.870
Traditionally actually,
French people always

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.910
had the kitchen apart
from their apartments.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.570
You never wanted, I mean
going back in history,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.940
the maid always made the food.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.230
Like you didn't, it's
very class orient--

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.920
you didn't want to be
around the smell of food.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.260
So they have this,
the new concept is,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.590
they call it cuisine American,
or an American kitchen.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.270
Which is open with a big counter
and everybody likes that,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.210
and you see the
stools and stuff.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.670
But it was very challenging.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.990
A lot of stuff,
you're tech people.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.020
I said, I want USB ports.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.522
We're doing the electricity.

00:15:53.522 --> 00:15:54.980
So I came home one
day, and there's

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.640
these cords hanging
out of the wall.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.720
It was like the wrong way.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.460
So I was like-- I was like, no.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.690
I need to plug my stuff into
the wall, not my apartment

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.960
into my computer.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.680
So we had a two week
argument about that.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.230
And there's a story in the book
about how the new contractor

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.850
saved my life,
because I found out

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.850
there was CO2 gas being
pumped into my apartment.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.068
And I was wondering why
was sleeping so well.

00:16:23.068 --> 00:16:26.500
I was like, I've been
sleeping really well lately.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.811
12, 24 hours.

00:16:27.811 --> 00:16:30.310
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Well, that's
the trick to sleeping well.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.280
Maybe I just need--

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.457
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well, I
don't recommend it, but--

00:16:33.457 --> 00:16:36.040
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: So why don't
we open up to everybody else?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.960
My guess is lots of good
questions for David.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.840
There's a mike floating around.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.483
Who has some good questions?

00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:44.316
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Or even
regular [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:45.230
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: OK.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.340
DAVID LEBOVITZ: If you have any
questions about the recipe--

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.540
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: And if
you don't have questions,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.123
David's going to ask
how to get higher

00:16:49.123 --> 00:16:52.950
in the search results ranking,
how to drop his AdWords cost,

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.830
why the street view
picture of his home--

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.780
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Shows
the bathroom, shower.

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:03.720
Everyone's always like,
that's not my department.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.909
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: M-hm.

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:06.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.176
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Hi.

00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:08.000
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.380
Thank you for all the
wonderful recipes on your blog,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.250
and beautiful photos on
your Instagram, and Google+,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.020
and everything.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.686
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Oh,
I'm a fan of Google.

00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:16.710
[INAUDIBLE] feedback.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.849
AUDIENCE: Really appreciate it.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.000
And you really made
my last trip to Paris

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.230
with all the recommendations
and things on your blog.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.650
If you were moving
back to San Francisco,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.290
what are some things
you would really

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.400
take from your Paris experience
that would maybe transform

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.529
the way you would
live here again?

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:34.820
DAVID LEBOVITZ: The way I shop.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.040
I'm used to, I mean I walk
everywhere, and I shop.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.580
I go to the bakery everyday,
and I go to the cheese shop,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.290
and I have people at the market.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.426
And here, it's so
easy to buy stuff.

00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:46.550
You go to the supermarket,
you drive up to a place,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.040
and you just buy everything.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.470
And I would still really
try to hold on to that,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.120
like getting my milk from
one place and cheese.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.960
And even though it
drives you crazy

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.320
if you're trying to do a
cookbook, because you know.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.720
It's like, I need an orange.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.790
And the store's
closed until Monday,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.090
and you have to wait until
Tuesday because they don't

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.610
have anyone to stock the store.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.980
And Cindy's laughing because
you remember this stuff.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.610
It's like OK.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.900
So just going more small scale.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.791
And actually, eating everything.

00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:15.290
When I left the
restaurant business,

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.100
I was a little chunky.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.770
And I was always a thin person,
and I made a conscious effort

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.920
to lose a lot of weight.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.690
And I was trying
to eat egg whites,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.960
and not eat so much fat.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.810
In France, I eat everything.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.050
And I've kind of lost weight
until this trip right now.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.750
And I've just been eating
ribs and stuff, so.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.580
I probably wouldn't
eat all this stuff

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.570
that I used to eat in
America like tacos,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.096
or burritos, and stuff.

00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:43.580
Does that makes sense?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.930
No lobster with ketchup.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.810
AUDIENCE: So it's a
two part question.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.000
As a technologist
and a home cook,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.050
I always have this love hate
relationship with sort of tech,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.550
right?

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.200
How much is going to be
useful in the kitchen?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.030
Most the time it's
useless to me,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.200
but-- so it's two part question.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.780
One is, what other kinds, if you
have any tech in your kitchen,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.670
what is it?

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.420
And then the other
is if you don't, what

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.484
would be great to have
that maybe doesn't exist?

00:19:14.484 --> 00:19:15.900
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
You know, I don't.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.070
Years before the iPad came
out, I did a story on my site

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.030
about ecookbooks.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.310
Because there were some
devices that had recipes.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.630
I'm like, you know,
is this going to work?

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.520
Are people going to want to
look at a tablet and cook?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.310
It even if you could
have Julia Child with you

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.900
on this thing saying cut
up the chicken this way.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.090
And when I write recipes,
I write them all longhand.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.260
And even downstairs,
the test kitchen woman,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.140
she's still writing longhand.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.810
So I don't really have
any tech in my kitchen.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.100
I don't use a computer
when I'm typing recipes.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.990
That's in another room.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.370
What I would like is,
and I know this exists,

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.630
but I'm just too crazy to do it.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.890
Is a voice activated
tool so I could

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:05.000
say, chop one onion, so I didn't
have to stop and write it down.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.670
Or something that
would record what I do,

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.797
and condense it so that I
could just have it right

00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:12.380
there without having
to go through all

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.697
this recordings of stuff.

00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:16.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.240
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
I can, is that sort

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240
of what you had in mind?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.364
Or would you broaden your
question as well to like,

00:20:22.364 --> 00:20:24.370
do you have a KitchenAid
mixer in your kitchen--

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.496
AUDIENCE: No, it actually
wasn't about the gadgets.

00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:28.870
Well, there's a
school of thought

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.391
that says you only need a
chef's knife and a paring knife,

00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:31.890
right?

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.390
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Exactly.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.931
AUDIENCE: So I'm
more on that school.

00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:39.966
But you could broaden it to
OK, when you're not cooking,

00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:41.340
and you go online
to look and see

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.180
what other people are doing.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.520
Maybe you're looking for a
recipe or online services--

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.830
although just to your
point about dictation,

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.160
we definitely have that.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.719
But it's not structured
for that use case.

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.760
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah, you
see these refrigerators

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.134
that tell you when
you need milk.

00:20:57.134 --> 00:20:58.850
It's like, I don't need that.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.930
I can open the door.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.930
But I need a
computer to write on,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.460
I need a computer to
go search for a recipe,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.860
or search for a technique.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.480
So a lot of this innovation in
the kitchen this kind of silly.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.920
And this whole idea of a
chef's knife, a paring knife,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.900
and a pan is really great.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.231
I've gone to people's
houses, I was actually

00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:18.230
somewhere the other day.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.990
And they had turkey deep fryer.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.880
It was a machine just
for deep frying turkey.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.895
And--

00:21:23.895 --> 00:21:25.895
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: That's
highly useful, right?

00:21:25.895 --> 00:21:29.540
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's highly
useful one day of the year.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.220
It's people who have these very
big kitchens, and so forth.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.830
And I lived in a really, I
had a really nice kitchen

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.230
here in San Francisco.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.230
And then I moved to a
very small place in Paris.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.604
I didn't have a
mixer for a year,

00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:40.820
and I just had a couple pans.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.930
And I wrote two books there.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.513
And it was good,
because I could write

00:21:43.513 --> 00:21:47.700
to people who have
small kitchens.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.920
Light up your wok
burner, and heat up

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.260
six gallons of rice
bran oil, and then

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.560
fry the quail hearts until, and
you're just-- all those kind

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.210
of books kind of freak me out.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.570
Because I love when people
come to me and they go,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.210
I made your recipe
for madelines.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.290
They were great.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.610
I made your vanilla ice
cream, it was great.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.901
And that's what it's all about.

00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:08.990
And I think in spite of
how great technology is,

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.640
it's just not, cooking
is a visceral experience.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.924
That's why books, I
wrote this book because,

00:22:16.924 --> 00:22:18.590
if you need a recipe
for chocolate cake,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.952
you can go online and find one.

00:22:19.952 --> 00:22:21.660
I wrote this book
because I wanted people

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.590
to read about my life,
read about the recipes,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.950
and pick it up, and
touch it, and feel it.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.100
I chose the photographer,
because he's very,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.070
he's good at getting the sort
of the textures of vegetables,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.160
and meat, and Paris.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.770
Paris is not necessarily
a beautiful place.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.750
It is, but there's a
lot of funkiness to it,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.569
like the ethnic neighborhoods.

00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:45.860
I live near Belleville, which
is an Asian neighborhood.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.734
And people are like,
there's Asians in Paris?

00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:50.270
I'm like yeah, there's
a huge neighborhood.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.530
There's Indian neighborhoods.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.687
And I thought those short of
showed the diversity of Paris,

00:22:55.687 --> 00:22:57.270
and I wanted to show
that in the book.

00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:01.000
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Other
questions from folks now,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.083
a few more hands going up.

00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:06.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.570
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Hi.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.570
AUDIENCE: So two things.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.510
One is I wanted to
admit, I've never

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.030
made a single one
of your recipes.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.840
But that's not because I
don't like your recipies.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.030
DAVID LEBOVITZ: The
books are for sale.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.238
AUDIENCE: No, no, no, no, no.

00:23:18.238 --> 00:23:20.220
It's because I have to
deal with my family,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.980
with over a dozen
different food allergies.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.969
Milk allergy, milk,
wheat, dairy, eggs.

00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:27.510
DAVID LEBOVITZ: But
you probably have

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.590
recipes that you make
over and over again.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.905
AUDIENCE: Absolutely

00:23:29.905 --> 00:23:30.570
DAVID LEBOVITZ: That's great.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.050
Yeah, that's what you do.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.290
AUDIENCE: And I actually
love you for your stories.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.330
So I'm really excited
about your new book,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.820
and I read your blog religiously
because of the stories.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.688
And what I imagine your
recipes would taste like.

00:23:40.688 --> 00:23:41.482
DAVID LEBOVITZ: OK.

00:23:41.482 --> 00:23:42.440
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: OK.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.140
AUDIENCE: The other thing
is that I had a question

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.330
for you is, how do you
balance that with Google, you

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.730
can find like you said,
chocolate ginger cake

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.670
recipe, right?

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.550
Which is one of those I
imagine, yours is amazing.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:02.270
But you can search for a
million of those recipes.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.990
So how do you differentiate
yours with all the other ones?

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.830
How do you balance making
it special enough, but not

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.070
so esoteric that
normal people will,

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.700
oh, that's way too many steps.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.350
That's way too many ingredients,
that's way too weird.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.349
So how do you balance that?

00:24:19.349 --> 00:24:21.140
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well
the way I've actually,

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.649
and this probably
sounds terrible,

00:24:22.649 --> 00:24:24.690
and you can turn the
cameras off when I say this,

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.300
but I'm seeing a stratification
now on the internet.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.380
There's so much content.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.940
If you want that ginger
cake, you type ginger cake.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.760
But whose recipe is it?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.990
Who's written this recipe?

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.530
If you go on a site
like Epicurious,

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.110
they have a test kitchen.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.120
And the recipe works,
there's someone behind it.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.550
If people go to my
site, I test the recipe.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.560
I test them two or three times.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.770
For the book, at least
three times, if not more.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.500
And then Cindy gets the
recipe and goes over them.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.140
I vet the stuff.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.360
People want curated,
vetted content.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.940
There's so much stuff out
there that's not good.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.490
I want my name to be, I've
become a trusted name.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.190
I didn't do it intentionally,
but I have that chops.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.270
Because I'm a cookbook
writer, as well.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.270
So you can turn the
camera back on again now.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.390
But I actually try to cook
for a global audience.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.910
A third of my readers on my
site are from outside the US.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.430
So I'm very conscious of
if I call for a recipe,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.740
I write in grams,
if I use molasses,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.080
people are going to
say, what's molasses?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.060
And I'm very conscious of that.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.670
And that sort of endeared
me to a larger audience.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.450
Americans, we tend to be
enclosed in our country.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.740
And even though
Google's international,

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.900
the internet makes us, we still
work within our own parameters.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.310
And I'm always constantly
trying to enforce this idea,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.834
suggest this idea,
that we need to think

00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:48.000
about the rest of the world.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.510
How people in England cook,
what they use, and so forth.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.510
Does that answer
the second question?

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.140
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.200
Just, there are lots
of recipes where

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.834
they use very hard
to find ingredients.

00:26:02.834 --> 00:26:04.000
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I actually--

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.470
AUDIENCE: Especially
living in France, you know?

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.470
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I actually
don't use ingredients

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.761
that people can't get anywhere.

00:26:09.761 --> 00:26:11.280
I search a lot on the line.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.285
I always make sure that
anything in the book is,

00:26:14.285 --> 00:26:16.160
and actually, I try to
make sure everything's

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.917
available in the community.

00:26:17.917 --> 00:26:20.000
There's nothing more
annoying than making a recipe

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.850
and go, oh, I have to
mail away for the spice.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.450
I do ask Cindy, I've written
butchers or called butchers,

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.620
or emailed, I guess, in Texas.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.675
I'm like when you get a
ham hock, is it smoked?

00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:34.390
Can you get on
unsmoked hem hocks?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.510
So they're like, yes.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.390
But things like
sausages, I really want,

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.050
and I give suggestions.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.810
For example, I have
a cassoulet recipe.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.290
And everybody's
like cassoulet has

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.840
to be made with these beans.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.150
And they're these
haricot tarbais beans.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:50.650
And in America, they're
probably $30, $35 a pound.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.210
And it's hard to do a
recipe to tell somebody, buy

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.790
two pounds of these beans.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.030
Because it's annoying,
and it's a peasant dishes.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.160
It's not, the esprit
or the soul of the dish

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.040
is to something that
anybody can make with,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.340
that's what French cuisine is.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.570
It's regional food
too, what's available.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.340
So I try to encourage people
to use what's available.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.620
And there's only one
ingredient in the book which

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.260
is salt cod, which
I love a lot, which

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.070
you might have to send away for.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.230
But other than that,
everything else is,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.370
I really strive to make
stuff that people can make.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.400
I've seen a lot of
chef's books with the 1/4

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.480
cup of squab stock, and
this-- I'm like, OK.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.534
They're just showing off.

00:27:31.534 --> 00:27:33.200
Or that's how they
cook in a restaurant,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.764
but that's not how
people cook, I think.

00:27:36.764 --> 00:27:37.930
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: It's OK.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.430
Here in the Bay Area, salt
cod is kind of the same thing

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.430
as on endive these days.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.040
So like--

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.910
DAVID LEBOVITZ: They couldn't
get it at Camino yesterday.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.170
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Really?

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:44.450
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.260
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Oh, strange.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:45.725
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:27:45.725 --> 00:27:47.308
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
See it everywhere.

00:27:47.308 --> 00:27:48.940
What other questions?

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.140
AUDIENCE: So, I've been
to Paris several times,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.300
but my wife's never been.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.690
She's fluent in French.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.010
Barring an invitation to
your place, where would

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:02.550
you suggest, what do you suggest
we would taste, or a place we

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.410
would eat, or I think
we'll have a kitchen.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.260
What should we make
ourselves to understand Paris

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.364
or to be surprised by Paris?

00:28:09.364 --> 00:28:11.030
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
think a couple things.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.370
If you're going to rent an
apartment, which is great,

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.485
eat bread and cheese.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.450
The bread and cheese
are outstanding.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.140
And you get really good bread
and cheese in the Bay Area,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.920
but it's not the same.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.800
Just eat a lot of cheese,
because it's spectacular.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.340
And for restaurants,
it's getting harder

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.740
to find a traditional
restaurant.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.640
Because people don't eat
that way anymore in Paris.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.580
We ate at this bistro.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.220
We had some deer stew and for
two days were like, oh my god.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.550
I'm still digesting it.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.110
But there's a lot
of young talent.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:51.200
Like Septime, 6 Paul Bert, where
they're doing fresh ingredients

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.140
like small peas, flowers.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.562
But not silly, but very
beautiful things, like whoa.

00:28:57.562 --> 00:28:59.770
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: If you
want, we can go play pool.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.800
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah,
we're doing it after.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.066
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah, OK.

00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:02.940
[INAUDIBLE] ball pit?

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.360
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Six Paul
Bert, Septime, and wine bars.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.037
A lot of Americans are a little
timid to go into a wine bar.

00:29:10.037 --> 00:29:11.870
But that's where all
the young people, those

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.490
are the bistros of today.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.170
That's where the
young people hang out,

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.710
people go for casual meal.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.480
You can get charcuterie cheese,
a glass of wine, or two,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.320
or three.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.880
That's fun.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.421
You don't have to
have a reservation.

00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:24.440
The people are nice,
the young generation

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.020
is much more accommodating.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.590
And they're happy to
see you, and so forth.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.609
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

00:29:32.609 --> 00:29:34.900
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: What
other questions do folks have?

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.280
AUDIENCE: Right here.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:35.660
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
have a question.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.920
What is the cue ball doing?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.110
Oh, Cindy, you're back.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.885
CINDY: I'm back Is this on?

00:29:39.885 --> 00:29:41.260
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.060
about any particularly
contentious topics

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.362
on your blog, or topics
that are eternally popular.

00:29:47.362 --> 00:29:49.820
Just sort of things that always
strike a chord with people.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.050
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah, I'm like
blogger chef, pastry chef,

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.480
slash referee.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.580
So sometimes I have
a couple things.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.260
Well, whenever I go
anywhere, everyone's

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.730
always like oh, you should
have gone to some restaurant.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.480
Just like the should'ves the
should'ves, you should'ves.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.900
And that's always, like
why didn't you go here?

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.290
I'm like well, because
I'm here for a day.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.590
So that's always a
point of contention.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.630
People, they think I should
go to all these places and I

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.420
can't.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.710
The authenticity police.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.070
I've recently had a
few run ins with them,

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.130
and they've tried to bust me.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.369
And that's a really big thing.

00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:32.660
There's a lot of people online.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.118
Everybody's an
expert, and they all

00:30:34.118 --> 00:30:36.540
want to point out that
they know more than you do.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.140
Which is often true.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.570
But once again, like
I was talking about.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.940
Thai food, like food changes.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.200
Cassoulet is not,
somebody wrote to me

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.929
recently one of these things.

00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:49.720
They said well, I was
looking at your book.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.886
And I'm not going to buy it.

00:30:50.886 --> 00:30:52.390
Because it's a book
on French food,

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.350
but there are some
non-French recipes in there.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.850
There's tarjine.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.780
And French people eat tarjine.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.340
It's like Americans
eat hamburgers.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.980
Hamburgers are not
American, they're German.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.660
Cassoulet is beans
from the new world.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.040
Beans are not native to France.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.670
So people, we're
talking a little bit

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.087
about different cultures.

00:31:13.087 --> 00:31:14.670
Not everything's
available everywhere.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.080
We're very fortunate in America.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.110
If you need Parmesan, if you
need pecarino, you can get it.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.779
But if you can't get
the bouillabaise fish,

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.570
does that mean you
can't make bouillabaise?

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.170
No.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.800
Because bouillabaise
is a peasant dish

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.670
using fish from the region.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.210
So you use what's available.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.010
You don't use what they use in
Marseille, because it's silly.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.170
You live in San Francisco.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.260
So the authenticity police,
I'm flipping over the word,

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.050
you can edit that out.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.800
That's been sort of a
point of contention.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.920
And I address that
now in blog posts.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.390
And I say, this is an
authentic, but I live in Paris.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.650
And we don't get this,
we don't get tomatillo,

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.340
so this is what I use.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.900
And that's the best you can do.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.436
And get your-- I tell people
if they don't like it,

00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:01.060
they can start their
own blog and write

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.300
about how I'm doing
everything wrong.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.900
I won't link to it, but--
and you guys don't either.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.010
I have friends at Google,
and they'll cut you--

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.490
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Lower.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.140
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.931
Move the algorithm.

00:32:13.142 --> 00:32:14.600
AUDIENCE: I want
to thank you again

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.850
for your blog and your books.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.230
I love them all.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.060
You mentioned you moved
to Paris to learn.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.390
I'm curious what
other countries,

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.870
or maybe even
regions of France you

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.950
would want to spend
more time in, and learn

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.065
more about their style
of cooking, and eating,

00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:28.220
and so forth.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.210
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I love the Jura.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.970
People think France, they
think Paris, Provence.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.380
Because Provence is very
accessible, especially

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.130
for Californians.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.100
Because the food
is great, it's all

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.090
vegetables, blah,
blah, blah, garlic.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.740
But the Jura is the mountainous
region where they make cheese.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.930
Comte cheese, [? Mondoora. ?]
There's these wines there

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.730
that you don't get outside
of France very often.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.735
They often have a funny
taste, almost sherry like.

00:32:52.735 --> 00:32:53.485
A little oxidized.

00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:58.410
I've been there a few times.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.930
We went once, and our car rolled
off a cliff, and it was pretty.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:02.596
They're like, this
happens all the time.

00:33:02.596 --> 00:33:05.370
And I remember my friend and I,
our car's rolling off a cliff.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.130
And we're looking at each other
like, are we going to die?

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.190
And we're talking about
it, and he's French.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.880
But it's a really
beautiful part of France.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.130
I'd like to learn more
about Alsauce too.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.150
They have a really, they
have wonderful wines.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.270
And people think
oh, Riesling, sweet.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.710
It's like no, it's not sweet.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:22.820
It's very good wine.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.496
I don't know anything about it.

00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:26.120
So I'd like to go
there and learn more.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.078
And that's how you learn
about stuff in France.

00:33:28.078 --> 00:33:30.300
You go there and you
see them make it.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.580
And now I know a lot
about comte cheese.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.520
You say [? compte, ?]
but in French,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.020
you say [? conte. ?]
I don't know why.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.590
But that's how I
learn about stuff.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.620
I go to places.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.110
I've gone to places
where they candy fruit.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.280
I've gone to cheese
caves, and stuff.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.049
And now I know.

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:46.465
I'm like wow, this
is fascinating.

00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:49.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:53.180
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: While
folks are queueing up,

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.930
some additional questions.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.200
You want to spend just
a minute or two talking

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.514
about Denise Acabo and the
fantastic shop she has.

00:34:00.514 --> 00:34:02.430
And then, maybe go into
the story a little bit

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.060
about the recent tragedy,
and where she's taking it.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.020
I'll just real
briefly set up that I

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.010
think one of David's
specialties has been,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.670
I mean clearly desserts, pastry
chef, et cetera, but also

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.260
in chocolate.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.210
And I've learned, although
I know very little,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.969
I've learned most
everything that I

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.290
know from talking to David.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.420
David goes really deep.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.928
All the way into, but
are you actually making

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:24.719
your own chocolate?

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.949
Are you buying it
from somebody else

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.074
to make what you have here?

00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:29.920
And he understands things
at the level of people

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.489
essentially roasting beans,
and making chocolate.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.639
In fact, you were at
Dandelion Chocolate

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.750
just the other day in San
Francisco, weren't you?

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.449
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's funny how
some people say "dan-dee-lion."

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:39.980
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Or what is it--

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.750
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
How do you say it?

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:41.900
I say dandelion.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.679
JONATHAN ALFERNESS Oh, I was
saying "dan-dee-lion," I guess.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.678
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's OK.

00:34:44.678 --> 00:34:45.810
It's like tomatoe, tomato.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.810
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Yeah, I guess so.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.185
And they're one
of the few places

00:34:48.185 --> 00:34:50.480
I think in the Bay Area that
actually makes their own,

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.320
makes own chocolate, right?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.060
But Denise Acobo has this
amazing chocolate shop

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.020
in Paris.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.682
And it was, I mean, it's
just so stuck in our memories

00:34:58.682 --> 00:35:00.390
as one of the places
that my wife and I'd

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.560
love to visit when
we were last there.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.630
We brought our kids.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.250
And she's an amazing
woman walking around,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.610
pulling out so the best
treats, chocolates, candies,

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.810
that you've ever
had in your life.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.226
You want to just talk a little
bit about how you guys met,

00:35:13.226 --> 00:35:17.054
and some of the, like she's got
a hold of special chocolates,

00:35:17.054 --> 00:35:18.720
but she had to beg
to get a hold of them

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.460
and all this kind of stuff.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.418
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's the
only 80-year-old woman

00:35:21.418 --> 00:35:23.755
who kisses me on the lips.

00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:26.790
Like, OK.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.500
Actually, the Dandelion
people are great.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.750
They actually came to Paris,
and I showed them around.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.860
I didn't know them.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.276
And they were like,
we're thinking

00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:34.671
of opening a chocolate place.

00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:36.920
And I was telling them, the
used to own [? Plaxo, ?] I

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.575
think, and they sold it.

00:35:38.575 --> 00:35:40.450
And that's what Americans
are really good at,

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.520
in reinventing ourselves.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.033
And they did.

00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:43.380
I was like well, you know,
it's going to be really hard,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.005
and blah, blah.

00:35:44.005 --> 00:35:47.640
And they opened, they
acknowledged me effusively

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.620
for influencing them,
which I didn't really do.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.170
They did it.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.045
But it was great.

00:35:53.045 --> 00:35:54.670
So they're a very
good example of that.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.580
But Denise Acobo
had a shop in Paris

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.420
for maybe 35 years called
A L'Etoile d'Or, which

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.000
is "The Golden Star."

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.770
Doesn't sound very sexy in
English, so you use the French.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.210
But she was curating
candies and specialty

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.626
treats from all over France.

00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:12.500
And the store was like
a little antique shop,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.070
and she wore a little pigtail,
like little girl pigtails,

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.450
a tie, kilt.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.950
Have you?

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.050
You've been in the shop.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.790
Oh, no.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.706
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: She's
like quintessential,

00:36:21.706 --> 00:36:24.230
like what you would expect for
a little old lady in a candy

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.730
shop.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.260
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
But she's lovely.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.760
She loves people, she
loves talking to people,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.390
she loves tourists.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.400
She's like, Americans are
so great, everybody wants,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.980
she loves talking to people.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.980
And there's a
couple of chocolates

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.290
that she, she was
the only place that

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.620
carried Burnachon
chocolates from Lyon.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.970
Lyon.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.040
And she said, I got down
on my hands and knees

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.150
in front of the owner.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.666
And it's like ay, it's
an 80-year old woman.

00:36:48.666 --> 00:36:50.415
When I was in her
apartment once upstairs.

00:36:50.415 --> 00:36:53.440
And she was like, yeah, Toulouse
Lautrec used to live back here.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.680
And I'm like, wow.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.670
And about two months
ago, her shop,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.240
there was an
explosion underneath.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.681
Somebody was working on the gas
line, and the shop exploded.

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:06.180
And the pharmacy
next door exploded,

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.560
and the whole floor collapsed.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.330
And she was in there
with customers.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.350
And luckily, she's OK, but she
that she saw the whole floor

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.570
collapse.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.430
As a testament to good building
materials, a lot of the shelves

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.786
are marble, so they
protected the chocolate.

00:37:22.786 --> 00:37:26.920
But the shop was destroyed
and is destroyed.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.240
And it's very sad,
because she's 80.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.190
And she's really lively,
she's very alert.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.890
And she really misses
people having this store,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.070
it's her whole life.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.667
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
But she's not

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.000
in the process of rebuilding it?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.790
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
Well, I had talks

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.780
with her and her
daughter, and they've

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.350
thought about ecommerce.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:45.600
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Ecommerce?

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.140
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Ecommerce.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.790
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Here,
in the states, maybe?

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.020
DAVID LEBOVITZ: (FRENCH
ACCENT) Ecommerce.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.936
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
(FRENCH ACCENT) Ecommerce.

00:37:47.936 --> 00:37:49.880
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It sounds
effective, I'm sorry.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.340
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I like it.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.590
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I'll be one
of those annoying people that

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.370
comes back from Europe
with a British accent.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.490
But she wanted to, I'm
like, you're in France,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.670
and nobody's going to,
people want to come here.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.630
And you went in the shop,
and every single person

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.820
I sent in that shop
was like, that was

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.750
our favorite shop in Paris.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.879
And that was actually one
of the reasons I started.

00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:10.420
I really worked on
the blog actually,

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.910
it started before
I moved to Paris.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.840
But it was all these shops
that nobody had heard about.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.700
They were mentioned
very briefly,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.200
but the magazines
were like, we want

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.470
to talk about Lauderee,
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.750
I'm like, this shop is amazing.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.530
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.946
DAVID LEBOVITZ: It's up at
Montemartre, near Moulin Rouge.

00:38:24.946 --> 00:38:26.031
And we had lunch.

00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:27.530
She's a fixture in
the neighborhood.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.370
You go up there and
everybody you walk by.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.120
And people come out
of their shops to say,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.930
I'm sorry what
happened to your store.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.965
So I said, let's do
some pop up stores.

00:38:36.965 --> 00:38:38.840
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Oh,
Kickstarter campaign,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.660
pop up stores, or
someone like that?

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.920
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.211
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: What
other questions do folks have?

00:38:50.237 --> 00:38:52.820
DAVID LEBOVITZ: And I want to
do a Google Glass tour of Paris.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.160
That's my question for you guys.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.640
It'd be fun to do a video in
Paris wearing the glasses.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.370
So just putting that out there.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.370
You can have the glasses
back when I'm done.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.560
AUDIENCE: Just kind
of a hopeful question.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.720
You mentioned how bread here
is good, but not the same.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.660
And I agree.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.540
Any tips on where we could
get a close approximation

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.160
of the bread and
amazing croissants

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.200
that we in Paris if you've
seen anything similar here?

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.180
And if I can ask a follow-up
question to something someone

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.295
raised earlier.

00:39:25.295 --> 00:39:27.170
I've really been impressed
with the community

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.206
you've built, like in your blog.

00:39:29.206 --> 00:39:30.580
And I'm sure it's
a tough balance

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.550
between the free
content you offer,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.320
and the services
and books that you

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.590
sell, anything you
can share about.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.870
And I'm sure moderating
your comments,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.390
so that it's a positive
community on your blog.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.170
And that's been really amazing.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.814
So anything you've kind of
learned that you'd share

00:39:46.814 --> 00:39:47.980
would be really interesting.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.770
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
These two questions

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.800
I always forget them
one after the other.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.770
You guys have really
good questions.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.436
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:53.820
[INAUDIBLE] more important.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.120
DAVID LEBOVITZ: OK,
well I can do both,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.480
but you might have to remind me.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.750
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
-baguettes and croissants.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.208
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
The baguettes, I've

00:39:59.208 --> 00:40:00.830
actually been going
to B. Patisserie.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.720
And in California,
she's is amazing.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.310
The granola is amazing.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.530
She does really, Evelyn, people
are nodding in the audience.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.560
She's doing a really good job.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.200
She's working with
a French bread

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.050
guy who actually
lives in the Bay Area.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.216
He's lived here a long time.

00:40:15.216 --> 00:40:17.110
But he's an expert on flour.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.790
So she's making these pastries,
and they're beautiful.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.960
They're as good or
better than France.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.060
Josey Bread, Josey Baker bread
at The Mill is fantastic.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.490
He's just a really cool guy.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.380
I visit him every morning
because he makes me happy.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.260
The fact of building a food
community, I was fortunate.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.390
Because when I started my blog,
there was like six bloggers.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.370
And we all kind of
knew each other.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.100
And then we kind of built
this sort of nucleus.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.220
And we still keep in touch,
we still have the same values.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.350
Always be honest, write
from the heart, which

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.690
sounds a little touchy feely.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.770
But really express yourself.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.830
Be honest and open.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.250
I also don't let
people push me around.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.800
I have an exit only policy
where I am the boss,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.080
and I don't let people dictate
what I do at all on my site.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.180
I keep it, I moderate it,
not in terms of comments

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.475
necessarily, but in
terms of the tone.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.850
When I write about, people
don't like what I write about,

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.992
I encourage them
not to read my blog.

00:41:22.992 --> 00:41:25.380
And it's fine, I don't care.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.830
They can, the home page
is fixed on my site.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.570
They should contact
their browser,

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:33.100
but I really make an effort
also to be fair on my site.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.750
If you read my older
posts, I'm a lot more maybe

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.480
critical of France.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.250
And as the longer
I live there, I

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.140
realize that's why they
are the way they are.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.800
And I've chosen to live there.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.230
And I have to learn why, and
I've learned why they are,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.040
why they go on strike.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.970
I don't understand right now
the pilots are going on strike

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:54.560
because they want to take away
their right to go on strike.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.060
So it does actually makes sense.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.920
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Oh,
that works actually.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.516
Yeah.

00:41:57.516 --> 00:41:59.550
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Wra
my head around it.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.910
So I've really tried
to be fair, as well.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.130
And I make fun of myself a
lot, because I'm an idiot.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.950
I go to Paris, and
I make mistakes.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.340
We all make mistakes.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.650
And people come to
France and they're like,

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:12.900
oh it's OK if I take pictures?

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.000
I don't want to
look like a tourist.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I'm like, if they
came to San Francisco,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.820
they be at a fisherman's wharf
eating soup out of bread.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.050
So don't worry about it.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.760
Be yourself, be funny.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.670
It's OK to be a tourist,
it's OK to make mistakes.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:29.050
And I make fun of that,
and I write about that.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.732
If you guys come, we're not
getting the soup and the brand.

00:42:34.732 --> 00:42:35.690
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: N0?

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.898
DAVID LEBOVITZ: In Paris, no.

00:42:36.898 --> 00:42:38.734
No baguettes.

00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:39.400
Soup [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.691
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Well,
you looked at me pretty funny

00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:45.670
when I wanted, it's cheeky,
but one of my favorites

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.630
is a really good bowl
of French onion soup.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.710
And I was asking David
like, where the hell

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.956
can I get this in Paris?

00:42:51.956 --> 00:42:53.330
And he was like,
you're in Paris.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.805
You're not going to get
good French onion soup.

00:42:55.805 --> 00:42:58.180
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well, it's
just not something people eat.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:58.410
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
That's right.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.910
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
That's the thing you

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.330
used to eat at 3:00 in the
morning when the bar's closed,

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.760
and it's just that era's over.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.510
And you can get it,
but it's not the same.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.980
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: He's right.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980
Because we went to, I
forget where we showed up.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.960
And I ordered the French
onion soup, and it was crap.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.680
And he's, see?

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.515
I told you so.

00:43:12.515 --> 00:43:12.930
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.560
Well, it's like
going to the Haight,

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.404
and experiencing the
free love movement.

00:43:16.404 --> 00:43:17.820
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.850
DAVID LEBOVITZ: There's
some relics of it,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.860
but it's kind of [GRIMACES.]
You're going to take a shower,

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.382
and maybe go to the
doctor afterwards.

00:43:24.382 --> 00:43:25.840
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Literal relics.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.680
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.330
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: We have time
for a couple more questions,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:28.830
I think.

00:43:32.248 --> 00:43:32.747
OK.

00:43:32.747 --> 00:43:34.982
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Oh, hi.

00:43:34.982 --> 00:43:36.690
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.090
So after grad school, I
had a French roommate.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.614
And she introduced me
to such great cuisine.

00:43:41.614 --> 00:43:42.530
Oh my god, the cheese.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.710
But then I became
lactose intolerant.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.950
So it's uncomfortable
for everyone involved.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.870
How do you still
enjoy French cooking,

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.330
but not be able to handle cream?

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.120
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I'm
lactose intolerant.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.370
I actually, when I was
younger-- I've never told them,

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.495
I'm telling this on camera.

00:43:56.495 --> 00:43:58.450
But they didn't know
what was wrong with me.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.040
I was doubled over in pain.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.870
I was like 12.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:04.630
And then I went to college, and
I took food science classes.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.720
I'm like, lactose
intolerant-- oh, that's me.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.460
And I stopped drinking
milk by the glass.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.310
And I mean, I'm not an expert.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.520
But most lactose
intolerants can tolerate

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.800
a certain amount of dairy.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.250
I can eat ice
cream, and so forth.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.840
Hard mountain cheeses,
there's very little,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.080
if any lactose in them.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.250
It's all been, I don't
quite know the process.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:31.170
But old cheeses, crumbly
cheeses, don't have lactose.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.410
Goat milk, yogurt.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.590
I love goat milk, I
love sheep's milk.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.280
Those, the lactose
is broken down.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.200
I actually don't
like cream sauces.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.370
I don't like stuff
that's swimming in cream.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.060
I like butter a lot.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.500
Butter in France is
cultured, so I can eat that.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.670
So move to France.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.780
People think I'm crazy for
not liking cream sauce,

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.950
but I don't know.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.470
I find that cream, stuff
that's really rich,

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.100
you don't taste the food.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.141
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.420
DAVID LEBOVITZ: There's
not a lot of stuff

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.520
with cream in my book.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.220
I like chocolate,
I like spice, I'd

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.160
rather use those
ingredients than cream.

00:45:16.575 --> 00:45:19.200
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: What's your
favorite thing to cook at home?

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.380
Both for a meal when you and
Roman are hungry, but then also

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.280
for a treat?

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.660
What's your favorite
dessert to cook, as well?

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.980
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
make a lot of sorbet,

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.220
because I'm a Californian.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.370
I go to the market,
and I see fruit.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.850
And I'm just
obsessed with fruit.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.460
I'm really crazy about fruit.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.930
And I see stuff, and I
can't help but buying it,

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.400
and I buy too much of
it, and I make sorbet.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.930
And I always make fruit with it.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.320
I love cookies, I'm
always making cookies.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.120
I make a lot of biscotti.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.950
I would do sable,
the French cookies,

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.640
the thin ones with the butter.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.580
With lime zest, or something.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.900
So I make a lot of those
kind of things for dessert.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.240
The problem is if I make a cake
or something, I work at home.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.150
I'm always slicing pieces off.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.990
And I'll just scrape
some of the icing.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.500
Oh I can't eat, that
piece doesn't have icing,

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.830
let me cut it.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.330
I have neighbors,
and they're always

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.630
getting cakes with
two slices out.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.130
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
This one's left.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.005
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:46:18.005 --> 00:46:20.544
Like, thanks, I think.

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:21.930
AUDIENCE: What's next?

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.892
DAVID LEBOVITZ: What's next?

00:46:23.892 --> 00:46:24.600
Well, it's funny.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.990
Because people ask that a lot.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.710
And often, people say having
a book is like having a baby.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.830
And I've never had a baby,
so I'm just imagining it.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.220
But once you've had a
baby, you don't really

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.580
want to be in that situation
again for at least nine months.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.640
So I'm taking nine months off.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.720
It's actually really great
going around and just talking

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.962
to people.

00:46:45.962 --> 00:46:48.325
Because I spent so much, I
put a lot into this book.

00:46:48.325 --> 00:46:49.700
And people say
that all the time,

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.090
I'm like-- this was pretty,
it's a lot of me in the book.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.300
It took two years
rather than one.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.440
So I'm actually enjoying
sort of talking about it,

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.210
and reflecting on it, and
thinking about what I did.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.380
And I have an idea for
another book about France.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.820
It's a whole different
subject for me.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.740
I'm actually one of
those people that if I

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.200
want to write about it, you
want to be an expert on it.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.900
So I'm trying to learn
about this subject,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:18.610
but it's proving challenging.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.070
That's all I'll say.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.302
But it involves whisky.

00:47:22.302 --> 00:47:23.260
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Oh.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:23.500
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.180
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Fun, I like that.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.357
DAVID LEBOVITZ: So I'm trying
to drink as much as I can.

00:47:29.357 --> 00:47:31.190
When's the meeting this
afternoon with the--

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.230
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I
don't know, we should go.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.020
DAVID LEBOVITZ: There's
a cocktail meeting.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.280
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.830
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I have
a driver, it's great.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.330
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I think
we're just about out of time.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.167
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:47:39.167 --> 00:47:41.000
If not, I'll wrap up
with the last question.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.940
Where are we e for
dinner tonight?

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.850
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
Where are we eating?

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:44.650
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Well,
I know we're not eating.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.440
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Oh, I wish.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.148
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Well, we still could.

00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:48.580
But where are you for dinner?

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.310
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I'm actually
going to Left Bank in Larkspur.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.920
They're doing a dinner for me.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.109
Last night they did a
dinner at Camino in Oakland.

00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:55.150
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yeah.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.608
DAVID LEBOVITZ:
Which is fantastic.

00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:58.790
And tonight is
Left Bank, which is

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:00.470
a more classic
French restaurant.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.570
Camino, I've worked with
Russell for many years

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.510
at Chez Panisse,
whose the chef owner.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.774
And I just let
him do what I ask.

00:48:06.774 --> 00:48:07.940
He can do whatever he wants.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.570
And he added his own take to
my food, and it was great.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.577
I was like, wow.

00:48:12.577 --> 00:48:14.410
I was like, now I need
to go change the book

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:15.760
and include what he did.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.260
That happened to me in Seattle.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.430
But cooking's collaborative,
and is changing.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.560
So tonight they
sent me the menu,

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.360
and the chef wrote
to me in French.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.980
When French people
write letters,

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.000
is anyone in here French?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.304
There's a real, it's very hard.

00:48:28.304 --> 00:48:30.220
Did you ever have to
write a letter in French?

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.735
AUDIENCE: Very, very formal.

00:48:31.735 --> 00:48:32.610
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Yeah.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.794
There's all these salutations,
and you end it with,

00:48:36.794 --> 00:48:37.960
it doesn't really translate.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.679
But it's like, I end this with
my distinguished salutations.

00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:44.220
You're writing to
your cable company,

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.640
like why is my bill so high?

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:51.680
And you're like, I wish of you,
"Je vous en prie," yeah, yeah.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.424
So he's writing me these
things, and we just email.

00:48:54.424 --> 00:48:56.590
It's just [BLOWS RASPBERRY]
whatever you want to do.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.640
So he's doing a much more
formal interpretation.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.140
And a friend of mine who
writes about vegetarian cooking

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.870
did a dinner there
the other night.

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.960
She's like, I didn't
recognize the food,

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.300
because it was his
own interpretation.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.740
Which is great, that's great.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.550
I love it.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.716
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Awesome.

00:49:11.716 --> 00:49:14.910
Well the next time, you and I
can go to Delfina or something

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.520
again.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.390
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I
have an in, I just

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.510
found out I have an
in at the hottest

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.030
restaurant in San Francisco.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.540
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Which one?

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.176
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I can't
tell you on camera.

00:49:21.176 --> 00:49:21.990
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Oh, OK.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.280
Well, we'll do it
when the camera--

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.446
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I have the
chef's cell phone number.

00:49:25.446 --> 00:49:26.620
The power of the internet.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.100
I was like, does anyone know--

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:28.890
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: How fancy.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:29.580
DAVID LEBOVITZ: I'm
not going to go.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.050
I actually, I'm a firm
believer in democracy.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.660
So I think I should have
the chance everyone else--

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.451
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I
have to call bullshit

00:49:36.451 --> 00:49:40.600
on that, because I remember
last couple times ago,

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.410
you called us.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.285
And you're like, can
you get us into Delfina?

00:49:43.285 --> 00:49:45.380
And I think our
response was just that.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.850
If anybody can get
into Delfina, you can.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:49.470
And I don't know,
I think we ended up

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:50.469
getting the reservation.

00:49:50.469 --> 00:49:52.570
But to hell with democracy
on that one, right?

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.580
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Well
I'm traumatized.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.038
Because years ago,
a friend of mine

00:49:55.038 --> 00:49:56.710
opened a restaurant
in San Fransisco.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.590
It became really hot.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:58.980
She goes well, if you
ever want to get in,

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.530
just tell them you're
a friend of mine.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.080
So I called up.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.395
I'm like hi, I'd like a
reservation for Thurs-- they're

00:50:03.395 --> 00:50:04.502
like, we're all booked.

00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:06.210
I'm like well, I'm a
friend of so and so.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.830
The woman said, oh sure you are.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.080
After that, I was like oh god.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.990
I'm never doing that again.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.490
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Well, with
that David, thank you so much

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:16.910
for coming by to Google, we
really appreciate having you.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.460
DAVID LEBOVITZ: Thank you.
