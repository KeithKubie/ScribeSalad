my god it's a very big question right we
believe that the causes of the crisis

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:01.070
believe that the causes of the crisis
 

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.360
believe that the causes of the crisis
were majoring balances including what

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:04.370
were majoring balances including what
 

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.730
were majoring balances including what
happened in the financial market some

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:06.740
happened in the financial market some
 

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.250
happened in the financial market some
kind of erratic behavior and we have

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:09.260
kind of erratic behavior and we have
 

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.080
kind of erratic behavior and we have
seen this year in United States but also

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.090
seen this year in United States but also
 

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.330
seen this year in United States but also
in Europe and because of the

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:13.340
in Europe and because of the
 

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.520
in Europe and because of the
globalization that had of course a very

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.530
globalization that had of course a very
 

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.160
globalization that had of course a very
much stronger global impact and before

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.170
much stronger global impact and before
 

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.680
much stronger global impact and before
so in a way these crises unprecedented

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:20.690
so in a way these crises unprecedented
 

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.650
so in a way these crises unprecedented
by its global nature so this was the

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:23.660
by its global nature so this was the
 

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.580
by its global nature so this was the
origin or the deep cause Lehman Brothers

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:27.590
origin or the deep cause Lehman Brothers
 

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.830
origin or the deep cause Lehman Brothers
was of course the demonstration the

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840
was of course the demonstration the
 

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.460
was of course the demonstration the
trigger but the causes of the crisis

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.470
trigger but the causes of the crisis
 

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.220
trigger but the causes of the crisis
were much deeper it had to do it hence

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
were much deeper it had to do it hence
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.590
were much deeper it had to do it hence
it has to do also with very high levels

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600
it has to do also with very high levels
 

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.610
it has to do also with very high levels
of debt that's why we are now addressing

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:42.620
of debt that's why we are now addressing
 

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.130
of debt that's why we are now addressing

the reality is that in face of these

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.330
the reality is that in face of these
 

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.810
the reality is that in face of these
crises there was not coming back to full

measures so initially we believed it was
 

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:46.810
measures so initially we believed it was
important also to avoid the most

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:46.820
important also to avoid the most
