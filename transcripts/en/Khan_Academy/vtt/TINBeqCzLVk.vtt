00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.580
Use the points 0 comma 2,
2 comma 8, and x comma y,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.387
on the blue line in the graph
below to complete the equation.

00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:11.220
And they have this first
equation, y minus 2

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.020
over x is equal to blank.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.520
And then they say
write the equation

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.520
of the line in the form
y equals mx plus b.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.325
So we have a line here and
they give us two exact points,

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:22.950
and then they tell
us one general point

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.200
in terms of x comma y.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200
Although the way they've
drawn it on the diagram

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.310
it looks like it's the point
negative 3 comma negative 7,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.450
but we'll assume
that we don't know

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.930
what those are, that those
are just two general points.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.720
And what we want to do is
figure out what this ratio is.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.300
And then we need to figure
out the equation of the line.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.800
Well, a good place
to start is just

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.080
figure out the common ratio
between our change in y

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.687
and our change in x between
any two points in the line.

00:00:48.687 --> 00:00:49.770
So let's think about that.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.260
If I were to go from point 0
comma to 2, to point 2 comma 8,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.300
what's going to
be my change in x?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.450
So my change in x
is just like that.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.821
So my change in x
is equal to-- well

00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.270
to go from x equals
0 to x equals 2,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.829
you had to go up two
in the x direction,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.870
or you have to go to the
right two, I should say,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.280
in the x direction.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.290
And our change in y--
well, we're going from y

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.240
equals 2 to y equals 8.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.170
So our change in y, if you're
going to go from 2 to 8,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.780
your change in y--
remember triangle y,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.470
this literally is the Greek
letter for delta, delta y,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.820
is just a shorthand for
saying your change in y--

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.870
well I went from 2
to 8 is equal to 6.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.340
So if you construct a
right triangle like this,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.830
this side's length is 6,
this side's length is 2,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.110
and the ratio of this
height to this base

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.330
is going to be the
slope of your line.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:56.050
So delta y over delta x over
delta x is equal to 6 over 2,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.600
which is equal to 3.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.630
So what do we do with this?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.870
How does this answer
either of those questions?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.970
Well, this ratio, your change
in y-- your change in height--

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970
versus your change in the
base right over here--

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.590
versus your change
in x-- is going

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.150
to be constant for any
right triangle constructed

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.696
this way on this line.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:21.070
So for example, when you're
going-- this right over here,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.610
y minus 2 over x.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.840
Let's think about it
a little bit more.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.100
If I were to go from the point
x comma y to the point right

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.900
here, which is the point 0 comma
2, what would my change in x

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.790
be?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.560
So my change in x is going
to be equal to-- well

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:51.150
if I end up at x equals 0,
and I started at x, my change

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.989
in x is going to be 0 minus x.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.530
And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, just think about it.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.890
If x is negative 3,
then our change in x

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.720
is 0 minus negative
3, which is 3.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.320
The length of the side of the
triangle right over here is 3.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.690
Now, let's think about the
height, our change in y.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.390
Well, our change in y--
we end up at a y equals 2,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.657
so it's going to be 2 minus
whatever our original y is.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.990
And it looks like, if you
just eyeball it at this point,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.830
it looks like it's
at about negative 7.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.210
And if you have 2 minus
negative 7 you get 9,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.670
and this indeed has length 9.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.470
So this ratio, delta
y over delta x,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.760
should be constant for any
right triangle constructed

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.760
like this where the
hypotenuse is the line itself.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.040
So delta x over delta y-- or I
should say delta y over delta

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.380
x, the ratio of this
side to this side,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.700
is always going to be the same.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.150
These are all similar triangles.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.566
It's going to have the same
ratio as this right over here.

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:59.920
So change in y is 2 minus y.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.830
Change in x is 0 minus x.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.440
This is going to
have the same ratio.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.834
It's going to be 6 to
2, or 3 to 1, or just 3.

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:10.250
Now you're saying,
wait, Sal, that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.540
still doesn't
answer my question.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.070
Even if I get this
0 out of the way

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.890
I could write 2 minus y is
equal to negative x, or 2 minus

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.550
y over negative x is equal to 3.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.957
But how does this get us to
this ratio right over here?

00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:27.290
Well, if you multiply this
numerator and the denominator

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.820
by a negative sign-- so if you
just multiply the numerator

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.569
and the denominator
by a negative sign--

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.610
as long as you're doing
the same to the numerator

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.110
and denominator,
you're not changing

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.410
the value of this expression.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.040
In the numerator
you'll get y minus 2,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.604
and in the denominator negative
1 times negative x is x.

00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:45.520
Well, that's still going
to be the same ratio.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.170
That's still going to be 3.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.980
So this right over
here is going to be 3.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.100
And then they say write
the equation in the form y

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.120
equals mx plus b.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.090
So when you have an equation
in the form y equals mx plus b,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.190
this term right
over here, this is

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.760
that ratio we've
been dealing with.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.440
This says, hey,
every time I increase

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.400
x by some amount how much
am I increasing y by?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.960
This is your slope
here, and so we

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.110
know that this is going to
be of the form y is equal

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.840
to-- I want to do it
in that black color--

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.130
y is equal to our
slope, for this line is

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.470
3 is equal to 3x plus b.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.520
And now we have to
figure out what b is.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.029
And what helps us in
this is to recognize

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.570
that they've given
us several points.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.070
They tell us what happens--
well, when x is 0, y is 2.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.680
When x is 2, y is 8.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.205
So we can use any one of
those points to solve for b.

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:47.520
I like using x
equals 0, y equals 2

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.330
because it cancels this
term out very nicely.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.730
So we know that when x
is equal to 0, y is 2.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.960
Or we could say when y is 2, or
when x is equal to 0, y is 2.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.500
So 3 times 0 plus b is
going to be equal to 2.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.520
Well, that's just a
0, and you're just

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.780
left with b is equal to
2, or 2 is equal to b.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.490
So we're done.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.330
It's y equals 3x plus 2.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.570
So let's fill that in
on the actual exercise.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.140
So this ratio is 3.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.600
It's the ratio between a change
in height over our change in x,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.880
that's constant,
across the line when

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.550
you construct a right triangle.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.383
They're all going to
be similar they're, all

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:37.180
going to have that same ratio.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.850
And then the equation of the
line, in that form, it's y

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.390
equals that change
in y over change

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.990
in x, that constant ratio.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.720
Which is defined as
slope, 3x plus 2.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.400
This 2, which is where
you intersect the y,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.460
it is the value you
get when x equals 0.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.780
That's often called the
y-intercept because, you see,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.640
when x is equal to 0 that's
when you intersect the y-axis.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.860
So y equals 3x plus
2, and you could

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.090
verify that any of these points
will satisfy this equation.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.030
And we got it right.
