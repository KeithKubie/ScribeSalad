00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.690
UUUUUUGGGGGHHHH SOOOOO BOREDDDDDDD

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.660
My mom always said, "People who are bored,
are boring people," and whether or not you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.790
agree with my old lady as to the SOURCE of
boredom, you know you want to avoid it.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.640
If you're SOMEHOW unfamiliar, boredom, or
ennui, is a feeling of listlessness.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.600
An emotional state where you're uninterested
in your surroundings and generally unoccupied.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.820
If that seems vague, it's because there's
not a true scientific definition!

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.910
It was first described in 1852, so it's a
relatively recent cultural phenomenon, and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.850
new science says it might be a dangerous one.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.750
Research into boredom has found two types
of people are especially susceptible to boredom.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.079
First, people who are thrill-seekers, people
for whom the day-to-day just doesn't seem

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.300
to jazz them enough.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.370
These people find the world, "chronically
under-stimulating," writes the Guardian.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.480
The other group are those who shut themselves
off from the world due to fear or trauma.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.030
They live in their comfort zone, which turns
out to be a pretty boring place.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.580
In the end, a South African study, found boredom
was the single largest contributor to the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.810
use of drugs, alcohol and cannabis.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.350
Another study found when people were left
in a room alone without entertainment, they'd

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.869
willingly push a button they KNEW would deliver
a mild electric shock, just for something

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.049
to do.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.830
A third longitudinal study (my favorite),
followed middle-aged civil servants in the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.790
UK for 10 years, and found those who were
likely to get bored, correlated with a significant

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.320
increase in the risk of mortality!

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.810
Now, we're not saying boredom KILLS, but scientists
are saying, crushing boredom seems to force

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.150
humankind to deal with it, even when doing
so might be harmful.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.130
This seems sort of, counter-evolutionary,
right?

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.310
Why would we evolve something which causes
us to die sooner, start smoking or drinking

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.790
for no reason, or perform risky thrill-seeking
behaviors?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.430
Well, Evolutionary Psychologists believe it
has to do with curiosity.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.110
*Curiosity is the cure to boredom.* That curiosity
moved us off the drudgery of the everyday

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.200
and into trying new things, it kept us alive
and stimulated our brains!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.650
That curiosity is reflected in the saying,
"curiosity killed the cat," sure we might

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.180
come to harm, but our pushing might make us
better too!

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.700
Studies done with people who are encouraged
into ennui, end up finding vast creative resources.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.450
Being constantly entertained and stimulated
isn't good for the brain, any more than a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.480
lack of activity would be.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.930
Boredom, or a lull in stimulation, might seem
terrible to start, but it's actually fantastically

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.440
mentally beneficial.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.930
In a British study, people encouraged into
ennui while in the lab, were given menial

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.930
tasks.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.020
Half were told they had to copy numbers out
of a telephone book -- UGH -- and then had

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.420
to think of things to do with two styrofoam
cups -- HMM -- the other half just got the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
cups.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.230
Those who were asked to copy numbers first,
were way more creative!

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.940
Boredom allows for mind-wandering and daydreaming!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.010
It allows us to organize our thoughts, dwell
and mull.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.930
Boredom is like anything, too much of a good
thing can lead us to take unnecessary risk,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.000
but without boredom we'd all just be boring
people.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.750
Looks like my Mom was wrong, but only a bit.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.610
Sometimes I'll turn off my music and just
people-watch on the train, or put down my

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.060
book and look at the clouds.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.980
You be surprised what your brain comes up
with!

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.820
Do you ever try justâ€¦ being bored?
