00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's spell out what this first term means --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(t + h + 1)³--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
here comes the trick -- I write it as

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.000
((t + 1) + h) * ((t + 1) + h) * ((t + 1) + h).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I just reshuffled the different terms --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
t + 1 + h, t + 1 + h and 3 factors of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that sort gives the 3rd power.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What do i get? (t + 1) * (t + 1) * (t + 1) = (t + 1)³.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Then I get terms of that sort--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
h * (t + 1) * (t + 1),

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
h * (t + 1) * (t + 1) is, of course, (t + 1)².

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How many terms of that sort do I get?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
h * this one * this one is one of that sort.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(t + 1) * h * (t + 1);

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
second one, and (t + 1) * (t + 1) * h;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a third one, 3 terms of that type plus everything else has h² in it --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
h * h * (t + 1) or (t + 1) * h * h

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or even h * h * h,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, whatever happens to appear next is the h² times something.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So what do we get?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:54.000
1/h times -- (t + 1)³, (t + 1)³ cancels -- 3h(t + 1)² + h² times something.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And look what happens -- we divide by h,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
h/h cancels, h²/h becomes h,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and in the end, we are left with 3(t + 1)², and this term is negligible.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So the answer would be 3(t + 1)².

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Of course, you may already know that there's tons

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of rules how to compute derivatives.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In the end, they're just shortcuts of such computations.
