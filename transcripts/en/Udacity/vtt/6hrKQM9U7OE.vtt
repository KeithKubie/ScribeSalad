00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.400
Now having the body object from inclusion is good, but it lacks specific

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.315
information that allows us to react with our game logic code. As such, we need

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:12.450
some way to correlate a body to an entity that created that body. Now there's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.057
number of ways to do this. We could create hash tables and lookups and all this

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:18.860
other stuff. Or, we can use one of the interesting nuances of box 2D,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.388
specifically physics bodies in box 2D contain a user data property that can

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:27.795
point to any other object in memory, or some subset of data. For our purposes,

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.504
we're going to use that member and assign it to whatever the owning entity is

00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:34.454
for this body. That way, when a collision call back occurs, each body will have

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:37.430
a pointer to its owning entity, allowing us to do game-specific logic as we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.416
need to. To get started with this, we need to modify the physics engine addBody

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:46.007
code, and assign body.userData if a userData variable has been passed in as

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.210
part of the calling settings to this function.
