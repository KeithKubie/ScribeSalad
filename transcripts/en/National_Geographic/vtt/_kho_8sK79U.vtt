00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.176
Let's move across the
Indian Ocean to the Maldives.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.978
<i> This is actually
 the first story I ever did</i>

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.181
<i> for</i> National Geographic
<i> magazine in 2008.</i>

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.984
<i> And I met Guy Stevens.
 He's a Manta ray researcher.</i>

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:21.087
<i> And he had discovered
 what he reckoned was</i>

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.656
<i> the world's biggest manta
 ray feeding aggregation</i>

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.157
<i> in the world, and...</i>

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.961
<i> the place was called Hanifaru,
 and he had a major issue.</i>

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.497
<i> And the issue was the
 fact that this site</i>

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.999
<i> was basically about to be
 developed into a marina.</i>

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.070 line:0%
He asked me to be the
first person to photograph

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.705 line:0%
his manta rays.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.606 line:0%
And basically, you know,
hopefully we were able to

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.541
use those images to try
to raise awareness

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.977
about this amazing,
amazing location there.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:47.313
<i> We had to travel in the
 Southeast Monsoon.</i>

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.883
<i> Now this is not the
 Maldives of your honeymoon.</i>

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.451
<i> It rains, it's dark,
 the seas are very rough</i>

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.021
<i> for us to get out to the study
 site using local boats.</i>

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.322
<i> The manta rays,
 they love it</i>

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.224
<i> because what happens,
 there's upwelling.</i>

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.259
<i> You know, a lot of nutrients
 pushed to the surface</i>

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.394
<i> and you know, a lot of
 plankton aggregate.</i>

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.330
<i> And these manta rays
 migrate there</i>

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.566
<i> from all across the
 Maldives mainly to feed.</i>

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.935
<i> Hanifaru Bay is
 basically this</i>

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.737
<i> sort of, little island
 on the bottom right</i>

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.472
<i>and then you have this, sort of,
 weird indentation in the reef.</i>

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.509
<i> That indentation makes for
 an incredible plankton trap.</i>

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.545
<i> And when the tides and the
 currents are just right</i>

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.280
all the plankton get
sucked into this bay

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.249
and it just gets
circulated in this eddy.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.485
And it just increases and
increases and increases.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.654
And this is where
the manta rays go.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.056
Now when the
plankton concentrations

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.224
are quite patchy and low

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.458
the mantas,
they're solo artists

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:33.593
they feed by themselves.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.128
Now, imagine you
are a manta ray

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.396
and the food is
quite patchy.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.330
There's a patch there,
there's a patch there,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.365
there's a patch everywhere.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.767
Now, they can
either swim through

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.001
and feed on the
plankton like this

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.403
but then they have to go all
the way around to come back

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.239
and by that time the
patch might have moved.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.907
<i> So they do somersaults
 backwards.</i>

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.575
<i> Like a puppy chasing
 its own tail.</i>

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:50.743
<i> They just go around
 because, I mean</i>

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.012
<i> that is the most effective
 way for them to feed.</i>

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.048
<i> As the plankton
 density increases,</i>

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:58.017
<i> they start to feed
 cooperatively.</i>

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.785
<i> They create these
 feeding trains</i>

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.521
<i> where one lines
 up head to tail.</i>

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.556
<i> Now why do
 they do that?</i>

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:07.493
Well, plankton can't exactly
swim away from a manta ray.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.261
But they can outmaneuver a ray.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.665
So, the plankton can actually
feel the pressure wave

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.468
of the manta ray as it swims.
And they can leap

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.870
a few centimeters upwards
or downwards.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.705
And they can leap over
the mouth of the ray

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.207
and then they tumble
down the back.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.542
Of course now all they do is

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.377
they've tumbled into the
mouth of the next ray

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:27.046
or the next ray or the next ray.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:30.516
So, it's an, you know,
a really efficient way to...

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.318
hunt down your food.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.386
<i> Plankton increases,</i>

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.588
<i> the water gets incredibly
 cloudy and milky.</i>

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.923
<i> Hundreds of these guys
 are aggregating now</i>

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.092
<i> and they're basically
 coming together</i>

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.327
<i> for something that's
 called "mass feeding".</i>

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.263
<i> Which is when multiple
 of these feeding chains</i>

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.631
<i> kind of almost connect and
 they create this sort of</i>

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.268
<i> crazy, in your face,
 mass feeding ballet.</i>

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.003
<i> Free-diving here is
 quite interesting.</i>

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.373
<i>You know, you have to be careful
 not to get hit by these guys.</i>

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.708
<i> You know, they are completely
non-aggressive but they're big.</i>

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.844
<i> Three, three and half meters
 or four meters of a wingspan.</i>

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.981
And they can knock you out, but
most of the time it's a ballet.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.350
You know where they are going
to be, they know where you are.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.019
And then...

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.920
every year once in a while
something weird happens.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.023
You know, these sort of ballet
dancers turn into drunks.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.726
<i> Bumper cars at a country fair,
 it's just things go nuts</i>

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.228
<i> and they start crashing
 into each other.</i>

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.364
<i>And something just goes horribly
 wrong with the choreography</i>

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.299
<i> and you know, and that's
 when you are in trouble</i>

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.600
'cause you're
sitting underneath them

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.769
you're holding your breath
and you're going

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.937
"Oh, no!"
And then you have to

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.673
swim slalom-wise
to get through them

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.976
without them knocking you
on the head, which...

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.144
never been hit by a
manta ray, which is, you know

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.213
knock on, is this real wood?
( audience laughter )

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.514
Knock on wood. Great.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.083
<i> Manta rays, you know, when the
 plankton's gone, they leave.</i>

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.085
<i> And there's a few enterprising
 rays that have figured out</i>

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.488
<i> that plankton hides
 on the seabed.</i>

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.990
<i> So they go down
 on the bottom</i>

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.858
<i> and they scrape their
 bellies on the seabed</i>

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.593
<i> and all the plankton
 pops up out of the sand</i>

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.462
<i> and gets vacuumed up into
 the manta ray's mouth.</i>

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:53.065
<i> So, you know, incredible
 feeding behavior.</i>

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.835
<i> This was published
 I think in 2008 or 2009.</i>

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.571
<i> And overnight, you know,
 Hanifaru and its manta rays</i>

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.639
<i> were kinda teleported into
 the offices and homes</i>

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.641
<i> of millions and
 millions of people.</i>

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.009
<i> With the article, a lot of</i>

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.211
<i> grassroots conservation
 movements on the ground</i>

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.747
<i> and you know, a very fortunate
 change of government.</i>

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.217
<i> Hanifaru became a marine
 reserve that same year.</i>

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.519
And the President himself
actually vetoed the development.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.423
So, today, you know,
Hanifaru is still

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.925
the place in the world for
tourists and divers to come

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:22.862
to actually observe this
fantastic manta ray aggregation.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.465
And it's not a marina for
super-yachts, which is great.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:29.302
<i>In the Maldives, manta rays are
 worth way more alive than dead</i>

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.737
<i> and I think they bring
 in millions and millions</i>

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:33.105
<i> in tourism revenue,
 every single year.</i>

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.541
<i> So as far as the conservation
 of manta rays goes</i>

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.479
<i> the Maldives really are the
 place to be these days.</i>
