00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.920
Watch the horse's legs.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.920
Which ones move together?

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.440
Now in slow motion. It's diagonally opposite
pairs.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.140
That's the trot. This one is exaggerated,
but it's the trot pattern.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
And it's not the only animal that uses that
pattern.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.920
The orangutan is in effect trotting upside
down.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.480
So we've understood two-legged animals

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.960
and now we've understood four-legged animals
but now we want the lot.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.160
We want to go to any number of legs.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.400
We certainly want to be able to get up to
six legs.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.760
So here we have a six-legged creature.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.860
Come on you. Here we go.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
There we go.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.360
Watch you move.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.759
Watch the pattern of his legs. It's a stick
insect.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.880
And it's moving its legs in one of the standard
patterns

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.980
that six-legged creatures move them.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.960
OK, thanks, Ilya.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
So, come this way.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.920
Now what we have here is a robot. This is
Darren Wen from the University of Reading.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.259
This robot is Elmer and Elmer, when he warms
up, is doing the tripod.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.460
It takes him a little while because he has
seen an obstacle, he saw the AT-AT.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.820
Come on Elmer, do your thing.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.440
Now he's doing a tripod, he's moving three
legs at a time.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.920
OK, Elmer, that's super. Let's turn you off.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480
Darren, thanks a lot for bringing Elmer along.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.600
[Applause]

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.640
So let's just sum up what we saw there.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.360
The insect with its six legs, there are certain
patterns,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140
Elmer was doing the tripod. The tripod is
like this.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.400
Three legs, the other three legs, but they
fit on the animal like that.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.220
It just moves three at a time, three at a
time, three at a time.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040
Nice stable gait.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.640
So what's the big picture here?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.240
What we want is to find out exactly why those
patterns are coming up.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.320
Now the way I've told that, I've made it sound
as if

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.630
it's all to do with these pendulums, with
the limbs, the legs.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.410
But it isn't really the pendulums at all.
It's not the legs.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.000
It's got to be the neural circuitry, the nerve
impulses that control those legs.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.180
Because when you have legs, it's the signals

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.220
that get sent to the legs that actually make
them move.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.600
So, we've got an electronic millipede.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.880
Had to switch him on.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.900
The electronic millipede.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.560
This is meant to be a kind of schematic
representation of the animal's nervous system.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.520
These lights are its nerve cells firing.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.540
You should think of them as linked together
in two long lines.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540
And linked across.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.400
And we can do the mathematics of those things
and see what the natural patterns are.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.720
And imagine also that the legs move when ever
the light lights up.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.560
This would be a pronking millipede.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.580
Not very realistic.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720
Now here's a more realistic millipede.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.460
Travelling waves of nerve impulses going along
the animal's body.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.620
And the legs would move in the same pattern.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.940
Let's just speed that up.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.120
Now we've got faster waves going along.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.320
Let me show you something interesting about
that.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:30.220
Suppose we just look at four of those nerve
cells.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.740
What are we seeing there? We're seeing the
trot, diagonally opposite pairs.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.560
And if we did that with a six-legged animal,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400
we're seeing the tripod.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.480
So see what I mean about there being universal
mathematical patterns.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.160
The same pattern of waves, depending on the
number of legs looks different to us.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.940
It looks like a trot, looks like a tripod,
it looks like a whole pile of millipede legs

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.420
moving.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.300
And in fact, evolution might have done that
for insects.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.520
We know that the six legged insects started
out

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.880
as creatures with lots and lots of segments.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.150
And they lost segments over a period of time.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.830
And if the pattern stayed with them as they
lost the segments,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.260
then you get the tripod.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.260
It's not so clear that that's true for things
like the horse.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.850
Because the horse did not evolve from segmented
creatures.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.080
The horse probably evolved like all mammals
from some kind of fish.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.780
But the real message here that we've learnt
is - it's all waves.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.800
It's all patterns of travelling waves. That's
the real pattern.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.920
Now that's what Meggie, the Sussex robot does,
too.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.500
Meggie uses the same sort of travelling waves,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.640
moves hre legs, just like our electronic millipede.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.740
So Meggie has been borrowing a trick from
nature.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.060
And now we've got the famous Royal Institution
wave machine.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.260
Which Pippy and Ilya will bring on.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.040
This is at least 50 years old.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.420
It's featured many times in these lectures.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.040
That's great, thanks.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.040
This is the ultimate in coupled oscillators.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.580
I waggle it at this end and the wave travels
all the way along.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.300
Here's our millipede.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.300
Just do that again.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.860
If I get too violent, it doesn't like it.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.740
Travelling waves.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.220
So that's the hidden secret, the mathematical
secret of animal movement.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.000
Travelling waves of nerve impulses going through
some kind of circuitry,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.460
just like the travelling waves of electronic
impulses going through the millipede circuitry.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.160
Let's just take a look at the millipede again.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.800
We look at the millipede, what we see is those
travelling waves of movement.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.300
The legs are moving because that's what the
nervous system is doing.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.880
And once we've realised that, you don't even
need legs.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.320
Here's a sidewinder, moving across the desert,
it's waves of muscular contraction.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.500
It leaves trails in the sand to show how it
moves.
