KARISHMA SHAH: Today I'd
like to say, not only

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.200
should you all be here,
but the technology industry

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.570
needs the insights,
perspectives,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.950
and ideas of females.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.900
And you all must be here.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.710
TINA LEE: I'm a strong,
ambitious woman.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.896

--to increase

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.260
the visibility of these
women and to come together

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.980
as a community.

SUSAN KOGER: You have
to take care of yourself

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.940
so that you're a better team
member, you're a better boss,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.359
you're a better family member.

KATHY PHAM: Some of these
things seem impossible.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.012

MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Trying
it and falling on my face

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.894
and failing in
front of everyone,

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.870
that's not as bad as not doing
it and having someone else

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.370
do it.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.000
BRI JAMES: We try to celebrate
kind of the little wins

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.662
along the way.

Because it's those nuggets
that, when you're in that panic,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.100
kind of carry you through.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.891
RUTH PORAT: How do we
make the organization

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.470

are at the center of innovation

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.150
in Silicon Valley.

it here and now.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.320
MIMI FOX MELTON: It is vital
that you as an individual

What story will you tell?

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.550
And who will you
inspire with your words

AREZOO RIAHI: While
challenges are global,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.069

fuel, since to me, all of you
