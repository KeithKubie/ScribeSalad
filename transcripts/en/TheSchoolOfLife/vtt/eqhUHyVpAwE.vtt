00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.480
in many challenges: personal and professional

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.300
we are held back by the crippling thought

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.960
that people like us could not possibly triumph

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.040
given what we know of ourselves

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.200
how reliably: stupid, anxious, gauche, crude, vulgar and dull

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.760
we really are.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240
we live the possibility of succes, to others

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060
because we do not seem to ourselves

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.220
to be anything like the sort of people we see lauded around us

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.780
faced with responsibility or prestige, we quickly become convinced

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.180
that we are simply: impostors

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.780
like an actor, in the role of a pilot

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.040
wearing a uniform, and making sunny cabin announcements

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.600
while utterly incapable, of even starting the engines

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.420
it can feel easier, simply not to try

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.980
the root cores of the impostor syndrome

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.340
is a hugely unhelpful picture of what other people are really like

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.380
we feel like impostors, not beacause we are uniquely flawed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.740
but because we fail to imagine how deeply flawed

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.940
everyone else must necessarily, also be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.100
beneath the more or less, polished surface.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.600
the impostor syndrome has its roots far back in childhood

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.960
specifically, in the powerful sense children have that their parents, are really very different from them

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.080
to a four year old, it's incomprehensible that their mother was once their age

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.620
and unable to drive a car, tell the plumber what to do

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.720
decide other people's bedtimes and go on planes with colleagues

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.840
the gulf in status appears absolute and unbreachable

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.840
the child's passionate loves

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.060
pouncing on the sofa, pingu, toblerone

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.460
have nothing to do with those of adults

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.580
who like to sit at a table, talking for hours

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.880
when they could be running about outside

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.300
and drink beer, which tastes of rusty metal

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.200
we start out in life with a very strong impression

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.440
that other people, especially competent and admirable other people

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.960
are really not like us, at all

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.580
this childhood experience

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.140
dovetails with a basic feature of the human condition:

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.460
we know ourselves from the inside

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.300
but we know others only from the outside

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.140
so we're constantly aware of all our anxieties, doubts and idiocies

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.200
yet all we know of others

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.300
is what they happen to do and tell us

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.560
which is a far narrower and more edited source of information.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.520
We're often left to conclude

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.040
that we are isolated at the more freakish and revolting end of human nature

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.520
far from it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.820
we're just failing to imagine

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.360
that others are, of course, every bit as disturbed as we are

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.100
without knowing exactly what it is

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.120
that troubles or racks another, outwardly very impressive person

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.120
we can be sure that it will be something.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.800
We might not know exactly what they regret

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.720
but there will be agonizing feelings of some kind

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.100
we won't be able to say exactly

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.560
what kind of unusual, sexual kink obsesses them?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.060
but there will be one

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.880
and we can know this because vulnerabilities and compulsions

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.100
cannot be curses that have just ascended upon us uniquely

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.040
they are universal features of human mental equipment

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.360
the solution to the impostor syndrome

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020
lies in making a crucial leap of faith:

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.060
the leap that others' minds must work

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.980
in basically much the same way as ours do

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.500
everyone must be as anxious, uncertain and wayward as we are

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300
it's a leap of faith because we just have to accept

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.240
that the majority of what we feel and are

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.260
especially the more shameful, unmentionable sides

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.280
will have a corollary in each and every one of us

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.440
one of the tasks that works of art should ideally accomplish

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.120
is to take us more reliably into the minds of people we're intimidated by

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.300
in order to show us the more average, muddled and fretful experiences that they have

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.860
that way, we would be helped to understand

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.160
that we're not barred by our vulnerabilities from doing what they do

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.560
that's what the philosopher Montaigne

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.600
writing in the 16th century

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.880
was attempting to do

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.820
when he playfully informed his readers in plain French that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.420
"kings and philosophers shit and so do ladies!"

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.980
Montaigne's point is that for all the evidence that exists about this shitting

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.220
we might not guess that these people ever had to squat on a toilet

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.640
we never see distinguished types doing this

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.060
while of course we are immensely well informed

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220
about our own digestive activities

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.580
and therefore we build up a sense

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.720
that because we have crude and sometimes rather desperate bowels

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.600
we can't be philosophers, kings or ladies

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.740
and that if we set ourselves up in these roles

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.080
we would just be impostors

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.320
Montaigne's example is a neat one

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.200
because despite the lack of evidence

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.340
we know that these exalted people

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.520
must of course excrete in exactly the same way we do

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.580
So, with Montaigne's guidance

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.740
we're invited to take on a saner sense of what

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.760
grand, powerful and beautiful people are really like

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.660
but the real target isn't just an under confidence about bodily functions

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.660
this point extends into the psychological arena too

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.040
Montaigne might also have said that kings, philosophers and ladies

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.680
are wracked by self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.600
sometimes bump into doors

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.400
and have weird, lustful thoughts about members of their own families

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.800
Furthermore, instead of considering only the big figures of 16th century France

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.860
we could update this example

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.540
and refer to CEOs, corporate lawyers, news presenters and successful start-up entrepreneurs

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.980
they too, can't cope, feel they might buckle under pressure

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.360
and look back on certain decisions with shame and regret

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.360
No less than shitting, such feelings are not what separates us from them

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.040
our inner frailties don't cut us off from doing what they do

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.240
If we were in their roles, we'd not be impostors

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.640
we'd simply be normal

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.860
Making a leap of faith around what other people are really like

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.060
helps us to humanize the world

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.640
it means that whenever we encounter a stranger

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.980
we're not really encountering a stranger

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.000
we're in fact encountering someone

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.400
who is, in spite of the surface evidence to the contrary

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.260
in basic ways, very much like us

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.140
and therefore, nothing fundamental stands between us

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.680
and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfillment.
