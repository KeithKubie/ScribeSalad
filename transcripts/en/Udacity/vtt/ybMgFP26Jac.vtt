00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.070
Alright, why don't you try writing a quick SQL query

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.630
of your own on the India aadhaar data set. What we're

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.150
going to do is read in an aadhaar data CSV

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.240
to create a pandas data frame which can be queried using

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.970
SQL like syntax. We'll rename any columns that have spaces

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.205
in them with underscores and set all characters to lower case.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.800
So if the columns names more closely resemble columns names

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.480
one might find in a table. Why don't you write query

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.500
that will select out the first 50 values

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.440
for registrar and enrollment agency in the aadhaar_data table.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.800
Your queries should go here. So that's how we

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.850
pull all of the data out of SQL database.
