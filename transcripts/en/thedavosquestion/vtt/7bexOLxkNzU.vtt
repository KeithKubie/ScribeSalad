&gt;&gt; Hi I'm Peter Galison. How are you YouTube?
And I'm a professor of Science and Physics

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.809
at Harvard. I've been at the World Economics
Forum and quite impressed with the seriousness

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.600
with which some of the environmental issues
have been discussed. But as for 2009, I would

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.980
say I think the environment will lose out
to the economy, but I think the hope for 2009

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.390
is that a longer term, five year say scope,
would be considered because if we're going

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.200
to change things with respect to global warming,
it's not going to be over the next six months.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.440
It's going to have to be over the next five
years with respect to the way we think of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.149
alternative generation power. The way we think
of the efficiency of cars. The way we think

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
of some fundamental issues that face us in
trying to reduce the carbon levels into the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.239
environment. Thanks.
