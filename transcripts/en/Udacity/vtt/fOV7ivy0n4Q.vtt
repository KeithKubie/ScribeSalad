00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160
All right, Michael. So, I think that brings us

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.740
to the end of what I wanted to talk about

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.340
anyway. So, can you help me remember what it is

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.910
that we've learned today? In particular, what you've learned today?

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.230
&gt;&gt; Sure. So, I guess the first think I learned is

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.350
that game theory can make you depressed. And, in fact, in

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.770
particular that my friend Charles, given the opportunity. Would totally drop

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.860
a dime on me just to save a month of incarceration.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt; Wait, no,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.470
no, no, I don't think you summarized that

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.080
correctly. Game theory is not depressed. It's depressing.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's a good point, that's a good point.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.880
&gt;&gt; And Michael is not cruel. He is the victim of cruelty.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.530
&gt;&gt; I don't think so. Because you want to know what the secret here is,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.760
Michael? You've got a little matrix of

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.230
numbers. Those number capture what's going on.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.410
The truth, Michael, is that, if we were in Prisoner's Dilemma. I would cooperate

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.010
with you because my utility is not simply the number of months that I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.980
would spend in jail. But it's the number of months you also would spend in jail.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.900
&gt;&gt; Oo. Interesting.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.180
&gt;&gt; So if I, the best way to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.395
beat Prisoner's Dilemma, is to change the numbers.

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:04.370
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see. It's like the Kobayashi Maru of game theory.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.700
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So there's an interesting question for you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.320
right there, Michael. If I had prisoner's dilemma here, here,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.600
let's write it out so you can remember. If I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.010
had prisoner's dilemma here, we already know that we're going to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.200
end up here, because that's what the numbers tell

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.580
us to do. But what we'd have to do

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.890
is change the game. So how would you change

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.450
the game in prisoner's dilemma? I see. So, if, if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.470
we're thinking about it in particular in terms of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.550
I care about how long you spend in jail.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.780
Maybe not as much as I care about how

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780
much I spend in jail. Like maybe half as much.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.441
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.660
&gt;&gt; Then, the payments shift, right?

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.950
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.210
&gt;&gt; So, now we have like minus1 and a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.180
half, minus 1 and a half in the upper left

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.880
hand corner.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Minus 9 comma minus 4.5, minus 4.5, minus 9 and minus 9, minus 9.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.820
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.390
&gt;&gt; So now that, that bottom right becomes a lot

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.120
less attractive if we actually care about the other person.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.360
&gt;&gt; Well that's, that's, that's, okay, I'm less depressed now.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.480
&gt;&gt; Except of course, that requires that you feel that way internally and that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.290
I feel that way internally. There's another

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.130
way that you could change the game here.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.490
Which is, what happens to sniches in jail?

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.280
&gt;&gt; They are rewarded.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.240
&gt;&gt; No. No they're not.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.530
&gt;&gt; They're punished.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.050
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.460
&gt;&gt; So, if your a part of the criminal fraternity, and you don't like

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.450
prisoners dilemma, then what you have to do is to create a system Where the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.860
people who snitch get punished. So it's not just the months that they spend

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.680
in jail, it's everything else that's going to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.840
happen to them if they drop a dime.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.450
&gt;&gt; So

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.450
you're saying that minus 6, minus 6, ends up being worse?

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.230
&gt;&gt; No, what I'm.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.820
&gt;&gt; No, the minus, wait, no, wait, what? Yeah. Oh, the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.060
zero ends up getting, oh I see the zero ends up being

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.470
worse. Because even though your not in jail your going to get

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.180
I don't know somehow thwarted or, or punished for your past behaviors.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.130
&gt;&gt; Accosted.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.090
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.540
&gt;&gt; That's right. So that's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.800
what you have to do and that works not just with criminals but with

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.110
the real world. Whenever your in this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.330
sort of situation like a prisoners dilemma,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.720
you can change the game by changing

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.460
everyone's utilities. Like for example hiring police

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.310
officer, police officers or hiring members of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.160
the mob to take care of everything.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.500
&gt;&gt; I see. So it almost seems like what

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.290
you're talking about is a kind of inverse game

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.600
theory, where if there's a particular behavior that I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.180
want to see. How do I set up the payments and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.760
rewards so that that behavior is encouraged.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.080
&gt;&gt; Right, and by the way that has

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.680
a name, and it's called mechanism design. Mechanism design?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.230
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.748
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understand either of those words. [LAUGH]

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.340
&gt;&gt; Well, that's where you're trying to set up the set of incentives,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.450
the mechanisms that you're using to pay people. You're trying to design them in

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.520
such a way to get particular behavior. This is what a lot of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.040
economics is all about. This is what a lot of government is all about.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.410
Tax breaks for example, for mortgage interest, encourages you

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380
to buy a home, rather than rent a home.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.590
&gt;&gt; I see, by changing the payoff structure.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.990
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.830
&gt;&gt; Oh that's neat.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.302
&gt;&gt; And so that's what we learned today. At least right now. [LAUGH]

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:03.780
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright. So, let's see. So, just to try

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.070
to rattle off some of the other things. The whole

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.390
notion of Game Theory. We talked about, especially the idea

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.360
that. You can think about a game as a tree or

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.070
you could represent it as a matrix.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.019
And, I believe you said, repeatedly, the matrix

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.529
has everything. Is that how you said it? Or the matrix is all you need.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.029
&gt;&gt; Yip!

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.870
Let's see. We talked about minimax and maximin.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.735
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:32.830
&gt;&gt; We, we relaxed a bunch of constraint on games.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.365
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:37.160
&gt;&gt; So we, we looked at both perfect and hidden information.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.745
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.870
&gt;&gt; We looked at both zero sum and non zero sum.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.581
&gt;&gt; We learned a lot today. We looked at deterministic

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.650
and [UNKNOWN] I would want to say, but you called it non-deterministic.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.410
And assuming that we can get rid of the first two

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.110
bullet items that look like maybe they were jokes. I would suggest

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.130
saying things like, we talked about what strategies are and that they

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.610
come in different flavors. We talked about the evil prisoners dilemma game.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.697
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. What else? You gotta give me more, otherwise it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:14.520
&gt;&gt; Oh, more, good point. Andrew Moore gave lots of really good examples that

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.153
&gt;&gt; yes.

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:18.240
&gt;&gt; Michael may be cruel, but Andrew Moore is awesome.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.290
&gt;&gt; He's more cool than me. Andrew Moor is very

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.470
cool. All of the examples that we've used today, or almost

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.580
all of the examples we used today actually come from

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.500
Andrew Moore's slides. Andrew Moore is a professor at Carnegie Mellon

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.388
or at least he was before he went off to

00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:35.960
Google. And is a really smart guy who cares very much

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.500
about machine learning. And game theory and produced a bunch

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.420
of slides that it turns out lots and lots of people

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.720
use in their own courses. And his examples were so good for game theory. That I

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.980
decided to coop them with his permission of

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.550
course. He tells everyone that they may use them.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.820
And, in fact, we have pointers to the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.780
slides in the resources links and folders for all

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.080
of you to look at. And I recommend

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.490
that you do. Did we learn anything else, Michael?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.810
&gt;&gt; The only other thing that I would want to

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.290
mention is NASH which is a concept that is nashtastic.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.280
&gt;&gt; It is nashtastic.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.240
There are by the way, I should mention briefly. Other kinds

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.890
of equilibria concepts they're beyond the scope of this class. But

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.030
there's a whole lot more to game theory as you might

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.830
imagine. And sometimes when they ask you to in these situations where

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.720
you can't do what you want to do, you end up in

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.340
these prisoner's lemonade situations. Other kinds of equilibria can get you

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.200
out of it. And I'm going to argue without explaining why

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.590
that the way that they get around this is by introducing Other

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.520
ways of doing various kinds of communication. and, in fact, I claim they're

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.150
a particular part of mechanism design. But that's a topic for another day.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.350
&gt;&gt; Okay. Fair enough.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. Did we learn anything else, Michael?

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.420
&gt;&gt; I don't know. That's what I was thinking about. I mean, that seems

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.480
like a lot to absorb. And, the other thing is that repeated games, even

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.950
the prisoner's dilemma kind of unravel if you know when the end. And I

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.960
was going to look into what happens if you don't know when they're going to end.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.700
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I guess,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.760
that will be something that we will learn. Next time.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.110
&gt;&gt; Right, what we, what will we have will learned?

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.220
&gt;&gt; Yes. Future past tense.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.811
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:07.650
&gt;&gt; Alright, Michael, well, I think that's about it.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.800
At least my brain is full. So I will talk

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.590
to you next time, and you get to lead what

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.770
I believe is the last full lesson of the course.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, exciting. It is excuiting. Alright, well bye

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.530
Michael. You have fun. I'll see you next time.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.050
&gt;&gt; Alright. Bye Charles.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.840
&gt;&gt; Bye.
