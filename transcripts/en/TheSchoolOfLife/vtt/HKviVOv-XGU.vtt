00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.890
For intense periods of our lives, we suffer
the agony of unrequited love. Our sorrow is

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.420
accompanied by a certainty that if only the
elusive being would return our smiles, come

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.610
for dinner or marry us, we would know bliss.
Epochal happiness seems tantalisingly close,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.320
wholly real and yet maddeningly out of reach.
At such moments, we are often counselled to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.500
try to forget the beloved. We should – given
their lack of interest – try to think of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.300
something or someone else. Yet this kindness
is deeply misguided. The cure for love does

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.160
not lie in ceasing to think of the fugitive
lover, but in learning to think more intensely

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.980
and constructively about who they might really
be. From close up, every human who has ever

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.219
lived proves deeply challenging. We are all
– at close quarters – trying propositions.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.329
We are short-tempered, vain, deceitful, crass,
sentimental, woolly, cold, over-emotional

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.090
and chaotic. What prevents us from holding
this in mind in relation to certain people

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.930
is simply a lack of knowledge. We assume – on
the basis of a few charming outside details

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.960
– that the target of our passion may miraculously
have escaped the fundamentals of the human

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.360
condition. They haven’t. We just haven’t
got to know them properly. This is what makes

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.080
unrequited love so intense, so long-lasting
and so vicious. By preventing us from properly

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.370
growing close to them, the beloved also prevents
us from tiring of them in the cathartic and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.540
liberating manner that is the gift of requited
love. It isn’t their charms that are keeping

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.580
us magnetised; it is our lack of knowledge
of their flaws. The cure for unrequited love

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.240
is, in structure, therefore very simple. We
must get to know them better. The more we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.190
discovered of them, the less they would ever
look like the solution to all our problems.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.900
We would discover the endless small ways in
which they were irksome; we’d get to know

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.840
how stubborn; how critical; how cold and how
hurt by things that strike us as meaningless

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.909
they could be. That is, if we got to know
them better, we’d realise how much they

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:15.879
had in common with everyone else. Passion
can never withstand too much exposure to the

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.719
full reality of another person. The unbounded
admiration on which it is founded is destroyed

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:27.519
by the knowledge which a properly shared life
inevitably brings. The cruelty of unrequited

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.410
love isn’t really that we haven’t been
loved back, rather it’s that our hopes have

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.489
been aroused by someone who can never disappoint
us, someone who we will have to keep believing

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.561
in because we lack the knowledge that would
set us free. We must, in the absence of a

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:48.300
direct cure, undertake an imaginative one.
We must accept, without quite knowing the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.790
details, that they would, of course, eventually
prove decisively irritating. Everyone does.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.250
We have to believe this not because we know
it exactly of them, but because they are – in

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.629
the end – human and we know this dark but
deeply cheering fact about everyone who has

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.480
ever lived.
