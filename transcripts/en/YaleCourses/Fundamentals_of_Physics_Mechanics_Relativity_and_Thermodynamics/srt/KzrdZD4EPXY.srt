1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,860
So today it's again a brand new topic.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,660
So if you like at relativity,
you would be in grief and mourning.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,520
If it got to be really nasty, you will
be relieved that that's behind us. Now,

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,680
and let me remind you one more time
that the problem set for relativity was

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,810
quite challenging because I had to make
up most of the problems and they're not

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:26,690
from the book.
So that a little more difficult.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,010
The exam will be much more
lenient compared to the
homework that generally true,

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:37,070
but particularly true in this case.
Okay,

9
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:42,071
so today I'm going to introduce
you to some mathematical tricks.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,290
As you probably noticed by now,

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,640
a lot of physics has to do with the
mathematics and if you're not good in one,

12
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,930
you're not going to be good in the other.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,250
And I just thought I'd spend some time
introducing you to some tricks of the

14
00:00:55,251 --> 00:01:00,251
trade and then we will start using that
first important trick is to know what's

15
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,780
called Taylor series.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Okay. I see this as greeted by
a booze and the hissing sounds.

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm not sure

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,300
what your past experience with Taylor's
city's water is and why it leaves you so

19
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,150
scarred. And uh, I'm happy.

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,330
My experience with Taylor's
thesis in positively positive,

21
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:30,610
and I don't think I can carry on any of
my things that not only the Taylor cds,

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,600
but I'll tell it to you Taylor cities as
we guys in the physics department tend

23
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,434
to use it.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,610
The philosophy of the
Taylor's CDs is the following.

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,970
That is some function f of X.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,370
And I'm going to drive that function,
something like this.

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,150
But I'm going to imagine that you don't
have access to the whole function.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
You cannot see the whole thing.
Uh,

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,420
you can only zero in on a
tiny region around here.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,060
And the question is,

31
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,590
as you try to approximate as you try
to build on a good approximation to the

32
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:14,570
function, oh, how will you set it up
so that you can write an approximation,

33
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:19,340
but this whole function valid near
the point x equals zero where you know

34
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,930
something.
So suppose I block out the whole function.

35
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:24,770
You've got mind and mental.

36
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:28,220
I don't show you anything except
what's happening here. Now that works.

37
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,530
I show you only f of zero.

38
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,880
That's all you had told.

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,390
The value of the function is 92
what should we do away from Mexico?

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,250
Zero.
Well,

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,560
you got no information about this function
or you don't know if it's going up.

42
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:49,910
If it's going down. All I tell you is
one number what is doing. Now it's clear.

43
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,820
The best approximation you
can make is a flat line.

44
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,170
There's no reason to tilted one way or
the other given the information you have.

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,380
So the first approximation, the function
you will say is ffx equal to that.

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,060
It's not equal to.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,530
You can put some symbol or that
means approximately equal to,

48
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,110
yeah,

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,600
but then if you have, it's like saying
temperature, today's mighty to at,

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,320
what's it going to be tomorrow?
Well,

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,460
if you don't have anything else,

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,910
you cannot tell what is
going to be tomorrow.

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,160
But if you know that this is fall and
the temperature's always going down and

54
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,250
somebody tells you,
I know the rate of change of temperature,

55
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,660
I know that as a up to date.

56
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:40,180
The rate of change of
temperature is something that
you can use that information

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,690
to make a prediction on
what it'll be tomorrow.

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,020
That is to say for values of x,
not equal to zero,

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,680
and let's denote by the
this falling symbol.

60
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,920
F prime of zero is the derivative,

61
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,820
which is the FDX at x equals zero and
you would multiplied by x and that's your

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,020
best bet for what the function
is away from Mexico zero.

63
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,610
What that does is to approximate the
function by a straight line with the right

64
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,430
intercept and the right slope by right,

65
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,490
I mean Matt says what you
know about the exact function

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,230
and if it turns out the function really
was the straight line, you're done.

67
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,210
It's not even an approximation.

68
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,280
It'll track the function all
the way through eternity,

69
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,070
but it can happen of course,

70
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,490
that the function besides to curve
upwards as I've shown in this example,

71
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,190
and this will not work if
you go too far for a while,

72
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,820
you will be tangent to the function,
but then it'll bend away from you.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,610
So it's really good for very
small acts and you can say, well,

74
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:47,360
I want to do a little better
when I go for the road. Well,

75
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:51,920
what does doesn't tell you
this approximation is that
the rate of change itself

76
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,030
has the rate of change.

77
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,480
This assumes the rate of change
is a fixed date of change,

78
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:59,690
which is the rate of change at the origin
and the rate of change of the rate of

79
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:03,350
change is the second date of it.
So if somebody told you, look,

80
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,760
here's one more piece of information,

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,070
I know the second day of it to go the
function which I'm going to write this f

82
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,180
double prime at zero,
what would that information,

83
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:18,220
you can build a better approximation to
the function and you will put that in x

84
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,063
square.

85
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,410
But the key thing is you
got to divide by two art.

86
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,280
If you like two factorial,

87
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,270
where do you d divide
by the two factorial?

88
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,510
Because your goal is to
take this approximation and
make sure it has whatever

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,730
you know about the function built into it,
right?

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,690
Let's check this approximation and
see if it satisfies those properties.

91
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,691
First of all at x equals zero let's
compare the two sites at x equals zero.

92
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:53,560
The lefthand side is f of
zero on the right hand side.

93
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,980
When you put x equals zero you kill
this and you kill this and it matches,

94
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,830
so you certainly got the right
value of the function. Then you say,

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,270
what if it take the data to have the
function at x equals zero let's take the

96
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:09,920
data to up this try and function are the
approximate function on both sides and

97
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,520
I take the derivative that being
a constant that's not contribute.

98
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,360
This didn't ever do have xs one.

99
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,023
Okay.

100
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,550
In the next one they'd ever,

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,560
two x squared is two x two x cancels the
two so I get amped double prime of zero

102
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,900
times x but now evaluate the
deliberative at x equal to zero.

103
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,340
Then that gets rid of this guy and the
date of it to all my test function.

104
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,700
Matt is the deliberate to what the actual
function because this is the actual

105
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,080
little bit about the actual function.

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,700
Yeah,

107
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,580
that what follows that.
If you want to say,

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,420
how about the second day they
went have this function, uh,

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,810
let's take the test function I
have or the approximation, take it,

110
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,630
second date of it too and make
sure that comes out right.

111
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,540
I don't feel like writing this out,
but try to do this in your head.

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,220
Take to deliver to them the lefthand side
and see what happens on the right hand

113
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,590
side. Well if you take one day
to rid of this guy is gone.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,020
If you take two derivative,
this guy gone.

115
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,440
And then if you take the first
day they have a TV, you get to x,

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,140
take the second derivative,
you get to the two cancels the two of you,

117
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,690
put x equals zero.
If you do,

118
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,430
you find that f double prime zero here
matches the secondary to go the function

119
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,323
on the left hand side.

120
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,970
So this two factorial is that to make
sure that the function you have cooked up

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,830
has the right value of the function,

122
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:38,390
that the origin has the right slope at
the origin as the right rate of change of

123
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,960
the slope at the artist. Well,
it's very clear what we should do.

124
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,710
If you had a whole bunch of derivatives
than the approximation we will write

125
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,560
will look like f entity limited.

126
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm cannot Dora and primes there.

127
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:59,441
So and means and sets primes extra the
end over end factorial and you go as far

128
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,820
as you can. If you know 13
derivatives, put 13 derivatives here,

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,110
that's an approximation.
That's not called a tailor cities.

130
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,790
That's the approximation to the function.

131
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,910
Now it may happen that sometimes we
hit the Jackpot and you know all the

132
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:21,830
derivatives. Someone tells you all the
databases of the function than white stop.

133
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,510
Yes sir,
I had them all up.

134
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,230
Then you will get the sum going from
the zero did ever do all the way up to

135
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:34,310
infinity. And if you do the
summation at every value of x,

136
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,150
you get a value.

137
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,780
And if that summation is meaningful
and gives you a finite number,

138
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,720
that in fact is exactly
the function you are given.

139
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,320
That is the tailor series.

140
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,130
Tailor cds is a serious with
infinite number of terms,

141
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,160
which if you sum up and sum
up to something sensible
will actually be as good as

142
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:58,190
the left side.
So let me give you one example.

143
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,090
It's famous example one over one
minus x is the real function.

144
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,320
Okay? You and I know this function. We
know how to put it in the calculator.

145
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:12,740
We know how to plot it. You gave me an
accent and I stick it to the denominator,

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,410
subtracted from one inverted.
That's the function.

147
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,640
But instead suppose this function was
reveal to us in status we a trolled f of

148
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,130
zero.
What does F of zero here put?

149
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,740
X Equals Zero F of zero is one.

150
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,600
Now let's take the date of it
to have this function. The FDX,

151
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,260
the FDX has a minus one because it's one
minus x to the minus one times square

152
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,590
than they did the data do with what's
inside this. That gives you a minus one.

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,860
This is simple calculus. How to take
delivery to have this fella here,

154
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,170
having taken the date of it,
evaluated at x equals zero this vanishes.

155
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,270
That becomes one and you get one.

156
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,110
If you're not, take the second
bit of it to have dysfunction,

157
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,870
which I don't feel like doing

158
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,430
and I evaluate that at x equals zero and
I'll find it as equal to two factorial.

159
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,470
In fact, I'll find the date of it
to at the origin to be n factorial.

160
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,440
Well that's very nice because then

161
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,480
my approximation to the
function begins as one

162
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,990
plus x times the first derivative,

163
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,790
which happens to be one plus
x squared over two factorial.

164
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,330
Time to secondary we'll do it happens
to be two factorial plus x cubed over

165
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:44,700
three factorial times three factorial.
So you can see,

166
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:49,460
but this guy is going,
it looks like one plus x plus x squared,

167
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,863
et Cetera.

168
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,850
The Taylor series is
infinite sound in practice.

169
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,790
You may be happy to just
keep a couple of terms,

170
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,080
so let's get a feeling for what does
a couple of times can do for us.

171
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,340
So let me take a x equal a 0.1

172
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,820
x equaled a 0.1.

173
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,420
The real answer is one over one minus
0.1 which is one over 0.9 which is 1.1111

174
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
et cetera.
That's that's the target.

175
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,910
What do you do with the series?

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The city starts at one time to one 10th
plus one over a hundred plus one over a

177
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,040
thousand and so on. And you can
see as I keep more and more terms,

178
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,140
I keep this filling up.
These ones,

179
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,730
if you stopped with one over a
thousand you stop right there.

180
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,200
So this is the exact answer.
This is the approximation,

181
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,300
but it's clear to you perhaps the simple
example that if you kept all the terms

182
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,800
in the series, you really will get
this infinite number of recurring ones.

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,980
So that is the function that
is a tailor approximation,

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,790
which is chop it off and I where you
want and there's a good approximation.

185
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,810
And does the Taylor series the
cities means some everything.

186
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,580
Now something an infinite number of
numbers. Is that the delicate issue?

187
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,370
I don't want to go there at all.
I discuss that in this math book,

188
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,540
but sometimes there's some makes no
sense. Then you got to quit. But example,

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,310
put x equal two to

190
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,980
the connect function as one minus two.
This minus one

191
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,460
I would approximation for next x equal
do to look like one plus two plus four

192
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:40,900
plus a what?

193
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,930
Eight and first of all this some is
going to grow to infinity because the

194
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:49,660
numbers are getting bigger and bigger.
This some seems to be all positive,

195
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:53,650
but it's a correct dancers. Negative.
Obviously the is doesn't work.

196
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,130
So the next lesson about Taylor cds is
you can write down the cities but it may

197
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:03,310
not sum up to anything sensible
beyond a certain range.

198
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,210
So if you're doing the Taylor series at
x equals zero and you go to x equal to

199
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:11,860
two, it just doesn't work. So you can
ask how far can I go from the origin?

200
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,720
Well,
in this simple example,

201
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,800
we know that a at x equal to one
the function just going to infinity.

202
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,700
That's why you couldn't go there and
you cannot go to the right hand side of

203
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:26,240
that point. The function is well
defined on the other side, but this cds,

204
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,490
there's knowledge that the function here,

205
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,290
it's not enough to get
you on the other side.

206
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,770
So this is a case where that are
obvious problems that x equaled the one.

207
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,240
But if I wrote a function like one or one
plus x square, that's a nice function,

208
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,770
got no troubles anywhere. And yet
if you took the sailors cds for it,

209
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:47,010
you will find if you go beyond
absolute value of x equal to one,

210
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,330
the cds makes no sense.

211
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,040
So I don't want to do that
mathematical theory of series.

212
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,840
I just want to tell you that functions
can be approximated by series and if

213
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:02,370
you're lucky or you can do the whole
psalm if you know all the data motives and

214
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:06,090
the whole sum maybe converge to
give a final answer in with guests,

215
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,930
it's as good as the function.
One guy can use one over one minus x,

216
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:14,250
the other one can use the infinity
cities and Marilee and mathematically and

217
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,410
every sin equal as long as they're known,

218
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:20,070
stray outside the region or
validity of the infinite series.

219
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,750
Okay. So, uh,

220
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,220
the most popular example that I've been
using in the class you'd remember is one

221
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:29,120
plus x to the end.

222
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,090
That's the function we can do it
staler series f of zero is one

223
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,590
what's the date? Two of the function. It's
n times one plus extra the n minus one,

224
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,480
right?
The FDX

225
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,100
is n times one plus extra.
The n minus one.

226
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,530
If I had evaluated at x equals zero.

227
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,220
It just an that's why we get this famous
result we've been using all the time.

228
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,500
If x is small enough,

229
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,050
you stopped it because the next time
is going to involve an x squared in the

230
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:05,980
next cube. And if x is tiny, we have
no respect for x squared and x cube.

231
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,550
We just cut it off.
But if you want an extra one of you guys,

232
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,630
you want to ask me what happens next?
We'll take the second derivative.

233
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,750
You can see n times n minus one times
one plus actually the n minus two if you

234
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,860
put x equals zero n times
n minus one x squared.

235
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,230
And don't forget the two factorial.

236
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,370
So what I've been doing is
I've been saying one plus
extra the end approximately

237
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:34,150
equal to this, but even if you
keep that as still approximate,

238
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,640
but it's a good approximation.

239
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,800
How many terms you want to
keep depends on how tiny exes.

240
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,530
Okay, so it's good to know
that's an infinite series,

241
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,010
but it's also good to know you can chop
it off and do business with a few terms.

242
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,720
In fact,
all of the activity we reduced as follows,

243
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,790
the energy of a particle is this,

244
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,750
which we can write it as MC squared times
one minus B squared over c squared or

245
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,560
the minus one half.
If you expand this in a power cds,

246
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,980
you're going to get mc square plus one
half MV squared plus stuff involving B to

247
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,470
the fourth oversee to the
fourth times the square.

248
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
We dropped all this and for 300 years we
did mechanics keeping just this stroke

249
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,210
just kept that first non trivial
Terman all of our collisions and so on.

250
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,740
But we did just only that
up to that point. So,

251
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,910
so the approximations that video useful
and they described nature approximately.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,630
If you say, well, I want to be
exact, you can go back and use this.

253
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,230
Unfortunately general relativity tells
you that that's not exactly that in

254
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,120
quantum mechanics still to
the whole thing is wrong.

255
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,550
So at every stage you will
have to give up something.

256
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,540
So I have a lot of respect
for approximations. If you
could not describe the,

257
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,740
well approximately you couldn't have come
where you've come because no one knows

258
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,780
the exact answer to a single question.

259
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,800
You can post asked me a question
and the answer is I don't know.

260
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,530
Second part,
the answer is nobody knows.

261
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,480
Because if your questions is give
an answer to arbitrary position,

262
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,200
any question to ask,
we just don't know.

263
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,290
Newtonian mechanics works
for small velocities. Uh,

264
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,610
all of the mechanics worked for any
velocity but not for very tiny objects.

265
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,530
Then you got to use quantum mechanics.
So always,

266
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,700
uh, theories get way the new theories.
And so approximations are very important.

267
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,160
So you have to learn this.
Okay,

268
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,010
so now I'm going to consider

269
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,480
the following function.

270
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,350
E to the X.

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,690
No, this guy is something you all know
and love because it's one nice thing about

272
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:55,320
the function is every
database is e to the x, right?

273
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,700
Every child knows you're the has got
e to the x assets didn't have it.

274
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,590
Why do we like that here?

275
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,440
That means all the bit of actives
are sitting in front of you.

276
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,210
They're eat the x and an x equals
zero e to the zero is one so every

277
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,810
deliberative is one. Then the
function is very easy to write down.

278
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,670
It is really one less x plus
x squared over two factorial.

279
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,090
Let's extra the three over two factorial
x the four over four factorial.

280
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,590
You can go on like this and if you like
to write use the compact notation is

281
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:28,921
extra.

282
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:33,921
The n o n n factorial and going from
zero to infinity at zero factorial is

283
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,800
defined to be one
actually e to the x.

284
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,700
If you ever forget the value of e

285
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,050
and I need to know the value of e because
when I locked my suitcase and check it

286
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,893
into the airport,

287
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,950
I use either e or Pi because they are
the only two numbers I can remember.

288
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,080
So if I forget the value of e,

289
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,680
I just say he is the same as the one.

290
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,170
I got one plus one plus one
over two dozen, one over six.

291
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,540
And pretty soon I'm telling the guy
scanning my luggage. That's my code.

292
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,550
And it's much better than any other
court because I cannot reconstruct, uh,

293
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,340
say my grandfather's name and
not get it right out in Minot,

294
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,840
construct my house at rest, at my
phone at risk. This doesn't change.

295
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,620
I've been moving it on all over the world.
This is a very reliable number.

296
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,900
No Pie is a good number,

297
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,980
but rule for computing pyre somewhat
more difficult by also can be computed as

298
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,230
an infinite series.
But this guy is very easy.

299
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,920
There's 2.77 something that is he okay
now he had a very nice property of the

300
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:44,410
cds.
It is good for any x.

301
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,880
You remember the CDs for one old,
one minus x,

302
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,750
crashed and burned at x equal to one.
This seat is always good.

303
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,520
You put x equals 37 million,
you got 37 million,

304
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,120
37 million cube. There's a million.
The fourth power, don't worry.

305
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,890
These factorials downstairs will tame
it down and make it converge and we'll

306
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,780
give you either the
whatever number I gave.

307
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,770
That's something I'm not
proving what the seed is.

308
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:14,190
Put either the ex no limits on validity.
All right?

309
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,150
Then we take the function course,
sign x,

310
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,800
of course I next we all
know and love is this guy.

311
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,360
Okay,

312
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,770
has got a period of two Pi,

313
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,640
but we can write a cities for it because
it's a function and what do I need to

314
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:32,020
know to write the cities for it?

315
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,110
I need to know the value of
the function or the origin.

316
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,480
So we know coastline of zero is one.

317
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,660
If you take the date of it,
dude,

318
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,230
you get minus sign and
it's value of zero is zero.

319
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,990
You take the one more derivative,
you can minus go signed zero,

320
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,440
which is minus one. And I think
by, and I have, you get the point.

321
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,250
Every other director will vanish
at the remaining delivered to,

322
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:59,440
so we'll alternate and
sign from one to minus one.

323
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,310
That means if you crank it out,
you will get one.

324
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,250
You won't have anything linear in x
because the Coefficient of that is signed

325
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:08,260
zero with vanishes.

326
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,820
Then you will get x squared over two
factorial plus actually the four over four

327
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:14,560
factorial and so on.

328
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,493
Okay.

329
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,840
The Cisco sine x,

330
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,670
if you cut it off after
some number of terms,

331
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,100
it's not going to work in the beginning.
One minus x squared looks very good.

332
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,800
This is one minus x squared
over to look like this,

333
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:37,480
but eventually this approximation will
go bad on you because x to the fourth is

334
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,310
just x to the fourth
and grow without limit.

335
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,690
No one's telling you this approximation
has a property that coastline is less

336
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:44,140
than one.

337
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,160
It doesn't satisfy that because you're
not supposed to use it that far out,

338
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,060
but if you keep all the terms and in
fact even though the exit the fort is

339
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:58,390
taking off, x to the minus six is saying,
hey, come down x date. The saying go up,

340
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,200
you add them all together. Remarkably
you would reproduce this function.

341
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:03,810
Yeah,

342
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,170
that he hard to imagine that the coastline
that we know as Oscillatory is really

343
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,063
this function

344
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,780
and I hope all of you know enough
to know how to find the series.

345
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,750
You should know the date of it too.
Of course sign is minus sign.

346
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,530
I did have two of sinus sign
and evaluate them or the origin.

347
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I say you can build up the series then
if it was similar tricks for sine x sine

348
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,590
of zero zero did a,

349
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,370
we have scientists course sine and cosine
of zero is one so the first day of it

350
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,700
was one that gives you this term.
Next one. One. Give me anything.

351
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,330
The one after that we'll
give you this and that.

352
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,900
This guy would go on like this one.

353
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,120
Okay.

354
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,720
Okay,

355
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
so these have CDs for e to the x cost
say annex and Synnex good for all x so

356
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,040
there's no restriction on this.

357
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,750
One of the really interesting things
to do when you are bored are stranded

358
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,290
somewhere and the airport is the
Taiko sine squared plus science square

359
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,510
squared, the whole thing at the square
of the whole thing and add them up.

360
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:15,570
You will find by miracle you will
get the one from the squaring,

361
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:18,360
the one and every other power of XL.
Keep on vantage.

362
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,650
Of course you will have to collect
powers of x by expanding the bracket,

363
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,640
but it will all counsel.

364
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,970
That's what I meant by saying this
series is as good as this function.

365
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,410
It'll be all the identities.

366
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,523
No.

367
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,900
Okay. Now for the
punchline thing, everyone,

368
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,110
some of you may know what the punchline
is. The punchline is the following.

369
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,530
Let us introduce without any preamble.

370
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,150
Right now the number I,
what's the square root of minus one?

371
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,250
All I expected. Why is that?
When I squatted I get minus one

372
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,260
if I cubit.
ICUBED is ice squared times eyes,

373
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:04,520
so that's minus eye.
An eye to the fourth is back to plus one

374
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,771
cause I the fourth.

375
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:10,860
This ice square times I
swear and I squared is minus
one so you could take power

376
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,910
survive. She'll keep jumping
between these values. It'll be,

377
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,910
I will become minus one. It'll become
minus side and become plus one.

378
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,150
That's the set of possible
values for power supply.

379
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,710
It'll be one of these four values.

380
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,620
Well then we are told

381
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,620
if you now consider the
following rather strange objects,

382
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,490
he put the I x
o x.

383
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,060
You have to agree is really bizarre.
He is some number.

384
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,040
You want to raise it to two that's fine.

385
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,180
Number of times number I
s a strange number, right?

386
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,910
It's this waiter to minus one and you
wanted me to raise e do a complex power.

387
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,040
What does that even mean?
Multiply e by itself. I x times.

388
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,210
Well that definition of powers is
no good, but the cts, what he did,

389
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,110
the x defines it for all x.

390
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,710
Then we boldly defined e to the x or
even complex values of x as simply this

391
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:17,150
thing. To the IMX plugged
in, place her bags,

392
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,550
and by that fashion be
defined exponentially.

393
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,270
So the exponential function
is simply defined as subway,

394
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,600
right?

395
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,600
He raised two dog used to dog one dog,

396
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,490
the dog squared over two,

397
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,120
that's the e raised to anything
is a cord for this series.

398
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,830
And now we raised it to barriers, things,
real numbers, complex numbers, matrices,

399
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,590
whatever you want your pet,
you can put that up.

400
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,970
Of course you got to be really careful.

401
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,210
You cannot raise erased the dog
because the units don't match.

402
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,970
There's a dog here and dogs quit.

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,250
So you should have divided
by some standard dog,

404
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,350
like the president is doc, take some
standard, but Napoleon's dog divided,

405
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,320
then you've got something dimensionless,
then it will work.

406
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,870
So as long as a, that is some dimensional,
this object, this is what we mean.

407
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:14,790
But he raised with that Mattson.
Fantastic. Uh, leap of imagination.

408
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,780
Hope to raise, eat whatever power
you like. Take the city as well.

409
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,190
Let's do the series.
Okay,

410
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,520
so I'm going to get one plus x
plus x squared over two factorial.

411
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,890
That's I x cubed over three factorial.

412
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,720
And I'm going to stop after
this last term. I actually,

413
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:39,720
the Ford over four factorial.
Keep going. Then what do you get?

414
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,640
Let's take the one from here. Uh,
leave this alone for a minute.

415
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,660
You're right.
I times x go here.

416
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,400
I squared is minus one.

417
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,470
So I get minus x squared over
two factorial than I come here.

418
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,870
ICUBED is minus I.

419
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,980
So I right here minus x
cubed over two factorial.

420
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,430
Then I go back here and write
extra foretold four factorial.

421
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,680
By now everybody knows what's going on.

422
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,810
Everybody knows that this is just
of course INX less ice sign next.

423
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,560
Okay.
This is a super duper formula.

424
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,390
Life cannot go on without this. You want
to draw a box around it. This one, uh,

425
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,450
dry because without this formula
we cannot do so many things we do.

426
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,130
It says that the techno metric functions
and the exponential functions that

427
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,060
actually very intimately connected and
he did all defined by the poverty cities.

428
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,180
You can able, you're able to prove this.
So this is the formula proven by oiler

429
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,490
and it's considered
very beautiful formula.

430
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,720
And here is the particularly beautiful
special case of this formula.

431
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,460
If you put x equals two Pi,

432
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,550
I get that it's an e to
the IPI equal the cost pie,

433
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,490
which is minus one plus I
signed pie with the zero.

434
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,830
So I get the result either the
IPI plus one equal to zero.

435
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,220
No,
everybody agrees.

436
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,940
This has gotta be one of
the most beautiful formulas
you can imagine involving

437
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:25,870
numbers are in mathematics.
Why is it such a great formula?

438
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,950
Look at this formula here.

439
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,330
Pi defined from the Egyptian times to
the ratio of circle to diameter I squared

440
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,600
or the minus one one is
the basis for all integers.

441
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,790
E is the basis for the logarithm.

442
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,040
Here's a formula in which all the key
numbers appeared in one single compact

443
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:45,874
formula.

444
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,780
So people think this and the fact that
these numbers would have a relation at

445
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:53,530
all is staggering and this is
the nature of the relationship.

446
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,570
This is voted Deimos formula most
likely to be remembered as formula.

447
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,080
Now we are going to use
not only the special case,

448
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:03,670
but we're going to use this all the time.

449
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,440
So you guys have to tell how
many people have seen this.

450
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,990
Okay.
If you have not seen this,

451
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,540
then you've got more work than
people who have seen this.

452
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,380
You got to go and you got to do all the
intermediate steps so you get used to

453
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:20,214
this thing.

454
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,390
Now let's do the following two other
variations and then I'll move on.

455
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,520
If I change extra minor sex,

456
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,660
then I get either the minus
I x cost center minus x is
course sine x and sign of

457
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:37,260
minus X is minus sine x so I
can get that to the relation.

458
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,220
Then I'm going to combine
those two to do the following.

459
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,880
I'm going to say that course x is equal
to eat the I x e to the minus x over to.

460
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,920
You can check that

461
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,450
and sign x is equal to eat the I x
minus e to the minus IEX over to I.

462
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,890
Yeah,

463
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,560
you just add and subtract these
two formulas and you get that.

464
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,340
Okay, so what does this mean? It
means a took not metric functions.

465
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,550
You don't need them.
You've got exponential functions.

466
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,130
You can manufacture trigonomic
function out of them.

467
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:33,400
Provided you're not afraid to go to
exponents with complex number I in them

468
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,990
and all the identities you know about
science and coastlines will follow from

469
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:43,190
this. For example, if they call
sign square plus Science Square,

470
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,310
you're supposed to get one where
they can square the right hand side.

471
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,930
You can square the lefthand side and you
will get one to get the one you bet to

472
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:55,610
the member of the following. Either the
IMX names, either the minus IEX is what

473
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,440
you don't have.
You come by and exponents.

474
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,470
You raised it to one power times the same
thing. Relation other power is erase.

475
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,470
Do I? X minus x either
is to zero, which is one.

476
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,220
When you raise that number to a power,

477
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,130
you multiplied by the number
of times a different power.

478
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,490
The product is the number two,
the sum of the two powers,

479
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,960
right powers combined to queue times
store the fourth store, the sixth.

480
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,960
That's true for two. It's true
for me. It's true for everything.

481
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,240
Exponents ad when you multiply them,

482
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,810
that's why either the IEX and even the
minus sign x combined to give you one.

483
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,760
Once you know that you can prove this.

484
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,433
Okay,

485
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,350
now I'm going to do a little
more of a complex numbers.

486
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,060
Maybe I'll leave this alone for now.

487
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,560
So I introduced you the number I by
saying it's a squared or the minus one and

488
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,890
complex numbers entered our life even
though we didn't go looking for them.

489
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,830
You can write down
equations with real numbers,

490
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,180
with no intentionally and
working anything fancy like this,

491
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,500
and you find that there's no solution
to this equation even though everything

492
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:14,150
that is completely real
are so you can say, well,

493
00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:19,151
x squared minus one and they can
manufacture a number I with the property I

494
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,800
squared is minus one. Then of course
you can have x equal to plus or minus.

495
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,820
I as your answer.

496
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,600
So complex numbers of errors by
trying to solve a quadratic equations.

497
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,110
So let me write you a slightly more
interesting quadratic equation.

498
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,520
X squared plus x plus one equals zero.

499
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,030
Okay,

500
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,200
so there's no funny business. All real
numbers. We want to solve this equation.

501
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,060
So if we go back to other good old a
sandbox days when we knew what the answer

502
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:49,894
for this was

503
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,180
a minus three over two

504
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,740
and be already have a problem because we
don't know what to do with square root

505
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:04,741
of minus three so we will write it as
square root of minus three we'll write it

506
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:10,600
as square root of minus one times square
root of three squared or than minus one

507
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:14,230
we will call I and we will say
this equation has two roots

508
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:20,790
explicit minus one I mean x plus minus
the two routes which are minus one plus

509
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,950
or minus square root of three I over to,

510
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,770
so one root is one minus,
one less rude,

511
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:35,771
three I over to the other old route is
minus one minus root three over two.

512
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,540
These are solutions
formally to this equation.

513
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,950
In the following sense,

514
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,150
take this x that I'm giving you
what that into that equation,

515
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,890
square the x and IDX. Stuart and I had
the one it'll in fact satisfied equation.

516
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,420
All you will have to know of when you
met it plated is that ice grade is minus

517
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:02,080
one. We've seen the one property you
can know solve a quadratic equation,

518
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,430
so people realize that if you enlarge
the numbers to include complex numbers,

519
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,670
then you can solve any polynomial
equation with that many number of groups.

520
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:15,550
If it's quadratic, it'll have two routes
which Kubik you'll have three routes.

521
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,420
They may not all be real.
They may involve the complex number nine.

522
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,160
Yeah,

523
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,400
no, very important point to
notice is that this whole thing

524
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,140
minus one plus root three I over to the
whole thing is a single complex number.

525
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,720
Don't think of it to some of two numbers.
It's a single complex number.

526
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,640
For example,
if this had been plus instead of minus,

527
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,380
you'd get something like one plus or
minus root three over to take the positive

528
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,800
route. You don't think of it as two
numbers. This is a single number

529
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,790
and that continues to be true
even if it's a complex number.

530
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,130
So you should think of
the whole combination as a
single entity which you can

531
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,200
add to other such entities and squared.
And so on.

532
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,510
Okay,
so that's what we are going to do.

533
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:10,511
Now we're going to generalize
this particular case and
introduce now a complex

534
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:17,891
numberZ and we're going to write every
complex numberZ as a part that is no I in

535
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:22,850
it and a part that has an I
in the example I had here,

536
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,230
x is equal to,

537
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,560
in this example x was minus one over two
and why was a plus or minus root three

538
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:32,474
over two?

539
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,190
Yeah,

540
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,210
and we are going to visualize that
complex as a point in the x y play.

541
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,300
We just met at x
horizontally and vertically.

542
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,810
Put a dot there that
your complex number z.

543
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Then we say a new complex number called
Z star and it's defined to be x minus I

544
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,060
why?
It's called the complex conjugate

545
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,500
complex conjugate of z is
obtained by changing the sign of,

546
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:13,501
I say feel like if z is sitting here is
he started sitting there reflected on

547
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,060
the x axis.

548
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,330
Okay,
so how does one work with complex numbers?

549
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,590
You add them, you subtract them, your
new, multiply them and you divide them.

550
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,200
If you know how to do that,
you can do with complex numbers.

551
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:39,730
Everything you did with real numbers,
so if z one is a complex number

552
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,340
that is equal x one plus Iwai one and
z two is a complex number that is x two

553
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,750
plus I white too.

554
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,950
We will define z one plus z two to be x
one plus y one bless I times I'm Saudi x

555
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:01,510
one plus x two times eight times white,
one plus white too.

556
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,570
If you drop pictures,

557
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,200
then use z one is that number and z two
is that number that [inaudible] really

558
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,900
it's like adding vectors.

559
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,170
This number is z one plus z two

560
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,830
it's exactly like adding vectors,
but you don't think of

561
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,930
this plus that as two disjoint numbers
but as forming a single entity in a

562
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:36,280
complex number.
Z X is called the real part

563
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,660
of z and there's been ordered by symbol.
Real Dizzy.

564
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,830
If you wanted to get to z, if we want to
get the deal part of a complex numberZ ,

565
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,390
do where there's complex
conjugate and divide by two

566
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,490
because you are adding
explicitly white minus Osi.

567
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,380
Why you get to x and divided by two
you get that. If you want to get

568
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,890
the wife just called imaginary part ofZ ,

569
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,880
Z minus z star divided by two one

570
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,140
it's like saying find the x component
of the vector is what automotive place.

571
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,570
I wake comprehensive vectors. Water
multiply multiplies Jay. Similarly,

572
00:38:20,571 --> 00:38:23,990
a complex number can be broken down at
the part with Israel and the part that

573
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,540
multiplies,
I extract the real part,

574
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,020
add to it the conjugate and divide
by two to extract the imaginary part,

575
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:34,430
subtract the conjugate and divide by two.
Again,

576
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:37,510
if you have seen you don't need this,
we haven't seen it.

577
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:42,430
It may look a little fast, but that's
why I posted on the nords, uh, in the,

578
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:46,510
on the website chapter five from this
math book, which has got all this stuff.

579
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,490
So you can go home and you can read it.

580
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,020
Okay. The next question is
what is the one times z too?

581
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Now that's very easy to calculate x one
plus I y one x two plus I wipe to just

582
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:09,930
open out the brackets and the
member I squared is minus one.

583
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,380
That's all you got to do.
Does that gives me x one x two that'll,

584
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,550
let me multiply the Iwai one times the
Iwai too and that gives me minus y one

585
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:20,544
white too

586
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,230
because I squared is minus one plus I
times x one y two x to y one the Soviet

587
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,520
multiply two complex numbers.

588
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,600
That's something very nice that happens
when you multiply a number Z by its

589
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,530
complex conjugate.

590
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,330
What happens when you
multiply Z by its conjugate?

591
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,760
You are saying take x plus
y multiply by x minus y wife

592
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,730
Oh a plus B times a million is
bs is square minus B square,

593
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,110
but remember these I why?

594
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,520
So when you take the square of that
should keep track of all the signs and you

595
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:07,230
will find is x squared plus y squared.
We denote that

596
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,300
as this and this thing
is called the modulars.

597
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,963
Okay.

598
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,140
Of Z. It's the length of the complex
number z just given by Pythagoras. Yeah.

599
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,020
You shouldn't have anybody take a
complex number. Multiply by age,

600
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:36,021
conjugate by its complex kind you get the
result will be a real number equal the

601
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,920
square of the length of the complex number

602
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,700
because I'm going to use that now
to do the last of the manipulations,

603
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,510
which is what does the
one divided by Z too.

604
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,380
How do you divide these
crazy numbers on the top?

605
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:55,820
I write x one plus Iya one the bottom.

606
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,460
I write x two plus Iwai too.

607
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,620
If I only had x two,
I know how to divide.

608
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,010
It's just the number the way
that bay doing that bakes too,

609
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:09,160
but I got the sum of these two numbers
in the bottom and you can ask how do you

610
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:09,994
do the division?

611
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,130
The trick always when you run into
this problem is to multiply the top and

612
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:20,131
bottom by the complex conjugate of get
up the bottle multiplied by x two minus y

613
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:21,670
to top and bottom.

614
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,103
Okay?

615
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,810
Then something nice happens.

616
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:31,520
That denominator because nominated then
becomes extra square plus white you

617
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,420
squared, which is an ordinary real
number. Nothing complex about that.

618
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,050
The numerator, you can open
up the brackets. I don't
know if I want to do that.

619
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,350
I just going to be x one x two plus y one
y two plus I times y one x two minus x

620
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,330
one no, don't worry about all the details.

621
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,480
All it means is if you know how
to multiply two complex numbers,

622
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,830
you can also divide by a complex
number. That's the key point. Why?

623
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,800
Because you've got a complex number,
dinner, not matter, you don't like it.

624
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,950
Multiply the top and bottom by
the complex conjugate of this guy.

625
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,590
The denominator turns
into purely real number.

626
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,820
So this whole thing could
be 36 for example. Well,

627
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,400
we know how to divide the
numerator by 36 right?

628
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,580
X One x two plus y one y two is on number,
maybe nine.

629
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,010
Then you would divide by 36 one forth.

630
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,020
This could be eight times 18
it will be 36 you get Iowa too,

631
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,770
so this number could have been
one fourth less. I over too.

632
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,500
So dividing by complex
number is not a problem.

633
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,520
Okay,
so now

634
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,300
why did I do all that stuff
today about either the IEX,

635
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,310
you're going to see that now the rationale
for going through that math is the

636
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:55,050
following,
so let's take this complex number

637
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,450
that goes from here to here.
That is explicitly why,

638
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,580
and let's introduce just like
we would for an ordinary vector,

639
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,790
this angle data and that length are

640
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,660
whenever they have a vector, you can talk
about the Cartesian components, x and y,

641
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,480
or we can talk about the length of
the vector and the angle it makes.

642
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,650
Then it's clear that x physical Arco
scientists and why our scientist over data

643
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:31,630
is now an angle associated with a complex
number which tells you at what angle

644
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:34,530
is located and art is the
length of the complex numbers.

645
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:37,260
So it's called a polar
form of the complex number.

646
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,560
Then you can see that
Z, which is x, bless I,

647
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:47,561
why is it going to our claims go
signed data plus ice signed data,

648
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,080
which you can know, right? This
are fine. Eat the ice data.

649
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,720
That's why we did all that work.

650
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,350
To tell you that a complex number
can be written in this form.

651
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,020
You can either write it as explicit,
why artists audio with the data.

652
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:08,320
They both talk about the same number
one prox about how much real partner,

653
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,180
how many imaginary part it
has other way of writing.

654
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,600
It talks about how long the vector
is and at what angled it is located

655
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,040
containing the same information so that
od is equal to if the inverse of this

656
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:25,041
formula is that are just square root
of x squared plus y square and Taito.

657
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,360
Yes, 10 in verse. Why are
would x, in other words,

658
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:35,040
Stan data y over x.
This is why this is rex.

659
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:37,683
Okay.

660
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,540
Now the advantage of writing a complex
number in polar form is the following.

661
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,940
Suppose I give you two complex numbers.

662
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,860
Xe One is odd one either
the ITA One and z.

663
00:44:50,861 --> 00:44:54,700
Two is art to eat the
right data to the product.

664
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:59,701
Z One z two is very easy to calculate
in this form because r one r two

665
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:04,360
multiplied to give you this and
the exponential is combined.

666
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,610
It's a lot easier to
multiply them in this form.

667
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,800
Then when I multiplied them somebody to
hear see threaded in this Cartesian form.

668
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:18,510
It's a big mess in polar
formative it easy little list.

669
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,960
If you want to multiply
two numbers multiplied the
lengths to get the length of

670
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:26,410
the new number and add that angles
to get the angle of the product.

671
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,980
So what I'm telling you is that if z
one looks like this guy with some angle

672
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:38,171
theta one and z two is that gave with an
angle data to the numberZ one z two has

673
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:43,550
the length equals the product of these
two langues and an angle equal the sum of

674
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,740
these two angles.
So it will look like that.

675
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,890
Do go from this to that. You multiply
the lengths and you add the angles.

676
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,510
So the polar farm is very well suited
for multiplying and it's even better

677
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:02,450
suited for dividing. If I
say, give me z one over z two

678
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:03,970
yeah,

679
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,220
well look, we can all do that
in your head. It's our one,

680
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,750
either the data one divided by
r two either the right data to

681
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,170
the modulus of the new number is just
r one over r two and how broad this eat

682
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,360
the Ita one divided by e to the I data too

683
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,640
dividing by either the [inaudible].

684
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:27,350
Same as multiplying by either the
minus I Taito. So this is really the,

685
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,290
I did a one minus data's too.

686
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,520
Okay.

687
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,410
So I'm assuming you guys can figure
this part out. One over Edi theater.

688
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:43,580
It's the same as either the minus I data.
Well,

689
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,410
if you don't mean multiply,

690
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:50,411
Cross multiply and all I'm telling you
is that one equals the [inaudible],

691
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:55,820
which you know is true when you combined
the angles. So when you got to the,

692
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,150
I take her downstairs, you can take
it upstairs with the reverse angle.

693
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,680
That's a useful trick. I hope you
will remember that. Useful trick.

694
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,560
So that is one part of this thing that
I wanted to carry in your head because

695
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,850
very, very important. When
you take a complex number,

696
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,000
he's got a length and
it's got a direction.

697
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,700
When you multiply a second
by second complex number,

698
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,990
you're able to do two things at the
same time. You're able to rescale it,

699
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,400
they'd be able to rotate it.

700
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,810
You'd be scaled by the length of second
factor and you rotate by the angle

701
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,070
carried by the second fight.

702
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,300
The fact that two operations are done in
one shot is the reason complex numbers

703
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:46,301
play an incredibly important role in
physics and certainly in engineering and

704
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:47,570
mathematical physics.

705
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,780
Okay. Uh, I'm going to now change gears,

706
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:02,781
but I want to stop a little bit and
answered any questions any of you have.

707
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,150
So how many people have seen
all of this before? I see.

708
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:11,640
So if you saw something you
saw the whole thing would look,

709
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,140
that's not such a big number.

710
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,530
So I am cognizant of the fact
that not many of you have seen it,

711
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,490
but you will have to go
and learn this today.

712
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,830
I'm going to post the problem set for
this some time in the day so you can start

713
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:30,180
practicing. Don't weight problems has
nothing to do with next Wednesday.

714
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,320
It has a lot to do with today.
I'm going to ask Santa problem today.

715
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:38,580
I imagine you're going, uh, breathlessly
you're out your room, not able to wait,

716
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,240
jumping into the problem set and working
it out because that's the only way

717
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:45,510
you're going to find out what these
things mean. If you've never seen them,

718
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,560
I've seen them before in high school
route taken a math course and you've got

719
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:52,500
lots of practice then
I'm not talking to you,

720
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,270
but I'm going to use this at some point.

721
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,790
So you should understand complex numbers.

722
00:48:56,791 --> 00:49:01,020
And I'm telling you there are very few
branches of any science where complex

723
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:05,010
numbers will not be used.
Or You may not believe this now,

724
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:09,270
but that is true. They make even an
electrical engineer. Absolute must.

725
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,650
I have to solve any kind of differential
equation which cannot occur in biology

726
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:18,300
and chemistry. That's
a must. So it was very,

727
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:22,800
very important. All right,
so now I'm going to do,

728
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,180
I'm going back to physics. No, laying
back from mathematics to physics.

729
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,240
And the physics of this topic for today
has to do with something very different

730
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,800
from the past.
So forget all relativity.

731
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,920
Now you're going back to Newtonian days.

732
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,200
Kinetic energy is one half Mv Square.

733
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,120
That's a little difficult to go back and
forget what you learned the other hand.

734
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,730
For some of you it may not be so hard.
If you didn't learn anything,

735
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,390
then you're that much ahead
of the other guys. Okay,

736
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:54,960
but so I remember now the truth
is that a little cubistic theory,

737
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,060
we're going to go back to Newtonian days
and the reason we do it that way is to

738
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:04,080
give you something interesting.
A hopefully compared to
what you normally do.

739
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,100
So what were you going to study now
is what's called small oscillations

740
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,100
are simple harmonic motion.

741
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,810
It's a ubiquitous fact that if
he took any mechanical system,

742
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,730
which is in a state of equilibrium and
they give it a little kick, it vibrates.

743
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,190
And if you've got a pillar
ceiling to Florida, hit it
with a hammer. It vibrates.

744
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,020
If you take a gong and he hit,
it also vibrates.

745
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,430
If you gotta a rod hanging from
the ceiling through a pivot,

746
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,200
it's hanging that if you pull it,
it goes back and forth.

747
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,820
The standard example.
Everyone likes to use this.

748
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:45,920
If you got a particle in a ball,

749
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,000
it's very happy sitting in the bottom.
If you push it up a little bit,

750
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,990
it'll go back and forth

751
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,270
and the example that we are going
to consider is the following.

752
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,470
If you have a mass am connected to a
spring and the spring is not stretched,

753
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,930
our contracted, it's very happy
to be there. That's what I mean.

754
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:09,890
But equilibrium equilibrium means
the body has all the forces on it,

755
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,930
adding up to zero.
It has no desire to move.

756
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,820
The question is if you give it a
little kick, what'll happen? Well,

757
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,350
there are two situations you can have.

758
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,720
You can have a situation where a
particle is on top of the hill,

759
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,310
let's call unstable equilibrium because
if you give that a kick is going to come

760
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,170
down and now going to turn to you.

761
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,440
That's equilibrium but
unstable equilibrium.

762
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,090
I'm talking about stable equilibrium.

763
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,580
That's because they're
the restoring forces.

764
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,920
If you stray away from the equilibrium,

765
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,880
there are forces bringing you back and
in the case of the mass in spring system,

766
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:46,310
the force m d two m a
is equal to minus k x.

767
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,400
And what is the equation tells you
is if you're straight to the right,

768
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,070
x is positive.
I love play a force to the left.

769
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,940
Remember this is Emma and this is f f
efforts such that it always sends you back

770
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,680
to your normal position.

771
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,930
So we want to understand the
behavior of such a problem.

772
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,130
You want to solve this problem?

773
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,583
Yeah.

774
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,080
So how do you solve this problem?
Well,

775
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:19,550
I did it for you long back when they
gave you a typical paradigm for how you

776
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:21,590
apply Newton's laws.
I gave you this example,

777
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,200
so I'm going to go
through it somewhat fast.

778
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,480
Our job is to find the function x that
satisfies this equation and we would like

779
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,770
to write it as follows.

780
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,080
A D two x over DT square is
equal to minus Omega squared x,

781
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:37,790
but Omega Square,

782
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,470
it's in shorthand for Omega
is the shorthand for square
root of k or whatever.

783
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,860
By the way, I'm using big x
and small lakes like crazy.
So it's this small likes.

784
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:53,720
I don't mean anything significant between
this and this. They're all the same.

785
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:55,940
If you want you can take this.

786
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,283
Pardon me?

787
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:06,080
Yeah, this is Kay and this guy is
k and other equations do you use,

788
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,860
just follow the lecture today.
These are all the same.

789
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,080
Okay, so don't say what happened there
when he moved from one to the other.

790
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,820
All right, so what did I say we should
do? You can make it a word problem.

791
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,890
Let's say I am looking for a function,

792
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,640
which one I take to derivatives looks
like minus itself exit for this number and

793
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:31,740
we just saw that today.
The trigonometric functions,

794
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,370
the property that you take to
deliberative, they returned
to miners themselves.

795
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,200
So you can take a guess.

796
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,980
That exit looks like
co-signed t but it won't work.

797
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:45,150
Then I showed you before so I'm
not going to go through that again.

798
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,460
You could do this.
Yes,

799
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,910
but it was his ex is not in
number is x is a function of time.

800
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:56,610
If you took this function of time
in fact or basis equation provided,

801
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:01,170
the Omega that you put in is the
Omega that's in the equation.

802
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,140
Why?
Because tape take two derivatives.

803
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:11,340
First let me get minus Omega Sine Omega
at the second time you get minus Omega

804
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:15,290
squared cost and make a tea with me and
says minus Omega squared times the Ux

805
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,620
itself and is whatever you like.

806
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,460
Then I said let's plot this
guy and then you plot this guy.

807
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:29,000
It looks like this is the amplitude.

808
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:41,190
What does Omega Well Omega is related
to the time or the frequency of

809
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:42,850
oscillations as follows.

810
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,550
If I start with the t equals zero where
the x is equal to a how long do I have

811
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,560
to wait till I come back to a,

812
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,220
I think everybody should know
that I have to wait a time.

813
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:59,221
Capital t so that Omega Times t is too
fine cause that's when the costs and

814
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:00,544
returns to one.

815
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,680
That means the time that you have
to wait is two Pi over omega.

816
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:11,370
You can see Omega is two Pi over t
it can also write it as two Pi Times

817
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:15,070
frequency, but frequency is what
you and I would call frequency.

818
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,590
How many oscillations
that desperate second.

819
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,540
That's the inverse of the time period.

820
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,730
So if you pull a mass and you let it go,

821
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,280
it oscillates with the frequency

822
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,340
we just connected with the
forest constant and the mass.

823
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,240
If the spring is very stiff and Kay's
video, large frequency is very high.

824
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,410
If the mass is very big in the motion
is very sluggish and is diminished.

825
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,380
So all this stuff comes
out of the equation.

826
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,810
One ready to marketable part of the
equation is that you can pick any air you

827
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:52,600
like.
Think about what that means.

828
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,980
What does the meaning of a is the Amanay
with you pulled it when you let it go,

829
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,210
you are told whether you pull the spring
by one inch Arba tenancies the time it

830
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:08,431
takes to finish a full back and forth
motion is independent of a this frequency

831
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:11,740
he has independent they yes,

832
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,673
small.

833
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:20,570
This d here, here at that. Ah, very good.

834
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,090
That's correct.
So let's be careful the stip t,

835
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,960
this is a particular time capital t.

836
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,113
Yeah,

837
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,820
so that a marketable property of simple
harmonic motion is that the amplitude

838
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,590
does not determine the time period.

839
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,270
If you pull it by two inches compared
to one inch, it's got a long way to go.

840
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,910
But because you pulled it by two inches,

841
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:49,110
the spring is going to be that much more
cans and it's going to exert a bigger

842
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:52,140
force so that it'll go faster
for the most of the time.

843
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,700
That's very clear what the fact that it
goes faster than exactly the right way

844
00:56:56,701 --> 00:57:01,350
to complete the trip at the same time
as rather miraculous property up.

845
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,260
The fact that this equation
has this particular form,

846
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,080
if you had tampered with this,

847
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,640
if you add to this a little bit like
one over a hundred times x cubed and all

848
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:16,440
these bets are off, it's gotta be that
equation for that result to be true.

849
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,700
Okay,
so this is simple harmonic motion.

850
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,930
Then you can do the following variant of
this solution, which I will write down.

851
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:26,890
Now suppose,
uh,

852
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,620
I set my clock to zero right there.

853
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,310
You set your clock to zero yet,
but I can say, you know what,

854
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,280
I just got up and I'm looking at the mass.
I set my clock to zero.

855
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,600
When it hits zero, it's not at the
maximum, but it's the same physics.

856
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:43,590
It's the same equation.

857
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,020
And that really comes from the fact that
we had one more latitude here of adding

858
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,180
a certain number, Phi, which is
called the phase the oscillator.

859
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,360
Okay,

860
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,610
whatever you pick, four or
five, the it'll still work.

861
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,010
And what did you pick for
capital aid and still work?

862
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,880
So whenever you have an Oscillator,
namely a mass in spring system,

863
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,630
and you want to know what is
x is going to be at all times,

864
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,090
you need to somehow determine
the amplitude and the fish.

865
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,360
I want you to know that you can
calculate exit all future times.

866
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,330
So let me give you an example.

867
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,960
Suppose an oscillator has x equaled
the five and velocity equals zero,

868
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,790
uh, t equal to zero. What does that mean?

869
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,520
I pulled it by five and then let it go

870
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,410
is I tell you the spring constant care
and I tell you the mass and I said watch

871
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:41,244
the future of X.

872
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:46,510
You've got to come back to this equation
and you got to say five equals a course

873
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:52,491
sine of zero plus fi and
how about the velocity?

874
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:58,670
Velocity is supposed to be zero let us
minus Omega a sign or make a t plus fi

875
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:06,000
but t is zero so that tells
me zero is minus Omega.

876
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,630
A signed Phi Omega is not,
zero is not zero.

877
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,760
That four signed five zero that
means five zero you get rid of that.

878
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So the subsequent motion is x
equal the five core sine Omega t.

879
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,840
This is a problem we had.
We did not need fi,

880
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,650
but it could have been that
when you join the experiment,

881
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,410
you are somewhere here than
the masses actually moving.

882
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,730
Then I would say at d equals zero
velocity was some other number, maybe six.

883
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,040
Then you've got to go back and
write two equations. One Fedex,

884
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,650
take the date of it. Dude, it looks
like this and instead of putting zero,

885
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:47,310
you put six, you've got
two unknowns, a and Fi,

886
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,720
you've got to juggle them around.

887
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,690
You've got to solve for a and
five given these two numbers,

888
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,870
simple exercise to solve
for them and when you do,

889
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,340
you have completely fit the problem.
In other words,

890
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,570
simply to be told,

891
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:04,010
a mass is connected to the spring of
[inaudible] mass enforced constant.

892
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:08,300
It's not enough to determine the future
of the spray. You have to be told,

893
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,210
for example, if nobody pulled the mass,
it just want to sit there forever.

894
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,110
If you pulled it by 10 it's going to go
back and forth from 10 to minus 10 so

895
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:20,520
you have to be told further information
to nail down these two numbers.

896
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:24,870
They're called free parameters and
the solution on the other hand,

897
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,950
no matter how much you pulled
it and Javiera listed this
Omega and therefore the

898
01:00:28,951 --> 01:00:31,650
frequency are not variable.
Yes,

899
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,180
any time start it.

900
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,340
If you started at rest,

901
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:43,330
indeed it will be zero because the
velocity at t equals zero is minus Omega a

902
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:46,470
sign fi do you want to kill that?
The only way is by equal to zero.

903
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,340
You could put five with the pie if you
like, but if you put zero that'll do.

904
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,140
Okay,
so

905
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:02,350
this is the elementary parts of this
thing and I already told you the following

906
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:03,184
things.

907
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,420
If x of t is equal to a cause,

908
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:12,421
Omega t let's put Phi equals zero in
other words it'd be like agree that since

909
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:17,050
there's only one oscillator it is perverse
to set your clock to zero at any time

910
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:19,540
other than when the oscillator
is at one extreme point.

911
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,410
If there are two oscillators
oscillating out of step,

912
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,430
it's impossible to make five zero for
both of them because if you can sync your

913
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:28,990
clock when one of them said the maximum,

914
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:33,000
that may not be when the other one said
at maximum but with one oscillator but

915
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:34,930
she was fine other than zero is perverse.

916
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,750
It's like saying I'm doing
a project title problem.

917
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,940
I'll pick the place where the line to
predict tile to be x equal to y equals

918
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:46,210
zero you can pick some other crazy origin
but it doesn't help so we'll assume

919
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,440
fire zero in this problem.
If that is x,

920
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:55,441
what is velocity at time t take the data
to with this you get minus Omega a sine

921
01:01:57,431 --> 01:02:02,320
Omega t
that means the is also isolating.

922
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:06,400
Sane is finally, but the amplitude
for Oscillation is Omega Times a.

923
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:11,020
So a is the range of variation for
x we'll make at time say is that the

924
01:02:11,021 --> 01:02:13,750
intubation for velocity. Lastly,
we'll go all the way through.

925
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,440
Plus Omega I minus Omega a,
the acceleration,

926
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:22,260
which is one more bit of it too is minus
Omega squared. A cost to make a tea,

927
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,310
which is really minus
Omega Square Times exit. So

928
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:32,620
so the amplitude for isolation for the
accelerations Omega squared times eight,

929
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,290
so I think you should understand
if will make us very large,

930
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:41,680
they end the velocity will have very
big excursions and the acceleration will

931
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:46,230
live even bigger excursions because the
range of this AI really means if you

932
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:51,231
plot x is going to look like this going
from a two minus eight this is if you

933
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:54,960
plot the velocity is
going to look like this.

934
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,100
The and we'll go from
Omega a minus Omega a.

935
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,760
If you plot the acceleration will go
from Omega squared eight to minus Omega

936
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:03,594
squared away.

937
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,280
Last thing you want to verify is
the law of conservation of energy.

938
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,750
I think I mentioned this Dubai and I
studied energy but let me repeat one more

939
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,210
time.
If you take in this problem,

940
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,860
one half NBS where plus
one half k x square.

941
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,540
I did that for you. You
can also verify this. Okay.

942
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:28,943
Uh,

943
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,780
one half k x squared is going
to involve [inaudible] squared.

944
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,740
Omega t one half MV squared is going
to involve something, something,

945
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:41,930
something science where Omega t and by
magic the science squared and costs and

946
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:43,470
squared will have the same coefficient.

947
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:48,060
So you can use the identity to set that
equal to one and get an answer that does

948
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,670
not depend on time.
That's the beauty.

949
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,900
Even though position and velocity are
constantly changing, this combination,

950
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,940
if you crank it out,
will not depend on time.

951
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,290
And what can it possibly be
if it doesn't depend on time.

952
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:05,310
I can calculate it whenever I like.
So let me go to the incident.

953
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:10,230
When the mass is reached one extremity
and this our board to swing back at that

954
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:12,060
instant,
it has no velocity.

955
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:15,060
It's only has an x which is
equal to the amplitude of motion.

956
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,630
So that's the energy of an isolator.
One half k square.

957
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,980
When x is when V is equal to zero x,

958
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:26,010
it'll be plus or minus a or
any other intermediate point.

959
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,430
You can find the velocity. If you
could give me the x, we did that too.

960
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,400
So this is all I want to say
about the linear oscillator.

961
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:39,251
Well,

962
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:42,520
let me mention to you another kind of
oscillation which is very interesting.

963
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:43,821
The subways,

964
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:48,821
you suspend a rod from
the ceiling like this.

965
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:55,570
It's sagging that if you give it a twist
then it'll go twisting back and forth

966
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:57,003
like that.

967
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:02,550
That's also simple harmonic motion except
watch wedding with time is not linear

968
01:05:02,891 --> 01:05:06,070
coordinate, but the angle taper by
which that artists being twisted.

969
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,420
What's the equation in this case
equation here is I need to take over d d

970
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:19,300
square. You guys remember?
No, that's the analog of m a.

971
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,820
That's going to be equal to the torque.

972
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,203
Okay.

973
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:32,650
Now what will happen in the problems we
consider is if data is a small number

974
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:37,720
in the torque will be such that it
brings you back to today equals to zero.

975
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:43,620
So this number will be approximately
equal to minus some number kappa times

976
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,273
state.

977
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,420
Yeah,

978
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,190
just the analog of Buenos Kx

979
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:57,250
little k was the restoring force divided
by the displacement which produced a

980
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:58,224
distorting force.

981
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,630
Literally Kappa is the starting torque
divided with the angle at which you

982
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:03,980
twisted it to get that torque.

983
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:09,600
So this isn't always true
for small oscillations.

984
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,820
Since towel vanishes that
[inaudible] equal to zero,

985
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,250
it will look like some number
of times data if you like.

986
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:17,010
It's the tailor CDs for
Tau for small angles.

987
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:18,880
Yeah.

988
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,110
If you knew this kappa,

989
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:24,910
you are done because mathematically this
equation is the same as MD two x over

990
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,920
Dt squares minus Kx Good Omega for this
guy will be square root of kappa over

991
01:06:31,971 --> 01:06:32,804
the eye.

992
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,600
You can steal the whole answer because
mathematically mathematicians don't care

993
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:41,110
if you're talking about data.
If you're talking about ex, uh,

994
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:46,190
if you compare this equation and this
equation MD two x over detainee square,

995
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,220
you pulled the minus kappa minus Kx.

996
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,130
If the Omega there was
root of k over them,

997
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,740
the Omega here will be
route of kappa over I.

998
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,920
So you may be thinking what,

999
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,660
give me an example where told
looks like capital times status.

1000
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,980
So I'm going to give you that example.

1001
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,050
So that example is going to be
the following. A simple pendulum

1002
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:32,260
take a pendulum like this. It's
got a mass m, it's got some length.

1003
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,250
L is hanging from the ceiling.
They said rigid rod, not a string,

1004
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,960
but a rigid massless rod
and the mass numbers at the bottom.

1005
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,990
So it's happy to hang like this,

1006
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,440
but suppose you give it a kick
so you push it over there,

1007
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:52,330
do an angle theta,
which is whatever you like.

1008
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,460
What is the Torque in
this particular case,

1009
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:02,540
let's find out the force is AMG

1010
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,580
and the angle between the forest and
you're trying to do rotations around this

1011
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:10,490
point.
This angle here is the same data.

1012
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,320
So torque is really
minus m g l science data.

1013
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,730
That's the formula for Torque is the
force times the distance of the lever arm

1014
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,050
or the distance over which you,

1015
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,490
the forces from the rotation axis
times the sine of the angle between the

1016
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:33,830
direction of the force and the
direction of the separation.

1017
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,210
So the equation of
motion for the pendulum,

1018
01:08:37,211 --> 01:08:40,650
but it really is the
following I need to take over.

1019
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:45,651
D D Square is equal to
minus N G L sine theta.

1020
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,030
No, we cannot do business
with this equation. This
equation is a famous equation,

1021
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:57,610
but you and I don't know how
to solve it with what we know.

1022
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,410
But we have learned even earlier today.

1023
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:05,490
Look at the formula for scion x saying
next begins with x minus x cubed over

1024
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:09,460
three factorial and so on.
So if data is small venue midnight,

1025
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,920
there's AMG l data.

1026
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,120
So for small angles,

1027
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:20,860
scientists data in the restoring torque
in fact is linear in the coordinate,

1028
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,680
the angular coordinate.
So by comparison,

1029
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:28,681
now we know that this fellow is Sour
Kappa Kappa far the pendulum is MGL.

1030
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,460
So cap,
I may not be universal in every problem.

1031
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:37,480
In each problem you got to find kappa.
You find that by moving the system,

1032
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:41,710
offer equilibrium, finding the restoring
torque. And if you're doing it right,

1033
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,230
they're starting. Torque will always
look like something, something,

1034
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:48,400
something time state everything.
Multiplying data is our kappa.

1035
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,160
So let's know,
calculate Omega.

1036
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,150
What does simple pendulum I'm showing you.

1037
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:59,260
This is kappa over I and Kappa was what?

1038
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,440
M G L and what's I?

1039
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:04,020
Okay.

1040
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:09,020
It's equal to moment to finish your of
this mass out on this point that artists

1041
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:12,060
massless for the single point mass.

1042
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:14,550
We know the moment of inertia
has just an times elsewhere.

1043
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:20,900
Do you find Omega is equal to the square
root of g or what l and that is two Pi

1044
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,580
over t so you get back.

1045
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:28,581
The famous formula I learned Ti
is two Pi Square root of l over g.

1046
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,120
This is the audit done up.
The formula you learn in school,

1047
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:38,910
it comes from small
oscillations of a pendulum.

1048
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:44,380
So think about this problem.
If you pull the pendulum by an angle,

1049
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:49,230
so a large, that scientist has
no longer approximated but data,

1050
01:10:49,231 --> 01:10:51,210
but you need a that you
build with a six term,

1051
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,520
it can happen for large enough data.

1052
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:56,580
Then the equation to
solve is no longer this.

1053
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,110
And what that means is if
you took a real pendulum

1054
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,550
massless rod and a Bob at the end,

1055
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,300
the time it takes to finish in isolation
in fact will depend on the amplitude.

1056
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:15,360
The only for small oscillations when
synthetic can be approximated. But data,

1057
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:19,110
you will find whether you'd do that
oscillation or that oscillation.

1058
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,540
The time is the same.
But if you go too far,

1059
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,170
the other terms in scientists that will
kick in and the result is no longer true.

1060
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,660
It a pendulum in fact is not just a
function of l and g also function or the

1061
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,620
amplitude only for small amplitudes.
You get this marvelous resolve.

1062
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,110
This one problem I want you to
think about. Uh, I may do it myself.

1063
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:44,580
[inaudible] I think you should try to
read up on it and I will try to explain it

1064
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:46,520
next time,
which is the following.

1065
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,880
I will give the problem to you and
I will do it for you next time.

1066
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,580
I want you to think about it.
Here's a hoop,

1067
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,960
like a hula hoop is hanging on the wall
with a nail and there's very happy to be

1068
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:07,710
wedded to this. Now I come and give it
a little push. You'll start oscillating,

1069
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,680
look like that and sometime
later it'll look like that.

1070
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,180
It's going back and forth.

1071
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,710
Your job is to find the
Omega for that Hoop.

1072
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,353
Yeah.

1073
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:25,140
So you move it a little bit and you find
the restoring Torque, then you're done.

1074
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,590
But you got to do two things,
right? To get the right answer.

1075
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,590
You've got to find a moment to finish.
You have a circular loop,

1076
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,890
not around the center, but I don't
own a point on the circumference.

1077
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:38,430
So you guys know the magic.
Where do you gotta use parallel axes?

1078
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,930
Theorem and defined?

1079
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,900
The restoring to here is the
part that blows everybody's mind,

1080
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,190
was that when the loop goes to that
position, where does gravity acting?

1081
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,560
Gravity's acting at the center of mass.

1082
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,250
Center of mass is somewhere
here in the middle of the loop.

1083
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,170
Even though there is no matter there.

1084
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,680
So center of mass off a body
need not lay on the body.

1085
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,570
That ring is a perfect example.
So if you remember,

1086
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,840
the center of mass of the loop isn't
the center of the loop and put the AMG

1087
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:11,140
there, you will get the right target
and everything will just fall.

1088
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,490
Yeah.

1089
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,480
By the way, my offer is always open.
If there's something about the class,

1090
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,550
uh, you want to, and you find this hard,
does that you can always write to me,

1091
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,953
okay,
you can,

1092
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:29,040
I want your feedback because I just
don't know which parts that easy,

1093
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:31,530
which parts are hard, which
are slow, which are fast.

1094
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,810
Or if you haven't had enough
math and you need some help,

1095
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,440
so send me some email and I
will try my best to answer that.
