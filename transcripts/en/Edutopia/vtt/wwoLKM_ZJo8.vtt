&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: Equity in education
to me means that young people,

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:17.516
especially those that are most impacted
by inequity, have a strong sense

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.876
of self, how they're
connected to the world,

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:21.976
and feel empowered to change the world.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Once you've
got your peer eds done--

00:00:34.106 --> 00:00:37.676
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: I am originally from
Vietnam and I came to the United States

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:45.116
when I was seven with my family and I
spoke very little English at that time.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:49.716
I discovered that language and
education are transformative.

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:53.186
And for me and my family
it was about survival.

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:59.126
So, my first day of high
school I was extremely excited,

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.786
because we moved into
a new neighborhood.

00:01:02.036 --> 00:01:05.156
I came from a pretty
poor working class area

00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:06.896
and I thought it was a new beginning.

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:07.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right.

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.956
So, take a look at this
screen real quick.

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:12.616
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: And the first day of
school-- it was a geography class--

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:15.786
and the teacher said,
"Everyone introduce yourself

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.066
and tell us where you're born."

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.566
My heart dropped.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:23.146
I was terrified that people would
know that I'm not from this country.

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:27.446
And I remember thinking to
myself I hated this country

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:31.946
because I don't belong and
then most of all I hated myself

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:35.346
for not having the courage
to be who I am.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:39.976
That moment really informed what
I wanted to do for young people.

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:43.016
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: I came to Envision,

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:45.456
because I wanted to impact
a whole system.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.626
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: How are you
feeling about being here?

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:51.726
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: We serve mostly
first-generation college-bound students,

00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:55.416
mostly low-income African-American
and Latino students

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.686
and they have so many assets.

00:01:58.386 --> 00:01:59.256
They're resilient.

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:01.106
They are smart.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:03.166
But they do face a lot of challenges.

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:09.956
They feel very responsible for their
survival of their family and they come

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:13.546
from environments where not
very much is expected of them.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:16.906
But they come and they realize
this is a whole new world.

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:22.436
At Envision our teachers
push our students

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:24.566
to excel and they believe in them.

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:29.226
So, when you are just around
that, you then believe in it, too.

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.006
I'm just really proud that eighty
percent of our students are accepted

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.156
to four-year college, right?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.846
A hundred percent of them are
accepted to two- or four-year college.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:41.156
I mean, I just think that's fantastic.

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:43.696
&gt;&gt;Student: You know, I'm always big
on leadership and finding myself

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:46.866
and I found myself through poetry and
all the workshops and projects here.

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:48.216
&gt;&gt;Gia Truong: And I think

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:51.116
that our environment brings
that out of them, right?

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:53.986
They can be free to like school.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:57.376
They can be open to rigorous academics.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:02:58.906
They can challenge themselves.

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.976
They can do what other people think
that is impossible for them to do.
