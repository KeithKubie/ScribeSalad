00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.278
Given two normalized vectors, the cosine of the angle between them is computed

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:08.362
by the dot product operation. So this is the dot, it's a big dot, and these are

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:13.215
denoted as vectors by putting arrows over them. The dot product is equivalent to

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.640
multiplying the x value of A times the x value of B and so on with y and z and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.932
then adding these up together. Say I have these two normalized vectors, and I

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:27.810
want to find the cosine of the angle between them. The dot product is then 0

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.328
times 0.8 and so on, next to values multiplied and so on. This comes out to be

00:00:33.328 --> 00:00:38.020
these three terms added together, which equals 0.6. So this is the cosine of the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.768
angle between these two vectors. Out of curiousity, if we take the Arc cosine of

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:48.740
this value, 0.6, we get 53.13 degrees. However, we don't really care about the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.330
angle, we truly want the cosine. As this is how much we'll scale the light's

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.920
contrubution to the surface. The dot product is a little mysterious, and is so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.560
fundamental to a large part of computer graphics, that it's worth buliding up

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.170
some understanding of what it really means. Why does this operation have any

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.312
connection with cosine?
