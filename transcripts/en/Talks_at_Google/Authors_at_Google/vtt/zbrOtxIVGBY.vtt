00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.455
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:12.680
SPEAKER 1: So I want to get
into this flow and interaction

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.360
idea with you, but I thought
maybe just start with,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.109
just by way of a little
bit of background,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.304
how does somebody get
into the prediction

00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:19.470
business in the first place?

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.100
It's not like something I saw
and my high school counselor

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.790
offered me.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.740
MARK ANDERSON: They didn't
tell you about that, did they?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.770
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.520
MARK ANDERSON:
Because everyone says

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.680
you can't predict the
future, so don't study that.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.800
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.550
MARK ANDERSON: I was
always a science guy,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.320
from when I was zero,
or five, or something.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.960
And if you study
science, first thing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.080
they teach you in seventh
grade is the scientific method.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.090
And so what they
don't teach you is--

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.340
the hypothesis really matters.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.280
They don't teach you
how to get a hypothesis.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.990
And people have studied this.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.510
If you look at the question
of who does great science--

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.802
not just wobbly
good, but great--

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.010
it turns out that getting
the right question, getting

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.060
the right hypothesis, is
about 90% of the deal.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.720
Einstein had a great hypothesis
when he was 16 years old.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.720
It's like, when I fly
alongside this photon--

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.690
which I can't do--

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630
what am I going to
see when I look left?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.240
And it's like, wow, that
question drove the world.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.930
It's still driving
the world today.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560
So getting the right
hypothesis, and it turned out

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.650
no one taught that.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.649
So if you're in science, in any
kind of science, at some point

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.440
you're going to start
creating experiments.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.830
And you're going
to ask yourself,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.360
why did that guy do
better than I did?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.080
How do I fix this?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.060
And the way to get great
questions, of course,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.380
is through inductive reasoning.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.364
And inductive
reasoning means you're

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:31.280
going to be looking at
a wide array of things,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.100
finding something where there's
either a pattern broken,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.480
which makes things very
interesting, or a pattern made,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.855
where the next
big thing is going

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:39.050
to be in the same pattern.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.430
Usually, it's broken.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.462
And Isaac Asimov said that
about the words "that's funny."

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:45.170
And it's like, the
great words of science

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.530
are not eureka, it's
like, that's funny.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.590
And that's totally true.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.320
So as I came to
recognize that, I

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.695
had a kind of an
a-ha moment when

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:56.060
I was in my very early 20s.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.070
I remember exactly
where I was standing.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
And I was looking out the
window at a bay, water was out.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.520
I just had this light
bulb going, it was like,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.860
start again.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.560
Reprogram your brain to
be really good at pattern

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.460
recognition, pattern discovery.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.070
And if you do that,
that's not just

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.840
going to get you good
science experiments,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.310
that gets you everything.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.340
And it turns out-- for a lot
of folks here probably do AI--

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.290
it turns out that's
exactly the answer.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.360
So almost everything in AI's
based on pattern recognition.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.230
So it was a fortuitous thing
to think of that a while ago.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.870
And I think that our brain
still is far beyond chips

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.010
and so forth in many ways.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.800
So teaching yourself
to do this gets you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.220
a lot further, even today,
than any computer will get you.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.740
Except in the most
rudimentary things.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.110
SPEAKER 1: And you want to
maybe highlight one or two

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.652
examples of things in the past
where you've looked at an area

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.068
and come up with
a prediction that

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.690
was maybe not an
obvious prediction

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.220
to have made at the time,
and turned out to be true?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.544
And maybe reflect a
little bit about why

00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:54.710
you were able to do that
when it's something so many

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.610
smart other people
seem to have missed?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.443
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.169
I think people miss things
because their funnel's not

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:00.710
broad enough.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.000
They're not looking
at a lot of data.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880
They're looking at data
in their own field.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.180
And that's a very
restrictive view of things.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.181
So one kind of
weird one was I was

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.930
able to predict the
best-selling Christmas

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.837
product a number of years back.

00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:15.920
And here were the things
that led me to it, right?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.890
So I found this-- it's usually
these little stupid stories

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.174
on page 17, like two paragraphs.

00:03:21.174 --> 00:03:22.840
There was something--
I'd gone to China,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.730
I was trying to find someone to
manufacture a computer for me.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.100
And they told me that
Samsung was unable to ship--

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.380
they could ship this, this, in
terms of screens, but not this.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.985
They'd already run out of--

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.360
the education
market was-- they'd

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.526
already run out of these
big screens a certain size.

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:39.920
Pretty big screen, right?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.070
And then I noticed that the
pricing change was happening,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.670
where they had been
5,000 to 4,000,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.310
and they were coming
down quite a bit.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.890
And then AT&amp;T fired
about 30,000 guys.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.724
They're mostly guys.

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:51.806
And they're on the street.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:53.420
And there's like a
big, big news item.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.045
This is probably
in July, August.

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:56.664
Like, wow.

00:03:56.664 --> 00:03:59.080
And I'm picturing-- and I'm
doing the micro economy thing.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.180
I'm thinking, these
guys are all home.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.680
And they're telling
their wives, I'm

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.520
going to get hired
again in months.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.690
Maybe not true.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.460
And what they're really going to
do is watch the football game.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.710
But they have to stay at home.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.820
They have to say, this is
exciting stuff, high tech

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.814
stuff, and it's going to
help me get a new job.

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:17.480
And then you ask
yourself, OK-- but when

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.729
they talk to their guys at
[INAUDIBLE],, and they say,

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.290
come on over for chips.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.540
They're going to go like this.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.450
Oh, how big is yours?

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.640
And he goes, mine is that big.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.800
Now, the human body, like
Leonardo, it's about six feet.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.610
So you could put
that all together.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.182
And that was, by
the way, the size

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:35.140
that was missing from
the inventory at Samsung.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.150
SPEAKER 1: Ah.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.900
MARK ANDERSON: And so all
that stuff, plus the pricing,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.850
plus the guys fired,
I thought, OK,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.770
that's going to be
the best-selling thing

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.394
this Christmas.

00:04:42.394 --> 00:04:43.590
And it worked out.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.090
That's

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.300
SPEAKER 1: Really fun.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.520
MARK ANDERSON: So that's
pretty disconnected.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.130
It'd be had for a
computer to see--

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.963
hard for a person, but
hard for the computer

00:04:48.963 --> 00:04:51.939
to see all those things that
are running together like that.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.480
SPEAKER 1: I think
another prediction

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.970
you've gotten a lot of acclaim
for was seeing the oil price

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.280
collapse coming before
a lot of people.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.540
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.400
were the antecedents there?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.220
Maybe remind some people
here what was the setup.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.090
MARK ANDERSON: Sure.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.070
So I have spent a lot
of time at oil prices

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.007
because it's a global tax.

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:08.340
It really is important to
understand the global economy,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.060
which I care about.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.643
So if you want to understand the
basics of the global economy,

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:14.080
the price of oil is right
in there in the beginning.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.600
And after a while, you
learn certain things.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.230
So I had learned, for instance,
that back 10 years earlier, it

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.930
cost about $14.35 to
produce a barrel of oil.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.392
So that obviously wasn't
driving the price.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.850
I learned that the
Saudi family had

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.160
$110 to pay all their
debts, because they

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.120
were spending so profligately.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.640
And we saw it go all
the way up to 148.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.580
So that made sense to me.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.610
I learned that the
cartel, which had

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.380
had a rock-solid
grip on the price,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.360
had lost its grip, which is
a really important thing.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.557
It was a multi-year
project, but every year it

00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:47.890
was worse, and worse, and worse.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.720
They couldn't
maintain the religion.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.010
Niger was cheating, all
these others were cheating.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.010
They would say they do
this, they would do this.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.430
So clearly, the cartel
was falling apart.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.491
The price had been pretty
steady around $93, $95.

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:04.240
So you can picture it,
if the prior years,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.532
you look back a decade, it
goes up to 80, 90, 148, 110.

00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:13.240
And you can think to
yourself, the Saudis

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.640
are pretty happy about
this story so far.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.540
And then 93, that's fine.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.880
But at 93, it occurred
to me that some things

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.710
had happened that were new.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.668
So one of the things that
happened that was new

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:28.820
was the United States
started making more oil.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.200
And if you looked at the
storage capacity of our tanks,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.720
for the first time
ever, Goldman Sachs

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.430
was building tanks
as fast as they

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.470
could because all
the tanks were full.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.600
We were at 100% capacity.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.940
We couldn't store any more oil.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.250
Well, that's interesting.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.730
That's a new thing.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.730
And then, of course, fracking.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.050
But before the fracking,
global warming.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.940
So you say to yourself, well,
windmills, electricity, solar,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.305
all these things are coming on.

00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:55.930
And guess what?

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.130
This story, when we're
all gone, this story's

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.320
going to roll right on.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.940
There's never going to be an end
to increasing alternative fuels

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.410
for whatever you want to do.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.870
That's just a death
knell for oil, right?

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.657
That's inexorable.

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:09.240
No matter how you
feel about politics,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.262
that's going to happen.

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.220
And then you put in the
final nail and you say,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.595
oh, by the way,
we have fracking.

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:16.230
And it turns out, Joe, that
you have a million tons of oil

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.852
in your backyard and I do too.

00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:20.060
Everywhere you sink something,
you either side drill,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.280
or it's right there.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.820
So the idea of how much fracking
would liberate was amazing.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.900
And as soon as that
happened, done.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.020
Those all together
led to the call.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.450
And Prince Al-Waleed, who
has been released from

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.540
the Ritz-Carlton jail now with,
I think, a thing on his ankle--

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.620
still won't talk about it--

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.410
he said no one could have
possibly predicted this.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.470
Well, what he means is no
person in the oil business,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.980
because they were so used to it.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.030
Often people get inured
to their own silo

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.850
are the ones who miss
everything because of that.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.850
You have to be outside it,
just looking at patterns.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.820
So I made the call at 93 bucks.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.570
And it had that
history of decades

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.010
of pricing around in there.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.770
And within very short order, I
think three weeks or something,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.270
I said it would go
down to 45 to 50.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.561
I thought it would take longer.

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:08.860
I thought it would take a year.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.710
It was like a month later.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.427
It went straight down to 45 to
50, and is kind of still there.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:15.760
Now it's at 70, now it's going
to come back to 60 again,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.440
I think.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.900
But now it's a year or
two sitting down there.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.090
So that call was hard to
make in terms of-- timing

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.230
is really hard.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.400
It was an accident, but
the number was hard too.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.080
Knowing that it would go
from 93 to between 45 and 50

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.005
and sit there, I can't quite
explain that one, I don't know.

00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:34.380
That takes-- I must have been
seeing about numbers that I

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.492
didn't even register.

00:08:35.492 --> 00:08:36.450
SPEAKER 1: Right, yeah.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.309
In some ways, it's
presumptuous to ask

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.857
how do you know
to do this stuff,

00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:41.940
because so much of our
performance is unconscious.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.830
You've trained your own
neural net in a way that--

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.370
MARK ANDERSON: Exactly.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.540
SPEAKER 1: --things emerge
that you don't necessarily--

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.998
MARK ANDERSON: There's a step
for me, which is a gut check.

00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:50.100
I never will publish
something if I

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.370
don't get a gut check on it.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.170
So I'll think,
that's interesting.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.210
I wonder if that's true.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.940
But if I don't really
feel intuitively--

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.940
that is the final thing.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.910
I think there's a pool
of knowledge back there.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.404
And if it doesn't match
against all that stuff,

00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:01.570
no, there's something wrong.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.804
SPEAKER 1: Hm.

00:09:02.804 --> 00:09:04.720
So I think a lot of
people could get this idea

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.910
that you have to step
outside your silo

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.024
and take a broader
view to understand

00:09:09.024 --> 00:09:09.940
what's going to go on.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.691
But it's harder to put
that into practice,

00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:14.356
because it's like, well, there's
a lot of information out there.

00:09:14.356 --> 00:09:15.130
What do I do?

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.963
I'm a little curious
about your methodology.

00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:19.750
Are you just constantly
voracious, and then serendipity

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.320
bubbles up?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.910
Or when you're going after
a particular problem,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.870
are you looking for what
are the adjacencies I

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.120
should be paying attention to?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.195
MARK ANDERSON: It
applies to any scale.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:28.570
So depending what
scale you use--

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.120
so we do this at the
office pretty often.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.700
So you'll have a wide
funnel, and you'll

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.700
see something interesting.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.780
And you go, let's
take a look at this.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.710
And then you're
looking for patterns

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.450
that are more and more
local, until you finally find

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.046
something really interesting.

00:09:42.046 --> 00:09:43.420
I met somebody in
the hall, which

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.900
I won't go into
the details about,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.141
but we have a thing called
nutritional micro analysis.

00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:50.140
We're looking at a lot
of nutritional questions,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.700
and a lot of
drug-related questions,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.200
and how the body works.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.090
I was trained in
biochemistry, which helps.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.084
And we found something.

00:09:57.084 --> 00:09:59.500
I found something-- we're doing
some research on something

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.060
related to autoimmune
diseases, stuff like that.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.900
And I found this biochemical,
and I was like, whoa.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.364
It was showing up everywhere.

00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:09.780
So let's do a
little dive on that.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.260
So Denyse Davis works with me,
did a deep dive for a few days.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.930
Big folder like
this, read all that.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.680
Whoa, this is getting
more interesting.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.507
So you can know nothing
at all, essentially.

00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:22.590
It would have to be
biochemistry, about something.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.420
But if you're very
objective about it,

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.856
and you apply these rules--
which are in this book that

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:28.980
you're going to buy today--

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.490
then it turns out you
can be not well-versed

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.804
in that particular field.

00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:35.220
It helps if you
are, but you don't

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.035
have to be an area expert.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:38.550
In fact, it's probably better
if you're not an area expert.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.180
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.390
Yeah, and I guess that leads
me to another question I

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.112
had for you, which is, when
you're trying to understand

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:47.070
and make predictions in
an area, how much is it

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.310
about the numbers and the
nitty gritty quantitative data,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.180
and how much of it is extracting
more intuitive or qualitative

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.862
patterns about what forces are
pulling on what directions,

00:10:56.862 --> 00:10:57.820
and that sort of thing?

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.653
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:10:58.653 --> 00:11:01.890
It's probably both, but more
about the intuitive part.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.787
It's more about
large-scale patterns.

00:11:03.787 --> 00:11:06.120
You get Wall Street guys, who
are always penny up, penny

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.244
down, penny up, penny down.

00:11:07.244 --> 00:11:08.870
I hate that.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.376
That would be going
to Hades for me.

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:13.500
Those kinds of things are
artificial to begin with,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.541
and they're not very
useful, and they're probably

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.490
being faked by the
management, so who cares.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.180
But if you could say,
oh, this company is

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.300
going to lose its CEO
because of this, or her CFO,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.550
or something's going to
happen to that technology that

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.260
will suddenly obsolete
it, that's a big deal.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.110
And so if you see
those kinds of things,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.390
you don't care about the
penny up, penny down.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.330
So I try to find things which
are intuitively strategic.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.672
That's why our name is that.

00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:39.630
And then there'll be
things that even the folks

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.181
inside the company don't know.

00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:42.680
They'll say, what
right do you have?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.660
Who are you?

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.370
I'm nobody.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.700
Just ignore me.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.210
But you have that tool set
that gives you that power.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.350
SPEAKER 1: One of the
things I was struck

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.100
by when reading some
of your recent work--

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.891
and this will lead us
into the work on flow

00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:56.370
and interactions-- is you said,
I think last year at the FiRe

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.770
Conference, I've been doing
all these predictions in all

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.610
these different fields.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.735
I feel like I've really
trained my brain up for it.

00:12:01.735 --> 00:12:05.100
But I never really had
my own unified theory

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.210
of how this all works.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.460
And the other thing you
said that I found surprising

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.876
was, you said, but
it never really

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:13.130
bothered me, because I was
still able to do my job.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.630
So I'm just curious for you to
reflect on that a little bit,

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.046
and maybe what led you to
start thinking that maybe there

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:19.170
was something more unified.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.722
Because maybe
there isn't, right?

00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:22.680
Maybe there's just a
bunch of noise out there--

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.150
MARK ANDERSON: I hadn't been
working on that, really.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.210
It hadn't occurred to me
that there needed to be one.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.376
I thought pattern recognition
and pattern discovery,

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.350
that's it.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.110
You can do anything
you want to do.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.760
So I really wasn't
on the hunt for that.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.010
It's kind of a separate story.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.468
I think maybe in
this conversation,

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:38.400
we'll come back to
these two things again.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.590
But there's flow and
interaction over here,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.850
and there's pattern
recognition and pattern

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.630
discovery over here.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.130
And as far as I was
concerned, there

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.590
was no flow and interaction,
and pattern recognition

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.430
was everything.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.140
Pattern discovery.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.930
But I had-- and I
think anybody who

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.770
tries to pursue this
kind of thought life

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.900
will have the same experience.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.580
That's funny.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.650
You have, that's funny.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.140
And I had a "that's funny"
about 30 years earlier

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.326
when they first announced
complexity mathematics.

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:05.700
And I'd seen a
documentary on it,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.560
and I'd read a couple of books.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.690
And the idea was,
this mathematics

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.919
applies to arrhythmia
in heart attacks,

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:12.960
predicting heart attacks.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.620
It applies to water dripping
out of a rusty faucet.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.290
It applies to the
shape of a leaf edge.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.590
And I thought, that's crazy.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.365
There's no reason for that.

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.990
What's the fundamental
reason for that?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.970
Because I wanted to know
what the patterns were that

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.178
were behind that mathematics.

00:13:28.178 --> 00:13:29.634
Well, they'd had no--

00:13:29.634 --> 00:13:31.800
if we today had someone
from the Santa Fe Institute,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.300
and we've done this
with them, they

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.883
would say we have
three problems left.

00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:37.210
One is we have no fundamental
theory, even today.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.470
So, OK.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.910
And I thought, these
are flow problems.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.724
So I had that much of
the puzzle way back when.

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:46.140
And I had a chance
to do a retreat

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.940
with a woman who is the
president of the Santa Fe

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.580
Institute.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.157
I said, are you guys
doing flow work?

00:13:52.157 --> 00:13:53.490
She goes, that's possible, Mark.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.360
That's possible.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.530
That's all I had.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.660
And then for 30 years, nothing.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.910
And I wasn't worried about it.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.700
It was just-- you kind
of pick up the dust.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.580
Clues happen, you see
somebody, you file it away.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.460
And about two years ago,
we were doing a FiRe,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.030
and I had to say, let's do
flow, because I knew that much.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.899
And we started working
on the program.

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:15.690
And we were working on
a different program,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.390
it's called Undiagnosed, it's
a medical thing for people

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.800
who can't get a diagnosis.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.590
And we had a dinner that night,
and the speaker at the dinner

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.120
was Murray Cantor, who's a
very famous mathematician.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.020
And he chose himself to do
the Lorenz attractor, which

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.250
is the core competency equations
for complexity mathematics.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.510
And after he was
done, it was Q&amp;A time.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.470
I said, Murray, is it possible--
now, I'd gotten this far.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.440
I made a little
traction, because I

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.980
have two friends, one who's
a world expert on fractals.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.320
We'd stayed up all night
in my hotel room one night,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.960
and he's done the fractal thing.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.790
He's like 10 to the
nth to the 10th.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.400
It was a crazy number, just
dive down through Mandelbrots.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.890
And these are also a
very important part

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.600
of complexity math.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.020
So we argued for a whole
night and afternoon.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.610
And I said, I think what we're
seeing is flow and resistance

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.730
to flow, like with water.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.930
He said no.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:11.860
They wanted to add--

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.610
they're electrical [INAUDIBLE]----
they wanted to add a reservoir,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.776
which is possible.

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:19.790
And I said, no, it's just two
things, it's not three things.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.890
So what's the other thing?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.430
And is it resistance,
what is it?

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.160
So I came into Murray Cantor's
talk with that in mind

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.420
and I said, Murray, is
it flow and resistance?

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.100
And he goes, absolutely.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.000
He didn't-- a
microsecond, right?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.692
Now, this is an
interesting thing.

00:15:35.692 --> 00:15:37.150
Here's a pretty
smart guy who knows

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.525
everything there is to know
about complexity mathematics.

00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:41.280
And he just went, yeah.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.130
So I thought, OK.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.838
We grab him, we drag
him out of the room.

00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:46.720
We sit with him over a beer for
90 minutes just pumping him,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.220
like, what is this?

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.362
What's happening here?

00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:51.070
He said, well, first,
Mark, you're wrong.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.350
It's not resistance.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.520
It's coupling.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.170
In mathematics, we
call it coupling.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.060
And I said, Murray, if
we call it coupling,

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.518
they'll think about
rabbits mating.

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:00.654
We can't do that.

00:16:00.654 --> 00:16:01.570
How about interaction?

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.840
He said, interaction is fine.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840
That's fine.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.370
So thus was born
those two terms.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.395
And it turns out--

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:10.020
and Murray, we're
the first one to say,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.120
he said it on stage when
we brought him to FiRe.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.570
I asked him, I was interviewing,
I said, is this everything?

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.269
He said, Mark, it's everything.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.060
SPEAKER 1: And I guess
I didn't realize it,

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.590
but you were saying
this goes back

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.631
to even da Vinci and people
like that were trying

00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:26.240
to study what are these
fundamental interactions that

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.000
create all these patterns, so
there's quite a long history

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.870
of people trying to study this.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.710
MARK ANDERSON: That's right.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.020
So I was asked to do a
speech at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.635
Tech Conference, and they
saw this stuff at FiRe.

00:16:36.635 --> 00:16:38.510
We'd like to talk about
flow and interaction.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.259
And I said, great.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:40.610
How much time do I have?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.296
We spent about
five hours at FiRe.

00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:44.420
So how much time do I have?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.253
He said, 10 minutes.

00:16:45.253 --> 00:16:46.350
No, he said eight minutes.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.570
So eight minutes.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.880
So Denyse Davis,
who works with me

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.700
and is doing research
on this, I said, OK,

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.130
but you've got to let me bring
my own interviewer, which

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.830
I did, and we have to rehearse,
and practice, and get this

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.510
into eight minutes.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.690
And we get it into 10 minutes.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.190
But after that was done, they
had a speaker's party, VIP

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:05.930
party.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.200
And Curtis Wong was there,
who does Bill Gates's work

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.589
on his "Codex Leicester,"
which is a famous Leonardo.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.630
And it's just been
released again, I think.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.970
And I asked Curtis.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.970
I said, what did you think
of that presentation?

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.380
And he said, Mark,
you've achieved

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.879
what Leonardo aspired to.

00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:25.420
SPEAKER 1: That's
quite a compliment.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:25.800
MARK ANDERSON: Cut there.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.650
I'm done.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.800
I'm going home now.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.460
SPEAKER 1: Check, please.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.060
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah, please.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.780
I'm out of here.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.384
I'll pay.

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:31.050
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.180
MARK ANDERSON: And
what he meant--

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.790
then I went back
and read it again.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.250
And he wasn't just
shining me on.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.070
That book is all about water.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.840
And Leonardo used
to stand on a bridge

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.639
and watch the flow of water, and
the eddies, and the resistance,

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:47.180
and the self-interactions, and
the interaction with the coast

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.190
and with the rocks.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.190
And he thought that that
was a fundamental thing

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.990
he was seeing.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.090
And then he would say he
saw it in a woman's hair,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.740
or he saw it in the clouds.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.440
He saw it everywhere he looked.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.099
So he was actually saying
something very real.

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:01.890
SPEAKER 1: So OK, so
this is probably worth

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.306
getting into a
little more detail.

00:18:03.306 --> 00:18:05.850
So can you start with a
capital sketch of what

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.280
you mean by flow
and interactions,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.660
and then maybe we can get
into a little more of what's

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.370
behind it, or some examples
where you see it apply,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.328
and that sort of thing?

00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:13.265
MARK ANDERSON: Sure.

00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:14.640
I think everyone
has an intuitive

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.680
sense of both these
things, and it's not wrong.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.390
So one of the most beautiful
things about this discovery--

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.800
which is what it is, not
an invention, a discovery--

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.090
is that it's not a
description of something

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.320
where it might be right.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.960
It's not just my stupid
idea about something,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.240
and maybe it'll
work out tomorrow.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.420
It emerges from the world.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.070
Just like complexity mathematics
emerges from the world.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.080
So this isn't really
about the usual stuff.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.170
It's really fascinating
because it is what it is.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.490
What you see is what you get.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.360
And if you look into
the biology, or botany,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.650
or the biology of animals,
or how cells work,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.420
or if you look into geology,
and how lava flows to the sea

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.160
and what shapes
result, or cloud shapes

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.730
and how they're
formed, in every case,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.190
it is involving the
flow of something

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.150
and its interaction with
itself or with other things.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.309
In every single case.

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:11.850
And so it's not
surprising that Adobe

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.450
can make fractal
mathematics that you

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.700
can use for all your drawings.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.010
It's not because
it was their idea.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.570
It's because this
literally is what's

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.180
happening with stone, and
with leaf, and with animals.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.690
So the most exciting
part of this to me

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.210
isn't just that it's
universal-- which is exciting--

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.260
but that this universal thing
literally is coming and talking

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.780
to us out of nature.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.960
And we're saying, oh, hi.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.660
Got it.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.180
Thanks for the message.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.960
SPEAKER 1: And so are there
a few basic axioms of it,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.444
or is it a meta pattern
that describes things?

00:19:42.444 --> 00:19:43.860
Are there different
types of flows

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.880
and different types
of interactions

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.930
you find in different systems?

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.050
MARK ANDERSON: There are.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.530
And so the fun part of
our conversation right

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.750
now is, welcome to early days.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.100
We're about two years into this.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.280
We've had very little
time to work on it.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.620
We've published
one work, one book,

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.350
to help people like
you get more into it.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.410
But literally, I can imagine
this going on forever

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.190
and people becoming
experts at this.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.019
I can imagine the
consultants selling services

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:10.560
on how to bring this
to your company,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.726
or how to bring this to
your programming techniques.

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:15.270
How to bring this into your
private scheduling problems.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.780
It applies to everything.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.750
And so we haven't done that yet.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.620
And what I expect to have happen
is like pattern recognition.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.600
I expect to see a
language evolve--

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.100
which we haven't done yet--

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.924
to describe certain
types of flows,

00:20:27.924 --> 00:20:29.340
and certain types
of interactions,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.007
certain types of
mathematical situations

00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:32.381
when these things
are bunched up.

00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:33.969
Sometimes flows are
good and positive.

00:20:33.969 --> 00:20:35.760
Sometimes they're bad
and they're negative.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.200
All of that work
has yet to be done.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.430
SPEAKER 1: And you were
mentioning a fascinating thing,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.929
which is, if you
look at the history

00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:43.620
of high-performance computing,
including what Google does

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.344
with its data centers, and
these data flow algorithms,

00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:47.760
and so forth, a
lot of that can be

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.030
seen as trying to figure
out how to trade off

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.296
flow versus interaction.

00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:53.670
How much parallelism
can you get?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.766
Where are the bottlenecks?

00:20:54.766 --> 00:20:55.890
What has to be distributed?

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.780
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.850
Well, you guys have some
invention called TensorFlow,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.094
that's what it's called.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:01.760
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.040
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.800
So you know what I mean?

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.554
It's pretty clear.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.970
I think to someone who's in
the high-performance computing

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.664
world, going back 30 years or
40 years, if you said to them,

00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:10.830
what's your biggest problem?

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.886
They would say latency.

00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:13.510
That's always been
the biggest problem.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.780
So it's like, how do I get the
time-- squeeze the time out

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.210
of the communication between
these chips and the memory,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.780
or the chips and the chips.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.310
That will never go away.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.220
And what they're saying
is, I have a flow problem.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.770
I need to maximize flow and
minimize the interactions.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.870
I need to have the number
of stops, and trips,

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:34.480
and gateways go down, and
the amount of flow per second

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.607
go up.

00:21:35.607 --> 00:21:36.190
And that's it.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.273
That's all there is to it.

00:21:37.273 --> 00:21:38.620
Everything else is details.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.770
So these guys have been doing
flow interaction since there

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.300
was a supercomputer.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.280
And the same thing,
in a different way,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.350
would be true if
you looked at people

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.010
doing more creative work.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.830
So-- and I don't want
to offend anybody.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.580
I think that there are
new types of chips.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.670
TensorFlow is a new chip.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.870
There are even more
different types of chips.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.389
TrueNorth would be one.

00:21:57.389 --> 00:21:58.430
[? NewEdge ?] is another.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.010
So you're looking
at chips that are

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.390
called non-von-Neumann chips.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.030
They're generally made to
improve pattern recognition,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.100
which is good.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.060
And in those kinds of
systems, you probably

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.460
see a situation where you're
trying to increase something

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.080
other than just the flow.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.520
The quality of
what you're finding

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.770
will be better or
different, and that's

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.310
what you're trying to maximize.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.410
So it's not just you
say, this or this.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.160
And you can have a war
between these guys,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.810
but the guys on the HPC side--
the high-performance side--

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.580
will say, we know
exactly how to do this.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.810
We can scale this
up at Oak Ridge.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.684
And the guys on the
other side will be saying

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.050
something totally different.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.910
And yet they're both right.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.995
And so there is a
long road ahead of us

00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:37.870
in trying to understand,
not just one is good

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.600
and one is bad, but what are
the languages around this?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.410
What situations in technology,
or in human relationships?

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.660
And you can imagine a romantic
relationship being full

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.610
of flow, right?

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.200
And very few but
great interactions.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.180
Or you can imagine
something between nations

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.860
where the flow of goods--
people say trade is good,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.980
the flow of goods provides
some cure against war.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.780
OK, fantastic.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.510
What we found very
early was that--

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.247
so let's go back a step.

00:23:06.247 --> 00:23:08.080
When the global financial
collapse happened,

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.000
I happened to make that
prediction publicly.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.625
And I think I'm the
only person to have

00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:14.260
made that one and the oil
price collapse, which are both.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.780
So no trained economist,
no trained [? economist ?]

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.620
in the world, according to
the "FT--" "Financial Times--"

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.970
got the GFC publicly right.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.650
Wow.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.004
That's amazing.

00:23:27.004 --> 00:23:28.670
So they were looking
at the wrong stuff.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.253
The Harvard-trained,
Stanford-trained,

00:23:30.253 --> 00:23:31.560
whatever the heck it was.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.760
And yet some idiot like me could
look at the flows of currency,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.180
and things like that, and
global liquidity, and go,

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.220
uh-oh, we have a
huge crisis coming.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.057
They just weren't paying
attention to that.

00:23:44.057 --> 00:23:45.390
And we call this flow economics.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.400
But it turns out
if all you did--

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.760
I think it's an argument you can
make that economics is broken

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.410
because of that,
and they should just

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.951
throw the tools away, flush them
down the toilet, start over.

00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:55.530
Reboot.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.300
And if they did
that, flow economics

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.830
is exactly what they should do.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.750
They should be watching
the flow of power

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.470
through Russia, of gas
through Russia, of ideas

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.870
through a company,
of patents coming.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.810
All these things are
flows, and they don't lie.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.730
Generally, they don't lie.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.190
So literally, you can tell
more about China today,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.700
and it's a very
important question.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.590
How's China doing?

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.670
You can tell more
about China today

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.961
and how they're doing by
looking at the flows of things

00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:22.540
than by what you're being told,
because I can guarantee you

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.360
you're being told silly stuff.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.740
SPEAKER 1: Because it's
not a closed system, right?

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.610
That's the point.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.750
You see these things
go in and out--

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.090
MARK ANDERSON: The information--

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.180
yeah, the top part is closed.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:30.830
SPEAKER 1: But
the actual flows--

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.700
MARK ANDERSON: But the
actual flows are detectable.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.230
SPEAKER 1: This is very
topical, obviously,

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.800
the domestic
political environment.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.360
We're thinking about tariffs,
and how much do you--

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.359
what's the relationship
between globalization,

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.650
and global capital flows,
and global flows of migrants,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.211
and how much individual
self-determination each country

00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:46.710
has.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.000
MARK ANDERSON:
Well, in this case--

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.708
we spent a lot of time
on that question--

00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:52.880
we know that Japan,
in post-war Japan,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.440
invented a model which
we call infomercantilism.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.410
It involves controls,
tariffs, structural barriers.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.280
And then South Korea
picked that up, said,

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.440
we can do better than you.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.023
Did exactly to Japan what Japan
had done to the United States.

00:25:04.023 --> 00:25:06.690
And then China showed up
much later, about 2000, said,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.340
we can do that
better than you guys.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.610
Same model, beefed it
up, much bigger country.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.720
So the model has been
around for a while.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.860
And yet it's nothing like
what you see in the press,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.620
You would never see anything
I'm telling you in the press.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.650
So people on Wall Street,
or people in politics going,

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.905
free trade, and
Trump's trade war.

00:25:24.905 --> 00:25:27.030
This is silly, because we
have three nations who've

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.770
built all of their economic
models based on blocking flows.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.480
That's how they got rich.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.494
They favor local companies,
they subsidize them,

00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:37.660
they sell things at half
price in the global market.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.576
It's a great way to get
rich if you can do it.

00:25:39.576 --> 00:25:41.840
It works.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.359
And then some country
tries to respond,

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:45.900
and it's like they're
creating a war.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.710
No, they're not.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.496
We're just seeing some
very feeble things

00:25:48.496 --> 00:25:50.370
the same way that
everybody else is doing it,

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.300
or the other side is doing.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.060
So it's a really big
argument, I think,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.360
that's worth a
long-term discussion,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.930
whether you can be an
innovative country or a company

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.700
and also be obstructive.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.620
My feeling is no.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.590
I think free trade and
free thinking are related.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.980
Free speech is
part of this deal.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.050
You can't have
great innovation--

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.930
SPEAKER 1: Flow of ideas, right?

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:11.790
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.920
So my thought is this
is all one package.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.665
And we'd be doing--

00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:17.790
I think Japan's gotten over
this to a large degree,

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.831
and then South Korea's
still in the middle of it.

00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:21.930
But we'd be doing everybody
a big favor in those

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:27.600
places if they let go
of the current model--

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.490
or modify it enough,
as Japan did--

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.919
so that, in fact, the result
would be that they became

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.210
more innovative in the process.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.490
That would be a big
win for everybody.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.220
SPEAKER 1: I remember the
famous economist, Bill Janeway,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.060
gave a talk at--

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.040
I think it was last year's FiRe.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.320
And one of things he said
that really blew my mind

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.520
is, again, if you
measure the flows--

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.410
I think that's one
of those takeaways--

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.060
if you can look for
any kind of system

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.770
and you can understand the
actual underlying flows,

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.050
like you say, that
might give you insight

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.175
you were missing otherwise.

00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:57.390
And that just the cross-border
flow of capital, and loans,

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.180
and direct foreign investment,
and things like that,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.100
even in the last 20--

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.260
starting in the late '90s
and early 2000s, just

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.290
this incredibly
dramatic increase

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.610
that led up to the global
financial collapse.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.145
And it wouldn't necessarily
let you predict the collapse

00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:13.020
timing, but it definitely
would have told you

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.360
we're in a qualitatively
different regime, which I'm not

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.610
sure you necessarily feel
in your daily life, how

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.410
much of this is happening, and
how much of the stuff around

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.493
me is owned by foreigners.

00:27:20.493 --> 00:27:22.854
But they actually
tracked the flows,

00:27:22.854 --> 00:27:25.020
we had moved into some place
that was very different

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.895
than historical norm.

00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:28.140
MARK ANDERSON: He
was completely right.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.640
One of the differences
between how--

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.310
so he and I agree on this, but
I was looking at it differently.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.960
So he was looking at
flows, god bless him,

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.584
and I was at patterns.

00:27:37.584 --> 00:27:39.250
So we'll come back
to that again, right?

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:39.916
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:39.916 --> 00:27:42.160
MARK ANDERSON: So I saw
a pattern in February 27,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.560
I think it was, of
that year, where

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.622
all of the stock markets in
the world did a kind of a bump.

00:27:50.622 --> 00:27:52.400
Like, all of them.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.540
I mean, not all of them.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.242
A lot of them.

00:27:54.242 --> 00:27:56.450
Normally, you'd see Spain
goes down, Germany goes up,

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.950
whatever.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.129
This is a daily affair.

00:27:58.129 --> 00:28:00.170
You'd have to have something
like if someone shot

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.786
the pope, or some big headline.

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:03.410
And the "FT" caught
onto this, and they

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.870
were like, there's no headline.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.980
They did a piece on it.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.210
And I thought, yeah,
there's no headline.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:07.730
What?

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:08.950
So there's a pattern broken.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.790
There's this long
pattern of stock pricing.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.650
Usually it's exchange
between countries.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.510
Why would all countries go down?

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.630
Or almost all countries.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.890
And it turned out
there was a problem

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.500
that no one had thought of.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.150
And I won't go into
all the details here.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.270
It is in the book
you all should buy.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:26.825
But--

00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:28.200
SPEAKER 1: Actually, I guess
this is maybe a good time

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.908
to remind people.

00:28:28.908 --> 00:28:31.437
So there's "The Pattern
Future," talking about patterns.

00:28:31.437 --> 00:28:34.020
And then he's also got "A Deep
Dive on Flow and Interactions,"

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.024
and we've got a couple
here you can look at,

00:28:36.024 --> 00:28:37.440
and then you can
take information.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.520
They're available to buy online.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.480
But they're-- yeah.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.160
MARK ANDERSON: With a
great quote by Vint Cerf.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.465
SPEAKER 1: And yes,
by our Google's own

00:28:42.465 --> 00:28:44.847
Vint Cerf telling you that
you should buy the book, so.

00:28:44.847 --> 00:28:47.430
MARK ANDERSON: So it turned out
there was a reason, of course,

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.730
behind that.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.730
It'd be like if all
the oceans in the world

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.024
went down a foot for about
three days and came back.

00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:53.690
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.280
Like you said, it's
like, hm, that's funny.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.446
MARK ANDERSON: That's funny.

00:28:56.446 --> 00:29:01.200
So it turned out that global
investors on a very large scale

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.660
had been applying what's called
a carry trade out of Japan

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.951
using Japan's zero interest
rates, or negative interest

00:29:05.951 --> 00:29:06.600
rates.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.980
And the Bank of Japan governor,
kind of new to the job,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.720
and he blew it and he
did a surprise rise.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.370
And they all thought, oh, cover.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.750
Got to cover.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.530
And they all rush
back through the yen.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.580
So you can actually see
the yen going crazy.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.080
You see the Japanese government,
oh, my gosh, we screwed up.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.340
And they're fighting
this yen, they lost.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.240
They fight it again, they lost.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.110
They it fight it
again, they give up,

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.568
and then there's
more to the story.

00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:30.860
But from the pattern side,
that's what was happening.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.370
And so I was a
little luckier to be

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.270
able to say some timing things
than Bill was, because he

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.310
was seeing a gradual change.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.950
But this was over
three days, so I didn't

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.200
know when it was going happen.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.120
I thought, OK, if there's
that much hot money

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.462
in the world moving that
fast on a dime, bad things.

00:29:49.462 --> 00:29:50.670
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.770
Somebody's going to get shot,
something's going to happen.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.920
The trigger doesn't matter.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.410
What matters is
we got ourselves,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.390
just as Bill described,
into a situation

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.910
we have too much hot money
flying around every night.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.780
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
because the other thing

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.905
he said that I think is
very apropos of what you've

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.830
been talking about
is, if you learn

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.500
how to maximize your use
of flow and interactions,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.990
you're essentially trying to
achieve higher throughput,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.002
or higher efficiency, which
normally is a good thing.

00:30:13.002 --> 00:30:14.460
Like in high-performance
computing,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.320
you want to have
maximum efficiency.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.070
But it also creates
a form of fragility,

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.240
because you don't have
the same kind of buffers,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.906
or the chance to stop and take
a beat, that sort of thing.

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:27.780
MARK ANDERSON: I re-read
his talk last night,

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.089
and that's his perspective.

00:30:29.089 --> 00:30:30.630
And it's the one I
mentioned earlier.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.190
It's the reservoir idea.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.260
And it is true that
reservoirs provide buffers,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.490
but they have other costs.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.364
SPEAKER 1: Of course.

00:30:36.364 --> 00:30:37.830
Inventory costs money.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.560
MARK ANDERSON: So I'm not quite
a convert to that one yet.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.570
I agree with the fact
that it does buffer.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.820
I'm not quite ready to agree
that that's the only way

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.762
to get protection.

00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:46.720
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.300
MARK ANDERSON: There may be
ways to manage flows, which

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.550
can change based on
the world around you,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.539
and that can cushion things.

00:30:52.539 --> 00:30:54.330
If you're doing
just-in-time manufacturing,

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.850
like Michael Dell does, he's
not interested in building

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.960
a reservoir.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.490
He's interested in doing
better and better at JIT.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:01.490
And he does it.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.300
So he's kind of the
proof case that you

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.430
don't have to have a
warehouse full of stuff.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.510
SPEAKER 1: I guess
another area this comes up

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.890
a lot is in social media.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.182
We have this ability
to send new information

00:31:10.182 --> 00:31:12.640
all around the world so quickly
and react to it so quickly.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.220
And that's obviously really
good in a lot of ways,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.290
but then it also can
cause misinformation

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.915
to spread out of
control super quickly,

00:31:17.915 --> 00:31:20.710
and it's hard to know how to
have one without the other.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.610
MARK ANDERSON: It's pretty easy
to see, I think, that flows--

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.359
in addition to this
thing being universal,

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.510
we're moving into this
world in a more obvious way.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.242
Just like that.

00:31:28.242 --> 00:31:29.950
So whether you're
talking about computing

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.850
and having petabytes
of flow going by you,

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.600
there's a lot of talk
about flow computing

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.610
now, data flow management.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.890
We talked about
flow triage at FiRe.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.680
How do you just know what to
throw away as fast as possible?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.710
Pretty important skill.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.400
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, when we have
all these sensors generating

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:43.760
so much information.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.970
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.190
So how we live in
a world is based

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.960
on flows and interactions.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.750
It would have been
more theoretical

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.190
probably five years ago.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.440
I don't think there are very
many people probably here

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.440
or anywhere else who now doubt
that their personal world is

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.794
that world right now.

00:31:59.794 --> 00:32:01.460
Whether it's traffic
flows getting home,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.835
or whether there's a flow of
data through their computer,

00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:07.650
or the daily flow of work, the
flow in their relationships,

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.920
the flow of news through
their phone, it's all flows.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.670
And the work they're
doing here at Google.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.378
SPEAKER 1: And so is
your advice to start

00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:17.040
to think about the work you
do, or your own life, in terms

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.248
of what are the flows, and
what are the interactions,

00:32:19.248 --> 00:32:21.330
and use that as the
conceptual model for--

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.406
MARK ANDERSON: Yes.

00:32:22.406 --> 00:32:24.030
I was talking last
night with a person,

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.590
and she said it's life changing.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.380
Changed her life.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.790
That's interesting.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.970
So I think of it as a lens.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.072
It's a new way of seeing.

00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:34.610
It's not necessarily
revolutionary.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.780
Everyone understands flow,
and interactions are obvious.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.770
But they haven't necessarily
put it into a duality.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.520
And they haven't thought
about it as a way

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.590
to become more efficient.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.510
And last night's
conversation that came up.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.900
Not only is it more efficient,
but it means less stress

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.440
for me.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.030
Well, how do you avoid dying?

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.840
Less stress.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.160
How do you avoid disease?

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.310
Less stress.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.870
So if there were one word,
the occurrence of the word

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.380
stress in every medical paper
that says, "don't do this?"

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.880
So this is a pretty
important thing.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.320
If you wanted to reduce
stress in your life,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.264
and you only did one
thing, you use this way

00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:09.680
of seeing your
world so that you'd

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.695
be more efficient and
less worried about it.

00:33:12.695 --> 00:33:13.690
It'd be a good thing.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:14.130
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.590
That was something that
was very topical for us

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.660
at Google, because
we have so many flows

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.770
of incoming information.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.770
Email, and alerts, and the
system going on, or whatever,

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.870
and trying to figure
out how to be maximally

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.970
productive while still being
interconnected to everything

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.290
that's going on
around us is something

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.248
we struggle with a lot.

00:33:28.248 --> 00:33:31.610
MARK ANDERSON: Well, everyone
has written books and articles

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.960
about email
interrupting your day,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.480
and people
interrupting your day,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.146
and whether you should
or you shouldn't.

00:33:37.146 --> 00:33:39.620
Sometimes it's good,
sometimes it's bad.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.880
But it's pretty ad
hoc, in my opinion.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.020
I don't think that the
science is very helpful yet.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.540
And yet that's the
world we live in.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.010
And you can add
another parameter

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.190
to that idea of your day,
which I think we've done.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.900
So give you two examples.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.430
We do meditation every day.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.390
It's not very long.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.860
10 or 20 minutes.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.160
But I think that
that particular thing

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.979
is really important in keeping
the flow of the day high.

00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:06.020
And it's been proven that
your productivity drops

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.070
if you don't take
a nap, or if you

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.236
don't do that kind of thing.

00:34:08.236 --> 00:34:09.469
You guys have that down.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.030
So that's an idea.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.522
And then if you have the idea--

00:34:12.522 --> 00:34:14.480
there are a lot of smart
people here at Google,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.400
so this will fit.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.620
Instead of having
prioritizations and lists

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.578
where you're going to do
this, and you do this,

00:34:20.578 --> 00:34:22.100
and you do this, I
think it's easier

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.989
to have four or five
things that you're

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.159
working on at the same time.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.230
And if the phone--

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.886
if the guy isn't
there, or the woman,

00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:30.260
you can't reach
them by whatever,

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.900
you don't let that block your--
it's not a true interaction,

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.610
you just go right
into the other thing.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.780
And so because you
got three, or four,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.460
or five things
going all the time,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.100
you're always at full speed.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.365
And it's not that stressful.

00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:41.989
If it's stressful,
you shouldn't do it.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.572
But if you're just
kind of used to it,

00:34:43.572 --> 00:34:45.800
you kind of build up
to it, it turns out

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.360
you can get a lot more done.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.735
And you could think of this
from a computing perspective.

00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.805
So if you-- people know
about messaging protocol.

00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:53.270
They open API and stuff.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.580
If you want to run a multiple
processor environment,

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.570
it's hard to compile problems
across many processors

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.010
if you're not just showing
video or something.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.760
And that problem remains
in a lot of ways.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.540
So how do you
distribute the problems?

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.436
It's a big deal.

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.310
But if you're thinking
about several things--

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.170
back to Windows threads.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.410
There are solutions to this.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.600
And so I think it's pretty
clear that the compute world is

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.594
behind us, human brains, but
coming in the same direction.

00:35:17.594 --> 00:35:18.260
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.635
And it's interesting,
you mention

00:35:19.635 --> 00:35:21.950
a lot of this renaissance of
these non-von-Neumann chip

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.310
architectures have to
do with how you optimize

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.140
and then break apart
these data flows

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.850
so you don't have the same
traditional bottlenecks, right?

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:29.683
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:35:29.683 --> 00:35:31.350
And reducing power consumption.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.059
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:34.266
And they're doing it in
service of pattern computing.

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:35.940
So it doesn't become
maybe full circle.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.480
You had these two separate
worlds of pattern recognition,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.854
and flow and interaction, and
it's an interesting insight

00:35:40.854 --> 00:35:43.932
that studying the
flow and interaction

00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:45.390
helps you do the
pattern computing.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.720
And it may be vice
versa, I don't know.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.020
Can you apply
pattern recognition

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.010
to flow and interactions?

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.330
MARK ANDERSON: So
I'm just talking

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.496
about the theory in general.

00:35:51.496 --> 00:35:53.510
But I think that
if you've gotten

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.207
to where we are today
in these two theories,

00:35:56.207 --> 00:35:58.040
then the really exciting
question that comes

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.490
next is, do they fit together?

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.010
And how do they fit together?

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.170
And I'm pretty convinced
they fit really well.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.780
And if we were sitting
here in private,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.270
I'd probably get myself
the point where I'd say,

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.641
the ultimate experience
in figuring things out--

00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:15.890
if you really wanted to do
the best science ever done,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.770
if you really wanted to do the
best compute designs ever done,

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.180
what you would do would be to
apply pattern discovery to flow

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.090
and interaction.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.230
And if you did that, you'd
have this most amazing

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.880
intellectual experience.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.110
True discovery.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.693
SPEAKER 1: You think
that can actually

00:36:31.693 --> 00:36:34.694
be bottled and put into a
real service of some kind?

00:36:34.694 --> 00:36:36.860
MARK ANDERSON: Well, that's
a really great question.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.276
Someday, I'll tell
you the answer.

00:36:38.276 --> 00:36:39.110
SPEAKER 1: Hm.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.300
There might be
something behind that.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.960
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.900
SPEAKER 1: I'm
mindful of the time.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.890
We can keep going,
but if anybody

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.630
starts having questions they
want to talk to Mark about,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.960
as you can see, you
can pick his brain

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.180
on a wide variety of topics.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.013
Why don't you guys go
to the mics over there

00:36:49.013 --> 00:36:50.900
so we make sure we get
it for the live stream

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.154
and for putting up on
YouTube afterwards?

00:36:54.154 --> 00:36:55.320
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.860
I wonder if you ever read the
book "On Growth and Form,"

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.360
and do you think
any of these ideas

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.630
were pre-saged there, or
maybe developed in that book?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.235
MARK ANDERSON: What's
the first-- what's

00:37:03.235 --> 00:37:03.740
the name of the book?

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.311
AUDIENCE: "On Growth and Form."

00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:05.810
It's a--

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.610
MARK ANDERSON: I don't know it.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.290
But there are a lot of
books that apply to this.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.050
And many of them are well known.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:16.530
They have to do with data
structures and so forth.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.550
There are a number of books--

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.430
if you gave us your email,
I could send you some books

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.692
that I've been looking at
that are very pictorial,

00:37:24.692 --> 00:37:26.400
and they're all about
this kind of thing.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.650
I don't think they
were written--

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.941
I'm sure they were not written
with this stuff in mind.

00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:34.340
You go back and look at the
flows described in these books.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.820
You go, oh, I get it now.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.590
That makes more sense to me.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.464
AUDIENCE: It was at the
beginning of the talk

00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:41.934
when you mentioned that the
famous inventor was talking

00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:44.100
about how he observed
patterns in water and thought,

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.110
there must be
something fundamental--

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:45.560
SPEAKER 1: da Vinci, yeah.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.160
MARK ANDERSON:
That was Leonardo.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.520
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a specific reference?

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.160
In what book did he meant
to talk about that--

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.600
MARK ANDERSON: The
"Codex Leicester."

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.433
AUDIENCE: Which one?

00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:53.120
MARK ANDERSON:
"Codex Leicester."

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.260
L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R. And I
think it just came out again.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.760
Bill Gates owns it,
but I think they

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.682
published a new version of it.

00:38:00.682 --> 00:38:02.694
It's pretty cool to read.

00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:03.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.160
So it sounds like
you've had some success

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.630
as a futurist predicting
what's going to happen--

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.880
MARK ANDERSON: Not a futurist.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.690
A predictions expert.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.650
AUDIENCE: Predictions expert.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.900
MARK ANDERSON: Very different.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.930
AUDIENCE: So is there the
equivalent of the GFC coming?

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.070
Or are there any upcoming
economic predictions

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.980
that you've made that
may be negative for me

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.420
that I should know about?

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.700
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah, sure.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.950
And I'll just do
the drop thing here.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.830
If you subscribe to SNS,
you get it every week.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.380
But we've been working-- and
it's kind of a funny situation.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.930
So according to the
Department of Justice,

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.140
we have a division which has
done the best job ever done

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.900
at describing the Chinese
national business model.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.570
And China is so large and so
important in the global economy

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.912
that if you don't track China
pretty much week to week,

00:38:52.912 --> 00:38:54.370
you're not getting
the whole story.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.250
You don't understand
the global picture.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:02.830
And we made a discovery, I
believe in January of 2015,

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.790
that based on some things
we were seeing inside China,

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.610
that they were having
economic problems.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:14.090
And now it's three years later,
pretty clear that worked out.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.050
That was true.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.050
So if you were worried
about the global economy,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.910
and you say, what
possibly could go wrong,

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:23.020
other than [INAUDIBLE] stuff,
one thing that could go wrong

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.920
would be that China
was in trouble.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.050
And my opinion-- just
call it opinion--

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:34.330
is that they have been having
an economic downturn since then,

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.400
which is why you see their
national debt exploding.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.040
It actually began
climbing before that,

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.630
but I think that's a
pretty good turning point.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.980
So my prediction has
been that they've run out

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.510
of tools to contain this.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.280
And that's a pretty
arrogant statement.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.821
They have a lot of
tools, and they're

00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:52.120
very good at containing
things, including information.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.540
So it's a bit hard to dig up.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.910
But you'll see things
that would reinforce

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.660
the case if it's true.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.810
So as an example,
market manipulations

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.840
to avoid the outside world
seeing that the markets were

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.640
in bad shape.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.880
They just pulled
six big companies,

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.230
they de-listed them a month ago.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.340
They have others like HNA,
which essentially bankrupt.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.660
So bank that said, we won't
give any money to HNA, they're

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.410
bankrupt.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.640
Well, then the party
came in and said,

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.230
give them billions of
dollars, thank you.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.550
They said, OK, we'll do that.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.630
Same bank.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.030
So these are unnatural
acts, on some level.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.990
And I think that they provide
a floor for understanding

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.494
the prediction that we made.

00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:35.160
And I don't know where
it's going to go.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.784
But to the degree
that we're predicting

00:40:36.784 --> 00:40:39.220
that the Chinese
economy is going

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.450
through some kind of major
problem that was not temporary.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.400
It was structural.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.260
That seems to be true.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.532
So I think that would answer
your question, probably.

00:40:49.532 --> 00:40:50.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.863
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:40:50.863 --> 00:40:52.210
SPEAKER 1: It's one to watch.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.480
One thing that
strikes me is, it must

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.650
take a fair amount of courage
to make a prediction that

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.527
is not what all the smart guys
in the room are saying, right?

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.360
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.318
SPEAKER 1: Is that
something you've always had,

00:41:06.318 --> 00:41:09.264
to be able to tell
some smart person,

00:41:09.264 --> 00:41:11.430
or at least to be able to
put it out there and say--

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.210
because you often do it in a
very humble way, like maybe I

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:13.960
don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.220
but it seems to me x, y, or z.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.610
But there's some
wisdom behind that.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.010
But talk to me
about that process,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.090
because I think
innovation requires,

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.520
often, everybody thinks
you're crazy, but you're not.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.390
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.070
Well, I'm lucky I now have
since 1995 to fall back on.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.300
I didn't have that in 1996.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.656
So that helps.

00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:31.030
And you don't have
to state that.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.404
People can just
go find that out.

00:41:32.404 --> 00:41:33.113
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:41:33.113 --> 00:41:35.112
MARK ANDERSON: People
tend to think that they're

00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:36.430
in an argument with you.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.350
If you say something
that they don't like,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:39.860
they want to argue with you.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.650
And I never argue with people.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.320
I just say, look, one of us
is right and one is wrong.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.220
Tomorrow, it's either
going to be sunny,

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.240
or it's going to rain.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.400
I'll predict rain.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.100
You take your shot,
and we'll find out.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.016
I'll call you tomorrow,
we'll see what it was.

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:52.130
So there's no heat in it.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.060
There's no emotion in it.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.115
It's just, either this
prediction will come true,

00:41:55.115 --> 00:41:56.090
or it won't.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.930
It's not a matter of conjecture,
it's just a prediction.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.330
And I think that helps, because
it clears the air of emotion.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.000
But certainly,
you can say things

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.405
that people don't
want you to say.

00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:09.100
SPEAKER 1: I guess
also, just speaking

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.580
of pattern recognition
on pattern recognition,

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.860
you've been through
enough situations

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.540
where the experts
didn't have it right.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.869
Or at least know that, what
are the chances that they could

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:18.160
be wrong, and I could be right?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.770
Well, we have seen that
happen before, so at least

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.890
at a meta level, there's
some confidence there, right?

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:22.810
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.221
I was in a secret meeting
that I won't describe.

00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:28.220
But we've briefed a lot
of three-level agencies,

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.094
[INAUDIBLE] agencies.

00:42:29.094 --> 00:42:32.920
And a guy there who
was world famous

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.190
argued with me about something.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.250
And I can't tell you
about the meeting,

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.250
but I can tell you what I said.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.570
And so I said, I
think you're wrong.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.890
And he said, well, I'm
right because I'm this guy.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:44.980
And I said, well,
what are the numbers?

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.650
And I knew what
the numbers were.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.830
And luckily, there
was one other person

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.300
in this fairly small
meeting who also

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.424
knew what the numbers were.

00:42:50.424 --> 00:42:52.240
I said, your
perspective is wrong

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.840
because if it goes
the way I'm saying,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.070
nothing bad will happen.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.390
And you're really, really
worried about that.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.280
It's preventing you
from taking action,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.950
and you shouldn't be worried.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:05.240
So I guess there's
one thing that I got--

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.690
I mean, I did have an argument,
but it was pretty important.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.140
In general, the danger isn't
from Wall Street analysts,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.200
or the hoi poloi, or all
the analysts in the world,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.210
or economists pile on you.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.620
They probably don't even bother.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.120
They just say what
they want to say.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.690
And someone has to weed
you out in the noise.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.640
But there's a
different danger where

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.402
you say something that
makes somebody mad,

00:43:27.402 --> 00:43:29.360
or you say something
which risks their company,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.410
puts them at risk.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.900
Not because you don't like
the company, it's just true.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.380
You uncover a crime.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.060
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.851
MARK ANDERSON: I've
uncovered a few crimes.

00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:38.760
I've had death
threats from that, so.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.400
SPEAKER 1: Imagine if you
track flows of money and things

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.730
like that.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.380
Sometimes you find things
you weren't supposed to.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.250
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.980
I actually did some
work a long time ago

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.410
that led to the first
imprisonment of officers

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.280
and directors in the
savings and loan scandal.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.950
And I got death threats then.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.550
And 5 million fines.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.580
So it can be dangerous
to say things.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.040
But I think you're right.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.530
I have the personal view
that you're going to be OK.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.600
I think courage
has its own reward.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.350
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.970
And you're not doing it
with an obvious agenda.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.860
You're just letting your
data go where it takes you.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.130
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.270
It's funny, people think--

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.050
since we all have agendas,
they assume you have one.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.060
I do have one, tell the truth.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.030
Predict the future.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.738
That's my agenda.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.670
During the first
election, I said

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.560
George Bush Jr.,
if he's elected,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.990
will become the worst
president in American history.

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.390
And I got all this hate mail
from Republicans saying,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.210
you are so biased.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.090
You're a Democrat.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.605
I tried to get it, it's like,
no, you don't understand.

00:44:36.605 --> 00:44:37.940
I'm not at all biased.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.040
I believe this.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.260
This is going to happen.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.510
And I think that actually
worked out pretty good

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:42.770
as a prediction until now.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.460
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I
was going to say,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.690
it was looking really good.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.590
MARK ANDERSON: Now I have
to rewrite it again and go--

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.320
but for a while, it
was a pretty good call.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.080
SPEAKER 1: Any more questions?

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.205
We have a few moments left.

00:44:50.205 --> 00:44:51.787
Yeah, go ahead, go to the mic.

00:44:51.787 --> 00:44:53.120
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.790
It seems like a lot
of your predictions

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.140
are around economics
and maybe politics.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.200
Are there any other fields that
you focus on that are possibly

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.430
scientific.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.680
MARK ANDERSON: Oh, yeah.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.384
Many, many.

00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:06.300
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
to hear an example.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.420
MARK ANDERSON: Well,
so health care.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.730
Genetics.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.230
We have a new
genetic theory called

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:19.670
equilibrium genetics that came
out of pattern recognition.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:20.480
Physics.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.090
So I've written a theory
called resonance theory, which

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.420
is based on the same thing.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.920
It was probably one of the
two first papers that looks

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.882
like a string theory paper.

00:45:29.882 --> 00:45:31.340
The first one was
finally published

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.871
by Michael Green back in '80.

00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:35.120
I couldn't get mine published.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.280
I had to publish it myself,
because no one would

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.750
publish my paper.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.320
But it's still, I think,
as correct as it was then.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.230
So there are a lots of reasons
people don't get their physics

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.052
papers published.

00:45:47.052 --> 00:45:49.010
So I think it applies to
anything, any science,

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.530
doesn't matter.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.190
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
observations or predictions

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.165
over the housing
price in the Bay Area?

00:45:56.165 --> 00:45:57.540
For example, I
live in Sunnyvale,

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.250
and the price basically doubled
in the past eight years.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:09.420
A 1,700-square-foot home
with a 7,000 square feet lot,

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.710
the price goes from 1.2
million to 2.5 million

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.240
in my neighborhood.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.240
I wonder, how much
higher can it go?

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.790
And meanwhile, when
I look all the stats

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:23.210
in the past few years,
for every five to six

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.597
to seven new jobs created, there
was only one new housing unit

00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:28.430
being built. So clearly,
you see the pattern

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.130
of supply and demand.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.710
But meanwhile, if I look at
the patterns in Chinese cities,

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:38.660
like Beijing and Shanghai,
1,000-square-feet apartment can

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.810
go as high as $2 million US.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.880
By the same pattern, we
can argue, in the Bay Area,

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.910
the same 7,000-square-foot lot
can go as high as $10 million.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.762
So what kind of predictions
or observations do you have?

00:46:51.762 --> 00:46:54.220
MARK ANDERSON: So I think you've
2/3 answered your question

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.530
yourself already.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:01.340
Certainly, tech has a
long-term impact on housing.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.900
That's true.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.580
Also, China does.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.539
And so I would almost--

00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:07.913
I don't know if you're Chinese,
but I'd send the question

00:47:07.913 --> 00:47:09.890
back to you, which
would be, if I'm

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:13.190
right about the current state
of the Chinese domestic economy

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.100
and their troubles there,
you see the government trying

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.124
to squeeze lending a
little bit and reduce

00:47:18.124 --> 00:47:19.040
the amount of lending.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.410
You see people trying
to find the next place

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:22.530
to put their money.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.570
They had wealth
management products,

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.010
all these different
places to put your money

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.968
to get a higher return.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:32.360
Well, given that I think
that the Chinese market was

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.980
an important-- or Chinese
people were important players

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.420
in the Vancouver, Seattle,
and San Francisco real estate

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.880
markets, will the turmoil,
the internal struggles

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.580
in the economy at home,
cause them to do less or more

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.960
purchasing of real estate--

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.300
legally or illegally,
I don't care--

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.550
in the United States
in the future?

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.522
What do you think?

00:47:56.522 --> 00:47:57.820
AUDIENCE: 21 years.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.580
MARK ANDERSON: OK.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.930
Well, I don't know the
answer to that question.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.804
But if we're going to
do a deep dive on that,

00:48:01.804 --> 00:48:04.310
I would try to figure
out that answer.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.200
Because it could go either way.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.990
If they feel like
they're not being allowed

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.660
to find good returns
at home anymore,

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.734
they will probably find illegal
ways of repackaging money out--

00:48:15.734 --> 00:48:17.150
which they've
already been doing--

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.130
and stay with the program of
buying real estate elsewhere.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:25.320
If they feel as though
that's not the case,

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.270
then my guess is that as the
investing climate suffers

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.259
in China, they'll pull back.

00:48:32.259 --> 00:48:33.800
And that will have
a dramatic effect.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.250
When there's low inventory--
like you mentioned--

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.710
when there's low
inventory, prices

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.450
are very highly leveraged.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.010
And it doesn't take
much of a loss.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:43.880
A few percent
decline in demand can

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.910
create a very large
percentage decline in price.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:52.237
So my guess is, probably,
it's going to be that one.

00:48:52.237 --> 00:48:54.570
But we'll have to see the
answer to this first question.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.710
I don't know the answer
to that question.

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.449
When I don't know something,
I love saying I don't know.

00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:00.740
In that case, I don't know yet.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.800
You're making an
interesting point about,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.550
that there's all these
interconnected forces that

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.000
aren't--

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.374
you talk about
looking in a silo.

00:49:06.374 --> 00:49:09.050
You think, OK, well, what's
Facebook's stock price going

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.080
to do over the next
year, and what's

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.690
that going to do for
Menlo Park housing?

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.440
But there's obviously
these bigger factors

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.250
at play that might end up being
a bigger needle mover than

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.750
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.041
MARK ANDERSON: Much more money.

00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:19.250
Much more money, yeah.

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:20.180
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, the
money has to go somewhere.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.170
MARK ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.380
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.410
Well, this has been fascinating.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.530
I think we could obviously
gone on for twice the time,

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:26.270
but thanks so much for
coming by and talking to us,

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.040
and giving us all
something to think about.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.770
MARK ANDERSON:
Denyse will be there

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.990
if you'd like to get a
signed book from Denyse,

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.920
she'll make sure you get one.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.530
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:32.120
Let's all thank our--

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.495
MARK ANDERSON:
Thanks, everybody.

00:49:33.495 --> 00:49:35.750
