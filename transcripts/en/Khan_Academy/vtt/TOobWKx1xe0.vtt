00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
So we have two
intersecting lines here,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.637
and then we have this
other purple-looking line.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.220
And then they've
given us some angles.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.920
They tell us that the measure
of this angle right over here

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.010
is 7x.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.020
The measure of this angle
right over here is 60 degrees.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.240
And the measure of this
angle right over here is x.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.300
So let's try to figure out
what all of these angles are.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.410
So to do that, we have
to figure out what x is.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.570
And there's a big clue here,
because the 60-degree angle

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.440
plus the x angle,
they're adjacent.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.610
And if you add these two angles
together, their outer rays,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.299
our vertical angle
with this 7x angle.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.840
So we could say-- and just to
visualize that a little better,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.060
let me color it in.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.540
Actually, let me do it this way.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.080
You see that this
angle out here--

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.970
let me do it in a color
I haven't used yet.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.530
This entire angle
over here, which

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.960
is going to be 60
degrees plus x, that's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.210
a vertical angle with
this angle, the one that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.850
has measure 7x.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.980
So we could say that 60
degrees plus x is equal to 7x

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.340
because vertical
angles are equal.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.890
So let's write that down.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.310
We get 60.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.030
And we'll assume that
everything is in degrees.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.770
60 plus-- let me do that
in this other color.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.180
60 plus x is going
to be equal to 7x.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.195
And now we just
have to solve for x.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:24.570
So the simplest
thing to do would

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320
be to get all over x's on
one side of the equation.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.820
I've already gotten seven
x's on this right-hand side,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.594
so let's get rid of all of
the x's on the left-hand side.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.260
And the easiest way
to get rid of this x

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.740
is to subtract x from
the left-hand side.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100
But of course, in order
to keep it an equation,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.750
we can't just do
something to one side.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.291
Otherwise, it won't
be equal anymore.

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.020
We have to do it to both sides.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.280
So let's subtract
x from both sides.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.190
And on the left-hand side,
we are left with just the 60.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.020
So we're left with just a 60.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.360
And then that is going to
be equal to 7x minus x.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.340
If I have 7 of something
and I get rid of 1 of them,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.650
I'm going to have 6 of
that something left.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.140
So that's going
to be equal to 6x.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.610
So we have 6 times
something is equal to 60.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.979
You could probably figure
that out in your head.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.850
But I will do it a
little systematically.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.190
We can divide both sides
by 6 to solve for x.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.600
So let's do that.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.660
And we would be left
with x is equal to.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.780
60 divided by 6 is 10.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.419
And we reminded ourselves that
everything was in degrees.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:26.710
And we could even do that here.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.680
This was in degrees.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.940
This is in degrees.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.270
And so this is in
degrees right over here.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.830
So the measure of this angle
right over here is 10 degrees.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.010
So this one right over
there is 10 degrees.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100
This is, of course, 60 degrees.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.260
You add them together, 60
degrees plus 10 degrees

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780
is 70 degrees.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.081
So this bigger angle right
over here is 70 degrees.

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.455
And of course, this one over
here, it's a vertical angle.

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:50.871
It's going to have
to be the same.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.520
And we see that, 7 times x.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.244
7 times 10 degrees is
70 degrees as well.
