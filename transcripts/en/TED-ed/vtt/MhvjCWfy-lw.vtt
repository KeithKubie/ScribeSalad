00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:11.397
They say, 'Time is money,'

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:14.140
but what does one really have to do with the other?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.595
Meet Sheila!

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.072
She just got her first big bonus.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:22.094
Sheila knows exactly what she wants to do with that money.

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:25.659
She's had her eye on a nice convertible for a while now.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.049
Yes, Sheila, that's a nice car!

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:31.448
Oh, looks like Sheila is a little short.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.404
But wait!

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:34.176
She has an idea.

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:35.819
Sheila is a smart cookie.

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.499
She knows that if she deposits the money for a year

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.433
instead of buying the car today,

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.544
she will earn interest.

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:45.889
Then she'll be able to afford the car.

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:49.601
Sheila knows that the value of her deposit one year from now

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.992
will equal the money deposited today plus the interest earned.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.623
We call Sheila's money deposited today

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.814
the present value of money.

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:01.073
And the value of Sheila's deposit next year

00:01:01.073 --> 00:01:03.079
is the future value of money.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.832
What connects one to the other?

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:06.251
The interest rate,

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:10.290
also known as the time value of money.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.994
Now, with a little bit of rearranging,

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:15.079
we can figure out the future value of Sheila's money

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.788
with this equation.

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:21.016
So in a year, the future value will be $11,000.

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:22.395
Well, it's been a year!

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.394
And there's Sheila, with enough money to buy the car.

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:28.275
Sheila really understands the future value of money.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:31.531
Now, I just hope she understands the speed limit!

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.633
Now, meet Timmy.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.553
He's also gotten his bonus.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.493
The money seems to be burning a hole in his pocket.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:42.440
Yes, Timmy, that's a nice car that will surely impress people.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.175
Oh! Looks like you're a little short.

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:47.479
Maybe you can follow Sheila's example.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.275
You see, Timmy, just like Sheila,

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.551
after the first year, you'll have $11,000.

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:56.161
But Timmy, that is still not enough to buy that fancy car.

00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.995
Why don't you leave the money deposited for another year?

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.914
Let's see how your deposit will be doing in two years.

00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.772
With a little bit of rearranging,

00:02:03.772 --> 00:02:05.940
it becomes the value of your money next year,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.353
times one plus the interest rate.

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:11.082
We can then convert the future value one year from now

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:14.165
to the present value times one plus the interest rate.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.790
We can even simplify this further

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.654
by just squaring the value of one plus the interest rate.

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:22.232
Sorry, Timmy, you'll have more money after two years,

00:02:22.232 --> 00:02:24.860
but you still can't afford the car!

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.113
I don't know how many more years you'll have to wait,

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:30.558
but I can tell you one way we can figure it out.

00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:33.190
Do you see that little number two in the equation?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.731
Any number that you put in there

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.256
is the number of years that you are waiting,

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.890
also known as the period.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.262
Sure, Timmy, we can see how much you'll have in five years.

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:48.445
Let's connect future value and present value across five years.

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.677
Let's watch the period increase from two to five.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:58.031
After 5 years, you'll have $16,105.10.

00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:01.147
Sorry, Timmy, you have to wait a little longer.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.780
10 years?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.593
Yeah! Let's see if you'll be able to buy the car then.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:08.146
Not quite.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:13.011
Well, Timmy, it looks like you'll need 26 years to afford this car.

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:16.190
You should ask Sheila for a ride to the beach.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.541
Maybe a bicycle will suit you better?

00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:20.534
I hear the bus is pretty cheap!
