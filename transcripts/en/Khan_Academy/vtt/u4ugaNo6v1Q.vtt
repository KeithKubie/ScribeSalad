00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:02.501
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.869
is calculate by hand

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:09.740
the correlation coefficient
for a set of bi-variated data.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.437
Now, when I say bi-variate

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:14.712
it's just a fancy way of
saying for each X data point,

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:16.996
there's a corresponding Y data point.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.461
Now, before I calculate the
correlation coefficient,

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:20.640
let's just make sure we understand

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.751
some of these other statistics
that they've given us.

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:25.924
So, we assume that these are samples

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:28.200
of the X and the corresponding Y

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.052
from our broader population.

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.428
And so, we have the sample mean for X

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.984
and the sample standard deviation for X.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.307
The sample mean for X
is quite straightforward

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.508
to calculate, it would
just be one plus two

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.925
plus two plus three over four

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.450
and this is eight over four

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.689
which is indeed equal to two.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.010
The sample standard deviation for X,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.350
we've also seen this before,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.925
this should be a little bit review,

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:56.807
it's gonna be the square root

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.976
of the distance from each of these points

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.728
to the sample mean squared.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.429
So, one minus two squared

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.117
plus two minus two squared

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:10.941
plus two minus two squared

00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.358
plus three minus two squared,

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:16.189
all of that over, since
we're talking about

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.131
sample standard deviation,

00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:19.940
we have four data points,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.006
so one less than four is
all of that over three.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.568
Now, this actually simplifies quite nicely

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:29.906
because this is zero, this is zero,

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:32.485
this is one, this is one

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.174
and so you essentially get the square root

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:38.341
of 2/3 which is if you approximate 0.816.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.317
So, that's that.

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:44.226
And the same thing is true for Y.

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:45.395
The sample mean for Y,

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:48.169
if you just add up one plus two plus three

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:52.054
plus six over four, four data points,

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:56.025
this is 12 over four which
is indeed equal to three

00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:58.246
and then the sample standard deviation

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.297
for Y you would calculate
the exact same way

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:01.272
we did it for X

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:03.272
and you would get 2.160.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:07.300
Now, with all of that out of the way,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.270
let's think about how we calculate

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.603
the correlation coefficient.

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.237
Now, right over here is a representation

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:19.098
for the formula for the
correlation coefficient

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:21.954
and at first it might
seem a little intimating

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:24.560
until you realize a few things.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.703
All this is saying is for
each corresponding X and Y,

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:30.620
find the Z score for X,

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:34.173
so we could call this Z sub X

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:35.937
for that particular X,

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:38.041
so Z sub X sub I

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.845
and we could say this is the Z score

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:40.854
for that particular Y.

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:45.594
Z sub Y sub I is one way that
you could think about it.

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:47.437
Look, this is just saying
for each data point,

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.399
find the difference
between it and its mean

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:55.025
and then divide by the
sample standard deviation.

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:57.450
And so, that's how many
sample standard deviations

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.191
is it away from its mean,

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.043
and so that's the Z score
for that X data point

00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:06.879
and this is the Z score for
the corresponding Y data point.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.849
How many sample standard
deviations is it away

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.375
from the sample mean?

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.921
In the real world you
won't have only four pairs

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.587
and it'll be very hard to do it by hand

00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:18.926
and we typically use software
computer tools to do it

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:20.895
but it's really valuable to do it by hand

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:24.514
to get an intuitive understanding
of what's going on here.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:27.590
So, in this particular situation,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.180
R is going to be equal
to one over N minus one.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.345
We have four pairs, so it's gonna be 1/3

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.009
and it's gonna be times
a sum of the products

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.658
of the Z scores.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:41.418
So, this first pair right over here,

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:44.218
so the Z score for this one

00:03:44.218 --> 00:03:47.846
is going to be one
minus how far it is away

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.412
from the X sample mean,

00:03:50.412 --> 00:03:54.579
divided by the X sample
standard deviation, 0.816,

00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:58.401
that times one,

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:02.961
now we're looking at the Y variable,

00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:06.805
the Y Z score, so it's one minus three,

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:10.972
one minus three over the Y
sample standard deviation, 2.160

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:16.701
and we're just going keep doing that.

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:17.596
I'll do it like this.

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:21.857
So, the next one it's
going to be two minus two

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:25.524
over 0.816, this is
where I got the two from

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:30.179
and I'm subtracting from
that the sample mean

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:34.482
right over here, times, now
we're looking at this two,

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.649
two minus three over 2.160

00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:45.644
plus I'm happy there's
only four pairs here,

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.383
two minus two again, two minus two

00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:53.550
over 0.816 times now we're
gonna have three minus three,

00:04:56.914 --> 00:04:59.247
three minus three over 2.160

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:05.525
and then the last pair you're
going to have three minus two,

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:06.603
three minus two

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:09.353
over 0.816 times six minus three,

00:05:12.872 --> 00:05:15.122
six minus three over 2.160.

00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:19.457
So, before I get a calculator out,

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:22.006
let's see if there's some
simplifications I can do.

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:24.147
Two minus two, that's gonna be zero,

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:25.657
zero times anything is zero,

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:27.309
so this whole thing is zero,

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:28.218
two minus two is zero,

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:29.176
three minus three is zero,

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.186
this is actually gonna be zero times zero,

00:05:31.186 --> 00:05:33.381
so that whole thing is zero.

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.569
Let's see this is going
to be one minus two

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.341
which is negative one,

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.345
one minus three is negative two,

00:05:40.345 --> 00:05:43.756
so this is going to be R is equal to 1/3

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:47.697
times negative times negative is positive

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:51.114
and so this is going to be two over 0.816

00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:56.474
times 2.160 and then plus
three minus two is one,

00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:00.842
six minus three is three,

00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:03.925
so plus three over 0.816 times 2.160.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.131
Well, these are the same denominator,

00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:11.961
so actually I could rewrite
if I have two over this thing

00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.685
plus three over this thing,

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:15.620
that's gonna be five over this thing,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.843
so I could rewrite this whole thing,

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:20.093
five over 0.816 times 2.160

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:26.274
and now I can just get a calculator out

00:06:26.274 --> 00:06:28.085
to actually calculate this,

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:30.688
so we have one divided by three

00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:33.938
times five divided by 0.816 times 2.16,

00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:42.885
the zero won't make a difference

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.283
but I'll just write it down,

00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:46.927
and then I will close that parentheses

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:49.421
and let's see what we get.

00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:51.299
We get an R of, and since everything else

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:53.124
goes to the thousandth place,

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:54.630
I'll just round to the thousandths place,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.797
an R of 0.946.

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.768
So, R is approximately 0.946.

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:07.544
So, what does this tell us?

00:07:07.544 --> 00:07:10.392
The correlation coefficient is a measure

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:15.090
of how well a line can
describe the relationship

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.423
between X and Y.

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.221
R is always going to be greater than

00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:21.924
or equal to negative one

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.155
and less than or equal to one.

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:26.112
If R is positive one,

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.593
it means that an upwards sloping line

00:07:28.593 --> 00:07:31.448
can completely describe the relationship.

00:07:31.448 --> 00:07:33.976
If R is negative one,

00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:36.430
it means a downwards sloping line

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.014
can completely describe the relationship.

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:40.846
R anywhere in between says well,

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:42.494
it won't be as good.

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:45.303
If R is zero that means
that a line isn't describing

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.050
the relationships well at all.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.081
Now in our situation here,

00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:51.557
not to use a pun,

00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:53.739
in our situation here,

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.072
our R is pretty close to one

00:07:57.272 --> 00:08:01.312
which means that a line
can get pretty close

00:08:01.312 --> 00:08:02.964
to describing the relationship

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:05.131
between our Xs and our Ys.

00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:09.975
So, for example, I'm just
going to try to hand draw

00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:10.892
a line here

00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:13.877
and it does turn out that
our least squares line

00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:15.878
will always go through the mean

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:17.517
of the X and the Y,

00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:19.245
so the mean of the X is two,

00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:20.443
mean of the Y is three,

00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:23.837
we'll study that in more
depth in future videos

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.222
but let's see, this
actually does look like

00:08:25.222 --> 00:08:27.183
a pretty good line.

00:08:27.183 --> 00:08:29.677
So, let me just draw it right over there.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:32.151
You see that I actually can draw a line

00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.049
that gets pretty close to describing it.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:34.965
It isn't perfect.

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:36.703
If it went through every point

00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:39.465
then I would have an R of one

00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:42.514
but it gets pretty close to describing

00:08:42.514 --> 00:08:44.313
what is going on.

00:08:44.313 --> 00:08:45.403
Now, the next thing I wanna do

00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:47.481
is focus on the intuition.

00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:49.930
What was actually going on
here with these Z scores

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.060
and how does taking products
of corresponding Z scores

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.616
get us this property
that I just talked about

00:08:56.616 --> 00:09:00.783
where an R of one will be
strong, positive correlation,

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:02.685
R of negative one

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:05.486
would be strong, negative correlation?

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:08.141
Well, let's draw the sample means here.

00:09:08.141 --> 00:09:10.784
So, the X sample mean is two,

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.956
this is our X axis here,

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:14.623
this is X equals two

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:18.291
and our Y sample mean is three.

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:22.984
This is the line Y is equal to three.

00:09:22.984 --> 00:09:26.569
Now, we can also draw
the standard deviations.

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:28.342
This is, let's see, the standard deviation

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:31.926
for X is 0.816 so I'll
be approximating it,

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:34.759
so if I go .816 less than our mean

00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:39.136
it'll get us at some place around there,

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:43.095
so that's one standard
deviation below the mean,

00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:44.801
one standard deviation above the mean

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:48.134
would put us some place right over here,

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.939
and if I do the same thing in Y,

00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:55.546
one standard deviation
above the mean, 2.160

00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:59.370
so that'll be 5.160 so it would put us

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.287
some place around there

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.874
and one standard deviation below the mean,

00:10:04.874 --> 00:10:07.799
so let's see we're gonna
go, if we took away two,

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:10.095
we would go to one

00:10:10.095 --> 00:10:12.516
and then we're gonna go take another .160,

00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:16.349
so it's gonna be some
place right around here.

00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:20.007
So, for example, for this first pair,

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:21.174
one comma one.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.303
What were we doing?

00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:26.288
Well, we said alright, how
many standard deviations

00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:28.937
is this below the mean?

00:10:28.937 --> 00:10:33.238
And that turned out to be
negative one over 0.816,

00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:34.858
that's what we have right over here,

00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:37.117
that's what this would have calculated,

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:38.941
and then how many standard deviations

00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:40.858
for in the Y direction,

00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:45.314
and that is our negative two over 2.160

00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:49.891
but notice, since both
of them were negative

00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.519
it contributed to the R,

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:55.046
this would become a positive value

00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:56.534
and so, one way to think about it,

00:10:56.534 --> 00:11:00.240
it might be helping us
get closer to the one.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.424
If both of them have a negative Z score

00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:05.869
that means that there's
a positive correlation

00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:07.006
between the variables.

00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:08.175
When one is below the mean,

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:09.324
the other is you could say,

00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:11.947
similarly below the mean.

00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:13.981
Now, if we go to the next data point,

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.731
two comma two right over
here, what happened?

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:22.599
Well, the X variable was right on the mean

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.971
and because of that that
entire term became zero.

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:27.888
The X Z score was zero.

00:11:28.928 --> 00:11:30.518
And so, that would have taken away

00:11:30.518 --> 00:11:32.875
a little bit from our
correlation coefficient.

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.900
The reason why it would take away

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.328
even though it's not negative,

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.543
you're not contributing to the sum

00:11:38.543 --> 00:11:42.245
but you're going to be dividing
by a slightly higher value

00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:44.340
by including that extra pair.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.312
If you had a data point where
let's say X was below the mean

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:49.028
and Y was above the mean,

00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:51.187
something like this,

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:53.321
if this was one of the points,

00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.833
this term would have been negative

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.852
because the Y Z score
would have been positive

00:11:56.852 --> 00:11:59.853
and the X Z score would have been negative

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:02.078
and so, when you put it in the sum

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:03.471
it would have actually taken away

00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:04.684
from the sum and so,

00:12:04.684 --> 00:12:07.333
it would have made the R score even lower.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:09.535
Similarly something like this

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:12.546
would have made the R score even lower

00:12:12.546 --> 00:12:15.334
because you would have
a positive Z score for X

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:17.185
and a negative Z score for Y

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:19.337
and so a product of a
positive and a negative

00:12:19.337 --> 00:12:21.004
would be a negative.
