00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.536
Today, we're going
to see what happens

00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:04.086
if we do all the things
that a can of aerosol string

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:05.000
says not to do.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
We're going to smash it,
cut it, stab it,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
and burn it.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.800
[Music]

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.440
Guys, you're almost certainly
familiar with aerosol string,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.300
also and more commonly
known as silly string,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.080
or in these cases,
Fiesta String and Goofy String.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.700
There's lots of
different brands of it,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.400
but the idea is
the same all around.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.900
And there's a liquid in a can,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.260
it's got an aerosol
pressurizing it,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.670
and then when you press
down on the top...

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.240
It sprays out a string.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.420
Cool stuff, huh?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.898
My cameraman loved that.

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:41.600
Best shot!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.583
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:43.636
We're going to destroy

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:45.600
cans of Silly String
in a variety of ways,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.070
and see what happens to 'em.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.083
What's the most fun?

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:49.400
What's the most dangerous?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.200
So what is inside one
of these little cans?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.400
Well, it's a combination
of a few different things.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.282
The main string
itself is made up

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:58.100
of a type of polyacrylic resin,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.300
which is just a fancy way of
saying, it's a type of plastic

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.872
that's liquid in the can,

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:05.200
and then become solid
as it dries out.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.493
We're just going to do a test.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:07.600
This is an orange one.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400
We're going to see
how much Silly String we get

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.600
if we just spray it
all in a pile right here.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.920
[Music]

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.200
The total contents of one.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.360
So this one is
Goofy String brand.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.700
This one actually came out
in less of strings,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.785
and is more of a blob,

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.454
and that's because I
was spraying it down so tightly

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:31.404
that the string
was piling up on itself,

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:33.680
and bunching up
before I had time to dry off.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.997
It dries off very quickly,

00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:37.203
but it does dry off better
if it has a couple

00:01:37.203 --> 00:01:38.540
of feet to travel.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.000
It really does just kind of
smell like a bunch of solvents.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.270
Since there are supposed

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600
to be isopropyl alcohol
and ammonia in there,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.320
not too surprising.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.519
It's wetter than you
might expect, I think too.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:50.600
Like there's a decent
amount of liquid,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.820
specially when you spray it
in a pile like this,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.280
and the liquid doesn't have
as much time to evaporate.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.400
Every version of aerosol string
that I've ever used

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.408
has pretty much the same
warnings on the back,

00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.843
saying that it's under pressure,

00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:02.978
and it could explode
if it's exposed to heat,

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:04.278
or even too much sunlight,

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:05.850
and you shouldn't
puncture the can,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.900
or any of those things.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.750
So we want to try all
of those things.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.000
I want to see what happens

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.800
if we just spray this
through a fire.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400
The string is supposed
to be pushed out by a repellent

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.560
that then evaporates
very very quickly.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.100
And so, if I were to try
and light these things on fire,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.500
I don't think much will happen.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
However, if you're spraying
directly through fire,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.814
that's where it's supposed
to get exciting,

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.000
and we're going to try it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.220
[Music]

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.300
That's not very exciting.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.949
Let's try just one
of these strings

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.400
that got a little bit more
of a chance to dry out.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.397
It's burning a little better.

00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:43.000
But as soon as I
take the heat away,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.440
it just goes out.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.420
So that didn't do a whole lot.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.320
Let's see what happens

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.386
if we just shoot it
right through a fire.

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:51.700
Seems like a good safe
indoor activity, right?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.340
[Music]

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.900
I think I see why they put
the warnings on it.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.100
That's kind of funny
because it has the fire,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.379
and then the fire goes out

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.365
by the time it hits
the wall over there.

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.200
So I'm not lighting
anything on fire.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.900
I just have this two foot string

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.500
of fire in the middle
of the air.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.400
Let's do this again.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.200
This is fun.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.180
[Music]

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.100
So we can see there is a reason
they put flammability warnings

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.666
on the cans.

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:23.432
It is flammable,

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:25.182
right as it's coming
out of the can,

00:03:25.182 --> 00:03:26.700
and it does carry
that a little ways.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.340
You don't want to spray
this on a person

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.451
when there's any kind of flame
or heat source around

00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:31.941
because you could
catch them on fire,

00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:34.300
and that is almost certainly
not what you should be doing.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.920
So what's gonna happen

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:39.100
if we actually crack one
of these cans open?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.500
That's something I
want to learn.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.600
So, what's going to be
the best way to do this?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.900
We've got so many options.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.941
We could use a saw,

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:47.233
we could use a drill,
we could use a hammer,

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:48.300
we could use an axe.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.900
Maybe you should try
all of those.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.700
All right.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.640
Anyone have any bets on what
they think is going to happen

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.750
when I drill a hole in?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.340
I'm guessing a lot of
propellants going to shoot out.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000
Possibly, the string liquid

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.440
turning into string
will also shoot out.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.800
I've got it clamped
down pretty good,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.100
so I'm not really worried
about it going anywhere,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.300
but we'll see.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:20.300
[Music]

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.700
Okay, here we've got a blob
of the string material.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.900
I don't think this is as

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.000
much as a whole blob
when I spread it out.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.100
So that means, hopefully,
there's still some in there,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.400
and now, we're going to cut it
open with a hacksaw, and see

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.200
if we can find it.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.800
Oh, yeah.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.700
There we go.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.700
Okay, here's some
of our Silly String material,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.200
and this will already
have started to change form.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200
There's no longer propellant in
there holding it pressurized,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200
a lot of the solvents
of started to change.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.619
Looks like there's a nozzle.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.800
So normally, this hose
runs all the way down

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.800
to the bottom to help let all
of our string fluid pour out.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.300
I think now it's time to start

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.000
breaking open these cans
a little more aggressively.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.800
So, first up,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.080
we're gonna try and chop it
in half with an axe.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.280
Here it goes.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.120
[Music]

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.600
That was awesome.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.300
So I didn't hit the can
perfectly on the top,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.100
kind of nicked it just
on the edge there, I think.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.800
Let's check out the slo-mo
to see what it actually did.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.900
Just going very slowly,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.202
because that it's
at a thousand times--

00:05:21.202 --> 00:05:21.486
No, oh!

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:22.500
Coming down, coming down.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.100
And...

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.840
Yeah, okay.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.200
All right, for dispersal,
that was probably about perfect.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.500
I want to try it again though,
and see if I can actually chop

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.980
a can right in the middle,
and see what that does.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.140
[Music]

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.400
Overshot the can again.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.260
All right.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.300
3, 2, 1.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.580
Well...

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.560
[Music]

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.400
That was great.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.300
It was very quick.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.180
Even at a thousand
frames per second,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.500
it's just a quick pop,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.800
and then flies everywhere,
and it's gone.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.950
It's just gone,
but that looked really cool.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.723
Now, we're going to try using
this 12 pound Sledgehammer

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:12.073
to just smash right down
through the top of one.

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:12.906
This is heavy enough

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:15.184
that I'm not sure how much
I really need to swing it.

00:06:15.184 --> 00:06:16.980
I mostly just trying
to keep it on course.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.120
3, 2, 1.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.480
I mostly missed.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.200
I've bent the can
on that hit a little bit,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.400
but it wasn't a straight
enough hit to really

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.595
smash the can very much.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.295
So, we're just
gonna put this back,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.400
and try and hit it again.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.460
[Music]

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.900
I gotta keep smashing it.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.440
[Music]

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.400
Well, I'm gonna say
the axe was way cooler.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.200
It actually tears the can open,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.396
and I'm sure it's possible
to do something like that

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:54.000
with a hammer,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.300
but I am not a very good shot
with this giant sledgehammer.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.080
All right, new experiment.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.900
We are going to see what happens
if we freeze one of these.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.078
We've got some liquid nitrogen.

00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:04.249
We're going to put the can

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:06.800
in liquid nitrogen,
and let it cool down, hopefully,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.879
until the bubbles stopped.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.175
That should mean everything
is frozen all the way through.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.460
We'll then take it out,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.800
and we'll try drilling a hole in
it the same way we did before.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.000
We'll see if the pressure

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.100
has changed from cooling
it down that much.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.872
It's also possible
that it'll get so cold

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.540
that it will just
collapse in on itself.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.840
For the most part,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.140
we can let that sit
for a few minutes.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.294
While we're doing that,

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:26.500
I actually have another can
that's been sitting

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.700
in a regular freezer
for about two hours now,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.350
and we can see

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.800
if that's made any progress
toward freezing solid,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.100
or at least having
less pressure inside.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:42.260
[Music]

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.600
A little bit of propellant
seems to have sprayed out.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.000
Let's see if we can hack saw
this right open.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.500
Well, look at that.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.300
Here we go.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.980
We have frozen slush--

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.200
You know what, let's try
and pour all this out.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.800
I suspect that some of this is
actually are frozen propellant,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.420
and some of it is just our goo.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.851
It just sort of let this sit out

00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:11.020
as it warms up, and see
what happens to it.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.200
I think we're just about there.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.900
At this point,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.100
most of the bubbling is
from the tongs themselves,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.200
which means this is
probably very very cold.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.760
[Music]

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.000
No propellant escaping at all.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.100
The other frozen
can had little bit,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.240
but not much.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.400
This one seems to have none.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:51.520
[Music]

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.540
Wow!

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.200
That is solid.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.900
We've seen a lot
of good destruction

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.200
with these silly string cans.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.300
We've seen the fire
that comes out of them.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.008
We puncture them,

00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:05.381
cut them open,
chopped them in half,

00:09:05.381 --> 00:09:06.387
smash them with a hammer,

00:09:06.387 --> 00:09:08.400
there's couple more things
I do want to try though.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.400
What happens if we
throw it into fire?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.200
That's one of the things
we're going to do, and then,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.400
how can we phrase this
in a YouTube friendly way?

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.800
We want to use a projectile
launching machine to launch

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.400
a projectile through as many
of these cans as we can.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.800
So then we're going
to line up several of them,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800
and then very quickly
launched a small lead copper

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.800
coated projectile through as
many of the cans as possible.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.000
Let's head up to the Dome.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.300
Guys, we are now
here at the Dome,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.450
and we're going to see
what happens if we do

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.100
what this is really
telling us not to do,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.600
and that's expose it to heat.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.600
Not just any heat,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.400
we're going to put it
in front of a blowtorch,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.500
and see what that does.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.200
I'm thinking it's
just going to explode,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.100
and I hope it does.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
So, here it goes.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:10:04.080
[Music]

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.977
Oh, that was great!

00:10:04.977 --> 00:10:06.670
That popped so nicely.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.960
Oh, that was amazing.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.300
Just POP!

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.700
Kind of went everywhere,
about as expected,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.507
about as hoped.

00:10:12.507 --> 00:10:13.100
In the end,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.685
it didn't really
seem that dangerous.

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:16.949
Not that I'm saying this is
a good safe idea to do,

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.100
because you should not.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.200
But just popped.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.800
Here's where our can ended up.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.976
Literally all the way
across the Dome.

00:10:22.976 --> 00:10:23.800
You know what,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.100
I think that didn't tear
through the side.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.660
That actually burst
the bottom off of the can.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.600
Pressure built up so much

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.022
that it just tore
the bottom off,

00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:31.845
and that explains

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:34.200
how we ended up getting
a splat mark underneath it.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.500
Completely empty inside,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.300
the nozzles gone
from the top.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.800
Let's watch this on slo-mo.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.640
Burned the label
off a little bit.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.100
Oh!

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.818
And come on.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.200
Off like a rocket.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.700
All right, we got
more thing we want to try,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.199
and that's what we
were talking about before,

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.800
lining up a bunch of these cans,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.602
and seeing if we

00:10:52.602 --> 00:10:54.952
can launch a projectile
through several of them,

00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:55.900
and what they'll do.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.700
All right.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.400
Well, we've got
our projectile launcher,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.000
and a few projectiles,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we're gonna see
if we can launch projectiles

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.590
through several cans
of our aerosol spray.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.600
Here it goes.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.440
3, 2.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.600
Yeah.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.400
[Music]

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.420
Whoo!

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.780
I love how some
of the ones up front,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.320
they didn't go anywhere.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.740
They didn't move.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.300
Shot clean through them.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.800
All right, safety is on.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.630
Yes.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.040
Oh, that is beautiful.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040
Look at this.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.100
Through one side, out the other.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.020
And the can didn't go anywhere.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.650
Projectile is moving so fast.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.470
Look at this.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.148
The green was so
powerfully shot out,

00:11:43.148 --> 00:11:47.720
it went through the blue can,
and came out this side.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.300
It's mixed in with the pink.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.380
That is fun stuff.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.100
So, until we got to here,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.900
so you can kind of see
that we're now going

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.840
a little off center.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.371
We were doing pretty well
getting to the pink one.

00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.038
We have much larger holes
going through here.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.020
There's--

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.240
Oh, we took out the hose.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.100
Going through, it's
a little off-center here.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.390
It's a lot more off-center.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.843
But that time you get
to the green, now,

00:12:09.843 --> 00:12:10.473
at this point,

00:12:10.473 --> 00:12:12.782
our projectile is probably
deformed a little bit,

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:13.600
get to the green,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.000
it's tearing open
these giant holes in the sides.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.200
Yellow, it seems to have
re-centered a little bit.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.171
The cans were not
perfectly lined up.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.800
So it's not going to be
100% the same every time.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.360
That one's just torn right open,
all the way across.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.780
But that went
through all of them.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.167
That is excellent.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.525
So... 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.064
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14,

00:12:35.064 --> 00:12:37.800
15 cans of aerosol string.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.900
I could not have hoped
for a better result.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.300
That was so perfect.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.100
So cool.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.940
[Music]

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.900
Guys, that's not all.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.271
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:50.300
That box up at the top
is going to take you directly

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.989
to our last video.

00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:52.100
You should go check that out.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.199
The other box
is going to show you

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:54.795
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.165
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:56.827
you'll be subscribe

00:12:56.827 --> 00:12:58.500
to the channel, so you
never miss out on a video.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.545
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.726
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:01.700
Talk to you then.
