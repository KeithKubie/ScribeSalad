00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.410
In this lesson, we're going to learn

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.820
about how a gene's expression, is regulated.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.610
&gt;&gt; So let me get this straight, the main difference between a brain

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.690
cell, and say, a stomach cell, is just the expression of a gene?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; Exactly. This gene expression pattern is analgous to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.420
our recipe again. We're going to be looking at how

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.690
a cell decides to add a cup of sugar,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.660
versus a tablespoon of sugar, versus No sugar at all.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.680
&gt;&gt; Well, let's go back to our lactose metabolism

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.920
example, which the main ingredient is the lactase gene.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.510
&gt;&gt; If we search all across the human genome for

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.870
the lactase gene, we'll find it here on chromosome two.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.670
Now, let's zoom in on chromosome two just a little

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670
bit, and we can see what we'd imagine it would look

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.360
like. Remember, I'm showing the non-duplicated chromosomes here because this

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810
is what they mainly exist as. In the karyotype here,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.890
we're looking at the duplicated chromosomes, which is why they

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.180
look like Xs, but here. They don't. You have two chromosome

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.880
2's, one from mom, one from dad. Chromosome

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.410
2 is the next largest chromosome in the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.180
whole genome, at approximately 243 million base pairs

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.360
long. The lactase gene is located approximately half-way along

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.940
Chromosome 2. Remember you've got Two copies, one

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.800
of mom's chromosome and one of dad's chromosome. If

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.180
we were to zoom into this region of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.240
chromosome two to look further at the lactase gene,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.440
we'd see that it's actually composed of about

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.260
17 exons spanning more than 50,000 base pairs

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.990
of DNA. After transcription and splicing, removing all

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.480
the introns that can be found in this gene

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.460
We're left with about 6,200 nucleotide of an

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.030
MRNA copy of the lactase gene. Now if

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.540
we take a look at that lactase MRNA,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.560
we'll see that between the start and the stop

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.620
codon, including the start and stop codon,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.920
we have 5,784 nucleotides of information. Now based

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.430
on what you've learned so far, I want you to tell me how many amino

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.680
acids would be translated by a ribosome

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.580
using this mRNA sequence here. We have 5784

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.900
nucleotides, including the start and stop codons and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.710
everything in between. If you need help answering

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.880
this question it's probably cause you need to go back and review

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.510
some material in lesson three. If you think the genetic code will help

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.110
you answer this question, you can find it in the instructor's notes

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.240
below. Go ahead and put your best number answer into this text box.
