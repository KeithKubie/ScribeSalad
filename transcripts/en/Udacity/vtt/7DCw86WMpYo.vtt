00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.790
You can add a new empty table to your
database with the create table command.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.960
When you create a table, you'll give
the name of the table, and the names and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.930
the types of each column.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.710
You can also set constraints on each
column, and on the row as a whole.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.370
We'll talk about constraints shortly,
but for now let's focus on types.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.270
Here's the simplest form of the create
table command that doesn't have any

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.380
constraints, only columns with their
types and gives the table a name.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.990
Now we've dealt with text and
integer types previously.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.870
And back in lesson two,
I gave you a big long list of lots and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.440
lots of types that SQL supports.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.750
The exact set of types that you can use
will vary from system to system though.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.930
If you're working with a database system
that doesn't natively support the type

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.128
you need,
there's usually a way to work around it.

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:51.430
For instance, PostgreSQL has
a specific type for IP addresses, but

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.400
MySQL does not.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.670
MySQL programmers usually use an integer
or a text string to store IP addresses.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.525
Of the databases we've used in this
course PostgreSQL has a proper type for

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:03.885
dates and times.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.925
But SQLite actually just
stores dates as strings.
