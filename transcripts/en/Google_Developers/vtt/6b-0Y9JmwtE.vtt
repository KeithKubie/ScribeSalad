ALEX MAIER: Hello, and
welcome to the next episode

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.400
of Women Techmakers.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.580
My name is Alex Maier, and
today with me in the studio,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.240
I have Lynn Langit, who's a
friend and a GDE, a Google

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.540
Developer Expert.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.900
So Lynn, tell me a
little bit about what

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.090
it means to you to be a GDE.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.550
LYNN LANGIT: I'm a big
data and cloud architect.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.340
So it really helps me to be
able to provide my customers

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.720
with timely access to
information about the Google

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.930
Cloud.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.080
I work with customers to develop
usually proofs of concept,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.940
because for a lot
of my customers,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.190
the Google Cloud is a
new platform for them.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.710
So we'll work side by
side and we'll usually

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.030
come up with a POC, so
that they can understand

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.102
the capabilities of Your Cloud.

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:49.310
ALEX MAIER: And how does it
usually go from there on?

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.230
LYNN LANGIT: Well, it depends.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.040
You're not the only
cloud game in town.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.680
So sometimes the
customers will find

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.450
that Your Cloud is the
best pick for them,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.910
and sometimes somebody
else's will be.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.230
ALEX MAIER: How has the
Google Cloud platform been

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.940
in your experience
for your business?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.580
LYNN LANGIT: Well, the services
that my customers most often

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.170
used are App Engine.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.590
And I work with the enterprise.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.230
So I've got Java
customers most generally,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.670
although I have had one Python
implementation that we're

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.110
going to talk a little bit
more about later in the show.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.693
And then I've done
quite a lot of work

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:22.380
with BigQuery, because I
work in the big data area.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070
And I'm particularly
impressed with the breadth

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.790
of service offering
around BigQuery,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.080
ALEX MAIER: Great.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.000
So you also are an educator.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.505
So what kind of courses or
other offerings do you develop?

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:37.880
LYNN LANGIT: Well, I've done
actually a number of things.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.710
I wrote some courses for a
company called pluralsite.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.870
And they're in-depth,
developer, video-based trainings

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.470
with code samples.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.910
And I did those a couple
years ago on Google App

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.290
engine with Java to
get developers started.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.550
And then I also did a series
on Google Compute Engine right

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.410
when it came out
of a trusted tester

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.250
and into general release.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.420
And then I did a
series on BigQuery.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.722
And what I've done recently--
I updated this in January,

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:09.430
because that series
was a couple of years

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.890
old-- is I made the
Google App Engine course

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890
updated because App Engine
had some new features

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.130
and new capabilities.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.060
And I put it out on
YouTube this time

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.490
for even broader audience reach.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.910
ALEX MAIER: So if our
listeners and viewers wanted

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.182
to watch these videos,
where would they find them?

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:27.890
LYNN LANGIT: I have
a channel on YouTube.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.900
It's under SoCalDevGal,
because I'm

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.630
based in Southern California.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.360
And I have over 150 different
videos on cloud and big data

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.197
technologies.

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:40.280
ALEX MAIER: That is great.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.350
Wow.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.560
That is quite a bit.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.969
I bet it took you a
lot of time to make.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.510
LYNN LANGIT: Well,
some of the videos

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.460
are really short because one
of the things that I have found

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.390
is useful for people
is as I'm staying

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.100
relevant on these
new technologies,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.810
I will actually just turn
on a screen capturing--

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.100
you know, Camtasia-- and
I'll just show people

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.360
what I'm studying and edit
out the bloopers and stuff.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.510
But they like to see
what I'm looking at,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.762
and it sometimes
saves them time.

00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:09.860
ALEX MAIER: Yeah.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.110
I bet that that's a
great thing to do.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.510
So you mentioned that you
worked on the Python project.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.200
And we have another
guest with us today--

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.690
Eric Grimm, software developer.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.606
Hi, Eric.

00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:22.945
ERIC GRIMM: Hi, how are you?

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:23.820
ALEX MAIER: I'm well.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.015
How are you?

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:25.890
ERIC GRIMM: I'm good.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.550
It's a little cold today,
but otherwise, it's nice.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.030
ALEX MAIER: Yes, Eric is joining
us today from Long Island.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.222
So nice to have you
on the show, Eric.

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:37.037
ERIC GRIMM: Thanks, I'm glad to.

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.870
ALEX MAIER: So Lynn and
Eric worked together

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.860
on a project which was
quite unusual in a few ways.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.090
So can you tell us a little
bit more about it, Lynn.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.840
LYNN LANGIT: Sure.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.214
Well, I'll talk
first about how I

00:03:47.214 --> 00:03:49.560
got brought in to the
project, and maybe Eric

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.101
will have some
insights that he wants

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.380
to share with the audience.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.910
So Eric works for a PR company,
and as part of a project,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.720
he was asked to create a
registration site on Google App

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.220
Engine.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.700
And his background
is in ColdFusion.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.650
And so the company reached out
to me as a developer expert

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.730
to help him as a new
developer on App Engine

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.610
to understand that platform.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.358
So what we did, because I live
in greater Southern California,

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.399
is we did remote pairing.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.274
In fact, this is the
first time I've actually

00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:25.970
seen Eric's face, because we did
voice and we did screen shares.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.840
And I helped him out,
understanding the APIs.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.280
And it was kind of interesting,
because for both of us,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.180
it was our first
time using Python.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.830
And I actually, from my
perspective-- and Eric,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.430
you certainly get
to weigh in here--

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.300
I thought the Python samples
were pretty usable and pretty

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.590
well written and
got us up and going.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.990
So to that end, I
think it would probably

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.480
be interesting for the
audience to hear for you,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.690
as a new Google App
Engine developer, what

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.980
your experience was
like-- honestly--

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.460
in getting an App
Engine set up and going.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.610
And before you talk
about that, you

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.260
should also say
what the site's for,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.020
because it's kind of a cool
thing that the site's for.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.910
ERIC GRIMM: Sure.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.290
Well, as Lynn mentioned, I
work for a promotions marketing

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.790
agency.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.630
We basically deal with
sweepstakes and contests

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.950
and moderation tools,
things of that nature.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.450
But we do a lot of registration
forms along the way.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.750
We've done work with Google
and YouTube in the past.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.410
And we were brought in
to work on this project.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.160
It's called Call to Code.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.850
It's a website for
students in Ireland.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.670
The teachers will
register the students,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.220
and. the students will take
part in an online coding

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.750
competition.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.220
And the winners will move on
to an on-site competition,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.760
again in Ireland.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.020
Hopefully next year,
they'll roll it out a little

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.570
to a little wider audience.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.880
But as she said, I do come
from a ColdFusion background.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.525
We initially intended
to write the site

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:05.040
in cold fusion using
our SQL server database.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.540
Google Security wanted us to
write it in Google App Engine.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.040
So I chose Python as my language
of choice for the project.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.300
It seemed to have a
lower barrier to entry

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.210
than trying to jump into Java
or something a little more

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.380
technically-oriented.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.470
The samples on the
Google site were great.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.590
They helped me get
up and running, up

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.810
to speed very quickly.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.160
And Lynn was instrumental
along the way

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.720
in pointing me in the
right direction on quite

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.582
a few of the stumbling
blocks that came up.

00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:42.040
LYNN LANGIT: So I
think it might be

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.640
interesting for the audience,
because I think a lot of people

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.350
are probably having a similar
background with traditional web

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.536
apps and relational
databases, to talk about some

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.597
of the things that
we talked about.

00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:55.430
In particular, I think
we talked quite a lot

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.330
about the high
replication data store,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.370
because that was
really a different data

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.780
model than the relational store.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.390
And I think the
audience might benefit

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.450
from hearing what was the
most useful in getting you

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.610
up and going on the high
replication data store.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.900
And any stumbling blocks
or anything, anything you

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.830
learned-- you know, that kind of
stuff would be useful for them.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.580
ERIC GRIMM: Right.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.305
Well, the high
replication data store

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.550
is definitely a
different paradigm

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.160
than a relational
database that I'm used to.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.630
Some things that were very
easy to get along with

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.340
are the ability to
just add properties

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.070
to a particular entity
within the data store.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.090
You can add as many
properties as you want,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.692
but then you can end up
with some entities that

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:43.150
are missing
properties, which makes

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.720
it a little more difficult
to find if you're searching

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.110
on a particular field
piece of data, for example.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.340
The fact that it's
high replication

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.890
means that sometimes it might
take a little while for objects

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:07.450
to be consistent across the
vast network of Google servers.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.700
So we did run into a couple
issues where, for example,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.746
a teacher would register
one of their students,

00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:15.620
and the student wouldn't
show up immediately,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.720
just because it
hadn't been replicated

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.600
all the way across
the data store.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.030
But with a little
user education,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.930
that wasn't an issue
that really brought

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.740
itself to bear in
the live application.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.130
ALEX MAIER: So where are you
right now in this project?

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.675
Has it launched?

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:37.799
You're in beta, aren't you?

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.620
Or are you launched?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.380
ERIC GRIMM: We ran
through a beta phase

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.760
where we had a few
select teachers

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.250
and a few select students
that use the site,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.410
ran through some
practice contests,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.670
and gave us some generally
positive feedback.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.370
We are in the process of
gearing up for a wider launch.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.530
There is an actual
coding competition

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.960
coming up on April 3 in Ireland.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.740
We've had something along the
lines of 250 teachers that

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.910
are registered for the contest
that in turn registered

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.850
close to 800 students that will
be taking part in the contest

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.425
once it rolls out live.

00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:21.800
ALEX MAIER: So
when do you expect

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.420
to have it rolled
out and all these 800

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.319
students to begin coding?

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:28.985
ERIC GRIMM: Again,
it's a timed contest.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.790
There is a 24-hour
period for them to enter.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.420
So on April 3 is when it
launches for the 24-hour period

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.234
that they will be able to
enter the competition itself.

00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:40.150
ALEX MAIER: All right.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.650
Well, good luck
with that, and I'm

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.720
keeping our fingers
crossed for you.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.750
ERIC GRIMM: Oh,
thank you, thank you.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.950
ALEX MAIER: So, Lynn, can
you share a little bit

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.530
about the experience, coding,
pairing up with somebody

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.360
all the way across
the continent.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.170
LYNN LANGIT: Well, just
generally, I pair-program.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.370
And I'll do in person when I
can, but I also remote pair.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.000
I think for Eric, it was
new, the pair-program.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
ERIC GRIMM: Yes, it was.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.190
LYNN LANGIT: Yeah, and
maybe a little skeptical

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.810
in the beginning, maybe?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.630
Maybe?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.210
What once we got, for
example, a couple modules up

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:22.284
and going, it was a little
bit more fun to do, I guess.

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:23.950
But, yeah, I thought
it was pretty cool.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.070
I was a little bit apprehensive
to dig into the Python,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.270
because my expertise is
Java, and this is literally

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.270
the first time I did
anything in Python.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.760
But again, kudos to you
guys and good samples.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.330
Seriously, god samples matter.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.780
They really, really matter.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.650
And I guess that's
my ask back out

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.880
to the Google people
who are watching this.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.640
Anything that you're
making for any platform,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.430
but my world is the cloud,
make sure your samples

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.310
are rock solid.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.040
Because it really
matters, I mean,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.130
it allowed you to hit your
deadline, Eric, I think.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.382
ERIC GRIMM: Absolutely.

00:10:55.382 --> 00:10:57.167
ALEX MAIER: Well, great.

00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:59.500
So Lynn, there's another
project that you're working on.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.744
It's a nonprofit?

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:01.660
LYNN LANGIT: There is.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.770
Yeah, I'm the co-founder of a
nonprofit called Teaching Kids

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.800
Programming.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.780
And really there's
two aspects that I

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.620
wanted to share with
the audience here.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.490
First of all, we actually
use Google App Engine

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.540
as part of the solution.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.940
What it is it's a set of
free and open source course

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.710
where it introduced children
ages 10 and up to programming

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.540
in Java.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.470
Which some people
might say, Java?

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.320
Well, that's not
a modern language.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.540
But that is the language,
if there is one.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.850
that's offered at high schools
for Advanced Placement.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.882
So we had a lot of
requests for on-ramping.

00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:32.590
So that's why we
created the course wear.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.412
It's up on Github.

00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:35.870
The connection to
Google App Engine

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.650
is that it kind of looks
like Logo, the basic recipes.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.920
So it's got the turtle
drawing the squares and stuff.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.120
And so when the kids
execute the program,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.760
it sends the blog up
to Google App Engine.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.870
And this is actually the reason
I got into the Google Cloud way

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.930
back, when because it was
easy to use, and you guys

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.930
have had a generous free tier.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.940
And we still use it today.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.770
And it's a great way to get
started on the Google Cloud

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.105
if you've a nonprofit project.

00:12:06.105 --> 00:12:07.809
So I wanted to share that.

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:09.600
ALEX MAIER: Great,
thank you so much, Lynn.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.910
LYNN LANGIT: Thank you.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.870
This was another episode
of Women Techmakers.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.800
my name is Alex Maier.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.650
Good bye.
