you've ever been
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110
you've ever been
and you decide you're going to take a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
and you decide you're going to take a
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880
and you decide you're going to take a
picture now this is going to be the best

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890

carefully take your phone out of your
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.779
carefully take your phone out of your
pocket push the power button and your

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
pocket push the power button and your
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.070
pocket push the power button and your
phone is out of batteries

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
phone is out of batteries
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.130

so not only do you miss the shot but

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
so not only do you miss the shot but
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170
so not only do you miss the shot but
then you realize you're not exactly sure

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
then you realize you're not exactly sure
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420
then you realize you're not exactly sure
where you are and you're really counting

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
where you are and you're really counting
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.740
where you are and you're really counting
on your phone to help you navigate back

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
on your phone to help you navigate back
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230
on your phone to help you navigate back
and all of a sudden the woods look like

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
and all of a sudden the woods look like
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.770
and all of a sudden the woods look like
a much scarier place so I think the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
a much scarier place so I think the
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289
a much scarier place so I think the
point here is that battery life is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
point here is that battery life is
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.410
point here is that battery life is
extremely important to users in fact one

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
extremely important to users in fact one
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300
extremely important to users in fact one
in three users say the battery life is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
in three users say the battery life is

the number one problem on their device
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.499
the number one problem on their device
the number one problem this is also

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
the number one problem this is also
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690
the number one problem this is also
apparent in statistics we track about

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
apparent in statistics we track about
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.499
apparent in statistics we track about
location so a large percentage of users

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
location so a large percentage of users
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.120
location so a large percentage of users
have decided to completely disable

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
have decided to completely disable
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.340
have decided to completely disable
location on their device and when we ask

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
location on their device and when we ask
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.380
location on their device and when we ask
them why it's at power with the main

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
them why it's at power with the main
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.899
them why it's at power with the main
reason now this is a problem for every

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
reason now this is a problem for every
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.450
reason now this is a problem for every
developer in this room who uses location

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
developer in this room who uses location
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.130
developer in this room who uses location
since when location is disabled just a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
since when location is disabled just a
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.889
since when location is disabled just a
lot of stuff breaks from navigation to

lot of stuff breaks from navigation to
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.510

weather just doesn't work whenever

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
weather just doesn't work whenever
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.639
weather just doesn't work whenever
location is disabled but I think more

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
location is disabled but I think more
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139
location is disabled but I think more
importantly your users turning off

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
importantly your users turning off
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120
importantly your users turning off
location means that they're not happy

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
location means that they're not happy
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.069
location means that they're not happy
with the experience they're getting and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
with the experience they're getting and
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.990
with the experience they're getting and
we don't want that we want users to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
we don't want that we want users to
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.809
we don't want that we want users to
absolutely love location so we've taken

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
absolutely love location so we've taken
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.760
absolutely love location so we've taken
a really close look at power consumption

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
a really close look at power consumption
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.010
a really close look at power consumption
and here's what we found

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
and here's what we found
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.330
and here's what we found
well for one thing location is used a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
well for one thing location is used a
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640
well for one thing location is used a
lot the location API is currently allow

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
lot the location API is currently allow
 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.710
lot the location API is currently allow
applications to request location at

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
applications to request location at
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.950
applications to request location at
virtually any time so every bar you see

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960
virtually any time so every bar you see

here is the device doing some kind of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
here is the device doing some kind of
 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.960
here is the device doing some kind of
location related work now we can analyze

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
location related work now we can analyze
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.850
location related work now we can analyze
the cost of these using something called

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
the cost of these using something called
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.040
the cost of these using something called
Android power primitives that's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
Android power primitives that's
 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.090
Android power primitives that's
something I'm really excited to be

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100
something I'm really excited to be
 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.560
something I'm really excited to be
speaking with you today about that's the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570
speaking with you today about that's the
 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.580
speaking with you today about that's the
first time we've talked about these

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590
first time we've talked about these
 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.440
first time we've talked about these
externally so you can think of power

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
externally so you can think of power
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090
externally so you can think of power
primitives as a way to understand the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100
primitives as a way to understand the
 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.600
primitives as a way to understand the
fundamental building blocks of power on

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
fundamental building blocks of power on
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.130
fundamental building blocks of power on
an Android device and we can use these

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140
an Android device and we can use these
 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.450
an Android device and we can use these
to really understand sort of how

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460
to really understand sort of how
 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.480
to really understand sort of how
location power is computed here are the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
location power is computed here are the
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.670
location power is computed here are the
four basic operations that consume power

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680
four basic operations that consume power
 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.910
four basic operations that consume power
when using location we first have to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
when using location we first have to
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.980
when using location we first have to
wake up the device to perform some work

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990
wake up the device to perform some work
 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.870
wake up the device to perform some work
we didn't have to get some location

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880
we didn't have to get some location
 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.140
we didn't have to get some location
signals like Wi-Fi and GPS then we have

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150
signals like Wi-Fi and GPS then we have
 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.700
signals like Wi-Fi and GPS then we have
to run some computation on the CPU and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710
to run some computation on the CPU and
 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.160
to run some computation on the CPU and
then finally maybe go to the network to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
then finally maybe go to the network to
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.710
then finally maybe go to the network to
get some more model model information

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720
get some more model model information
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.120
get some more model model information
and we can understand the cost of all of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130
and we can understand the cost of all of
 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.160
and we can understand the cost of all of
these by using the power primitives so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170
these by using the power primitives so
 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.050
these by using the power primitives so
this is the cost of every single one of

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
this is the cost of every single one of
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180
this is the cost of every single one of
these operations there's a lot going on

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
these operations there's a lot going on
 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.590
these operations there's a lot going on
here so let me highlight the most

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600
here so let me highlight the most
 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.229
here so let me highlight the most
important ones

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
important ones
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.610
important ones
well first using the cell network is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
well first using the cell network is
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.130
well first using the cell network is
extremely expensive this is why the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140
extremely expensive this is why the
 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.300
extremely expensive this is why the
location stack has been heavily

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310
location stack has been heavily
 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.790
location stack has been heavily
optimized to cache data locally whenever

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800
optimized to cache data locally whenever
 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.000
optimized to cache data locally whenever
possible and try to avoid going to the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010
possible and try to avoid going to the
 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.380
possible and try to avoid going to the
network by computing things locally um

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390
network by computing things locally um
 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.080
network by computing things locally um
also obtaining location signals is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090
also obtaining location signals is
 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.300
also obtaining location signals is
expensive for example the first fix for

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310
expensive for example the first fix for
 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300
expensive for example the first fix for
GPS can cost quite a bit this is why we

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
GPS can cost quite a bit this is why we
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.040
GPS can cost quite a bit this is why we
usually tend to prefer doing Wi-Fi scans

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050
usually tend to prefer doing Wi-Fi scans
 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.320
usually tend to prefer doing Wi-Fi scans
instead but unfortunately Wi-Fi scans

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330
instead but unfortunately Wi-Fi scans
 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.990
instead but unfortunately Wi-Fi scans
are not really cheap either

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
are not really cheap either
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.340
are not really cheap either
so what we've been doing is trying to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350
so what we've been doing is trying to
 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.080
so what we've been doing is trying to
reduce the cost of these as much as

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090
reduce the cost of these as much as
 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.750
reduce the cost of these as much as
possible by limiting which channels we

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760
possible by limiting which channels we
 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880
possible by limiting which channels we
look at when doing a Wi-Fi scan as well

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890
look at when doing a Wi-Fi scan as well
 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.930
look at when doing a Wi-Fi scan as well
as spending the least amount of time

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940
as spending the least amount of time
 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.449
as spending the least amount of time
possible on each Channel but we are

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459
possible on each Channel but we are
 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.610
possible on each Channel but we are
coming up to some physical limits so how

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620
coming up to some physical limits so how
 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.360
coming up to some physical limits so how
much we can optimize here so in summary

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370
much we can optimize here so in summary
 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.310
much we can optimize here so in summary
we see that power is extremely important

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320
we see that power is extremely important
 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.380
we see that power is extremely important
to users

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390
to users
 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.610
to users
unfortunately location is not cheap and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
unfortunately location is not cheap and
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.440
unfortunately location is not cheap and
we're coming up to some pretty hard

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450
we're coming up to some pretty hard
 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.909
we're coming up to some pretty hard
physical constraints as to where we can

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919
physical constraints as to where we can
 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.099
physical constraints as to where we can
optimize and as well there are some

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109
optimize and as well there are some
 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.690
optimize and as well there are some
amazing features being built using

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700
amazing features being built using
 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.060

so with all of this in mind we're

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470
so with all of this in mind we're
 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.080
so with all of this in mind we're
introducing a significant change to how

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090
introducing a significant change to how
 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.790
introducing a significant change to how

let's take a look at an example of how

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260
let's take a look at an example of how
 

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.680
let's take a look at an example of how
to enable location Beijing at zero you

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:45.690
to enable location Beijing at zero you
 

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.800
to enable location Beijing at zero you
will need to create a location request

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:47.810
will need to create a location request
 

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.660
will need to create a location request
you set the interval to ten minutes the

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:50.670
you set the interval to ten minutes the
 

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.690
you set the interval to ten minutes the
key here is to set the next word time to

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700
key here is to set the next word time to
 

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.760
key here is to set the next word time to
a few times more than the request

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:55.770
a few times more than the request
 

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.890
a few times more than the request
interval so this allows location

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:57.900
interval so this allows location
 

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.860
interval so this allows location

in a car now a simple way to do this

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.430
in a car now a simple way to do this
 

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.920
in a car now a simple way to do this
would be to write an if statement that

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:20.930
would be to write an if statement that
 

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.010
would be to write an if statement that
says if the activity is in vehicle start

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.020

pitfalls that you'll encounter do if you
 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.070
pitfalls that you'll encounter do if you
do this okay so the user starts in a

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080
do this okay so the user starts in a
 

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.560
do this okay so the user starts in a

driving the confidence of 100 everything
 

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.700
driving the confidence of 100 everything
is working well so far and then they

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:42.710
is working well so far and then they
 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.650
is working well so far and then they
stop satellite and you get a still

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:44.660
stop satellite and you get a still
 

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.350
stop satellite and you get a still
activity now that simple if statement

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360
activity now that simple if statement
 

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.790
activity now that simple if statement
from earlier wouldn't have taken this

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:48.800
from earlier wouldn't have taken this
 

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.260
from earlier wouldn't have taken this
into account and the app would have

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:50.270
into account and the app would have
 

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.170
into account and the app would have
closed so you say okay okay let me

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.180
closed so you say okay okay let me
 

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.790
closed so you say okay okay let me
update my filter to deal with the still

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:54.800
update my filter to deal with the still

we work really hard to avoid

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.150
we work really hard to avoid
 

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.270
we work really hard to avoid
misclassifications but sometimes you're

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280
misclassifications but sometimes you're
 

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.650
misclassifications but sometimes you're
unavoidable and this kind of raw

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:08.660
unavoidable and this kind of raw
 

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.270
unavoidable and this kind of raw

low-level API we're providing that has
 

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.900
low-level API we're providing that has
very little filtering in it now you can

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:13.910
very little filtering in it now you can
 

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.130
very little filtering in it now you can
write a filter to try to deal with

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.140
write a filter to try to deal with
 

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.360
write a filter to try to deal with
things like this because if you look at

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:16.370
things like this because if you look at
 

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.250
things like this because if you look at
the history well there's a lot of

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:18.260
the history well there's a lot of
 

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.890
the history well there's a lot of
driving in the past the biking

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:20.900
driving in the past the biking
 

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.780
driving in the past the biking
confidence is very low so 55 is pretty

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:22.790
confidence is very low so 55 is pretty
 

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.730
confidence is very low so 55 is pretty
low and there was no activity that you

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740
low and there was no activity that you
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.410
low and there was no activity that you
would expect between driving and biking

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:26.420
would expect between driving and biking
 

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.540

like something like walking but but
writing this is getting pretty

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480
writing this is getting pretty
 

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.800
writing this is getting pretty
cumbersome and complicated ok so the

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:32.810
cumbersome and complicated ok so the
 

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.320
cumbersome and complicated ok so the
user continues to drive and now you get

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:35.330
user continues to drive and now you get
 

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.930
user continues to drive and now you get
a tilt event now tilt event is a strong

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:37.940
a tilt event now tilt event is a strong
 

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.640
a tilt event now tilt event is a strong
indication that the users activity is

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:39.650
indication that the users activity is
 

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.010
indication that the users activity is
about to change it tends to happen when

a user goes from sitting to standing so

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.140
a user goes from sitting to standing so
 

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.210
a user goes from sitting to standing so
you can take that into account into a

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:46.220
you can take that into account into a
 

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.970
you can take that into account into a
filter and then finally the user starts

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:48.980
filter and then finally the user starts
 

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.380
filter and then finally the user starts
walking and you can finally close your

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.390
walking and you can finally close your
 

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.780

with all of this is pretty tricky and
 

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.380
with all of this is pretty tricky and
requires a lot of training data to get

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:56.390
requires a lot of training data to get
 

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.540
requires a lot of training data to get
right oh we're making this much easier

context the direction of the user is
 

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.330
context the direction of the user is
traveling and heading is the direction

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340
traveling and heading is the direction
 

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.090
traveling and heading is the direction
that the users phone is pointing so

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100
that the users phone is pointing so
 

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.710

heading and getting a different like

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720
heading and getting a different like
 

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.169
heading and getting a different like
heading is something that if you are if

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179
heading is something that if you are if
 

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:10.760
heading is something that if you are if
you are standing at a stoplight and you

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:10.770
you are standing at a stoplight and you
 

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.950
you are standing at a stoplight and you
plan your phone around to find which

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960
plan your phone around to find which
 

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.260
plan your phone around to find which
direction you should walk that's when

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.270
direction you should walk that's when
 

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.060
direction you should walk that's when
you're heading changes and your bearing

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.070
you're heading changes and your bearing
 

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.200
you're heading changes and your bearing
is not necessarily changing at that

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:18.210
is not necessarily changing at that
 

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.250
is not necessarily changing at that
point so how do you realize getting and

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260
point so how do you realize getting and
 

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.289
point so how do you realize getting and
heading depends a lot on the users

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299
heading depends a lot on the users
 

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:26.390
heading depends a lot on the users
context so if you're an application who

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:26.400
context so if you're an application who
 

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.880

might be my gain by knowing the

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:28.890
might be my gain by knowing the
 

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.740
might be my gain by knowing the
direction of the user think very hard

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:30.750
direction of the user think very hard
 

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.390
direction of the user think very hard
about what context you're after

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:32.400
about what context you're after
 

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.370
about what context you're after
because based on that you want to select

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380
because based on that you want to select
 

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.250
because based on that you want to select
between heading or bearing let's see how

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260
between heading or bearing let's see how
 

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.799
between heading or bearing let's see how
we are doing that in Android Google Maps

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:41.809
 

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:44.960
so in Android Google Maps the blue dot

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:44.970
so in Android Google Maps the blue dot
 

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.210
so in Android Google Maps the blue dot
arrow used to always point to the users

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220
arrow used to always point to the users
 

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.580

heading essentially which direction your

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:49.590
heading essentially which direction your
 

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.029
heading essentially which direction your
phone is pointing now what we found is

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039
phone is pointing now what we found is
 

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.950
phone is pointing now what we found is
that the users expectation from the blue

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960
that the users expectation from the blue
 

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.980
that the users expectation from the blue
dot arrow is much more when they are

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:57.990
dot arrow is much more when they are
 

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.649
dot arrow is much more when they are
stationary like standing still or you

00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659
stationary like standing still or you
 

00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:02.690
stationary like standing still or you
know above or panning their phone around

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700
know above or panning their phone around
 

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.210
know above or panning their phone around
they want to see they're heading from

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220
they want to see they're heading from
 

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.220
they want to see they're heading from
the blue or arrow perhaps because they

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:07.230
the blue or arrow perhaps because they
 

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.240
the blue or arrow perhaps because they
are trying to figure out which direction

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.250
are trying to figure out which direction
 

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.880
are trying to figure out which direction
to go next if they're traveling like in

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:10.890
to go next if they're traveling like in
 

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.310
to go next if they're traveling like in
a car or in a bicycle or even when they

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320
a car or in a bicycle or even when they
 

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.380
a car or in a bicycle or even when they
are running but they want to see the

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:15.390
are running but they want to see the
 

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.600
are running but they want to see the
bearing that is the direction that they

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:17.610
bearing that is the direction that they
 

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.340
bearing that is the direction that they
are moving because they want to perhaps

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:19.350
are moving because they want to perhaps
 

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.380
are moving because they want to perhaps
are verified that the relation they are

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:21.390
are verified that the relation they are
 

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.020
are verified that the relation they are
going towards is actually correct and

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.030
going towards is actually correct and
 

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.520
going towards is actually correct and
more importantly they want us to

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.530
more importantly they want us to
 

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.230
more importantly they want us to
communicate the uncertainty in heading

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240
communicate the uncertainty in heading
 

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.299
communicate the uncertainty in heading
or bearing because if we are not certain

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:29.309
or bearing because if we are not certain
 

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:31.010
or bearing because if we are not certain
if the heading or bearing information

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020
if the heading or bearing information
 

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.180
if the heading or bearing information
that we are giving to the user is not

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.190
that we are giving to the user is not
 

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.039
that we are giving to the user is not
correct the user wants to look around

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:34.049
correct the user wants to look around
 

00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:35.720
correct the user wants to look around
and orient themselves and be diligent

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:35.730
and orient themselves and be diligent
 

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:40.460
and orient themselves and be diligent
about this so how do we do this to

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.470
about this so how do we do this to
 

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.260
about this so how do we do this to
distinguish between stationary and

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:42.270
distinguish between stationary and
 

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.850
distinguish between stationary and
traveling we can use the activity

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860
traveling we can use the activity
 

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.320
traveling we can use the activity
recognition API that matches talked

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.330
recognition API that matches talked
 

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.850
recognition API that matches talked
about you can know when the user is

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860
about you can know when the user is
 

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.770
about you can know when the user is
stationary versus traveling and choose

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:48.780
stationary versus traveling and choose
 

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.770
stationary versus traveling and choose
between heading and burek based on that

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:50.780
between heading and burek based on that
 

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.310
between heading and burek based on that
now to determine the be uncertainty note

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320
now to determine the be uncertainty note
 

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.260
now to determine the be uncertainty note
that bearing is based on location

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:57.270
that bearing is based on location
 

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.200
that bearing is based on location
so you can you can see what the location

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:00.210
so you can you can see what the location
 

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.300
so you can you can see what the location
speed is and what the location accuracy

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:02.310
speed is and what the location accuracy
 

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.100
speed is and what the location accuracy
is and based on that you can determine

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.110
is and based on that you can determine
 

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.620
is and based on that you can determine
if the building is correct or not but

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:06.630
if the building is correct or not but
 

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.340
if the building is correct or not but
how do you find heading uncertainty to

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:10.350
how do you find heading uncertainty to
 

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.800
how do you find heading uncertainty to
understand that let's see how heading is

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:12.810
understand that let's see how heading is
 

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.530
understand that let's see how heading is
being actually been computed so heading

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:15.540
being actually been computed so heading
 

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.690
being actually been computed so heading
today is estimated based on the phone's

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700
today is estimated based on the phone's
 

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.510
today is estimated based on the phone's
compass and as many of you know the

that the phone's compass will become

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:38.790
that the phone's compass will become
 

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.580
that the phone's compass will become
uncalibrated and hence becomes

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:40.590
uncalibrated and hence becomes
 

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.770
uncalibrated and hence becomes
unreadable and all of these types of the

heading uncertainty that we are after so

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:45.330
heading uncertainty that we are after so
 

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.120
heading uncertainty that we are after so
in a nutshell what we found by looking

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.130
in a nutshell what we found by looking
 

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.890
in a nutshell what we found by looking
at a lot of data is that heading

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:48.900
at a lot of data is that heading
 

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.530
at a lot of data is that heading
unscented it really is about what is the

data our machine learning can tell when

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080
data our machine learning can tell when
 

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.890
data our machine learning can tell when
there is animal e and hence when the

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:12.900
there is animal e and hence when the
 

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.570
there is animal e and hence when the
compass is correct and when the compass

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580
compass is correct and when the compass
 

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.760
compass is correct and when the compass
is not and that ties into heading

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:16.770
is not and that ties into heading
 

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.950
is not and that ties into heading
uncertainty we can tell the user or your

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960
uncertainty we can tell the user or your
 

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.210
uncertainty we can tell the user or your
heading is strongly not correct because

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220
heading is strongly not correct because
 

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.300
heading is strongly not correct because
the compass is unreliable and moreover

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.310
the compass is unreliable and moreover
 

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.860
the compass is unreliable and moreover
now because we know that the compass is

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:24.870
now because we know that the compass is
 

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.050
now because we know that the compass is
when the company's unreliable we can go

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.060
when the company's unreliable we can go
 

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.240
when the company's unreliable we can go
back to other kind of sensors like

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:29.250
back to other kind of sensors like
 

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.690
back to other kind of sensors like
gyroscope and this in return actually

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700
gyroscope and this in return actually
 

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.190
gyroscope and this in return actually
improves the heading accuracy

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200
improves the heading accuracy
 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.820
improves the heading accuracy
significantly so now that we know the

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:37.830
significantly so now that we know the
 

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.650
significantly so now that we know the
heading on sentry let's see how we can

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:39.660
heading on sentry let's see how we can
 

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.110
heading on sentry let's see how we can
communicate that using and in an Android

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120
communicate that using and in an Android
 

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.900
communicate that using and in an Android
Google Maps so before in Google Maps we

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:44.910
Google Maps so before in Google Maps we
 

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.670
Google Maps so before in Google Maps we
had this pointy cone which will always

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:46.680
had this pointy cone which will always
 

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.160
had this pointy cone which will always
fall into a heading but now because we

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:49.170
fall into a heading but now because we
 

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.230
fall into a heading but now because we
know the heading uncertainty we can have

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240
know the heading uncertainty we can have
 

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.900
know the heading uncertainty we can have
a corny y where the width of the core

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:53.910
a corny y where the width of the core
 

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.760
a corny y where the width of the core
now tells you what is the answer and in

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:55.770
now tells you what is the answer and in
 

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.710
now tells you what is the answer and in
heading if it's too wide you know that

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720
heading if it's too wide you know that
 

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.060
heading if it's too wide you know that
the heading is problem or correct and

00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.070
the heading is problem or correct and
 

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.980
the heading is problem or correct and
hence you can look around and try to

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:00.990
hence you can look around and try to
 

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.230
hence you can look around and try to
orient your yourself if the cone is

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240
orient your yourself if the cone is
 

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.820
orient your yourself if the cone is
narrow you know it is correct and you

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:04.830
narrow you know it is correct and you
 

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.980
narrow you know it is correct and you
can just look you know use it for your

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:06.990
can just look you know use it for your
 

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.159
can just look you know use it for your
