Man, I love woolly mammoths!

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.480
They’re like fuzzy elephants!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.769
Actually, that’s kind of exactly what they
are.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.780
Hi guys, Catie Wayne here for DNews.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.910
By now I’m sure you’ve all heard of Yuka,
the woolly mammoth found in 2010 on the coast

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.600
of the Laptev Sea near Russia.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.540
She was found in permafrost, and she is the
most in-tact mammoth ever found.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.080
A recent study describes her brain as the
best mammoth specimen in the history of paleoneurology!

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.609
It’s amazing!

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.070
There are folds, and membranes, and blood
vessels and all kinds of neat things that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.670
can help us to better understand what their
brains were like!

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.399
But I know what you’re thinking: does this
fantastically preserved mammoth brain bring

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.640
us any closer to that sweet, sweet mammoth
ride we’ve been dreaming of?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.479
And the answer is “no, unfortunately not.”

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.350
As well preserved as the mammoth is, it is
certainly not perfect.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.010
Scientists are essentially in exactly the
same place that they’ve been for a long

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.010
time now.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.620
Trace actually explained this “place”
in detail in a DNews from earlier this year.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.749
What it comes down to, is it is EXTREMELY
hard to restore mammoth DNA with elephant

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:01.749
DNA.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.749
Like, extremely.

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.970
But this is still cool because, a mammoth
brain has never been this well preserved before!

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.590
While we’re not really any closer to cloning
them what we have learned is that mammoth

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.190
brains appear to be fairly similar to the
brains of elephants today.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.070
But that isn’t particularly surprising because
they’re both members of the same family,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.070
the elephantidae.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.930
In fact, the differences between the two aren’t
that extreme.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.300
Aside from the Songhua River mammoth which
was 17 feet tall, most mammoths weren’t

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.090
that much bigger than an African elephant!

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.200
Just a few inches taller!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.870
There are certainly minor differences.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.450
I mean they couldn’t be exactly the same
or else this whole cloning thing wouldn’t

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.450
be a problem.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.310
The mammoth’s tusks were longer and curved,
for example.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.920
But a rather significant difference between
the two is their actual teeth.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.100
Mammoths had four molars-- two on the top
of their mouth and two on the bottom which

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.750
they would grind in order to shred the tough
plants they ate and two tusks.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.670
Meanwhile elephants typically have 24 teeth
and two tusks.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.810
But obviously, there are two extreme differences
between them: the mammoths are fuzzy and well,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.810
extinct.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.690
So you guys, with these few differences between
them is it even worth cloning the mammoth?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.830
Even though they no longer have a natural
place in the wild?

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.340
