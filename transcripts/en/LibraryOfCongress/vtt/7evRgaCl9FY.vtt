00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:19.300
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.030
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Good afternoon.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm Jane McAuliffe, the Director of
National and International Outreach

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.780
at the Library of Congress, and
I'm delighted to welcome you

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.980
to this afternoon's lecture.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.380
This is of course the
point at which I ask you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.370
to silence your cellphones,
and also mention to you

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.220
that this is being filmed and
will be posted on both the library

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.550
and the Kluge Center websites,
because this event is being hosted

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910
by the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.460
The Kluge Center is located
right next door to this room.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.740 position:56%
And it is the part of the Library
of Congress, very generously funded,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.070
by the philanthropist John W.
Kluge, where we support, showcase,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.730
and celebrate scholarship.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.410
We support it by hosting over a
hundred scholars in any given year.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.720 position:56%
Junior scholars or senior scholars
like today's distinguished lecturer.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.280
We showcase scholarships --

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.890
we showcase scholarship
by events like this.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.090
A whole series of lectures
and panels and symposia

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.010
that the Kluge Center
mounts throughout the year.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.040
And we celebrate scholarship
by awarding every few years,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.940
the Kluge prize for
the study of humanity,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.400
which was awarded most
recently last September

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.250
to Jurgen Habermas
and Charles Taylor.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.150
Today's lecture is titled "Humanity
in Crisis: Ethical Responsibilities

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.820
to People Displaced by War."

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.660
And our speaker is Dr. David
Hollenbach, who was in residence

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.100
at the Kluge Center this past fall.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.350
When in residence, he held
the Cary and Ann Maguire Chair

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.220
in Ethics and American History.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.970
That chair was created to
enable a distinguished thinker

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.500
to spend a period of residence
at the Library of Congress,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.020
exploring America's history
with special attention

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.880
to the ethical dimensions
of our country's economic,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.180
political, and social policies.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.900
The chair was a gift to the Library
of Congress and to the nation,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.210
by Mr. Cary Maguire,
and we are delighted

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.260
to have Mr. Cary Maguire
with us today.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.030
On behalf of all of us, I
would like to thank you,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.460
Mr. Maguire for your extraordinary
generosity in giving this chair

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.360
to the Library of Congress
and the nation.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.160
Thank you.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:07.750
[ Applause ]

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.120
Our lecturer, Dr. David
Hollenbach, is the University Chair

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.000
in Human Rights and International
Justice at Boston College,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.950
where he is also the Director
of the Center for Human Rights

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.660
and International Justice.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.070
He was educated at St. Joseph's
University with a Bachelor

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.510
of Science in Physics,
and then an MA

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.340
from St. Louis University,
and finally a PhD.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.700
in Religious Ethics
from Yale University.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.630
Dr. Hollenbach has published
extensively on Christian ethics,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.100
Christian social ethics,
human rights, refugees,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.730
contemporary theories of justice,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.740
and the role of religion
in public life.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.290
He's the author of
hundreds of articles

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.890
and the author or editor
of nine books.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.150
Some of the best known
titles are, "The Common Good

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.290
and Christian Ethics," "The Global
Face of Public Faith: Politics,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.920 position:56%
Human Rights, and Christian Ethics."

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.390
That was first published in 2003,
and then issued in Chinese in 2013.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.670
" Refugee Rights: Ethics Advocacy,
and Africa," published in 2008

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.230
and finally, "Driven from
Home: Protecting the Rights

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.050
of Forced Migrants,"
published in 2010.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.700
Dr. Hollenbach's books
have been awarded prizes.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.630
He's been honored by major
professional societies.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.200
He's received numerous
honorary degrees.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.840
And he is currently
the President Elect

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.310
of the Catholic Theological
Society of America.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.180
At the Kluge Center last fall,
David Hollenbach's research focused

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.950
on his current book
project, tentatively titled,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.100
"Humanity in Crisis: Religious

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.970
and Ethical Responses
to War and Disaster."

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.600
This book is exploring the
role of faith based communities

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.300
in responding to humanitarian
crises.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.610
I think he must have
enjoyed his time in D.C.,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.480
because starting this
summer, he'll be back.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.830
He's just been appointed the
Pedro Rupe Distinguished Research

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.780
Professor, in Georgetown's
School of Foreign Service,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.990
and also a Senior Fellow at the
Berkeley Center for religion,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.900
peace and world affairs
at Georgetown.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.610
So it will be wonderful
to have him across town.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.710
But before then, we will
hear from him this afternoon.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.510
Dr. Hollenbach.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.130
[ Applause ]

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Thank you very much.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.140
I want to express my
sincere gratitude

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.120 position:56%
to the John Kluge Center here at the
Library of Congress, and especially

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.270
to Mr. Cary Maguire, for enabling
me to be here at the library

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.370
with his support during
the past fall semester.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.200
I want to thank Jane McAuliffe, the
former Director of the Kluge Center

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.220
who invited me to be here at the
Kluge Center during the past fall.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.380
I want to thank Robert
Gallucci who was --

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.080
is the center's current director,
and also the entire staff

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.310 position:56%
of the Kluge Center who made my time
here so congenial and so supportive.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.850 position:56%
The Kluge Center here at the library
is an ideal place for research.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.330
The serenity here is, in some
ways, the very antithesis

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.910
of the conditions faced by
the people who were the focus

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.910
of my work, while I was here.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.540
Their struggles, the struggles of
these people whom I was working

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.440
on while I was here, may
be indicated by the title

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.970
of my address this afternoon,
namely, Humanity in Crisis.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:11.360
A recent study defined humanitarian
crises as quote, "Any situation

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.800
in which there is widespread threat
to life, physical safety, health,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.220
or basic subsistence that is
beyond the coping capacity

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.370
of the individuals and
communities in which they reside."

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:34.390
I can assure you from some of my
visits to places like South Sudan,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:40.540
Rwanda, that people displaced by
war, especially those displaced

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.360
in vast numbers, often
face threats that are --

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.180
go beyond their coping capacity.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.450
The very opposite of
the kind of support

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.610
that I received here in the fall.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.120
My concern this afternoon is
with our ethical responsibilities

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.290
to people who are facing
these humanitarian crises.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:10.460 position:56%
And I'm using the term humanitarian,
in a way shaped by the principles

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.730
of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.760
Some people regard the ICRC

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.320
as the gold standard
of humanitarian action.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.800
But in the principles of
the international committee

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.000
of the red cross, humanity is used
in a way that has two meanings.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.560
It refers first of all to
the whole of human kind.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.100
To act with humanity therefore,
calls for inclusive concern

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.070
for all members of the human
family, on the basis of their need.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.360
Not because of their
nationality, race, or religion.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:54.530
Secondly, humanity is a spirit that
is sometimes called humaneness.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.610
It is compassion for
those who are suffering.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.580
A virtue quite similar
to Christian love.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.570
Humanity in this sense, seeks
to alleviate serious distress,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.840
especially when that distress
exceeds the coping capacity

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.820
of those who are affected.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.570 position:56%
The scope of humanitarian crises has
grown dramatically in recent years,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:27.090
and is evident from the growing
number of people displaced by war.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.170 position:56%
United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees tells us that the number

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.600
of people displaced by
war, intrastate strife,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.080
and human rights violations,
reached 59

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:47.120
and a half million globally
last year, 8.3 million more

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.080
than just a year earlier.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.750
This is the largest
increase in the number

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.070
of displaced persons ever
recorded for a single year.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:04.260 position:56%
The number of displaced people, it
is estimated, will exceed 61 million

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.070
by the end of this year, 2016.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.680
These people have no
choice about moving.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.180
The conditions they face,
often due to conflict,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.680
put their most basic
human rights on the line,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.450 position:56%
often including their right to life.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.680
For example, the massive
displacement in the eastern part

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.670
of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, has been caused

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:37.390
by ethnic conflict, armed
rebellion, and resulting disease

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.840
and malnutrition that
has led to more

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.690
than 5 million deaths
over the past decade.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.940
Well, what can we say about our
responsibilities in the face

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.090
of these crises, and the
suffering they cause?

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.380
As the number of people
seeking asylum

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.610
from such grave threats
has risen in recent years,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:08.450
secular political philosophers
such as Joseph Carens,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.900
and refugee scholars such as
Philip Marfleet, have been arguing

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:21.380
that the time has come to consider
making borders fully open to all

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:27.870
who are fleeing from
persecution, conflict, or disaster.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.260
In a similar way, similar
spirit, several years ago,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.560 position:56%
the philosopher Martha Nussbaum
argued that a cosmopolitan community

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.410
of all human beings, should have
primacy over narrower communities,

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.800
defined in terms of nationality,
ethnicity, or religion.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.340
Indeed, Nussbaum called
nationality, in her words,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.230
"a morally irrelevant
characteristic of personhood."

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:06.980
Such a cosmopolitan vision can be
given Christian religious backing.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:14.160 position:56%
For example, during his recent visit
to the island of Lesbos in Greece,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.850
on the border with Turkey, Pope
Francis told Syrian refugees there,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.280
who were seeking entrance
to Europe, that quote,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.440
"God created humankind
to be one family."

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.400
The pope then called
Europe to "Build bridges

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.800
and to recoil from
putting up walls."

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:43.320
And then he turned around and took
12 Syrian refugees, all Muslim,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.910
back to the Vatican
with him in his plane.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.830
Pope Francis was drawing on
the Book of Genesis' teaching

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.310
that all persons are created in the
image of God, making them brothers

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.300 position:56%
and sisters in a single human family

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.820
that reaches across
national borders.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:06.350
The universality of human
dignity in a similar way,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:13.000
led Pope John the 23rd back
in 1963, to insist, I quote,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.240 position:56%
"The fact that one is a citizen of
a particular state, does not detract

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.240
in any way from one's membership
in the human family as a whole,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.570
nor from one's membership
in the world community."

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:34.900
So, a strong defense of the
common humanity among all of us

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.370
that should affect our
response to people in crisis.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.640
Nevertheless, this philosophical
and Christian universalism,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.300
calls not only for the support
of the unity of the human family,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.620
but it also calls, I would
submit, that we are obligated

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:02.400
to respect the differences among
people's cultures and nations.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.710
In her recent writings,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:10.600 position:56%
Martha Nussbaum now draw upon
Rothias [phonetic] and Kant to argue

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.810
that "People exercise their
freedom and express their dignity

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:21.480
when they shape the institutions
of their own nation state."

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.980
Protecting the independence
of accountable states is thus,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:32.510
for Nussbaum today, a way
of protecting human dignity.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.130
In a similar way, Christian
theologians like St. Augustin

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.390
and St. Thomas Aquinas,
have affirmed that

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:46.250
"There is a Christian duty to love
all human beings as our neighbors,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:51.990
but also a duty in Christian
love, to show distinctive concern

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.440
for those with whom we have special
relationships," such as members

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.860
of our families or
our fellow citizens.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.660
Christian ethics thus
acknowledges our special duties

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.930
toward co-citizens.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.370
While also forbidding actions
that effectively treat those

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.430
from other communities
who are in grave need,

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.900
as if they were nonhuman
or nonpersons.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.430
A key issue for the
ethics of response

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.780
to people facing humanitarian
crisis, is thus what kind

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:31.660
of priorities should we be giving
to this universal concern for all

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.810 position:56%
and this special concern for those
with whom we have special relations?

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.410
A special concern, a set of
priorities, that Augustin

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.610
and Aquinas call the "ordo
amoris," the ordering of our loves.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:50.450
The humanitarian crises of today
call us to reflect carefully

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.740
on the relative weights of the
obligations and rights that arise

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.200
from our common humanity and
from our distinctive identities.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.500
What I want to do today is to
suggest several priorities,

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:09.300
focusing first on our negative
duties that are relevant

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:15.380 position:56%
to the crises caused by war today,
and then on several positive duties,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.430
to aid those who are facing crises.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.560
Key negative duties relative to
the humanitarian crises caused

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.320 position:56%
by conflict today can be highlighted

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.620
by drawing upon the moral tradition
known as the "Just War Ethic."

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.720
This tradition distinguishes
between morally legitimate

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.860
and morally illegitimate
uses of force.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.150 position:56%
So it should probably be called
"The Just and Unjust War Tradition,"

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:50.500
rather than suggesting that it
implies that all wars are just.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.110
This tradition has roots
in Christian thought,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:58.630
especially in Catholicism, but it
also overlaps with the tradition

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.450
of the International
Law of Armed Conflict.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:08.500
In its modern form, the Just/Unjust
War Tradition draws a sharp line

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.220
between force used in the
defense of human rights,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.270
and force used to violate
human rights.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.610
The U.S. Ad Bellum of Just
Cause, requires that requires

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.910
that force be strictly
limited to defending the rights

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.770
of innocent persons to
life, freedom, and security.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.760
And the rights of nation
states to self-determination

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.760
and territorial integrity.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.480
Conversely, there is a negative
duty not to use force aggressively

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.200
against other people's or to
deny them their political freedom

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.520
to exploit them economically

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.610
or because they are
culturally different.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.150
Violation of these negative
duties is both immoral,

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:03.550
and according to international
law, criminal.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.930
Sadly, this is just what happened

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.390
in perhaps the worst humanitarian
crisis of recent times:

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:19.000
the Rwanda genocide of 1994,
where force was massively used

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.550
to deny the most basic rights
of the Tutsi people in Rwanda.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:31.240
It was also appallingly violated
in the slaughter at Srebrenica

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.600
where thousands of
Bosnian Muslims were killed

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.720
because of their identity
as Bosnian Muslims,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.520
as part of an ethnic cleansing.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.770
Similarly, the Just War
norms also forbid direct

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.120
and intentional attacks
on civilians,

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.880
as well as collateral harm to
civilians that is disproportionate

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.290
to the good being sought.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.270
International law sets
forth similar prohibitions

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.160
in the Geneva Conventions,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.860
which insist that civilians must
be distinguished from soldiers

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.980
and protected, both
from direct attack

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.950
and from disproportionate
collateral harm.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:22.470
Violations of standards are war
crimes, and can become crimes

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:28.110
against humanity, if they are
widespread and systematic.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.050
Regrettably, some recent
conflicts in our world today,

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:39.250
have become humanitarian crises
precisely because of violations

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.250
of these moral and
legal prohibitions.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:51.340
For example, tactics used in the
civil war that began in South Sudan

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.790 position:56%
in December, 2013, just a short time

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.750
after South Sudan had become
an independent country,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.910
the tactics used then have
regularly violated the rights

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.670
of civilians to security.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:12.920
Human Rights Watch and a U.N.
panel of experts both concluded

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.750
that the government of South Sudan
and the opposition forces as well,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.230
had quote, "Committed extraordinary
acts of cruelty that amount

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:28.100
to war crimes, and in some
cases, crimes against humanity."

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.040
Because of this mayhem,
by July 2015,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:40.070
over 1.6 million South Sudanese
had become internally displaced,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:45.150
and over three-quarters of a
million had become refugees.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:51.310
The strategies and tactics used
by both sides in South Sudan,

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:56.920
have themselves turned
South Sudan into a situation

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.350
of grave humanitarian emergency.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.080
The Syrian crisis reinforces
the conclusion

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.860
that armed conflict can
lead to humanitarian crisis

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.600
when the adversaries
violate their duty not

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.460
to attack the basic
rights of civilians.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.690
The U.N.'s Independent
Commission of Inquiry on Syria,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.750
concluded that quote, "War
crimes, crimes against humanity,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.290
and human rights violations,
were so severe

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.750
that the Syrian reality should
shock the conscience of humanity."

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.570
These violations have led

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.870
to the single largest forced
migration in recent history.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.150
The flight of refugees has
threatened the stability

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.810
of neighboring countries,
including Turkey,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.760 position:56%
which today hosts the single largest
number of refugees of any country

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.190
in the world, Lebanon where one

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.000
out of every four persons
inside the boundaries

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.110
of Lebanon is a Syrian
refugee, and Jordan.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.750
Syrian displacement has also as
we know, strained the politics

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:15.070
of the European Union
in very recent months.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.440
The International Criminal
Court was established in 1998,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.540
to hold people accountable
for violations of standards

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.370
of international law, like these.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.250
The Rome Statute that created
the court, gave it jurisdiction

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.800
over genocide, crimes
against humanity, war crimes,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.100
and the crime of aggression.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.990
The ICC has so far not been
able to bring to trial some

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.610
of those it has charged with
such atrocities, due to its lack

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.850 position:56%
of effective enforcement mechanisms.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:56.940
For example, Omar al-Bashir of
Jordan, Khartoum, a northern part

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.740 position:56%
of what used to be the one Jordan,
faces charges of genocide and crimes

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.410
against humanity for his
actions in the Darfur Region.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:11.160
But obtaining his arrest
has so far been impossible.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.720 position:56%
Although he better not go back to
South Africa after a recent decision

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.090
of the South African supreme court,
that he should have been arrested

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.830
when he was there the last time.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.320
Charges against Uhuru Kenyatta
of Kenya had to be dropped

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.990
because the International Criminal
Court prosecutor was unable

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.140
to get witnesses to testify,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:38.450
largely because most people think
their lives are on the line,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.990
or that some of them had
been massively bribed.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.970
Nevertheless, the court has had
success in some other cases,

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:51.260
and other international
criminal tribunals have succeeded

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.350
in bringing other people who
conducted these kinds of atrocities

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.940
to account for their actions.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.540
These moves by some of these
international criminal tribunals,

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.780
at least encourage me to think
that accountability for these kinds

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.030
of violations is increasing.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.710
Duties not to violate basic
rights in conflict are more likely

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.180
to be enforced today
than in the past.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.860
Although we're far from
where we should be.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.830
And those who violate such norms,
are less likely to get away

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.680
with it today than
they were in the past,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.940
but with still a long way to go.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.000
Regrettably, we have learned
from history, and from insight

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.010
in the human moral weakness
that threats to human rights

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.270
of this sort are probably
going to continue.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:53.200 position:56%
This raises the question of what
positive obligations we have to come

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.390
to the assistance of those who
face crisis level suffering,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.110
because of their violation
of human rights.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.230
If people fail to follow
their negative duties not

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.940
to commit these crimes, what
kind of positive duty do we have

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.030
to actually take some
action to come to their aid?

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.740
Here, I want to draw on
a mode of moral analysis

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:21.510 position:56%
that was originally developed in
the 1970s, in the context of debates

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.250
about who had duties to
eliminate the apartheid regime

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.940
that separated South African
people by race, and did such harm

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.290
to so many Black South
Africans for so many years.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:40.390 position:56%
Some maintain that those who had not
created the apartheid system had no

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.560
duty to try to change it.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.400
It was the South African's
duty to change the regime,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.200
not us Americans or Europeans.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.320
But a very different
ethical approach was proposed

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.210
by several scholars
at Yale University,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.950 position:56%
who argued that under certain
circumstances, persons, communities,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.680
or institutions can
have positive duties

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.890
to help remedy harms they
themselves did not cause.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.320
They called their approach,
the Kew Gardens Principles,

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.090
for it arose from reflection
by these group --

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.670
by these scholars at Yale, on
a tragic case that occurred

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.870
in the Kew Garden section of New
York City, way back in the mid-60s.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.370
According to press reports,

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:33.470
a young woman named Kitty Genovese
was viciously assaulted, stabbed,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.610
and died a slow death while
38 nearby people watched

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.100
and did nothing.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.950
Some failing to call the police.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.180
It has since been learned
that the initial reports

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.380
of what happened were not entirely
accurate, but the public outrage

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.630
at what happened to Kitty Genovese
stimulated by the press reports,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:01.340
points to the fact that most
people anyway, have a conviction

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:08.170
that it is not enough not to
cause harm, in some situations,

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:13.390
one has a duty to come to the
aid of people one has not harmed.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.400
A sin of omission can
in some circumstances,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.910
be as morally objectionable
as a sin of commission.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.370
Drawing on this conviction, the
Kew Gardens Principles developed

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:32.960
by the Yale authors argues that an
agent has a positive responsibility

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.990
to help others when four
conditions are present.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.560
First, there is a critical need.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.090
Second, the agent has
proximity to the need.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.030
Third, the agent has a
capability of responding.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.820
And fourth, the agent is
likely the last resort

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.750
from whom help can be expected.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.270
Subsequent reflection has
added a fifth condition,

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:06.820
namely that the action can be
taken without disproportionate harm

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.030
to the one providing help.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:14.090
These five criteria of course,
cannot be applied mechanically,

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:18.630
but I think they can help
us think about the scope

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.040
of our positive responsibilities
in the face

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.850
of the crisis level suffering
that is occurring in places

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.890
like Syria and South Sudan today.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:35.070
For example, there can be little
doubt that grave need exists

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.820
in Syria and South Sudan today.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.010
Those inside the borders of
these crisis-torn countries,

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.750
are vulnerable to harms that
could lead to their deaths

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.540
or to the violation of
their other basic rights.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.760
Secondly, the duty to
respond to such need,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.080
falls upon those whose proximity to
the crisis makes them more likely

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.410
to have knowledge of the need,
and also better understanding

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.940
of how to respond to the need.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.120
This means of course that
the government of the nation

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.830
where the crisis is occurring
and the local communities

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.750
within that region, bear
the prime responsibility

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.420
for addressing the need involved.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.820
In South Sudan and Syria for --
therefore, both the governments

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.640 position:56%
and the opposition forces in each
country, have both the negative duty

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.700
to stop the atrocities they are
causing, and the positive duty

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.420
to help lift the burdens the
suffering has already caused.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.280
The duty to take positive
action however,

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.380
does not end at the national
borders of the countries

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.940
where the crisis is present.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.360
When people become aware of a
crisis in a neighboring country,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.090
or even in a country at a great
distance, this awareness leads

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.940
to what might be called
"Intellectual

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.600
or Psychological Proximity."

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.990
It puts people, even at a
distance in moral proximity

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.320
to those who are suffering.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.070
There has been helpful,
though imperfect,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:23.650
response to the duties
arising from proximity

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.690
by the countries neighboring
South Sudan.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.240
The regional organization of
Sudan's neighboring countries,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:39.270 position:56%
namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, and Eritrea,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.600
an organization that is called
the Intergovernmental Authority

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.170
on Development, IGAD,
abbreviated as,

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.970
IGAD has played a diplomatic role
in seeking to mediate the conflict

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.320
within South Sudan,
that began in 2013,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.070
as it did during the earlier effort

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.470
to bring the comprehensive
peace agreement to Sudan

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.310
that ended the conflict between
Northern and Southern Sudan,

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.310
that ultimately led to the
independence of South Sudan.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.340
Regrettably, the economic
and political self-interest

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:20.170
of these countries in IGAD has
sometimes distorted their mediation

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:25.150
efforts, leading particularly
of Uganda and Ethiopia,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.840
which has in turn led
several countries

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.490
at even greater distances outside
the region to become involved

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.730
in mediating the diplomatic
efforts to bring an end

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:41.060
to the South Sudan crisis, through
an initiative called IGAD Plus,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.350
which includes not only
South Sudan's neighbors,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.660
but also the African Union, the
United Nations, China, the U.S.,

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.060
the United Kingdom, Norway,
and the European Union.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.830
A sense of moral responsibility
arose

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.430
in these more distant countries,

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.540
because of their proximity
through awareness.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.050
What I'm calling, moral proximity.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.690
These combined regional and global
mediation efforts have been far

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.180
from perfect to be sure.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:19.530
However, a fragile peace process
is underway and there's even a sign

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:24.130
of hope that it may be
leading to a positive outcome.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:29.080
Even today, new news of Riek
Machar returning back to Juba

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.940
with the possibility of moving
in back into the government

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.030
to heal some of the
wounds that are there.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.080
At least there's a hope
that this could happen.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.460
And it points to the fact

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.560
that distant neighbors
can make a difference

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.430
in addressing these crises.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:49.980
The criterion of capability also
sheds light on the positive duties

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.900
to respond to humanity in crisis.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.760
In considering this issue,
it has become common to point

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.350
out that someone who cannot swim,
does not have a duty to come

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:07.010
to the aid of a child who is
drowning a rapidly flowing river,

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.380
if aid requires swimming
some distance

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.930
that the person is incapable of.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:19.080 position:56%
On the other hand, a good swimmer,
could have a duty to come to the aid

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.520
of such a child in the river.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.130
Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:31.510 position:56%
are already massively
overburdened by the Syrian refugees.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.960
In my judgement, they do not
possess the economic resources

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:42.240
to provide asylum for additional
refugees in the current situation.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.220
On the other hand, the resources
of the wealthy countries

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.730
of Northern Europe, North America,
and the oil producing Gulf states,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:55.420
gives them the capability to
receive many more asylum seekers

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.760
than they are, and to share
the burdens being carried

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.300
by Syria's already
overburdened neighbors,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.660
by providing financial assistance,
to those surrounding neighbors.

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.290
The assistance being provided to
the countries bordering on Syria,

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.410
financial, is woefully inadequate.

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:21.110
Our capability it seems
to me, gives us a duty,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:26.830 position:56%
both to receive more Syrian refugees
than we have, and especially

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:33.220 position:56%
to do much more to provide direct
financial assistance and other forms

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:38.710
of technological and humanitarian
aid to help Syria's near neighbors,

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:43.860
deal with the massive number of
refugees they are dealing with.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:50.210
The responsibility of the Doctrine
of the Responsibility to Protect,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.940
that was affirmed at the
2005 General Assembly

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.780 position:56%
of the World's Summit -- General
Assembly of the U.N.'s World Summit,

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.640
states that the international
community can have --

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:06.350
do positive duties to help
protect populations from genocide,

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.910
war crimes, ethnic cleansing,
and crimes against humanity.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:16.310
Such crimes are clearly occurring
in Syria and South Sudan today.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.710
In the first instance, such
protective efforts should be

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.560
through diplomatic, humanitarian
and peaceful meanings.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.930
But if such peaceful initiatives
do not succeed however,

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:33.470 position:56%
the use of armed force can become a
legitimate way to carry out the duty

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.330
to protect people from
violations of their rights

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.910
that reach the level of atrocity.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.510
The responsibility to
protect doctrine of course,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.620
has been the focus of much
controversy, heated controversy,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.360
since it was first
proclaimed by the U.N. in 2005.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.740
Political realists oppose
it because they hold

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.480
that foreign policy should be
determined by the interests

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.510
of one's own people, not

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:07.690
by a supposed moral
responsibility to other lands.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.540
Others see the responsibility
to protect,

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:18.730
as a form of neo-imperialism, an
expansion of what the French used

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:24.440
to call the advancement
of civilization.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.960
Still others say that
what happened in Libya,

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.980
shows that that the responsibility
to protect doesn't work.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.190
And that what's happening in Syria
today shows that it can't work.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.090
Despite these critiques,
it is important to note

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:45.280
that the responsibility to protect
has been invoked on a number

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.880
of occasions since 2005,
and that it has in fact led

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.360
to the effective protection
of people

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.650
from grave human rights violations.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.900
For example, when conflict
flared in Kenya,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:05.180
following the disputed 2007
elections, Kofi Annan said

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.680
that he looked at the
crisis through the prism

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.740
of the responsibility to protect.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.560
This led him to initiate and
to stimulate others to follow,

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.850 position:56%
in creating diplomatic interventions
by the U.N., the African Union,

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.680
a number of other governments
from Africa and around the world,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.400
including the United States.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.460 position:56%
Condoleezza Rice went there
herself to try to mediate the crisis

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.490
in Kenya following the election.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:42.030
A power sharing agreement was
reached between the two forces

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:49.330
that were adversaries in Kenya, and
the downward spiral into civil war

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.670
and what some feared was
moving toward genocide was

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.770
actually stopped.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:59.090
The Kenyan case illustrates in my
judgement, that the responsibility

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.140
to protect can be successfully
carried out through nonviolent,

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.110
political and diplomatic
initiatives.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.570
The responsibility to protect
doctrine has also been invoked

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.780
on several occasions in the
past decade, to justify the use

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.110
of military force to protect
people from grave atrocities.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.780
In 2012, with the U.N.
Security Council approval,

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.790
France and the economic
community of West African states,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:35.170
took military action in
pursuit of peace in Mali.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:43.220 position:56%
And in 2013, the Security Council
supported the use of force by France

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.780
and the African Union
to stop atrocities

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.280
in the Central Africa Republic.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:57.580
These cases, Mali and CAR, Central
African Republic, indicate to me

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:03.460
that the responsibility to
protect can remain a viable option

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.890
in grave crisis.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.390
Two other cases however,
Libya and Syria,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:13.120
cause others to question this.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.920
In the Libya case, the
U.N. authorized action

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.870
to protect civilians when
fears arose that Gaddafi was

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.700
about to commit atrocities.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.790
He had done a lot of bad things
already, but there was fear

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.230
that he was even going
to do worse things.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.610
For example, when he
referred to his adversaries

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:37.520
in Benghazi as "cockroaches."

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.210
This is the very epithet
that the Hutus used

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:46.600
of the Tutsi during the
midst of the Rwanda genocide.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.630
And it led a number of people to
think that Gaddafi was on the verge

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.450
of an extermination
of his adversaries.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:00.810
As a result, the Security
Council with the notable support

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:05.410
of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, and the League

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.470
of Arab States, called
for the use of quote,

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.730
"All necessary measures
to protect civilians."

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.470
NATO intervened with air power.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:20.020
Gaddafi was killed and
his regime was overthrown.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:26.020
Sadly, and this is what leads the
critics to say RtoP doesn't work,

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.330
Libya has fallen into
political chaos,

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:33.860
with armed conflicts among several
groups, significant violations

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.670
of human rights continuing
on the basis of religion,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:42.960 position:56%
and the unsafe flight of migrants
across the Mediterranean from Libya.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.310
These consequences confirm
some in the conviction

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.470
that pursuing humanitarian goals,

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.240
not required by national
self-interest,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.570 position:56%
is likely to do more harm than good.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:41:00.220
I would argue however, that the
intervention in Libya failed,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.630
not because it was excessive,
but because it was incomplete.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:10.280
Following the norms that my
colleagues in ethics today call

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:16.290
"jus post bellum,"
justice following conflict,

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:20.060
NATO and the U.S. should have
followed up their intervention

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:27.030
with action to rebuild Libya and to
prevent the chaos that developed.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:30.230
What happened in Libya
was in my judgement,

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:34.810
an incomplete implementation
of the responsibility

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.670
to protect, not a simple failure.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.380
Syria has also been
invoked to suggest

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.310
that the responsibility
to protect is dead.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:48.780
The political complexities
and moral ambiguities

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.010
of the Syrian situation,
surely go very deep.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.750
But these complexities in my
view, do not discredit the notion

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.830
of the responsibility to protect.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:05.890 position:56%
Thomas Weiss has argued that the
"wisdom of the use of military force

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:13.200 position:56%
to protect people from atrocities is
governed by three factors: legality,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.100
moral legitimacy, and feasibility."

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:22.720
In Syria, it is clear that the
legal prohibitions of war crimes

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.910
and of other atrocities,
have been violated.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.950
The moral legitimacy of efforts to
stop a conflict that has displaced

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.510
over half the entire Syrian
population, and killed hundreds

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.290
of thousands of Syrians,
is also evident.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.950
The issue of course is feasibility.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:48.680 position:56%
Feasibility of military intervention
to alleviate the crisis,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.260
and this I think is -- this
feasibility is unclear.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.080
This does not undermine the idea
that there is a responsibility

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.770
to protect people from atrocity.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.380
The apparent lack of a presently
feasible way to overcome the crisis

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:10.490
in Syria I would argue, calls
for additional political

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:14.780
and diplomatic initiatives
to find a path forward.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:24.890
Not only Assad and the rebels, but
also Russia, Iran, the Gulf states,

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.660
and some others, are keeping
the crisis in Syria alive.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:35.280
The United States has a duty, in my
judgement, to engage these powers

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.410
in the pursuit of peace,
through continuing political

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.040
and diplomatic engagement.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:47.280
In my judgement, Secretary
Kerry is on the right path here.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.380 position:56%
Outside of Syria itself, what is our
responsibility to the large number

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.320
of Syrians presently
seeking asylum in Europe,

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.200
and other parts of
the developed world?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.280
We should affirm -- we should
reaffirm the United Nations 1951

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.470
Refugee Conventions Affirmation
that refugees fleeing persecution,

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.050
should be granted asylum elsewhere.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:17.300
Countries in Europe and North
America have the capability

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:22.050
and the resources to grant asylum
to a considerably larger number

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:27.310
of refugees from Syria and South
Sudan than we are doing today.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.530
Indeed, the number of Syrians
seeking asylum in Europe,

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.740
is not even close to
the number already

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.490
within the borders
of Syria's neighbors.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.820
For example, in the
fall of last year,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.030
when Prime Minister David Cameron
of the United Kingdom announced

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:51.630
that is country would grant
asylum to 20,000 Syrian refugees

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:57.030
over the next 5 years, he
was appropriately reminded

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:02.260
that Lebanon had admitted
that number of Syrian refugees

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.170
over the last two weekends.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.890
Indeed, developing
countries today host 86%

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.410
of all the world's refugees.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:22.430
And the very poorest countries of
the world, are providing asylum

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:27.750
to 25% of the global
total of refugees.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:32.920
The rich nations of the north,
like us, have the capability

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:38.150
and therefore the responsibility
to admit a larger number

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:41.800
of asylum seekers, and
even more I would say

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.610
to assist these poorer countries

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:51.020
who are already hosting most
of the world's refugees.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:56.240
The funds being provided for this
burden sharing by us in the north,

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.700
need to be substantially increased.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.210
To achieve this, the rich nations
of the northern hemisphere,

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:08.040
will have to overcome
tendencies to racially

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.690
and religiously driven xenophobia,
and overcome the mistaken fear

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.600
that most terrorists
have come in as refugees.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.800
Most terrorists are actually
native born people, born within --

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.490
the French terrorists who blew
up the -- took action in Paris,

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.790
and those who took action

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.970
in Brussels were all born
in France and Belgium.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:35.630
A country with a history
of military involvement

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.160
in another country can also
have special obligations.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.570
For example, the United States
recognized its particular duty

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.150
to receive refugees from
Vietnam, after the Vietnam war.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:54.100 position:56%
Though the U.S. intervention in Iraq
was certainly not the sole course --

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.820
cause of displacement of many
Iraqis in the world today,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.570
it was surely the occasion

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:06.150
of the huge forced migration
of Iraqis that followed.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.470
And political scientist
Steven Walt recently observed

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:13.520
in a somewhat cynical column,
that if the United States

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:19.310
and its allies had not invaded Iraq
in 2003, there would almost no --

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.920 position:56%
certainly be no Islamic state today,

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.880
which would then be
raising questions

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.220
about our duty toward the
people being displaced

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.620
by the Islamic state.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.130
If we had not intervened,
it seems to me,

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.580
there would surely be
fewer people seeking asylum

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.830
from Iraq and Syria today.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:45.300
This deepens our duties toward
those refugees, in my judgment.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.450
Finally, I recognize
that there are reasons

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:53.990 position:56%
to wonder whether national
self-interest will not almost always

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:58.150
overshadow the duties
that I've been sketching

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.050
and that I then advocating.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:06.350
Nevertheless, I am encouraged by
the recent work of Martha Finnemore

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:11.360
and Kathryn Sikkink, two
distinguished political scientists,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:17.820 position:56%
whose work shows the positive impact
of people who have been advocating

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.800
for normative, ethical
standards in some domains

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.080
of contemporary international
politics.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.600
The standards of international law
of armed conflict, where the result

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:37.650
of normative advocacy, by
groups such as the Red Cross

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:41.090
over the past century,
leading to the creation

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.470
of the Geneva Conventions.

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.810
More recently, though the
International Criminal Court is

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:52.870
still by all means, a
developing institution, Finnemore

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:57.190
and Sikkink have argued that,
"normative entrepreneurs,"

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.180
as they call them, have
advanced the effort

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:06.510
to hold political leaders
accountable for violating standards

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.610
through the action of several
international criminal tribunals.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:12.080
Not only the International
Criminal Court,

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.440
but the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.540 position:56%
the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, etcetera.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:23.140
This suggests that contrary to
the standard realist argument,

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.830
ethical standards can
come to have real impact

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.050
on the conduct of nations.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:37.130
My hope is that strong ethical
pressure, including pressure

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:42.150
from faith-based agencies like
the pressure we saw from the Pope

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.030
in Lesbos, just a few day --

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:50.050
few weeks ago, that this pressure
will lead to more action in accord

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.550
with the responsibilities

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.340
that I have incompletely
sketched here today.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.280
And that I hope to treat in
considerably greater depth

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:03.130 position:56%
in the book that I'm writing, thanks
to my stay at the Kluge Center.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.930
Thank you.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:18.060
[ Applause ]

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.100
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Thank you
very much, Dr. Hollenbach.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.640
I think you have wetted our
appetite for some questions

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.900
and you have graciously
agreed to take a few,

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.480
if there are some in the audience.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.400
When you pose a question, would
you please make it a question

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.800
and identify yourself
before doing so?

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.030
Thank you.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:45.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for
this very stimulating talk.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.450
My name is Theo Cristov.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.750
I'm a Kluge Fellow.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:53.020
I wanted to push more on the
philosophical question and to think

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.580
about the distinction between
duty and responsibility.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.150
In my sense, from your discussion,

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.710
was that you use both
interchangeably in the talk.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.470
And here's the context.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:08.870
In the last 17th Century, the
German theorist Pufendorf speaks

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:13.070
of the responsibility to protect
only on the condition that in fact

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.840
that help is needed by the people

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.900
who are suffering,
and that's their call.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.180
So the distinction that he makes
between duty and responsibility

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.590 position:56%
that duty comes with responsibility,

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.570
but responsibility does
not necessarily dutiful.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.910
So from that context, I wanted
to invite you to think about,

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:34.270
how can we respond to the current
crisis that you are discussing,

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:37.380
by using that distinction
between duty and responsibility?

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.040
And would that change any
part of your argument?

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.340
Thank you.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach: Well,
that's a very interesting question.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.540
I am not familiar with
Pufendorf's distinction.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.470
So maybe you could give me an
illustration of what's a duty

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.340
and what's a responsibility
so I know a little better

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.450
about what you're asking
me to clarify

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.930
about the contemporary scene?

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.840
I'm not fully clear on
what the distinction is.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.120
&gt;&gt; So the context comes
in Pufendorf --

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:07.160
he's attacking essentially
[inaudible] scholastic,

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.610
on the question of the
[inaudible] Indians that in fact,

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:14.410
the [inaudible] Indians, do they
have a right to be dispossessed

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:18.520 position:56%
by the Europeans, or can they just
be dispossessed without their right?

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.650
So what he says is that in
fact, we can only protect people

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:28.190
who are calling for our help, as
opposed to on humanitarian grounds,

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.110
without the help of people we
can intervene at any point.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.740
And that's the distinction
between duty and responsibility.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.410
The moral question versus the
political realism which you sort

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.200
of addressed at the
very end of your talk.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
So, you're suggesting

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.460 position:56%
that responsibility is more response

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:47.720
to a call whereas duty is
sort of initiated by me.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.780
Well, I'm not -- I'd have to think
about that much more carefully.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.250
One of the ways in which I
do think about it though,

00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:05.740 position:56%
is to say that the very dignity of
the person is already a kind of call

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:12.810
to me to respond in a way
that supports that dignity.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:21.450
I mean, one way to think of it
is to think about the dignity

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:28.370
of the person is already a kind
of ought toward me, that it speaks

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.750
to me and says, "Don't violate me."

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:38.320
Or if I am indeed being
submerged in crisis,

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.620
it can call out to me the
very dignity of the person,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.660
not the words the person
uses, but the very humanity

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.000
of the person is a
kind of call to me.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.340
And that's the way I would
start thinking about this.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.380
I'd want to go back and see what's
at stake though in the argument

00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.280
about indigenous Americans
and what kind

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.140
of argument Pufendorf
is making there.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:08.170
I know that [inaudible] was very
strong in making an argument

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:11.930
about the need to protect these
people from the kind of abuse

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:16.150
that some of the Spanish colonial
practices were exerting upon them,

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.580
but I'm not sure how
Pufendorf dealt with that one.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.540
I would certainly respond
-- one way that --

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:28.730 position:56%
well, maybe that's enough to say
and we can move to another question.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.600
Bruce Gentleson [phonetic] is
looking there to ask a question.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.320
We were neighbors when I was here
at the Kluge Center in the fall.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.740
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, and it
was a joy talking with you,

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.040
and a fabulous talk today.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Thank you Bruce.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.640
I appreciate that.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.980
&gt;&gt; Let me pick up on the last point
you made about national interests,

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.390 position:56%
because I think the way you laid
things out was really very powerful.

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:54.220
And I'm wondering whether the Syria
case, you know and the Rwanda case,

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.530
as awful as the humanitarian
issue was,

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:00.110
some people would say it was a
stretch to say that interests were

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:02.830
at stake, even though you
and I might agree they were.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.640
But here in Syria,
we have a situation

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:10.740 position:56%
where the awful humanitarian
situation has impacted, as you said,

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.630
the stability of many
states in the region.

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:14.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Even the E.U.

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And that of course to Europe now.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.980
And so anybody who would
say, "Well, you know,

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.770
that's a really terrible thing.

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:24.680
It's just about you know,
values," could there possibly be

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.950
and maybe a way towards the end of
your book to say that these really,

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.820
in a globalized, interconnected
world, that the dichotomy

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:35.850 position:56%
between interests and ideals, really
holds up less, and there's more

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.150
of a kind of cross-connection
between them?

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
I fully agree with that.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:45.310
I certainly don't want to make
it as if the whole response

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.070
to my argument today
is all about ethics

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:50.060
and self-interest has
nothing to do with it.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.310
I do think that there are
real self-interests involved.

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.280
I mean, it's not only
what's happening.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:01.210
I mean, if this crisis with
the Syrian refugees leads

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.150
to the disintegration
of the European Union,

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.080
I mean that's really
serious business.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.160
I mean the European Union has
been the source of peace in Europe

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.960
for the last -- since
the Second World War,

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.070
or the Union more recently.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:21.630
But we don't want to repeat
World War I and World War II,

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.670
and finding ways to prevent that is

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.980
in our self-interest,
it seems to me.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.730
Now that's not the only
self-interested people.

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:32.910
The response to the whole
Middle Eastern situation,

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:36.140
if this Syria crisis
flows over and --

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.030
into other regions of
the Middle East, if --

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.420
especially if we weren't producing
cheap oil the way we are right now

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.520
because of fracking, which
raises another whole question,

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.960
but we'll deal with
fracking another day.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.320
But there is a self-interest
involved

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.360
in keeping peace in these regions.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.440
And that means responding
to these crises.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.050
So I think they go together.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:02.720
The other thing is that from
a normative point of view,

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.340
this probably comes from
Catholic background rather

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:10.640
than from another approach,
I'm not entirely sure

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:16.110
that drawing a sharp
distinction between self-interest

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.840
and purely altruistic
other interest,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.850
is a legitimate way
to think about ethics.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:30.900
I think my well-being and
other's well-being are inherently

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.780
interconnected with each other.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.810
That goes back to Aristotle,
talking about the fact

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:38.630
that a human being
is a social being.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:43.460
We are interdependent on each
other, throughout our whole lives.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:49.660
So to think of a pure self-interest
that's totally dissociated

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.940
from any concern for others,
doesn't make sense in terms

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.690
of the kind of being we are.

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:58.410
We're not little atoms,
separated from each other.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:02.730
And the growing globalization
and interdependence economically

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:07.190
and culturally and politically
makes that even more obvious today,

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.920
than it would have
been some time ago.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.950
So I'm very much in
agreement with your direction.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:13.910
Yes?

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.210
&gt;&gt; Hello, David.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.510
I'm Jim Lund [phonetic].

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:17.810
I'm now with [inaudible].

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach: Hi, Jim.

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:20.410
Good to see you.

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:21.710
&gt;&gt; Good to see you.

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.180
Let me just say that the first time
I heard you lecture was in 1977.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.710
And I still remember what you said.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:27.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Well, that's amazing.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:29.170
I don't.

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:31.970
&gt;&gt; And so I thought I'd wander up
Capitol Hill to hear you today.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:35.760
So thank you very much for your
insights and wisdom here today.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.050
I didn't hear you talk
much about last resort.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.850
Now, I think the situation
in South Sudan,

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:44.680 position:56%
the situation in Syria is
self-evidently, we're in a situation

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.650
of last resort with the millions
of people that are affected.

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.500
But could you talk a
little bit about that

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.260
from a philosophical framework too?

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.300
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach: Well,
I think that probably touches

00:58:54.300 --> 00:59:00.250
on what Tom Weiss calls
"feasibility" also.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.870
Certainly, last resort is invoked
in the Just War Tradition to say,

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:11.720
you don't start using force

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.210
if you could take another
initiative diplomatically

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.410
that would solve the problem
without the use of armed force.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:21.190
I mean it follows from
the fact that the use

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:24.720
of armed force involves
killing people.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.550
And you don't do that if you really
take seriously the Thou Shalt Not

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:36.150
Kill commandment, unless it's the
only way to protect innocent people

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:39.970
from being killed, and that means
last resort comes into play there.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:46.680
So finding steps that would take
action to -- I mentioned Kenya.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:51.720 position:56%
Kenya is an example of a diplomatic
implementation of the responsibility

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:56.700
to protect that did not
involve the use of armed force.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.500
Following the election there,
it looked like Kenya was going

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.250
to fall apart into an ethnic war.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:07.460
The major ethnic groups of Kenya
have been divided for a long time.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.890
It felt very much like
-- it looked like that,

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:15.700
and that's why there was a sense
that we've got to do something

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.990
to prevent another Rwanda.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:20.560
That was Kofi Annan's position.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.260 position:56%
And Kofi Annan had been the Director

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.490
of Peacekeeping Operations
during the Rwanda genocide,

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.430
which led him to be very sensitive
to this, because he had failed

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:34.760
to take the action needed in Rwanda
to prevent what happened there.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.420
So, he took action, but it
was not military action.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:43.050
And I think to say, that's
a good example of the use

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:47.150
of force should be only in the
last resort, if you can find ways

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.870
to take those diplomatic maneuvers
that will solve the problem

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.980
and protect people, do it.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.960
Don't intervene militarily.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.640 position:56%
Now, in Syria, I think we've
probably reached the point of saying

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:07.110
that if we could militarily
intervene, and do so,

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.820
there's another criterion

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:14.360
of Just War Theory called
Reasonable Hope of Success.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.180
You don't want to intervene
militarily

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.870
if you don't have a good
hope that it's going

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.500
to make the situation better.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.690
The fear is that a military
intervention by the United States

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:27.440
in Syria today would
make the situation worse.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.210
And that's where I think, last
resort, as well as Reasonable Hope

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:35.640 position:56%
of Success may point to saying,
we've got to take other steps to try

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.840
to move in a new direction.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.760
I don't know what those are.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.830
I know Secretary Kerry has
been really working hard on it,

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:46.300
and he's taken some steps that
have moved in the right direction,

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.830
but we're way far removed
from where we are.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:53.820 position:56%
I do think our remaining obligation
is to make sure we do something more

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.920
to help all these people
who are being displaced.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.190
These millions of Syrian refugees.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:02.300
Anyway, I'm just thinking
out loud about this.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.910
I'm not answering the question,

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:08.050
because I don't think there's a
clear answer to the Syrian question

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:09.350
that sound -- that looks

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:13.770
so perfectly beautiful
and solves the problem.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:15.070
Yes, sir?

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:23.280
&gt;&gt; I want to compliment you
on a brilliant talk first.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Oh well, thank you so much.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.960
I'm very grateful.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.770
&gt;&gt; But I also want to
introduce a new thought here.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:37.860
My slogan for 2016-17 is that
we cannot afford war any longer.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.990
Now just think about that.

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:47.800
Every country in the world
seems to be consumed with debt,

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.730
consumed with other projects that
are worthwhile, so I want to think

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:58.850
about the thought, well we
can't afford war anymore.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:02.710
And it's a Catholic idea
that all need each other.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:06.340
Now I'm in the oil business,
so I know what the price

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:11.880
of oil dropping is, but I also
think it's good for the world too.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:19.330 position:56%
And so -- but on the other hand, the
last time Reagan dropped the price

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:22.630
of oil in a war with the Saudi --

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:29.490
the Russians, 3,000 independent
oil companies went out of business.

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:32.210
I used to be a bank
director and I will predict,

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.590
a lot of oil companies,
small oil companies,

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.240
will go out of business again.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:44.400
Now, what's that got to
do with the price of eggs?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.370
I say that if we can't
afford war anymore,

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.150
then we ought to be
talking about that.

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:56.610
And from a religious point
of view, we've been talking

01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:57.930
about that for centuries.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.150
So, just want to throw
that out as a thought.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.520
Thank you.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Thank you very much

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:13.330
and I'm certainly very much in
agreement with finding alternatives

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:18.640
to war is a very, extremely
important step.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.530
I've been challenged by some of
my colleagues in the ethics area

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.740
for saying that I still
hold the possibility

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.040
of some legitimate
use of armed force.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.080
Some people want to say it's
totally unacceptable today.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.620
The only thing that
has led me to not move

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:42.040
in that direction is having
spent some time in Rwanda

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.270
and having seen the aftermath
of what happened there,

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.940
which could have been prevented.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.810
General Romeo Dallaire who was
the Canadian General in charge

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:56.160
of the Rwandan peacekeeping troops,

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.780
said that if he had had 5,000
more peacekeeping troops,

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.520
he could have saved 300,000 lives.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.270
Well, that use of armed force, I'm
in favor of, if you can do that.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:12.320
So, but that's not
the same as the kind

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.940
of war we've got in Syria today.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.240
That's for sure.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:20.220
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: I think
we have time for one more?

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.520
&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.140
I'm Ronald Wilson with Social
Security Administration.

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:29.460
The question I have is do you ever
envision a scenario in the future

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:34.790
when all nations would be
stable and that the burden of R

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:38.680
to P would be adhered
to by all nations

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.980
so that there would not be a
flow of refugees, or do you think

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.700
because of the history of
humanity that the burden of R

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.020
to P will always be on the
international community?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. David Hollenbach:
Well, I would love to think

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:53.680
that we could move
in that direction.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.710
I'm not enormously hopeful
that we're getting there.

01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:02.760
I do think that there's likely to
be some continuing serious conflict

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.840
and that's one of the
reasons why I have argued

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.000 position:56%
for why we have these positive
duties to take action to help people

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.270
who are facing these
crisis situations.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.810
Negatively, I would like to
think we could get people

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:21.310
to be serious enough about
adhering to the Geneva Conventions

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.720
and the U.N. Charter and so forth,

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.710
that we wouldn't have
these kinds of conflicts.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:35.670
But the fact that I'm not
expecting that to happen real soon,

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:40.600
is a reason why I've -- arguing
for some of these positive duties

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.660
to respond when crises do emerge.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:49.460
I do think that we have to
press much more strongly

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:54.310
for these implementation of some
of these international standards.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:58.220
And I think that the United States
has been contributing to that,

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.980
but we have not always stayed --

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.950
we haven't stayed in harmony
with the Geneva Conventions

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.350
in what we've done with
torture, for example.

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:11.220
There have been some really serious
problems there, and that's --

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.290
you can make a very strong case

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:18.410 position:56%
that the U.S. has violated the
Geneva Conventions regarding torture

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:20.280
of Common Article 3.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.290
But anyway, my hope is that
we can move in that direction,

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.740
but if you're asking me
to make a prediction,

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.640
I'm not really predicting that
it's going to happen tomorrow.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.690
But maybe over the -- the
creation of new structures

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:37.750
of international governance is
really important in this regard.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.270
And I think that's where the
International Criminal Court is a

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.070
step in the right direction.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.810
Far from complete, but it's a step.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:49.860
So I'd hope to see we can move
further in that direction.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.170
So.

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.680
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Thank you.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.850
Thank you again, and
please, would you join me
