00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.820
I guess there are at least two aspects

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830
I guess there are at least two aspects
 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.250
I guess there are at least two aspects
to his situation that have caught the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260
to his situation that have caught the
 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.100
to his situation that have caught the
public's attention one is the whole

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110
public's attention one is the whole
 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.019
public's attention one is the whole
issue of whether or not someone of his

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
issue of whether or not someone of his
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.220
issue of whether or not someone of his
prominence was given special attention

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230
prominence was given special attention
 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.120
prominence was given special attention
in terms of access to a liver and the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130
in terms of access to a liver and the
 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.420
in terms of access to a liver and the
other has to do with the indication for

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430
other has to do with the indication for
 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.420
other has to do with the indication for
his liver transplantation now with

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430
his liver transplantation now with
 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.500
his liver transplantation now with
regard to the former let me say that the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
regard to the former let me say that the
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.270
regard to the former let me say that the
distribution system for solid organs has

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280
distribution system for solid organs has
 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.590
distribution system for solid organs has
advanced particularly livers has

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600
advanced particularly livers has
 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.459
advanced particularly livers has
advanced tremendously to a more fair

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469
advanced tremendously to a more fair
 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.299
advanced tremendously to a more fair
more fair and equitable system with the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309
more fair and equitable system with the
 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.630
more fair and equitable system with the
evolution of the Mel system of scoring

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640
 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.060
so the the the the system allocates

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
so the the the the system allocates
 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.270
so the the the the system allocates
organs based on generally on the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280
organs based on generally on the
 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
organs based on generally on the
severity of the liver disease it's

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290
severity of the liver disease it's
 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.490
severity of the liver disease it's
organized on a regional basis some areas

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500
organized on a regional basis some areas
 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.290
organized on a regional basis some areas
of the country have better access to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300
of the country have better access to
 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.730
of the country have better access to
more livers than other areas of the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
more livers than other areas of the
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.130
more livers than other areas of the
country now according to the press he

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140
country now according to the press he
 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.080
country now according to the press he
got his transplant in Tennessee and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
got his transplant in Tennessee and
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.990
got his transplant in Tennessee and
based on what I know the availabilities

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000
based on what I know the availabilities
 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.600
based on what I know the availabilities
of livers in Tennessee might be better

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610
of livers in Tennessee might be better
 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.310
of livers in Tennessee might be better
than say on either coast if that was the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
than say on either coast if that was the
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920
than say on either coast if that was the
case there's nothing inappropriate about

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930
case there's nothing inappropriate about
 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.200
case there's nothing inappropriate about
that there's no there's not there's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210
that there's no there's not there's
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.550
that there's no there's not there's
nothing

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
nothing
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.830
nothing
he wasn't gaming a system in any way

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840
he wasn't gaming a system in any way
 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.410
he wasn't gaming a system in any way
many people will will it will have

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420
many people will will it will have
 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.180
many people will will it will have
themselves listed in more than one

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190
themselves listed in more than one
 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.820
themselves listed in more than one
region in an attempt to get access to a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
region in an attempt to get access to a
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.700
region in an attempt to get access to a
liver so III think that that that's how

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
liver so III think that that that's how
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.860
liver so III think that that that's how
I would comment on that aspect of with

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870
I would comment on that aspect of with
 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.210
I would comment on that aspect of with
regard to the indication yeah you know

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220
regard to the indication yeah you know
 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.310
regard to the indication yeah you know
again it's not clear what is original to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320
again it's not clear what is original to
 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.130
again it's not clear what is original to
yet a pancreatic tumor there there there

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140
yet a pancreatic tumor there there there
 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.749
yet a pancreatic tumor there there there
there are a number of different kinds of

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
there are a number of different kinds of
 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.150
there are a number of different kinds of
pancreatic tumors the most common is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
pancreatic tumors the most common is
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.430
pancreatic tumors the most common is
what's called an adenocarcinoma of the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440
what's called an adenocarcinoma of the
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.229
what's called an adenocarcinoma of the
pancreas and this is a devastating

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239
pancreas and this is a devastating
 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.220
pancreas and this is a devastating
disease with a very poor prognosis that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
disease with a very poor prognosis that
 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.100
disease with a very poor prognosis that
has a 5-year survival in general

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110
has a 5-year survival in general
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.860
has a 5-year survival in general
less than 5% it would be highly highly

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
less than 5% it would be highly highly
 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.100
less than 5% it would be highly highly
unlikely that that was the kind of tumor

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
unlikely that that was the kind of tumor
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.980
unlikely that that was the kind of tumor
that he had or that anyone would

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990
that he had or that anyone would
 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.720
that he had or that anyone would
consider a liver transplant for that

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
consider a liver transplant for that
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.120
consider a liver transplant for that
kind of a tumor when the tumor went to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
kind of a tumor when the tumor went to
 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.910
kind of a tumor when the tumor went to
the liver so the likelihood is that he

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
the liver so the likelihood is that he
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.100
the liver so the likelihood is that he
had some type of a neuroendocrine tumor

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110
had some type of a neuroendocrine tumor
 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.590
had some type of a neuroendocrine tumor
which are generally slow growing tumors

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600
which are generally slow growing tumors
 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.080
which are generally slow growing tumors
and the likelihood is from what I've

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
and the likelihood is from what I've
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270
and the likelihood is from what I've
read that that the tumor was resected

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
read that that the tumor was resected
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.180
read that that the tumor was resected
but probably had metastasized to the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
but probably had metastasized to the
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.730
but probably had metastasized to the
liver and that that was the indication

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740
liver and that that was the indication
 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.229
liver and that that was the indication
for a liver transplant and and in fact

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239
for a liver transplant and and in fact
 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.010
for a liver transplant and and in fact
at many centers a transplant for a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020
at many centers a transplant for a
 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.140
at many centers a transplant for a
neuroendocrine tumor that's metastasized

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
neuroendocrine tumor that's metastasized
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.390
neuroendocrine tumor that's metastasized
to the lizard liver is considered

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400
to the lizard liver is considered
 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.390
to the lizard liver is considered
appropriate
