00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.960
 I moved from the United States to Singapore about two years ago. 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.320
 One of the most important reasons for my transition was spending more time with my mom. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.600
 At that time, I met with my co-founder Lilly as well. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
 We were going through the same phase of our lives 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.640
 We would have spent more time with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640
 Our parents and relatives are older. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 Our design solution provides excellent home care 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.800
 To allow for independent living at home. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.600
 We thought that Lilly's previous experience could be integrated into healthcare 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.000
 With my previous experience in business and technology 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920
 To provide this improved experience in home care. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760
 When the health of older people worsens 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.000
 They will not want to go to the hospital 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 Loss of control over their lives. 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.360
 They all want to take care of the home. 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 The Homage application provides access 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.050
 For people who need care for them and their loved ones. 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.600
 My work starts at 9 am and ends at 6.30 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.320
 So my mother will be alone during my working hours. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.440
 She told me she could not take care of herself 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.720
 In things like bathing, dressing and cooking. 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.520
 "Cali" was selected through Homage as a mother care specialist. 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.120
 She is very friendly and tells me 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.110
 "Do not worry, go to your work and take care of it." 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.700
 "Cali" also took some pictures 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.260
 To know what I gave my mother 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.940
 That was very comfortable. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 I can tell what happens to my mom anytime and anywhere. 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 The latest Start on Android software is a big difference in the development of our mobile app. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.810
 The program has contributed to our growth and our experience to users. 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 All the discussions were about 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 How to improve this experience 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.310
 Either in a multi-dimensional design, or in UI / UX. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 The program was helping us look at the command from a user perspective. 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 One of the benefits of signing up for the Start On Android program 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.240
 To show us our apps on the Play Store recently. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.720
 It was very nice to get this support not just from the wonderful support team 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 But also members of a technical community like Google Play. 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 I recommend that other startups join Start on Android. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.920
 Where you will benefit greatly from external comments. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.200
 Often you can develop independently 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.880
 And get expert advice on aspects that need improvement. 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.560
 It can speed up the way these improvements are offered to users. 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.040
 We aspire to build a large community of caregivers 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 Trainers who are happy to help anyone. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.640
 Using the Homage application, you'll get help with a single click. 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.760
 Older people will not worry about aging after knowing that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.280
 A helping hand will always protect them.
