00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.380
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today, we're talking about free speech.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.420
Other Craig: Finally, today we can let loose
and establish the kinds of things we can say

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.759
to criticize our government, like the crazy
idea that money and speech are the same thing.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.490
Other Other Craig: Not so fast, Clone, the
Supreme Court has ruled that spending money,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.730
at least in the political context, is speech.
You do have the right to criticize that decision

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.390
though. Unless your boss or YouTube says that
you can't.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.000
Craig: All right, we're trying to talk about
free speech, shut up. Let's get started and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.380
see if we can figure out what the limits of
free speech are, assuming that there are some.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.660
Other Other Craig: There aren't.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.440
Craig: That's a lie. But I'm free to say that.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.360
Craig: There are two really important things
to remember about the First Amendment protection

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.309
of free speech. The primary reason we have
freedom of speech is to allow for public criticism

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.030
of the stupid government. Stupid government.
That's the sort of thing that can land you

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.739
in jail in countries that don't have strong
free speech protections, or should I say,

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.339
you would be Putin jail, heh, don't put me
in jail. Oh, that's right, I'm in the US, it doesn't matter.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.310
The stories of oversensitive kings and dictators
silencing people who question their rule or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.280
even make jokes at their expense are too numerous
to recount, but for the most part, that kinda

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.290
thing doesn't happen in the US, which is why
no one gets arrested for carrying around a

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.299
giant picture of Obama as Hitler, or former
President Bush as a monkey. Well, that's stuff's

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.759
okay, as far as the First Amendment is concerned,
but that doesn't mean it's respectful or in

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.860
good taste. The second thing to remember is
that the First Amendment protects you from

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.310
the government doing things that try to deny
your speech, but not anyone else. What this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.330
means is that you don't have an absolute right
to say whatever you want, wherever you want,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.030
to whomever you want and not suffer any
consequences. Isn't that right, Stan, you dingus?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.100
I'm fired?
I was just kidding; it was a joke.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.220
If you work for a private company, your boss
can certainly fire you for saying mean things

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.820
about them or revealing company secrets, and you
don't have any First Amendment claim against them.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.040
Unless, of course, your boss is the government,
or a branch of the government, in which case,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.840
you might be able to claim a First Amendment
right. See, like most things, it's complicated.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.659
Among the speech that is protected, not all
of it has the same level of protection under

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.439
the First Amendment. Now, let's exercise our
right to free Thought Bubble. The speech that

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.040
gets the strongest protection is political
speech. Criticism of, but also praise for

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.619
particular officials, their parties, or their
policies is usually protected. It's given

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.450
what is called preferred position, which means
that any law or regulation or executive act

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.980
that limits political speech is almost always
struck down by courts. The big case that made

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.970
pretty much the final decision on political
speech was Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1968. In

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.650
this case, a Ku Klux Klan leader was making
a speech that, as you can imagine, was offensive

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.010
to a lot of people and could have been considered
threatening, too. The court ruled that because

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.400
the speech was political, it was protected
by the First Amendment, no matter how outrageous

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.260
it was. The court said, "The Constitutional
guarantees of free speech and free press do

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.290
not permit a state to forbid or proscribe
advocacy of the use of force or law violation

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.090
except where such advocacy is directed to
inciting or producing imminent action and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.209
is likely to produce such action." According
to the court, the First Amendment protects

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.250
speech even if it advocates the use of force
or encourages people to violate the law. So

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.000
you can advocate overthrowing the government
or not paying your taxes as much as you want,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.879
unless what you say is likely to produce the
thing you're advocating. Overthrowing the

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.450
government, say. And it is likely to happen
imminently, meaning very soon after you make

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.810
the statement. This case limited an older
standard regarding free speech that was put

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.670
forward in the case US v. Schenck in 1917.
In that case, Schenck distributed pamphlets

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
urging people to avoid the draft for World
War I. This was a violation of the Espionage

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.159
Act, which made it a crime to obstruct the
draft or the war effort. The law was more

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.739
complicated than that, but that's the basic
gist. In his decision on this case, Oliver

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.379
Wendell Holmes wrote that, "When that speech
presents a clear and present danger, the state

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.879
can then abridge that person's speech." Memorably,
he explained that the First Amendment does

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.349
not protect a person who shouts "fire" in
a crowded theater. In later cases, Holmes

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.830
limited this idea, largely because it gives
the government a lot of leeway to say what

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.459
kind of speech creates danger, especially
during a war, as was the case with Schenck.

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.760
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.140
Political speech isn't the only type of speech
that the courts have addressed. Symbolic speech

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560
can also be protected by the First Amendment,
and if that symbolic speech has political

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.739
content, it usually is protected. Symbolic
speech includes wearing armbands, carrying

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.830
signs, or even wearing a jacket with an obscene
word directed at the military draft. Symbolic

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.879
speech also includes burning an American flag,
which pretty much is always a political message.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.340
Not all symbolic speech is protected, though.
For example, if you're a high school student

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.459
who holds up a banner that reads, "Bong hits
4 Jesus" at a school-sponsored function, don't

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.330
expect that the First Amendment will prevent
the school, a government agent, from suspending

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.410
you. And yes, that really happened. Also,
this is not symbolic speech. That's violence.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.060
Even hate speech is protected. Even if it's
really hateful, like burning a cross on a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.530
person's lawn, although this might be prosecuted
as vandalism or trespassing. Public universities

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.340
that try to punish hate speech have seen their
discipline code struck down. Commercial speech

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.220
might not be protected, but if it's a political
commercial, it will be, and as we've pointed

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.160
out before, spending money on political campaigns
has been determined to be speech that is protected

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.900
by the First Amendment, although we shall
see donations to political campaigns are still

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.500
treated differently, at least for now.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.930
Pretty much the only kind of speech that's
not protected, other than speech that's likely

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.900
to incite immediate violence, is what's called
fightin' words. In the actual case that dealt

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.680
with fighting words, Chaplinsky v New Hampshire,
the defendant uttered what seemed more like

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.440
insults than a call to engage in fisticuffs.
What'd you call me? Still, the court ruled

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.960
that some words were so insulting that they
were more than likely to result in a fight,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.380
so fighting words are not protected speech.
One thing to note, though, the fighting words

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.280
free speech exception is almost never used.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.360
So as you can see, the First Amendment pretty
much protects you from the government throwing

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.210
you in jail or otherwise punishing you for
what you say in most instances, but it's important

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.780
to remember than the First Amendment is not
unlimited. Most important, it only protects

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.710
you from government action, not the action
of private people, especially your employers.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.190
One final example might make this clear. In
Pickering v. Board of Education, a public

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.500
school teacher wrote a letter to the editor
of his local paper complaining about the way

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.539
that the school board was spending money on
the schools. He didn't write it on school

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.169
time or using school paper or email, especially
since it was 1968 and there was no email.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.039
The school board, or his principal, fired
him. He brought the case to the Supreme Court,

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.160
claiming that he was fired for his speech,
which was political in nature criticizing

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.930
local government and not for anything related
to his job performance, and he won. But the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.539
only reason he was able to get his job back
is that his employer was the government, so

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.550
it was the government that punished him for
speaking out. For most of us, complaining

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.430
about our employer's policies may get us fired,
and unless we are government employees, we

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.009
can't claim that it violated our First Amendment
rights. The First Amendment, like all of the

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.199
Amendments, is meant to protect us from an
overreaching government. There are other types

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.729
of laws that help us deal with individuals
who do things that we think are wrong, but

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.650
we'll talk about those in another episode.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.210
Thanks for watching. See ya next time. Mmmph!
Third eagle punch in the video. Is that too

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.389
much? It doesn't matter. I'm free to do it.
