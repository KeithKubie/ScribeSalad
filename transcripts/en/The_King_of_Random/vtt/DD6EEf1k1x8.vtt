00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.929
WazzupðŸ‘…ðŸ¤˜. I'm hanging out in Corpus Christi, Texas with my two brothers. I'm Mark, and I'm Scott!

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.220
Beyond yonder is the Gulf of Mexico right off this side here.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.680
Today we're going to try an experiment, and see if we can turn ocean water into chlorine gas let's jump right in.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.420
So, we just went down to the store and picked up a couple of containers

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.709
We got one of these cereal containers and a couple bottles of Smart Water. The water in here is great

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710
but we don't really need it so we got to find a way to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.120
deplete these bottles because in reality I only bought these things for the bottles themselves.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.180
Yeah! Now we all know that ocean water is very very salty and so the theory here is if we pump electricity into salt water,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.560
It's going to divide the salt NaCL into two elements. Sodium and chlorine. So here's the basic idea for building a simple chlorine generator:

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840
We're going to use our jug here with a couple of water bottles.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.610
We're going to empty these out, flip them upside down, and drill a couple holes in the top so these rest in the container.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.540
We're gonna stick our carb electrodes up inside the bottle and run

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.840
Electricity into them and with a little bit of luck our ocean water we split into two gases; Hydrogen and chlorine. Let's do this.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.560
Let's Rock

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.559
Science all right so our first step is to gather up as much salt water as we can so do the honors right fill this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.780
Container up we're going to take this back to the house and physically modify our container to accept our two water bottles and start pumping electricity!

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.194
(Singing)

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:23.909
Alright, so update guys. We have just about completed this system

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.490
 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.660
We took a utility knife and cut a couple of holes in the top of our container just big enough that our water bottles will push down inside

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.960
We cracked open a six volt lantern battery and extracted these carbon rods, and then we took those carbon Rods

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.110
We shoved them down the necks of these water bottles

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.939
All that's left to do now is take some insulated copper cable wrap it around these carbon electrodes and hook it up to a car battery

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.509
Check it out guys. We've got our bottles prepped

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.449
We've got our carbon electrodes in the necks with the electrical wire connected the black wire we're going to connect to the negative and this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.490
Will Produce hydrogen gas and our positive is going to produce chlorine is it going to work science will tell us?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580
Let's go, hook it up to a car battery

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.260
All right, this is the moment of truth guys

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.480
This is where we connect up the car battery to the system

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.139
And if we've done it properly that when I make this connection the container should start bubbling

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.489
There you go, we got a couple little bubbles

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.139
Nothing super exciting, but I'm getting something in there. That's really weird though

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.790
It's like not bubbling inside the container. It's bubbling on the outside container

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.520
Yeah

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.650
That's not good

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.350
quick update guys we found that these tips of the bottles were actually hindering the process because they weren't letting enough water flow so [we]

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.299
Just ripped them out completely rewrapped the carbon electrodes and just shove them back in the bottles, and it's actually working better

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.669
If you look really closely there you can see with the car running [there] actually is an increased production of hydrogen wow alright

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.760
We're just going to let that sit [for] about half an hour, and then come back to check on it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.079
So we moved our [setup] over here to a rental vehicle and look the solutions turn blue

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.489
I'm thinking that might have something [to] do with our copper wires may be copper wasn't a very good choice

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.619
We check our levels here. You can see we do have a little bit more gas in there. That should be hydrogen

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.620
It's not very much, so this is a very slow process

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.499
Disappointingly there's really not much happening over here. We do have a little bit of gas, but not much all right so update guys

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.779
We're failing I haven't tried this experiment before at home with just the carbon electrodes and a work just fine

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.350
[I] think maybe the copper is messing up the solution very interesting have you seen the solution?

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.369
No, it turned blue take a sniff of that tell me how [it] smells

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.410
You can smell chlorine you can you can smell chlorine in the water?

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.839
Yeah, just in the interest of time I pulled this out

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
This is how much gas we've been able to collect this should be hydrogen. We can confirm that by lighting it off

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.589
Whoa yep, so that's what we got guys. We got hydrogen gas and blue [seawater] yay, whoo Jano guys

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.250
It's the next day

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.580
I've let this thing sit overnight, and you can see the solution has cleared up

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.790
And we've got a blue precipitate that settled down to the bottom now

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.869
I talked to my friend nurdrage and asked him if he could explain a little bit about what might be going on here and this

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.179
Is what he said in the electrolysis of saltwater copper electrodes actually get attacked to form Copper chloride?

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.420
And if we're using copper electrodes and eventually the ph of the solution will get so high [that] it'll start forming copper hydroxide which is

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.220
The blue precipitate that we saw in our solution

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.540
so it sounds like what I need to do now is go back to the drawing board rig up a very very simple system for

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.519
Using only the carbon electrodes for splitting salt water into hydrogen and chlorine gas [it] is going to work

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.339
But that's going to be experiment for another video according to nurdrage

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.790
We're not going to get much, but we should get something and there's a whole lot of salt water in the ocean

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.029
So we've got plenty of resources to tap into so our failed experiment isn't fruitless after all by running electricity through seawater

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.399
We've actually generated four really cool components

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.220
We've made hydrogen gas which is extremely flammable sodium hydroxide which can be use as a cleaning agent or for making soap?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.970
We've made a solution of bleach which can be used for cleaning and purifying and some

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.099
[for] hydroxide that has a lot of uses as well [electronics] dyeing clothes and paper

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.760
It's used as a fire retardant for flame proofing materials printing photocopying

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.870
pyrotechnics and even as a wood preservative

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.659
[so] there's a lot of uses for copper hydroxide so guys we're gonna have to put this experiment on pause [for] today

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.689
We're going to figure it out and come [back] with a solution in another video

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.330
so

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.590
