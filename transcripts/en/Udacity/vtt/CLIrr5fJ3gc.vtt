00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.870
Let's zoom in a bit on this idea, and

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.660
see how it plays out in a bit more detailed code example.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.630
Start by considering this function that takes two positional parameters and

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.010
makes no mention of the keyword this at all.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.720
Looking at the code you see here,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.470
what do you expect to be bound to the second positional parameter named "two"?

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.600
Fill in what you think it might be.
