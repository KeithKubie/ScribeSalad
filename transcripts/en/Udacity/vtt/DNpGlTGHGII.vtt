00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.330
Starting from the pseudo code from the hint video, and get

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.005
set to the credit card number. Sum is set to 0. Count

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.960
is also set to 0, and that's an int. And now

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.224
for the tricky part, for each digit in n starting from the

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.474
right. So I need to use the parts of this while

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:20.316
loop that correspond to that. So I'll keep while n is greater

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:23.046
than 0 and n equals n over 10. And I need

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:26.230
to actually get the digit so that I can add it. But

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.640
I don't just want to add the digit to the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.940
sum. I only want to do that if count is

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.390
odd and I need to increment count. So count

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.260
plus, plus. And if count is odd then add digit

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.132
to the sum. But count is odd is not quite Java yet. If count mod 2 is 1

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:47.553
then count is odd. And instead of printing the

00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:51.470
sum, I'll return it. And if I run the tester,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.610
so far so good. I don't see any evidence that I made mistakes.
