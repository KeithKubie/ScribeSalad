00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.920
In the last video, we saw that
amines are actually reasonably

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.090
decent nucleophiles.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.420
And, in particular, we saw some
ethylamine attack some

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.320
bromoethane in an
Sn2 reaction.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.500
And right after that happened,
we had some diethylammonium

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
because the nitrogen had given
away an electron to this

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.460
carbon right over here.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.120
So it had a positive charge.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.530
And so you had diethylammonium
bromide.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.730
The bromine had left,
taking an electron.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.300
It then had a negative charge.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.630
And then we said that that
could actually be in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.740
equilibrium, where another
ethylamine goes and takes a

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.790
hydrogen from the
diethylammonium and turns that

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.020
into diethylamine.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.240
So we essentially had a primary
amine turn into, or I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.620
guess you could say, converted
into a secondary amine.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.270
Now, the one thing that might
have popped into your brain

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.450
near the end of that video is,
hey, isn't this also a good

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.700
nucleophile?

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.370
And you say look, it's
got this lone pair.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.140
It's more electronegative
than the things

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.090
that it's bonded with.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.220
Maybe this too could do a
nucleophile attack or maybe

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.310
some type of an Sn2 reaction.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.060
And you would be correct.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.120
So you could imagine, if you
have some more bromoethane

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.420
hanging around-- let me draw
some more bromoethane.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.820
So let me draw it like this.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.750
So this is our bromo group.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.740
And then let's say we have a
hydrogen above like that.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.600
That's kind of upside down
from the last one we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.690
did, but same idea.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.390
Then we have another hydrogen
behind, just like that.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.140
And this is obviously
a carbon.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.010
You could imagine that now you
have this diethylamine.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.660
It can have an Sn2 reaction
with the bromoethane.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.810
So before it was just
the ethylamine.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.960
Now it's the diethylamine
that's acting as a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.250
nucleophile.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.370
So this electron right here in
yellow could be given to this

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:15.780
carbon right at the same time
that this bromine leaves and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.800
takes that electron.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.400
And the bromine already had one,
two, three, four, five,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.250
six, seven valence electrons.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.640
And this is really almost
identical to what happened in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.360
the previous video, except now
we are starting with a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.700
secondary amine, and we're going
to see it's going to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.180
turn into a tertiary amine, as
opposed to the last one, where

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.820
we started with a primary
amine and turned into a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.830
secondary amine.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.640
So what's this going
to look like after

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100
we've done the attack?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.120
So the bromine will have left.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.170
It's now the bromide anion.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.970
So now we have the
bromide anion.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.790
It has its seven original
valence electrons and now it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.200
took one more electron
from the carbon.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.140
It now has a negative charge.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.040
And now this ethane group right
here-- so this carbon

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.950
right here is this carbon right
over here-- is now going

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.260
to be attached-- let me
draw it this way.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.010
It's now going to be attached
to this nitrogen.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.420
So this yellow electron is now
attached to that carbon, and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.950
it's bonded to that green
electron, which on the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.250
nitrogen or that the
nitrogen has.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.670
And then this nitrogen has two
other ethyl groups attached to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.230
it, one, two, and then it also
has this hydrogen over here.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.950
And because this nitrogen gave
away an electron, it now has a

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.360
positive charge.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.740
And I didn't draw these two
hydrogens here on this carbon;

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.250
they're implicit.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.070
I could draw them.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.190
One hydrogen, one hydrogen,
and then another hydrogen.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.020
But just to keep things simple,
I'm going to leave it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.210
off, just so it becomes
very clear

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.000
that we now have triethyl.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.900
Let me make this clear.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.720
So we have one, two three
ethyl groups.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.060
So now this is triethyl
and it's a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.550
positively charged nitrogen.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.480
It's bonded to four things.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.290
And essentially, it has given
away an electron, so this is

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.540
triethylammonium.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.650
And if you view it as being
an ionic compound with the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.550
bromide, then you would call
this triethylammonium bromide,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.650
which this would be the salt
version, the ionic compound

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.990
right there.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.920
But we have our
triethylammonium, and then you

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.240
could imagine, we had
that ethylamine

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.680
floating around before.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.080
If you still have enough of
that ethylamine floating

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.420
around-- so let me draw some
of that ethylamine.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.680
Ethylamine looks like this.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800
It has two hydrogens.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.425
It has a lone pair.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:08.070
It has a slightly partially
negative charge right here.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.390
Nitrogen is very
electronegative.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.640
It's the most basic of the
neutral functional groups that

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.450
we've studied.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.610
It might want to capture this
hydrogen proton, so it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.730
captures it by giving
it its electron.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.780
And then that electron that
was associated with that

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.025
hydrogen atom is now given
back to this nitrogen.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.100
And now, once again, I'll draw
this as being in equilibrium.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.520
I'll do this in equilibrium
because one could swipe the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.390
hydrogen from the other.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:46.540
But now this guy over here
becomes ethylammonium.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.450
So I'll draw-- so this is
what he was before.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.250
And now he's bonded
to this hydrogen.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.990
So now he's bonded to this
green hydrogen over here.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.490
Let me make this green
just here.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.160
So that's ethylammonium.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.470
And we saw this in the last
video: ethylammonium.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.130
And then this guy right over
here, and, of course, you have

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.180
the bromide floating around, but
this guy over here now is

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.080
just a nitrogen bonded
to three ethyl

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.680
groups: one, two, three.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.130
It lost its hydrogen, gained
an electron, so it's now

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.310
neutral again.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.915
And so this guy is
triethylamine.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.480
And since he gained that
electron, he had an electron

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.170
here, an electron there, so this
is the electron that he

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.760
already had and that magenta
electron he gets back, and he

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.180
has a lone pair.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.130
So you might say, hey Sal, but
couldn't this guy, couldn't

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.240
triethylamine act as
a nucleophile?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.650
And you would be right.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.430
So the triethylamine, if you
still have some of that

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:59.800
bromoethane hanging around--
so let me draw some

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.860
bromoethane.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.330
And obviously, there's
some hydrogen here.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.860
There is some hydrogen here.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.610
If you have some more of that
bromoethane hanging around,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.040
this guy could then attack that
bromoethane and then you

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.050
would be left with-- what
would that look like?

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.400
Let me do it in that
same color.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.030
So in that green color,
you have the nitrogen.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.740
It has its three original ethane
groups or ethyl groups

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.510
that's attached to it.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.900
It has this electron.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.040
But it's now bonded to this
carbon over here.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.920
And let me be very clear.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.100
This was an Sn2 reaction.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.330
So right when it attacks that
carbon, this bromine, and we

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.580
saw this multiple times, can
take that other electron from

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.970
the carbon, and so this becomes
another bromide anion.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.060
I'm going a little bit faster
than I've done in the past

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.650
because we've seen this many,
many, many, many times.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.670
And now this guy is attached
to this ethyl group.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.210
So this ethyl group I could
just draw like this.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.090
He gave this carbon, this
magenta electron there, and so

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.080
we have this new bond.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.400
And I could also draw
the hydrogens.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.090
We have this hydrogen
and this hydrogen.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.530
We could draw them off like
this, hydrogen and hydrogen,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.500
but that makes the drawing a
little bit more confusing.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.950
But what just happened?

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.200
This guy gave away
an electron.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.900
Let me make it clear.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.510
He gave away an electron so he
has now a positive charge.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.690
You have the bromine turned
into bromide.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.840
It took an electron.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.559
But what is this now?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.174
This is tetraethylammonium.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.780
So we have four.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:48.110
It's a quaternary ammonium.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:54.400
So this is tetra, tetra for
four: one, two, three, four.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.650
Tetraethylammonium.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.910
Ammonium, instead of amine,
because it has

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.170
that positive charge.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.610
The nitrogen has four bonds.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.270
It's given away an electron.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.980
Tetraethylammonium, and then if
you view it as a salt with

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.630
the bromide anion, it's
tetraethylammonium bromide.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.230
So the whole point of this video
and the last video is--

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.490
in the last video, I just wanted
to show you that an

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.235
amine, it's reasonably basic.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:25.590
It can act as a nucleophile,
and show you how it would

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.770
react, show you the mechanism.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.220
But what I wanted to show you
in this video is that that

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.780
reaction just keeps going.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.450
And so when you start with the
original ingredients, when you

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.580
started with the ethylamine and
the bromoethane, you might

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.720
say, oh, this is
pretty simple.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.940
You're just going to end
up with a little bit of

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.300
diethylamine.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.140
But the reality is you're going
to end up with all of

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.560
this stuff.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.600
It's going to be all mixed up
in every different way.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.520
You're going to end up with some
diethylamine in there.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.440
You're going to have some
ethylamine in there.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.980
You're going to have some
ammonium in there.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.110
You'll have some
triethylammonium in there.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.530
You'll have some
ethylammonium.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.010
in there.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.815
You're going to have a little
bit of everything.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.050
Oh, let me be clear here.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.300
I just want to make
sure I didn't

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.980
misname any of this stuff.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.390
No.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.080
Yes, I think I named it right.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.110
Sometimes I get confused with
the ammoniums and amines.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.170
But the whole point of this is
that this reaction can keep

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.060
going and this Sn2 reaction can
keep occurring in a bunch

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.230
of different ways.
