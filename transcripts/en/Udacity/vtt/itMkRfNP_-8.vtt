00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.360
So, now you have the keys to the castle,
and you've gotten the tour.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.580
You may have noticed, there's kind of
an exclusive wing of the castle that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.630
you do have to pay to get into.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.500
Remember earlier, when we were talking
about predicted traffic time, and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
certain features of the roads API?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.890
We mentioned the Premium Plan.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.120
The Premium Plan is a way for
businesses and users to get access to

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.810
some exclusive features of the API to
enable a larger amount of quota and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.660
to get help from Google's
technical support team.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.550
&gt;&gt; There are a few more things you
get if you become a Premium Plan

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.720
customer as well.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.060
For example more repoints per request
in the direction service request.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.300
More destinations and
origins in distance matrix.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.310
Specific places API data,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.260
not to mention generally higher
queries per second on the services.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.380
And access to more usage analytics.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.410
Check out the page link in
the instructor notes for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.930
the exact usage limits, and
other data on the Premium Plan.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.460
&gt;&gt; We're going to go through
a few situations where,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.340
according to our terms of service, you
must purchase a license to use the APIs.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.680
&gt;&gt; First, if you plan on using
the APIs on an internal domain,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.890
that is not publicly available.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.490
Like for example, if you are a delivery
service that wants to optimize routes

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.620
for your vehicles and
visualize them to run your business.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210
&gt;&gt; Another situation where you
would need to purchase a license

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.850
is if you plan on using the APIs
in some kind of paid service.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.300
For example, if purchasing a product
gets the user access to a site

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.330
that uses the APIs or
if you have a cost to enter that site.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.360
&gt;&gt; Finally,
if you plan on doing asset tracking.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.760
That is, using the Google Map's APIs
to track one or

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.150
more physical objects,
you must be a Premium Plan customer.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.130
&gt;&gt; Again, a general rule of thumb.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.390
If your usage is free for
users, so no fee, and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.290
publicly available to everyone,
no firewall,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.980
you can use the plan available through
your developer project that you created.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.770
Even if you go above the free limit and
enable pay as you go billing.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.570
&gt;&gt; The page in the instructor notes
has more detailed information

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.760
about the Premium Plan benefits and
usage limits.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.710
Now, on your own, take a look at some
more information about the ideas we've

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.630
talked about so far.
