00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.779
- [Voiceover] So we have the graph of an

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:06.779
exponential function here,
and the function is m of x.

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.950
And what I want to do
is figure out what is

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.990
m of six going to be equal to?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.930
And like always, pause the video,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.090
and see if you can work it out.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.710
Well, as I mentioned, this
is an exponential function,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.030
so m is going to take the form.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.880
Let me write it this way.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.069
M of x is going to take the form

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.409
a times r to the xth power,

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.969
where a is our initial power,
and r is our common ratio.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.209
Well the initial value is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.348
It's just going to be what m of zero is.

00:00:39.348 --> 00:00:42.668
So a is going to be equal to m of zero,

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.149
and we can just look at this graph.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.369
When x is equal to zero, the
function is equal to nine.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:51.909
So it's equal to nine, and now we need to

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.720
figure out our common ratio.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.720
So let me set up a little
bit of a table here,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.320
just to help us with this.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.900
So let me draw some straight lines.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.420
And so this is x and m of x.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.220
We already know that when x is zero,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.720
m of x is equal to nine.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
We also know when x is, let's see.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
When x is one, when x
is one, m of x is three.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340
M of x is three.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.860
So when we increase our x by one,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.260
what happened to our m of x?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.340
Well, what did we have to multiply it by?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.120
Well, to go from nine to three,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.960
you multiplied by 1/3.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.780
So that's going to be our common ratio.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.787
And in fact, if we wanted to care what

00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:42.787
m of two is going to be, we
would multiply by 1/3 again.

00:01:43.977 --> 00:01:47.127
And m of two should be equal to one,

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:48.967
and we see that right over here.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.647
M of two is, indeed, equal to one.

00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:54.877
So our common ratio, our common ratio

00:01:54.877 --> 00:01:57.797
right over here is equal to 1/3.

00:01:57.797 --> 00:02:01.437
So m of x, we can write it as, m of x

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:06.437
is going to be equal to
our initial value, a,

00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:11.237
which we already figured it out, as a is,

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:13.815
a is equal to nine, so
it's going to be nine,

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:18.395
times our common ratio,
times our common ratio,

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.495
1/3 to the xth power.

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.535
So I was able to figure out
the formula for our definition

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:28.355
for m of x, but that's not what I wanted.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:30.835
I just wanted to figure out
what m of six is going to be.

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:33.975
So we can write down that m of six,

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:38.095
m of six is going to be nine times

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:41.975
one over three to the sixth power.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.055
Let's see, that is going to be equal to,

00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:47.135
that's the same thing as nine times,

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:49.215
well one to the six is just one.

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:50.695
That's just going to be one to the six,

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:54.015
which is just one, over
three to the sixth power.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:56.335
Now what is three to the sixth power?

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:58.475
In fact, I can even simplify
this a little bit more.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:01.735
I can recognize that
nine is three squared,

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:03.512
so I could say this is going to be

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:05.412
three squared over three to the sixth.

00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:09.585
Three squared over three to the sixth,

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:12.085
and then, I could tackle
this a couple of ways.

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:13.884
I could just divide the
numerator into the denominator

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:16.164
by three squared, in
which case, I would get

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:20.225
one over three to the fourth power.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:21.904
Or another way to think
about it, this should

00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:25.220
be the same thing as three
to the two minus sixth power,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.020
which is the same thing as three
to the negative four power,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.340
which is, of course, the same thing as

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.840
one over three to the fourth.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.580
So what's three to the fourth?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.960
So three squared is nine.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.679
Three to the third is 27.

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.600
Three to the fourth is 81.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.120
So this is going to be
equal to one over 81.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.740
M of six is equal to one over 81.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.040
We could also, we could've done that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.830
if we kept going by our table.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.270
M of three, multiply it by 1/3,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.650
is going to be 1/3.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.190
M of four, multiply by 1/3 again,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.510
is going to be 1/9.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.071
Then we could, m of five is going to be

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:03.883
1/27, and m of six is going to be 181st.
