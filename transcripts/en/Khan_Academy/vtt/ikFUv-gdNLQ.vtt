00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.720
Now that we know how a signal
can spread through a neuron,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.310
through an electrotonic
potential and action

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.950
potential and combinations
of the two, let's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.520
put it all together
by looking again

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.270
at the structure of a neuron,
the anatomy of a neuron,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.020
and thinking about why
it has that anatomy

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.600
and how it all can work.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.460
So we've already talked
about the dendrites

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.570
as being where the
neuron can be stimulated

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.860
from multiple inputs.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.700
If we're in the
brain, these dendrites

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.409
might be near the terminal
ends of axons of other neurons.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.240
If we're some type
of sensory cell,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.130
these dendrites
could be stimulated

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.985
by some type of sensory input.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:39.860
But let's just say, for
the sake of argument,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.459
they are stimulated in some way.

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.250
And because they're
stimulated in some way,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.510
it allows positive ions
to flood into the neuron

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.329
from the outside.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.120
As we know, there's a
potential difference.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.470
It's more negative
inside of the neuron

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.960
than outside of the neuron.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.140
And so if a channel
gets opened up

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.090
because of some
stimulus, that would

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.690
allow positive ions to flow in.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.370
And the primary positive
ions we've been talking about

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.400
are the sodium ions.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.910
Maybe this is some
type of sodium gate

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.310
that gets opened up
because of this stimulus.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.120
So when that happens, you
will have electrotonic spread.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.440
You will have an electrotonic
potential being spread.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.570
So let's say that
we had a voltmeter

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.320
right here on the axon hillock.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.490
It's kind of the hill that leads
to the axon right over here.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.450
So what you might see happening
after some amount of time--

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.950
so let me draw.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.800
So let's say this is our
voltage in millivolts

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.179
across the membrane--
our voltage difference,

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.720
I should say.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.340
This is the passage of time.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.910
Let's say the stimulus
happens at time 0.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.940
But right at time
0, we haven't really

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.750
noticed it with our voltmeter.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.290
Our voltage right across the
membrane right over there

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.370
is at that equilibrium,
negative 70 millivolts.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.350
But after some small
amount of time,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.919
this electrotonic potential
has gotten to this point,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.640
because all of these
positive charges

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.840
are trying to get
away from each other.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.000
It's gotten to that point.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.975
And you might see a
bump in the voltage--

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.960
in the voltage difference,
I guess I should say.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.480
This thing might go up.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.620
So it might look
something like that.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.400
Now, that by itself
might not be--

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.180
we might have gotten the
voltage difference low enough,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.260
I guess we could say.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.600
Or we might not have gotten
the voltage inside of the cell

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.730
positive enough in order to
trigger the voltage-gated ion

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.610
channels.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.260
And so maybe nothing happens.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.390
Maybe this right over here,
this is negative 55 millivolts.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.530
And so that's what you have
to get the voltage up to,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.400
the voltage difference
up to, in order

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.620
to trigger the ion
channels right over there.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.590
So those are the sodium channels
to get positive charge in.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.040
Here's the potassium channels
to get the positive charge out.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.710
The axon hillock
has a ton of these,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.010
because these are really there.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.690
Once they get triggered,
they can trigger an impulse

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.870
that can then go
down the entire axon,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.510
and maybe stimulate other
things, maybe in the brain

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.550
or whatever else this neuron
might be connected to.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.790
So maybe that stimulus by
itself didn't trigger it.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.789
But let's say that there's
another stimulus that

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.260
happens right at the same
time, or around the same time.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.060
And that happens.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.000
And on its own, that
might have caused

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.356
a similar type of
bump right over here.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.730
But when you add
the two together

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.450
and they're happening
at the same time,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.852
their combined bumps
are enough to trigger

00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:53.310
an action potential
in the hillock,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.650
or a series of action
potentials in the hillock.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.620
And so then, you really have,
essentially, fired the neuron.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.170
So now all sorts
of positive charge

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.360
gets flushed into the neuron.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.210
And then purely through
electrotonic spread,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.740
you will have this electrotonic
potential spread down the axon.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.300
Now, this is the
interesting part,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.966
because we can think
a little bit about,

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.420
what is the best way for
an axon to be designed?

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.570
In general, if you're trying
to transfer a current,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.080
the ideal thing to do is, the
thing that you're transferring

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.126
the current down should
conduct really well.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.750
Or you could say it
has low resistance.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.250
But you want it to be
surrounded by an insulator.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.490
You want it to be surrounded.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.310
So if this was a
cross section, you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.340
want it to be surrounded
by an insulator that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.050
has high resistance.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:05:00.410
And the reason is because
you don't want the potential

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:08.100
to leak across your
membrane-- high resistance

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.790
right over here.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.910
If you didn't have something
high resistance around it,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.642
your current would
actually go slower.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:17.850
This is true if you're just
dealing with electronics.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.420
If you just had a bunch of
copper wires on one side,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.950
and you had some
copper wires that

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.690
were surrounded by a
really good insulator,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.850
a really good resistor-- for
example, plastic or rubber

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.630
of some kind.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.690
The current is actually going
to have less energy loss.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.490
It's going to travel
faster when it's

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.399
surrounded by an insulator.

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.690
So you might say, OK, well gee.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.400
The best thing to do would be
to surround this entire axon

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.030
with a good insulator.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.890
And for the most
part, that is true.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.520
It is surrounded by
a good insulator.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.270
That is what the
myelin sheath is.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.560
So let's say we want to surround
this whole thing with just one

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.392
big grouping of Schwann's
cells, so one big myelin

00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:01.850
sheath-- which is
a good insulator.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.430
It does not conduct
current well.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:13.640
So this right over here is just
one big myelin sheath right

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.650
over here.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.790
Now, what's the
problem with this?

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.270
Well, if this axon is
really long-- and let's say,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.280
you know, you're a
dinosaur or something.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.390
And you're trying
to go up your neck,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.980
and your neck is 20 feet long.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.750
Or even a human being,
we're a reasonable size.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.640
And you're going several
feet, or even whatever,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.980
you want to go a
reasonable distance

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.220
purely with electrotonic
spread, your signal, remember,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.990
it dissipates.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.390
Your signal is going to be
really weak right over here.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.104
You're going to have a weak
signal on the other end.

00:06:47.104 --> 00:06:48.520
It might not be
even strong enough

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.130
to make anything
interesting happen

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.700
at these terminals, which
wouldn't be strong enough

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.790
to trigger, maybe,
other neurons,

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.440
or whatever else might need
to happen at this other end.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.520
So then you say,
OK, well then why

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.749
don't we try to
boost the signal?

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.290
Well, how would you
boost the signal?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.790
You say, OK.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.510
I like having this
myelin sheath.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.480
But why don't we put gaps in the
myelin sheath every so often?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.110
And then those gaps
would allow the membrane

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.280
to interface with the outside.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.950
And in those areas, we could
put some voltage-gated channels

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.300
that can release
action potentials,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.590
in order to essentially
boost the signal.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.940
And that's is exactly what the
anatomy of a typical neuron

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.970
is like.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.310
So instead of just one big
insulating sheath like this,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.280
it would-- let me
make some gaps here.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.630
Whoops, I'm going
to do that in black.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.570
So actually, let me
just draw it like this.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.495
Let me just erase this.

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:47.310
So clear, and let me clear this.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.920
That's good enough.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.100
And so what we could do
is we could put gaps in it

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.120
right over here where
the axon, the axonal

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.100
membrane itself can interface
with its surroundings.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.840
And of course, we
know we call those

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.760
gaps the nodes of
Ranvier, or Ran-Veer.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.130
I'm not really sure
how to pronounce it.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.200
So let me put
those gaps in here.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.210
So you put those gaps in here,
so these are the myelin sheath.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.960
And this right over here
is a node of Ranvier.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.960
These are nodes of
Ran-Veer, or Ranvier.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.590
And right in those little nodes,
right in those nodes, right

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.890
where the myelin
sheath isn't, we

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:43.789
can put these voltage-gated
channels to essentially boost

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.350
the signal.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.500
If the signal had to
go electrotonically

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.270
all the way over here,
it'd be very weak.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.960
It's going to dissipate
as it goes down,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.210
but it could be just strong
enough right at this point

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.840
in order to trigger these
voltage-gated channels,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.280
in order to essentially boost
the signal again, in order

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.271
to trigger an action
potential, boost the signal.

00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.770
And now the signal
is boosted, it'll

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.960
dissipate, dissipate,
dissipate, boost.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.800
And it'll boost right
over here again.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.350
And then it'll dissipate,
dissipate, dissipate,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.340
and boost.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.350
Dissipate, dissipate, boost.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.540
And so by having
this combination,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.980
you want the myelin sheath.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.970
You want the insulator in
order to keep the transmission

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.940
of the current to fast, in order
to have minimal energy loss.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.120
But you do need these areas
where the myelin sheath isn't

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.780
in order to boost the signal, in
order for the action potentials

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.640
to get triggered, and so your
signal can keep being-- well,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.550
I guess keep being
amplified, if we

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.017
wanted to talk in kind of
electrical engineering speak.

00:09:47.017 --> 00:09:49.100
And this type of conduction,
where the signal just

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.940
keeps boosting, and if you were
just to superficially observe

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.350
it, it looks like the
signal is almost jumping.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.660
It gets triggered here,
then it gets triggered,

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.680
here then it gets
triggered here,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.920
then it gets triggered here,
then it gets triggered here.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.470
This is called
saltatory conduction.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.570
It comes from the Latin
word saltare-- once again,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.820
I don't know how to pronounce.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.460
My Latin isn't too good.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.570
But it comes from the
Latin word saltare,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.730
which means to jump
around or to hop around.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.790
And that's because it looks like
the signal is hopping around.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.590
But that's not exactly
what's happening.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.080
The signal is traveling
passively through.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.380
It gets triggered here
in the axon hillock.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.099
Then it travels passively
through electrotonic spread.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.140
And then it gets boosted.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.890
And you have the
myelin sheath around it

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.600
to make sure it goes
as fast as possible,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.790
and you get very
little loss of signal.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.140
And then it gets boosted
at the nodes of Ranvier,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.570
because it triggers these
voltage-gated channels again.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.774
That triggers an
action potential.

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:58.190
And then your
signal gets boosted,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.439
and then it dissipates--
boosted, dissipates, boosted,

00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:02.290
dissipates, boosted, dissipates.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.010
Maybe it could even
get boosted again.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.440
And then it can trigger
whatever else it has to trigger.
