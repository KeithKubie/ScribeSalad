00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.940
Express the area of a rectangle
with length 4xy and

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.580
width 2y as a monomial.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.360
Monomial just means
just one term.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.710
So let's think about
a rectangle.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.910
So let me draw a
rectangle here.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.860
And they're telling us that the
length is 4xy and they're

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.850
telling us that the
width is 2y.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.610
And just as a bit of a
refresher, we know the area of

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.950
a rectangle is just the width
times the length, or the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.045
height times the width, or
however you want to view it--

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:40.680
just the product of its
two dimensions.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.390
So the area of this rectangle,
the area is going to be equal

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:58.390
to this length, 4xy times
the width times 2y.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.860
We can simplify this.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.540
We have a 4 times a 2.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.660
Whenever you're just taking a
product of a bunch of things

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.680
you can switch the order however
you like, as long as

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.500
it's all multiplication.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.620
So 4 times 2, that gives us 8.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.590
Then we have this
x sitting here.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.380
That is the only x we have
there, so it's 8 times x.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.310
And then we have a y here.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.260
We could view that as y to the
first. And then we have

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.220
another y there.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.550
We could view that as y to
the first. So y times y.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.140
You could view that
as y squared.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.160
Or you could say look, y to
the first times y to the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.140
first-- same base, add the two
exponents-- 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.970
So it's 8xy squared.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.670
This y squared covers both that
y and that y over there.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.230
And we're done.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.855
We've expressed the area of this
rectangle as a monomial.
