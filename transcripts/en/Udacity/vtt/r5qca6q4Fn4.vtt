00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.330
Let's look at another example of EDA. In the instructor notes,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.880
you'll find the link to a blog posting on Nathan Yao's

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.710
blog about flowing data. In the post Nathan analyses the size

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.400
of televisions over the past couple of years. I want you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.190
to read through the post and think about how Nathan conducted

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.830
his EDA. And pay careful attention to the date of visualization

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.470
and the source of his data. I want you to gather

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.360
some thoughts about some specific things that Nathan did in his work.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.620
And how they relate to the definition and the goals of EDA.
