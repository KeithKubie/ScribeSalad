&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich:
Good morning.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.760
If everyone wants
to take their seats,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.710
we'll get started in a moment.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.100
Welcome to our fiction stage.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.770
I think one of the finest

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.910
of those wonderful
National Book Festival.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.350
My name is Peter Vankevich.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.560
I have been fiction
manager for many years,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.680
but I worked 30 years at
the Library of Congress,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.880
and I'm the last standing person
be a volunteer for every one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.060
of them, so I'm very -- one of
my proudest accomplishments.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.730
I live in North Carolina.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.410
This is my homecoming
weekend here.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.630
So, we're going to have
a wonderful day here.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.100
This is the best part, and we've
got some fantastic writers.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.180
I do want to introduce
Mare Arana, my good friend.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.540
She's the literary director

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.510
for the National Book
Festival and welcome.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.700
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Thank you
and welcome to all of you.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.360
This is a grand occasion
every year.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.690
The Library of Congress puts
on a very big show for you.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.330
I hope you have a
chance to go down --

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.980
we're very grateful to our
sponsors and our donors,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.360
and I hope you have a chance
to go down to the expo floor

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
and thank them personally,
because you're able to come

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.160
to this wonderful free event
because of their generosity,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.760
And, really no amount
is too small.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.680
If you're willing to
give to the Library

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920
of Congress' National
Book Festival, please,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.720
I invite you to do so.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.020
We love your support,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.580
and we love to see your
faces here every year.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.660
It's a wonderful,
wonderful event.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.990
It's a great lineup this year.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.580
I always think that every year
it's the best it could possibly

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.860
be and then it gets better.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.590
So, wonderful to
have you with us.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.480
It's now my pleasure to
introduce the Librarian

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.630
of Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.740
Dr. Hayden was sworn in as
the 14th Librarian of Congress

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.160
on September 14, 2016.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.580
She was nominated by President
Barack Obama, and she came

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.890
to the Library of Congress from
the Enoch Pratt Free Library

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.510
in Baltimore, wonderful
library if you don't -- yes--

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.610
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.800
Where she was for
23 years the CEO.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.960
So, she is, I don't
think it's been --

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.360
it's probably a hundred years,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.640
since we've had a
librarian be the Librarian

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.510
of Congress, so we're
very proud.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.300
One of Dr. Hayden's primary
goals is to make the Library

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.480
of Congress accessible to all
Americans through its website,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.610
check it out loc.gov,
through its exhibitions

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.680
and reading rooms we
invite you to come.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.980
It's a public place.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.480
It is your library.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.610
So, and with grand events

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.190
such as the National Book
Festival please welcome our very

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.290
wonderful Librarian of
Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you
so much, thank you so much.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.390
Well, I'm delighted
to welcome all of you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.940
to the National Book Festival,
my favorite event of the year.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.370
The fiction authors
being brought to you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.670
through the generosity

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.500
of the Library's James Madison
Council really brings this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.250
to life, and they have been
a sponsor of the Festival

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.170
for the entire 18 years.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.740
I also have to say that
I share Mare's excitement

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.810
about the wonderful
lineup of authors

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.470
on this stage and
all the others.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.100
While you're here, I hope you
make it down to the lower level,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.260
where there are many fun
family-friendly activities

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.750
devoted to bringing you
and young people more

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.870
from the Library of Congress.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.590
So, I hope you have
a wonderful day.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.720
Now, I have to also tell
you that I am super excited,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.110
and so you will probably
see me throughout the day,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.580
running around.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.320
I wore this top especially.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.680
So, just wave, because,
as a librarian,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.640
this is like being in heaven.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.880
Books, authors, poets,
illustrators, authors,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.070
it's just, I'm aquiver.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.220
So, that's why I have to make
sure that I write down all

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.040
of my remarks, because
I can get distracted,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.970
and I know you will, too.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.060
So, this is wonderful, and I'm
very pleased to be able, no,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.570
to be, to present
something today

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.370
that is very dear to my heart.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.760
Since 2008, the Library

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.110
of Congress has honored
great writers of fiction,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.440
from John Grisham to Toni
Morrison to Marilynne Robinson,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.940
Dennis Johnson, and this award
recognizes the best writers

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.720
of fiction, and the winners are
chosen by a distinguished panel

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.810
of Nobel and Man Booker Prize
winners, Pulitzer Prize winners

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.060
and other literary
award recipients as well

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.660
as past winners of the prize.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.130
And, this year, to my
personal delight as well,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.510
the panel has selected
Ms. Annie Proulx.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:42.630
[ Applause ]

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.670
Now, Ms. Proulx has
received just

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.380
about every literary award
there is, the Pulitzer Prize,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.930
the National Book Award,
and the O. Henry Award among

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.230
many others.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.570
She is the author
of eight books,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.600
including "The Shipping
News" and the short story

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.360
"Brokeback Mountain",
both of which were adapted

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.020
into major motion pictures, and
her latest book is "Barkskins".

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.290
She is truly an American
original.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.000
She has given us monumental
sagas and keen eyed,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.670
skillfully wrought stories,

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.970
and throughout her writing she
succeeds in capturing the wild,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.560
wooly heart of America
from its screwball wit

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.800
to every last detail.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.280
She is so deserving
of this award,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.530
and we are about to
confer to Ms. Proulx.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.120
Will you please come forward
and accept the 2018 Library

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.480
of Congress Prize
for American Fiction?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.080
Please join me in welcoming
a true American treasure,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.880
Ms. Annie Proulx.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:25.090
[ Applause ]

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.380
And, we're even giving
her something.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.580
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Thank you,
thank you so very much.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Would
you say a few words?

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.680
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Certainly.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:43.210
[ Applause ]

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.220
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.940
It's wonderful, wonderful to
see so many pals up there,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.640
and I do think of
readers as friends.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.330
And, I've had the great pleasure
of meeting people everywhere

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.670
who like the things I write
about who have stories

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:12.920
of their own, and once in a
while I get a real big surprise.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.170
One time in Australia,
after I had been reading,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.730
a lady handed me in the book
signing line a little note

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.920
folded over, and she
looked very sorrowful

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.590
as she handed it to me.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.270
I didn't have a chance
to open that until later

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.810
and when I did open it,

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:38.140
it was about two sentences
of a very hard story.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.960
She said that she had hated her
husband all the years she'd been

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.500
married to him, and the
only surcease that she had

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.880
from her misery was reading.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.900
And, I found that extremely
poignant and it's troubled me

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.580
to this day to think
that her only escape

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.680
from what was an unhappy
situation was reading,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.990
but reading can do that to us.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.000
It can do that for us, and
I know this is an audience

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.160
of readers, and I
share that with you.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.050
We're all readers here.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.260
I'm so pleased to be
here and thank you,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.510
thank you very much for coming.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:26.500
[ Applause ]

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.480
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: It's such
a pleasure to be here

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.510
with Annie Proulx, one of I'm a
devoted loyal fan for many years

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.320
and have read every single
book that she has written

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.960
from the very beginning.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.580
It's extraordinary.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.060
I think, I said to
her last night,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.660
"I think you're the great
chronicler of North America."

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.240
She's done the Range and I don't
mean just the Wyoming Range.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.480
I mean she's done Newfoundland,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.720
she's done Canada,
she's done Wyoming.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.020
There's this tremendous
cavalcade of characters

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.980
that she has brought to us.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.710
Her stories can be raw.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.850
They always hit you in the gut.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:09.470
They are really an extraordinary
collection of American,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.350
North American beautiful,
beautifully written works.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.000
I am so pleased that you have
received this prize, Annie.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.400
Congratulation from the bottom
of my heart and thank you

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.470
for that anecdote,
because reading is,

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.520
in many ways, an escape.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.880
You gave us a good -- last
night at the pep rally,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.690
because we have a pep rally.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.860
We call it the Gala where
authors all get together

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.950
and they talk about
what inspired them

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.410
and what put their
heads together in a way,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.010
and you gave the most
extraordinary sort of litany

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.770
of works that had, from
the very beginning,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.990
that had informed you.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:12:00.940
Could you sort of give a short
version to our audience here?

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.680
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Sure.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.160
The message that I was trying
to get across, much condensed,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.820
is that you can never introduce
your child to reading too early.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.680
When you get home
from the hospital

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.790
or even before the baby is
born, read, read out loud.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.550
It may sound silly, but it's not
and as soon as you do get home

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:34.360
from the hospital with that
new kid, pick up a book,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.730
preferably one with pictures,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.210
even though those little
eyes aren't really focused

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.120
yet and read.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.150
Start reading and repeat
this recipe every day

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.830
until the child says I
want to read by myself,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:53.250
and you will have a smart,
intelligent, involved,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.480
terrific person in your life.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.800
You have to start young.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.490
Don't wait until the kid is
six or seven or eight or ten,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:08.430
right away, as tiny infants,
introduce them to books.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.730
That's what I said.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.400
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: That's, yeah,
that's exactly what she said,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.370
and your background, I
think, predisposes you

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.480
to really know North
America so well.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.070
You have Anglo-American and
French-Canadian backgrounds,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:32.540
and your father was from Quebec,
and your mother was a painter,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:41.690
and that, in many ways, I think,
seeing, because your books,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.630
your short stories
are so vividly drawn.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.550
There's a very painterly
quality.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.140
Did you paint as a child?

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.770
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: We all
grew up with pencils

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.160
and brushes in our family.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.170
It was just what we did.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.100
I think our parents were
not happily married.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.220
I'm the oldest of five girls.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.310
I think our parents were not
really happy with one another,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.460
and my mother took
refuge in painting.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.140
I've seen some of her paintings
from before she met my father

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.320
and they're joyous and
with very strong colors.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.040
And, then, as years went by,
the paintings became smaller

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.950
and tighter and almost
always landscapes.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.060
People began to disappear
from her work,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.930
but she had a storytelling
talent

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.730
like her mother before her,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.350
something about women
and stories.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.620
And, she could, and often
did, we'd be sitting outside,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.140
and she motioned to the ground
and we noticed some ants

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.660
down there, and she would pick
out discernable ants like one

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.640
with a particularly large
crumb, would identify the crumb,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.230
and that particular ant,

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.680
it would quickly
had a name attached.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.080
And, this went on with
everything around,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.850
so that we had stories just
boiling up from the ground,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.620
and she just did this
as a matter of course.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.380
If the wind was blowing
the leaves a certain way,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.690
there was an animistic
touch to this.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.300
It was a story that
came out of it.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.080
So, we were very
much in the bosom

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.610
of nature during my childhood,
which was a wonderful thing.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.440
She was an amateur naturalist
and noticed everything.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:39.390
We had a house full of pressed
rose petals, and animal skins,

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.190
and butterfly cocoons, and
it made for a rich childhood

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.030
in addition to reading.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.540
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: This
was in Connecticut?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.840
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: It
was in Connecticut,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.230
but not just Connecticut.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:58.070
My father was, my father left
school at age 14, not by choice,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.910
and went to work in the
textile mills of New England

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.720
as bobbin boy, and
his ambition was

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.570
to make something of himself.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.890
He felt very keenly, being
a French Canadian at a time

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.200
when French Canadians
were disliked and despised

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.880
as being unwelcome immigrants.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.310
It didn't matter that his
grandparents had been born

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.930
in New England.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.480
Anyway, he set out
to improve himself

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.920
and that affected our
home lives very much.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.940
We moved. He was constantly
after the better job,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.170
went to night school,
read, and read, and read,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.460
and taught himself, and
we moved, and we moved,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.780
and we moved, and we moved.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.260
And, I think by the
time I left home,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.900
I had lived in maybe 20 places,

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.970
and I've continued
this in my life.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.800
I think I've moved maybe 40
times in my life, most recently

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.540
within the last five years
I've moved four times.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:08.650
There's a big problem with this,
because as a reader I have a lot

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:17.480
of books, and even though I have
shed myself of many of them,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.130
from time to time, I tend,
when I'm doing research

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:26.500
on a particular facet of life
or history, to collect all sorts

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.080
of books about that
period of time,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.780
people, place, and so forth.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.140
So, I've had to divest
myself over and over again

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.840
and to make the load of moving
lighter, hundreds of boxes

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.200
of books, and I lifted every
one of them with bad results.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.760
But, now, I have to replace
the ones that I've lost,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.910
because them so badly.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.860
I'm not one who lets
go of books easily,

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.000
and it's very embarrassing
privately

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.890
to want a particular
book and not have it.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.190
I knew I had it.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.220
I knew where it was
four houses ago.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:14.030
So, that's my life,
getting more books

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.170
and replacing the ones
I've gotten rid of

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.580
and repeating this
over and over.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.100
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: That's the
challenging part, of course,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.820
of moving, but travel
seems to feed you in a way.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.380
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I've
done a lot of that.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.680
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: You have.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.980
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: A
lot of traveling.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.380
I really do have itchy feet.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.880
I think I'm always looking
for the right place,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.020
the place I really belong.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.970
But, I guess in the end, it
boils down I probably belong

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.780
in New England, although I lived
just about the opposite of that.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:52.700
I'm in the Northwest
Pacific corner,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.080
and New England's far away,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.120
but New England is not
something you can escape from.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.810
For those of you who
know New England,

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.410
it's with you right to the end.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.780
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: The travel
part is important, I think,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.410
at least in my mind, as
a reader, as your reader,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:18.090
because in The Shipping News,
the language that is used is

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:26.780
so -- I mean, one can hear the,
that sort of Northeast pander,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:32.680
sort of the language
that is used.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.240
The way that a Northeasterner
will drop the subject

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.830
or the pronoun in a
sentence and you, I feel,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.610
you feel that you are in
Newfoundland, and you are a part

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.240
of these, this community,
and in Wyoming,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.600
my grandparents were in Wyoming.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.260
I visited Wyoming as a child
from very far away and the --

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.860
when I read your
Wyoming stories,

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.790
these are my cousins,
my uncles, my aunts.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.640
The lingo that you managed
to capture is extraordinary.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.600
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Well,
that's what I do.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.320
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: You
sure do, you sure do.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.040
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: My great
interest is in place.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:29.340
I am quite fascinated by the
geography, geology, the climate,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.130
the weather, the
ancient history,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.820
all of the things about a place.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.460
If it's a small place,
fine, but I try to find

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.270
out everything I can about
it, who's been there before,

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.970
what was before anybody
and put them all together,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.200
because I strongly believe that
place makes us what we are.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.450
It's extremely difficult
to escape from your place.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:00.670
Lots of people try it and
very few succeed entirely.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:07.180
So, the mores, the accents,
the climate, the weather,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.160
everything that you grew
up with is stuck in there.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.060
It's the measurement for
anything that comes afterwards,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.960
which is why I think so many

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.070
of us are having trouble
with climate change.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.600
It can't be right.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.910
It has to be like it was.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.090
So -- and it's not.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.390
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Indeed.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.120
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: So, this
examination of place is, for me,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.410
the main reason for
writing stories.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.020
I try, in the writing, to
understand what made this place

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.810
like it is and what are
the problems of the people

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.920
who live there and how
do they solve them,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.140
and that's my recipe
for story writing.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.230
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Yeah,
and it's spelunking

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.510
into the culture that you do.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:57.440
Let me take you back to
the' 70s, which was when --

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.960
just let's, speaking
of spelunking,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.010
you began your career
by writing nonfiction,

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.570
and you actually founded
a newspaper in Vermont.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.660
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx:
It wasn't fiction.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.480
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: No.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.410
[Laughter] We could go off
on that one, but at the time,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.370
you were and, you know, skiing,
canoeing, hunting, fishing,

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.390
all of these wonderful
outdoor things,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:32.430
and you were doing
how-to-books on gardening and--

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.730
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Madness.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.750
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: And,
making cider and all

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.110
of that wonderful
sort of lifestyle.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.790
How -- and you, I think,
began a PhD in history,

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.690
which you decided to
abandon, but the --

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.230
all of these things
fed, in some way,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.210
what you eventually
did in fiction.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.510
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx:
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.890
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Tell
us about that.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.250
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I've had
learned people commiserate

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.550
with me for not finishing
the degree,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.270
but it was the smartest
thing I ever did.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.360
The academic life, for me,
would have been a prison.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.900
I don't like to be
pinned into a corner,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.510
which is probably why I have
been married so many times.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.260
[ Laughter ]

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.560
But--

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.260
I don't know, this stuff
is hard to talk about.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.850
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.560
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I did
do all those things,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.370
and this little newspaper
started as a joke.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.160
It was called Behind the Times.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.480
It was a small town in Vermont,
and a friend and I learned

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.100
that the selectmen were
having secret meetings,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.460
supposed to be public
but weren't.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:01.800
And, so we took turns in
actually appearing there

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.340
and defying them
to have a meeting

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.210
without a member of the public.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.510
We wrote about it.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.480
We wrote about the
selectmen's meetings at length.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.310
They got used to it, although
they were really upset

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.530
and angry at first.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.310
And, to get this paper off the
ground we called together a

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.230
bunch of friends and interested
persons and put a note

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.010
up on the general store
counter that we wanted

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.590
to start a newspaper and
would everybody come together

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.200
and we'd talk about it.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.370
So, the town folks turned
out, and Vermont is one

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.980
of the few places
left in this country

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.070
where town meetings are
really, really important.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.120
And, the whole town
comes together just

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.010
like the Norman Rockwell
cover and people stand up

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.690
and speak their piece and sit
down again and are drowned

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.440
out by shouts, but it's
something to admire

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.950
and wonderful to live through.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.610
So, our paper got off to a
flying start, and we ran it

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.040
for several years, my
friend Tom Watkin and I.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.850
Eventually, I went on
to different things.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:16.150
I started moving and writing
fiction, and he sold the paper

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:22.440
and it soon disappeared from
the surface of the earth.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.570
I don't know the
history of what happened.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.450
I think the fellow who
bought it filled it full

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:32.380
of political tripe, and
that's what happens.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.060
But, we had a good thing going,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.060
and while we did it,
it was a lot of fun.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.430
So, citizen science is another
thing that's very dear to me,

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.260
and I see that newspaper
adventure

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.220
as a kind of citizen science.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.130
As citizens we have a tremendous
amount of power, if we take it,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.230
but if we just sit there
and wait for the next guy

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.690
to do it, it doesn't get done.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.080
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Indeed.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:08.570
How did you -- going from this
sort of nonfiction introduction?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.390
You were, if I may
say, of a good age

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.850
when you started
writing fiction.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.150
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Yes.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.920
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: You would
have some life behind you.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.340
How did you make that decision

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:25.040
to suddenly write
through the imagined?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.210
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I don't believe
it was really a decision.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.900
It just happened, as
most things in life do.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.480
I'm not one of those people who
wake up one morning and say,

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.890
"By god, I'm going
to do such and such."

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.980
That's nice, but it
didn't happen to me.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.980
I just started writing.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:47.550
I've been a reader forever and
ever, and it was just natural.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.990
I think at one point I picked up
some terribly popular new novel

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.260
and read about 30 pages and
thought, "I could do that."

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:02.560
Put it aside, I don't
remember what it was now,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.050
but it had its day
and then its night,

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:13.150
but I just started writing and
I found it to be engrossing.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.140
I saw it as working
out of puzzles

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.990
and it's still that for me.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.910
To write is to examine a
place and the people in it,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.530
the people who might be in it,

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.590
because I never use
real people as models.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:37.660
I always use names from
the past or invented names

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:43.150
or just completely make
people up who are composites

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:49.640
of characteristics added to
swaggers, head scratching.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.810
And, this kind of thing is very
fun and if you haven't tried it,

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.780
I suggest that some day when
you have a little free time,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.890
sit down and invent a
world that you know.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.510
It's really very engaging.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.850
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: You
began with stories.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.900
"Heart Songs" was
your first book.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.200
That was 1988, and
then you moved on to

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.680
"Postcards" very quickly,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.080
because that was
published in 1992.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.690
Very well received,
wonderfully received,

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:25.260
and then very shortly there
upon came The Shipping News,

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:31.780
and I just want to read one of
the -- from one of the reviews,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.820
which is really, I
think, wraps it up nicely.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:40.740
"The writing is charged with
sardonic wit, alive, funny,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.420
a little threatening,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.350
packed with brilliantly original
images and, now and then,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.220
a sentence that simply
takes your breath away."

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.950
So true, and The Shipping News
came so quickly after Postcards.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.310
Was this something that you
were holding in your back pocket

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.780
or in a drawer somewhere
that you had written early

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.430
and how did that happen?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.540
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I had
been thinking about it.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.010
My newspaper friend Tom Watkin
and I went on a fishing trip.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.180
We both liked fishing,
and I had wanted to go

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.650
to Newfoundland for years.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.180
I did graduate studies at the --

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.470
at Sir George Williams
University in Montreal,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:30.200
and at the time, Newfie
jokes were just rife.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.290
They were like the Polish jokes
that had been in this country

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.270
and I can't remember when,
the '50s or something or other

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.040
and the ditsy blonde jokes.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.580
So, I was curious about
Newfoundlanders, and so Tom

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.520
and I decided to go fishing
up there and away we went,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.360
headed for Newfoundland and
decided to camp out all the way,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.970
brought a canoe along with
us, which was silly, but--

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.660
I fell in love with the
place, as we were just sliding

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.970
into Port aux Basques.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.220
There's a long ferry crossing

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.310
from Nova Scotia
over to Newfoundland.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.260
It's about a seven-hour ferry
ride, and just as we came

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.480
into the harbor, everything was
coming with a deep green moss,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.480
and it was foggy, and
there was fog horn going,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.430
and there was a bell
clanging in the distance.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:34.110
And, it was just exquisite,
and salty, and unknown,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.010
and I just thought this is
a place, and I determined

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.410
to learn more about it.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.870
So, that was the
beginning of that book.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:50.200
I went back ten times, over
the next two or three years,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.290
gathering material, listening
to people talk, eating the food,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.640
staying in different
places, and there are lots

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.290
of stories connected with
that, which are still untold,

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:11.770
but it was a grand place, and
I loved it deeply and still do.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.350
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Well, you
captured it beautifully.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.080
You won the Pulitzer Price

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.470
and the National Book
Award for that book.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.560
I should mention
also for Postcards,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.150
which was her first
novel, she was the first,

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.910
you were the first
woman, I believe,

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.170
to win the PEN/Faulkner Award.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.560
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I was so lucky.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.540
I was really lucky, yes.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.880
I think I just happened to be at
a certain age at a certain time

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.150
and things just fell into place.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:46.010
So, it was good fortune for
me, really good fortune.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:51.130
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Postcards has
a very powerfully sad ending,

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.540
Shipping News does not.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.010
It has a powerful sort of
happy ending as in a way.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.510
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Sometimes,
you can't avoid happy endings.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:05.970
[ Laughter ]

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.270
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: That's a quote.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.870
That is a quote.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.210
I am writing that down.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.370
You've moved to Wyoming.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.110
I think it was in
the late '90s or so.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.410
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Yes.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.710
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: That
must've been a, quite,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.720
a change of just certainly a
change of landscape from all

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.020
that moss to all that prairie.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.320
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Yes.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.970
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: How did it go?

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.540
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Well, it was
actually when I was working

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:40.910
on Postcards, I needed
a place that was Western

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.240
for my peripatetic protagonist.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.310
And, I looked in the guide
to writer's residences

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.110
around the country
and, low and behold,

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.560
there was one in Wyoming.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.890
I'd never even been in Wyoming,
but it sounded very promising.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.190
So, I wrote to them
and got particulars

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.210
and made an application,
and they said come on out.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.260
So, one day in, I think it was
February, I threw all my stuff

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.480
in the back of my old truck
in Vermont and headed West,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:24.010
and as I crossed the line from
Nebraska from one of the Dakotas

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.640
into Wyoming, there
had been a light skiff

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.010
of snow the night before.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:37.030
And, it was late afternoon, that
is about 3:30 in the afternoon,

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:43.090
and I saw the landscape was
a color I had never ever seen

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.880
in my life.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.210
The yellow grass under the snow,

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.480
the way the light was hitting
this very light, fluffy,

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.620
dry snow made everything
have a kind

00:33:54.620 --> 00:34:03.380
of glistening mauve purplish
color that was ethereal

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.640
and bizarre at the same time,
a color I had never seen.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.330
What kind of a place is
this that can make colors

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.810
that you've never seen before,
because I was, you know,

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.110
I was certainly not young,

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.000
and I thought I'd seen all
the colors in the world.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.640
So, I was enchanted right off
the bat and spent a couple

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.040
of weeks there working
on my story for --

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.120
what was the name of that book?

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.320
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: For Wyoming
Stories", "Bad Dirt", or--

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.470
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Not
Wyoming Stories, the--

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:48.470
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Bad Dirt, or
"Fine Just the Way It Is", or--

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.910
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx:
Postcards, thank you.

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.620
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Postcards?

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.170
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Yeah.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.490
So, I was able to get
the information I needed

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.690
for Postcards, but by then,

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.950
I realized that Wyoming
was a place

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.620
that I should spend
some time in.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.580
I walked a great deal while
I was there, and it's a --

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.680
walking is an important
component of writing,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.690
because if you're tied up with
knots about plot directions

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:23.010
or character exposes or the
way things are coming together,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.810
walking usually solves
the problem.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.250
The rougher the terrain,
the easier the problems are

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.200
to solve, and I did a lot of
walking there, and I decided

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.360
that I would move to Wyoming.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.150
My mother had recently died.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:44.350
I packed up, I moved and
have been out ever since.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:51.310
I had 19 years of
champagne powder in Wyoming.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.820
I was an avid cross-country
skier

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.590
for many years and
it was the best.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.690
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: I will take
your suggestion on the walking.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.990
For me it's cooking.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.290
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Really?

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.470
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Cooking seems
to get the gears spinning.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.770
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: My
god, I never tried that.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.570
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Try it.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.060
[ Laughter ]

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.730
Wyoming was very
fertile ground for you.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.750
I mentioned some of
the books, Bad Dirt,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:22.100
Fine Just the Way It Is,
Wyoming Stories, wonderful,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.600
every single one of them, and I
actually reviewed "Bird Cloud"

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.970
which was your book in returning
to nonfiction actually,

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:36.960
to write about your travails of
the household business of living

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.720
in Wyoming and being
snowed in and all of that

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.960
and the tribulations with the
fixing things around the house.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.710
It was really a nitty-gritty
description of life in Wyoming.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.310
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I
miss it very much,

00:36:54.310 --> 00:37:01.330
but I'm not there anymore,
but it's in my mind.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.180
So, yes, it was a
big part of my life.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.790
I will always love that place
and the people who live there,

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.190
very particular kind
of people, hard-bitten,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.300
able to fix anything, a
lot like Newfoundlanders.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.320
If you ever have to be
cast on a desert island,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.240
it's good to have
either a Newfoundlander

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.850
or a Wyoming person with
you, though I'm sure

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:34.040
that they don't give them out
at the edge of the railing.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.770
Yeah, great people.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.070
I learned a lot.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.550
I had many fine times, and
now I'm in another place.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.200
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: And, you've given
us Barkskins in the interim,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:53.880
really a tremendous sort of
chronical of the settling

00:37:53.880 --> 00:38:00.660
of North America, a big book,
a book about deforestation.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.040
It couldn't be more
timely, this book.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.800
One of the, one of your
epigraphs is a quote I won't --

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.630
I'm not going to read
here, but basically,

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.960
it says that when the
conquest of America took place,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:19.670
we virtually destroyed the pagan
animism, and in the process

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.830
of destroying that pagan animism

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.500
in which nature becomes very
much alive and is a character

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.210
in your life you begin the
erosion of a very deep respect,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:36.070
if not worship, of the
natural world, and it's almost

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.070
as if we've invited a
curse upon ourselves.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.100
I find that really, really
interesting, compelling,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.480
and convincing, that
we have, in a way,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.410
leaving that mythological
past that we've --

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.900
the connection that
we've had with nature,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.410
that we have lost
something profound.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.310
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: We
never had it to lose.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.630
The people who settled, the
settlers, the adventures

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:13.350
from Europe and England, we did
not have those animistic beliefs

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.820
at the time that people begin
shifting to the New World.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:22.950
So, this was, and among other
things, Barkskins was a contrast

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:28.610
between two kinds of
peoples, two kinds of thought,

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:33.980
two kinds of world approach
between Native Americans

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.970
and the go-getter
entrepreneurial types.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.920
A complicated story and
it's a big book, too big,

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.550
but it was hard to make it
smaller, because if you're going

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.350
to do forests, you're
going to have to have time

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.710
and 300 years was the
absolute minimum time

00:39:55.710 --> 00:40:02.090
that I could manage the rise
and fall of forest situation

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.950
and that means a
lot of characters.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.070
So, that was kind of a trap.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.920
I've often thought, since then,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.800
how could I have made
this a smaller book.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:18.080
My editor had a good idea about
how to make it a smaller book.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.620
She had her red pencil, and we
cut something like 150 pages

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.510
from the original
manuscript, many of them--

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.220
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: That's a
deforestation in itself.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.520
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Yes.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.180
Many of those pages I was
sad to see go, but probably,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.480
people would not have been able

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.050
to pick the book
up, but so it goes.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.160
It was an ambitious thing.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.070
I think I would have --

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:53.270
the ending of it was very much
darker before I changed it

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.670
at the end and gave
a ray of hope.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:02.460
I still have that ray of hope,
but it's dimmer every day.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.830
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Would you like to
ask a question of Annie Proulx?

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.440
Please come forward
to the microphones.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.140
We'll have a little bit of time.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.870
I will ask -- question
Annie while people do.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.230
Please, please, I
invite you to come up.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.120
If when you ask a
question though,

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.250
lots of things don't last
forever, but this does,

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.850
because it gets archived
in the Library of Congress

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.100
and your question and
the answer are going

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.010
to be archived forever,
so choose well.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.610
Annie, I think you
mentioned last night

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:43.330
that Barkskins is going
to be a series made

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.870
by National Geographic.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:51.190
You've had apart from a
life in words and in print,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:57.430
you have now filmed,
and these, this writing

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:04.520
of yours is coming very much
alive in a visual medium.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.820
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx:
There was a time

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:11.240
when books were what it
was all about storytelling

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.660
and imagination in this country,
but it's not like that now.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.040
Film is dominant.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.280
Television serials are dominant.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.060
Some people get around to
actually reading the books

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:32.740
of a film that they've seen
and liked or been provoked by.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:40.010
So, yeah, it's nonsensical to
avoid film under the impression

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.870
that you're being
some kind of purist.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.010
So, I have been involved
in and am involved

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.750
in various film ventures.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:54.890
Yes, National Geographic
did option Barkskins

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.060
to be made into a series.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.130
I don't know where the
project is right now

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.900
and like these things, perhaps
it will come to nothing.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.450
I have read some of the
early sections and been

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.420
in contact with the writer.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.100
Haven't heard anything for about
six months, so I have no idea.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:24.380
Some of the Wyoming Stories are
being looked at with fresh eyes

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:32.400
by filmmakers, and I'm involved
in books that I haven't written

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.670
but that I know something
about, because I read them

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:41.180
and enjoyed them so deeply,
and on and on it goes.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:47.480
There's a connection with
museums, exhibits, film people,

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.100
television people, and so forth.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.970
It's part of today's
writing world.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:57.380
You can't be a hermit and
as attractive as that is,

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.980
it doesn't really work.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.560
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Yes, indeed.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.330
Question here?

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.630
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.150
You mentioned that you are
in the Pacific Northwest now,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.800
and I was hoping you
could tell us a little bit

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.870
about what inspiration
you're finding there.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.050
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I am living in
the Pacific Northwest now and as

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:21.770
for inspiration,
it's all around.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.070
It's a beautiful
part of the country.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.420
I've got the Olympic range
to the West, the Cascades

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:36.010
to the East, British Columbia to
the North, Oregon to the South,

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.310
and it's a mild climate.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:45.520
The ocean is there, Puget Sound
is there, seaweed, see lions,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:53.860
seals, fish, crabs, wind,
rain, interesting people.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:45:00.220
It's a very engaging place,
and I'm learning about it,

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.340
trying to learn some
seaweeds right now

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.900
and about the indigenous people.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.510
Many of the tribes
remained their own selves.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.030
They weren't shuffled
off somewhere,

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.240
and they still are very viable.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.820
Anybody who makes it out there
should go to Cape Flattery

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.150
in Nea Bay up at the
tip of the peninsula

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:29.510
and see the extraordinary
Makah Cultural Center,

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.930
which will teach you a
great deal about life

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.830
as it was before
white people came.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:41.250
The Makah Museum, the
cultural center, is the result

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.840
of something that
happened 500 years ago.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.330
A fishing village of Makah
people were sleeping happily

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:56.500
when a landslide came down and
covered their village entirely.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.340
Beginning in the late
'70s, it was noticed

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.610
that the sea was eroding,
some of the pile of dirt

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.360
and artifacts were appearing.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.240
Archeologists came, and after
a while, all of the people

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.320
in the Makah tribe were
engaged in helping puzzle

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.850
out what these artifacts
were, how they were used.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.770
Plans were made for a museum.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.860
The work went on for years,

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.080
and the result today
is extraordinary.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.870
This entire village was
preserved in every tiny detail,

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:36.110
and you can see the
unfolding of those lives

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:40.820
and how life was lived 500
years ago in that museum.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.480
I think it's one of
the most striking

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.100
and powerful museums
I've ever been in.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:50.270
So, when you all come out to the
Olympic Peninsula, be sure to go

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:57.810
out there to Cape Flattery and
visit the Makah Cultural Center.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.340
That's only part
of what's there.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.240
It's a rich, rich place
with rainforests, with --

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.020
I can look out my kitchen window
and see those things that look

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.590
like the -- does anybody
remember when the semis used

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.330
to go up and down the
highways with big crates

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.670
of chickens stacked up on
them, feathers blowing around?

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.540
Well, the cruise ships
remind me very much

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:29.860
of the place of those old semis.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.430
They don't carry chickens
around that way anymore,

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.930
but the cruise ships
are still there.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.680
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: My
timekeeper says we have time

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.860
for one more question, so--

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.160
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: I'm sorry.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.460
I've been talking too much.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.760
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: No, we love it.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.060
That's why we're here.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.360
Please?

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, you talked about
the importance of place

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:54.200
and how it affects who we are,
and it seems to me, right now,

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.960
when experiencing a mass
migration from areas of conflict

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.310
and poverty, people moving
within our country as well

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.300
to get a better job or whatever.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.120
So, what effect is this going
to have on the human psyche,

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.000
if we lose our sense of place,
will it be a global sense

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.070
of place rather than individual?

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.370
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Thank you.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.670
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx:
That is a question.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.580
Cancel the rest of the day.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:31.040
[ Laughter ]

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.160
I'm extremely interested
in migration right now.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.220
I had the huge pleasure
of writing a foreword

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:46.300
for the Wyoming project
on angulate migration

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.750
in the state of Wyoming
recently.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.500
I think it's coming
out in a month or so.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.290
But, human migration, animal
migration, bird migration,

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:01.810
butterfly migration,
everything is in motion,

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.620
and one of the directions

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.920
that scientific studies are
taking now is in the direction

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.560
of trying to understand
that everything is moving.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.900
We live on these chunks of rock

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.710
that are shifting
around the world.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.340
We live next to shores

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.470
where tides are changing
and increasing.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:26.660
We live in so much motion
and change that that's

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.390
where it's all happening,
and I'm utterly intrigued.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:34.390
This is my keen -- one of
my keen interests right now

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.790
about migration,
human migrations.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:38.620
I have zero answers.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.010
I'm still learning, I
think like the rest of us.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.530
So, I can't really
give you any kind

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:49.680
of coherent answer there except
to say I want to know more.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.020
&gt;&gt; Mare Arana: Well, your
coherent answer will, I'm sure,

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.930
come in your next work,
which we all look forward to,

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:59.540
and congratulations for being
the Library of Congress Prize

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.790
for American Fiction winner.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.510
Sometimes, you have to
have a happy ending.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:07.150
[ Applause ]

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.820
&gt;&gt; Annie Proulx: Thank you.
