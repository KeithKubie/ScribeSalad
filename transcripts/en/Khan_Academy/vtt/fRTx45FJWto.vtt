00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.300
We're on problem 24.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.180
A rope 40 feet long is
cut into two pieces.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.430
Let's draw that.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.520
Let's say that's where
I cut them.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.100
If one piece is 18 feet longer
than the other, what is the

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.790
length in feet of the
shorter piece?

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.630
So let's say this is
the shorter piece.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.283
This is the longer piece.

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:25.220
x plus 18.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.030
And they also tell us that both
pieces combined-- it's a

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.490
40-foot long rope, so if I add
these together it should be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.620
equal to 40.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.256
So x plus x, plus 18
is equal to 40.

00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:41.150
x plus x is equal to 2x,
plus 18 is equal to 40.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.320
And then I get 2x is equal to--
subtract 18 from both

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.240
sides, that's what?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.480
22.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.680
x is equal to 11.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.350
Next problem.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.940
Let me switch colors.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.620
25.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.570
The Earth travels around
the sun at a speed of

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.676
approximately 18.5
miles per second.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.470
This approximate speed is
how many miles per hour?

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.470
So how many seconds are
there in a mile?

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.150
So you have 60 seconds
per minute.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.240
And then you have times
60 minutes per hour.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.040
So you get 60 times
60 is 3,600.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.220
And the units work out, too.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.640
Minutes in the denominator.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.140
Minutes in the numerator.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.120
So you get 3,600 seconds
per hour.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.050
So 18.5 miles per second, you're
going to go 3,600 times

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.960
as far in an hour.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.030
So let's multiply that times
3,600 seconds per hour.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090
And you'll get whatever
this number is.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.050
So let's multiply it out.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.130
18.5.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.170
I'm going to multiply it times
36 and then add two 0's later.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.020
6 times 5 is 30.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.700
6 times 8 is 48, plus 3 is 51.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.580
6 times 1 is 6, plus 5 is 11.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.400
3 times 5 is 15.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.060
3 times 8 is 24, plus 1 is 25.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.660
3 times 1 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.120
And so you get a 0,
a 6, a 6, and a 6.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.530
And then I have one number
behind the decimal point.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.580
So 18.5 times 36 is 666.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.990
But I'm multiplying it not
by 36 but by 3,600.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.840
So 18.5 times 3,600 is going to
be equal to this times 100.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.500
So 66,600.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.520
And the units work out.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.640
Second in the denominator.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.820
Second in the numerator.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.060
Miles per hour.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.990
And that's choice D.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.915
And they didn't even let you
approximate it, because choice

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:53.880
C is really close.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.960
You really have to, as far as
I can tell, go through the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.840
multiplication.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.190
Next problem.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.780
26.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.060
If the quotient a/b is
positive-- that's what they're

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.490
telling us-- which of the
following must be true?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.140
So if a/b is positive, that
essentially tells us that a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.290
and b have to have the
same sign, right?

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.970
The only way you can get a
positive number when you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.740
divide two numbers is if they're
both positive, or

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.040
they're both negative.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.420
If they were different signs--
if one was positive and one

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.810
was negative, or one was
negative and one was

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.820
positive-- then this would
be a negative number.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.810
So this tells us that they're
the same sign.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.700
So statement A, choice A, tells
us a is greater than 0.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.190
No, this doesn't have
to be true.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.970
They both could be
less than 0.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.700
B tells us that b is
greater than 0.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.030
Once again, this isn't
necessarily true.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.340
They both could be less than 0
and this would still be true.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.380
Choice C.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.930
ab is greater than 0.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.200
Well, think about it.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.200
This implies that both a and b
have to have the same sign.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.140
If a and b have the same sign
when I multiply them, I'm

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.770
still going to get a number
bigger than 0, right?

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.950
A positive times a positive
is a positive.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.680
A negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.100
So it's choice C.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.630
Problem 27.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.459
And I saw this coming, so I
drew this ahead of time.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.730
Actually, no I didn't.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.680
Well, I thought I had drawn
it ahead of time.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.370
Let me actually open it up.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.010
I thought I had drawn it.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.240
Oh, well, it must have
gotten erased.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.270
Well, let's just do it
in real time, then.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.830
So it says, the dots on the
graph above indicate the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.560
weights and fuel efficiency
ratings for 20 cars.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.250
How many of the cars weigh more
than 2,500 pounds-- so

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:57.510
weight is more than 2,500--
and also get more than 25

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.470
miles per gallon?

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.510
So fuel efficiency is more
than 22 miles per gallon.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.120
And notice, they said more than
22, not 22 miles or more.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.270
And they said more than 2,500,
not 2,500 pounds or more.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.840
Let me just draw the part of the
graph that seems relevant.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.160
So if that's the weight axis--
so they have a couple at 25,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.980
26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.500
And then, we want to
know above 22.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.270
So let me actually
draw all of it.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.360
So that's 25.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.050
I'm only drawing part of the
graph because I don't want to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.900
go through the exercise.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.530
Because I actually already
did it and I can't find

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.640
it, all of a sudden.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.550
But I don't want to stop
recording this video.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.050
So 20.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.040
This is 22.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.990
This is 24.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.250
They don't label the 22
on their drawing.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.290
This is 26.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.480
This is 28.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.920
And so they want to know
everything that weighs more

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.200
than 2,500 pounds.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.680
So everything to the
right of that.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.240
Because all of these tend to
be on integer numbers.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.620
None of them are in between.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.540
And they say, and get more
than 22 miles per gallon.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.350
So let me draw all of the
ones that apply there.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:33.060
So let's see, at 2,600 pounds,
there's two, at 24 and 26

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.310
miles per gallon.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.735
At 2,600 there's two
points right there.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:46.190
At 2,700 there are
three points.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:54.920
1, 2, but the other one falls
on the 22 miles per gallon,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.080
but we're talking about
greater than that.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.573
And then-- let's see, that's 26,
27-- 28 has one down here

00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:03.040
and one up here.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.610
When I say 28, I mean
2,800 pounds.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.470
I'm just trying to
draw it for you.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.690
And then the rest of them.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.940
There's two here and
there's one here.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.570
But all we care about
is the ones in this.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.700
There's a bunch more
over here.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.580
I could draw them real fast, if
you want me to, just so you

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.046
can visualize the graph.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:21.140
So it looks something
like that.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.590
And then there's
one more here.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.033
But all we care about
is this range, and

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:28.480
there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.565
Five of those.

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.190
So the answer is B.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.190
A lot of work for a fairly
straightforward problem.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.430
Let me get some clean space.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.230
Problem 28.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:47.150
How many minutes does it take
John to type y words if he

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.960
types at a rate of x
words per minute?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.850
Now, this is a fairly
straightforward thing, but it

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.450
can get confusing.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.690
Do I divide x by y?

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.480
Y by x?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.170
I think a lot of times this
becomes a lot simpler if you

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.640
just pick numbers.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.640
So if we just phrased it, how
long does it take him to type

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.360
100 words if he can type,
I don't know,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.870
50 words per minute?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.820
Now your brain would say, oh,
if I can do 50 words per

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.280
minute, it's going to take me
2 minutes to do 100 words.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.680
And how did you get 2 minutes?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.290
You said 100 divided by 50.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.510
So if you need to type y words
and you can type at x words

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.370
per minute, the answer
is y divided by x.

00:08:34.895 --> 00:08:38.350
Let's see, that's not
one of the choices.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.590
But I think they've made a
mistake, because this is a

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.179
simple enough problem that
I have conviction.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.330
And if you look at the choices,
choice A and choice

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.820
B, at least in the book I have,
they wrote x/y, so I

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.740
think that's a typo.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.590
One of those probably should
have read y/x.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.720
So I'm going to stick
by my answer.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.800
I think this was another
mistake in the book.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.900
y/x.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.740
You might want to check the
answer key, just to make sure,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.270
but I have no doubt in my
conviction on this one.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.520
Let me see, do I have time
for the next one?

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.760
Well, sure.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.990
Problem 29.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.240
I'm running out of space.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.610
The square root-- this is just
to make sure you know how to

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.990
do square roots-- of 16 times
20, in order of operations,

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.290
plus 8 times 32.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.060
So there's a bunch of ways we
could think about this, but

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.760
the easiest way, instead
of doing all of the

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.440
multiplication, let's see if we
can factor 16 out of both

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.830
of these numbers.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.230
You could multiple them out
and try to figure out the

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.360
square root, but it'll
take you a long time.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.360
So if we rewrite this as
16 times 20 plus, what?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.950
This could also be written
if we took-- 32

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.780
is 16 times 2, right?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.980
So 8 times 32 is the same thing
as 8 times 16 times 2,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.720
which is the same thing
as 16 times 16.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.140
So we could have rewritten
this as 8 times 32

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.110
is 16, times 16.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.580
So if we're factoring
a 16 out, that's 16

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.550
times 20, plus 16.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.380
If you were to just multiply
this out it would be 16 times

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.000
20, plus 16 times 16, which is
the same thing as 8 times 32.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.060
And I'm doing all of this.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.830
You could just do the math
yourself, but it takes a lot

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.470
of time if you don't
have a calculator.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.390
Well now, you can say, well,
this is the same thing as the

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:35.490
square root of 16 times the
square root of 20 plus 16.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.480
Well, this is plus or minus 4,
although I don't think they're

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.120
going to make us worry about
the negative square root.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.290
So let's just say it's 4.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.410
Looking at the choices--yeah,
everything 's positive.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.180
So it's 4 times.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:46.880
And then, what's this?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.190
The square root of 36.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.860
So that equals 4 times 6,
which is equal to 24.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.880
And that's choice B.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.740
Se you in the next video.
