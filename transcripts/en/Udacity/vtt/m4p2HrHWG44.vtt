00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.400
So as a quick quiz, what are some of the advantages of TCP Syn cookies?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.100
Is it that they can be applied to filter traffic in the network core? Is

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.330
it that they can prevent the server

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.900
from exhausting state by setting up socket buffers

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.180
after receiving a TCP Syn? Or is it

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.520
that they can defend against UDP flooding attacks?
