00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.440
The romantic story of love

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.980
tells us that our search for a partner is inspired

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.100
- above all else

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.280
by desire to find someone, who can make us happy.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.380
But the truth is a little bit more confused and peculiar

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.840
for one of the oddest aspects of love

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.440
is in tracking down a mate.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.660
We don't in fact look out just for anyone who seems kind, good and attractive.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.680
We look out for someone, who will fulfill a number of pre-existing psychological requirements,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.060
which could include:

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.300
subterranean appetite for frustration and humiliation.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.900
We are constrained in our love choices by what we've learned of love as children.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.080
Adult love is in central ways a search for rediscovery of emotions first known in childhood.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.440
In order to prove exciting and attractive,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.780
the partner we pick must reawoke many of the feelings we once had around parental figures.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.000
And these feelings, though they may include tenderness and satisfaction,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.280
are also likely to feature a more troubling range of emotions,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.380
perhaps a desire to prove ourselves to someone, who is always slightly skeptical of us,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.500
or feeling of shame around sexuality,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.460
or a need to cheer up someone with depressive tendencies.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.380
We can find ourselves of rejecting certain candidates in adulthood,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.980
not so much because they are wrong,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.860
as because they feel a little bit too right.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.740
That is, we dimly intuit that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.020
they're not going to make us suffer in the ways we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.780
The romantic view of love suggests that we end up in bad relationships by mistake.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.500
The psychological view suggests that we end up in tricky places by unconscious intent;

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740
without being fully aware of our wish,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.900
we need our partner to have a failing that our parents once had

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.200
so that we can repeat the flawed, but potent, dynamic we once had as children.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.700
Though in most cases, we're drawn to people with the very same things as a parent,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.780
occasionally a relationship pays tribute to a parent's failings in a slightly different way:

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.420
we act towards our partner as our parent once acted towards us.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.860
We push the partner into the role we once inhabited as a child.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.360
We may leave our partner uncertain where they stand or deeply aware of their inadequacies.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.960
We may shout at their failures or complain of their inadequate performance in the eyes of the world.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.680
It seems we are fated either to seek out the fault of a parent in a partner

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.720
or to mimic the fault of the parent with a partner.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.580
Either way, the fault of the parent is central to our love choices.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.540
Without it, we may simply not be able to feel passionate or tender with someone.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.680
We might imagine we would only be attracted to admirable traits,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.000
to perfection, to very positive things about a loved one.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
Yet, just below the conscious radar, it is the failings that lure us in.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.880
Because we don't automatically see what we're doing,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.760
it can be helpful to actively try to compare past and present.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.140
For example, to reflect on how a parent is feeling, and then to audit how we often feel around a partner.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.880
Correspondences can be as striking as they are humbling.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.000
We become aware of the tricky strips we're following to want to leave a relationship at once.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.080
But, this implies we might easily be able to overcome the sort of people we're attracted to.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.840
A less dramatic but still hopeful strategy

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.060
is to try to deal more successfully with our compulsions within an existing relationship.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:44.360
What this involves is accepting the extent to which we're liable to be dealing with the issues in our couple with some of the immaturity of a child,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.000
the child we were when we first encountered the compelling flaws of our parents.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.740
We should feel sympathy for ourselves for facing a double challenge in love.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.720
We're attracted to adults who have some of the failings we knew in childhood.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.080
But then in dealing with these failings we have none of the resources, wisdom and competence

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.060
that someone who had enjoyed adequate parenting in relation to them would have been able to master

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.200
The failings we're most attracted to become those we're least set up to deal with

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.020
We love a slightly distant person but we can't deal with the silences

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.460
We're drawn to free spirits but we can't deal with the attendant anxieties

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.480
In other words, our emotional legacy doesn't just involve an attraction to certain failings

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.500
It also involves a style of responding to these failings that's stuck at the level of traumatized childhood.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.380
And typically involves panic, terror, cold withdrawal, projection, shame and obsessive rigidity

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.460
We should untertake an unusual thought experiment

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.480
To imagine the responses that an ideal, mature person

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.820
might display in relation to the challenges we face.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.980
We should imagine what the mature person might do in relation to a partner who was often working

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.420
or who made them feel ashamed of sex

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.440
or who's career was in decline.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.420
A mature person would't be pleased or  unfazed

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.800
but they would have the inner skills to  navigate the rocks calmly.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.760
They would resist jealous rages or silent sulks

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.040
They would know how to wait for the right moment to deliver a point

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.500
They might have the inner freedom  to make a joke out of a problem

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.180
They wouldn't have to crush a weaker party

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Keeping such possibilities in our minds helps us to see

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.700
that our own instinctive responses aren't necessary or normal

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.420
They are the responses of people who underwent a lot of trouble before they had any idea of how to cope with it

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.280
We should create a zone of possibility in which we can regularly imagine

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.400
having a different and more constructive response to our partners audities

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.800
We should accept that the way to have a better relationship is likely to lie not in firing the partner

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.440
We are with them for tricky but firm reasons

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.160
but in doing some internal work to learn better how to cope with the problems we face with them

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.900
We can come to accept that being uncomplicatedly happy in love was never going to be our leading psychological possibility

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.360
given our childhoods.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.020
But that we may gradually learn to make our peace

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.620
with character traits in our partners

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.860
that are as troublesome as they are compelling.
