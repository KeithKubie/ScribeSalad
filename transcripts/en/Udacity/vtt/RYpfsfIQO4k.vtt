So, to recap, we see that humans begin to speak around the same time and follow

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:08.402
predictable patterns of language development. We've seen the importance of

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:11.900
nature, meaning the language areas of our brain, so the Wernicke's area and the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.186
Broca's area, and nurture, meaning our exposure to models who imitate our

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:20.572
language and reinforce our language. We saw that the amount of words a child is

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:25.454
exposed to, is a function of nurture. Psychologists have different theories

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:28.922
regarding language acquisition and there continues to be discussion regarding

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:33.672
these theories. And finally we saw that other species can be taught to use

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:37.312
American sign language and use it to communicate not only with humans but each

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:41.790
other as well. Okay, so now let's move onto thought.
