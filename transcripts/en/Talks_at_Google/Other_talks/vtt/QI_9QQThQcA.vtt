ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.510
Thank you all so much
for making it out.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.730
My name is Artur Oliveira.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm on the authors
at Google team.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.791
And it is my pleasure to
introduce your speaker today.

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.290
A lot of you might
be wondering what

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.050
does serving great
guacamole have

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.110
to do with eradicating poverty?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.700
And the thing is, I don't know.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140
That's why we have
Josh Ruxin here,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.220
who is here today with us to
talk about his brand new book

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.760
"A Thousand Hills
Through Heaven,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.159
Love, Hope, and a
Restaurant in Rwanda."

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.430
Now, the "New York
Times" called it an

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.140
observing and
affecting narrative.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.240
And the book has been receiving
a lot of praise recently,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.330
so this really is a treat.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.730
Josh is on faculty at
Columbia University,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.320
and he's been living
in Rwanda since 2005.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.940
So without further ado, if we
could please welcome up Josh.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.371
JOSH RUXIN: Thank you, Artur.

00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.802
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.150
Hi, everybody.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.910
So, this whole story actually
starts about 30 years ago.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.660
I was a high school
student at the height

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.250
of the Ethiopian famine.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.170
I didn't really
know much about it.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.930
But there was a really
cute upper class woman

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.650
who I saw go into some
meeting after school.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.750
And I thought, huh, I
wonder where she's going,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.630
so I followed her in
and started to learn

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.830
about this incredible
catastrophe that was costing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.360
of course millions
of lives in Ethiopia.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.530
This was back 1984, 1985.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280
And that was actually the very
beginning of my interest in it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.780
all.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.630
A couple years later, it
led to a trip to Ethiopia.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.940
I was just a teenager.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.870
I'd never been outside
of the country before,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.460
and ended up taking a little
plane to the middle of nowhere

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.250
in northern Ethiopia, get out
of the plane on a grassy field.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.210
And everybody
dropped their plows

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.760
and came over to look
at this white teenager

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.900
from Connecticut.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.800
And a teacher came over
and started to translate

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
and asked all the kids
who were gathered around,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.780
how do you think this kid and
the other students got here?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.370
And one kid raised his
hand and says, by mule?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.700
And then another kid points at
me and says, come, in Amharic.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.720
And so I end up walking with
these kids about a mile up

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.500
to this mud-walled classroom.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.140
And there's a poster,
which has got pictures

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.140
of this club from high school
from three years earlier

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.680
that we had sent with an
aid worker years before.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.210
And that for me was that aha
moment that I'm sure all of you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.880
have had in one way or
another about how very, very

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.430
small this planet is,
how you're only ever

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.000
24 hours away from the
poorest places, the most

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.410
desperate places.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.960
And I decided then,
hey, I want to make

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.150
some sort of contribution.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.540
I want to figure out how
to make a difference.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.110
And the next 30
years have been spent

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.650
trying to figure out
how the heck to do that,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.070
because it's not as easy as
just having your heart into it.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.060
So, about eight years ago, now
nine years ago, my wife and I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.770
were just about to be married.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.940
And we were given a very
unusual sendoff gift.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.410
A very wealthy donor and
fundraiser said to us, hey,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.050
I've seen a really
interesting poverty reduction

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.770
program in Kenya and
some other places,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.000
but it's not happening in
Rwanda, and it should be.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.060
So why don't you, Josh, and
with your new wife Alissa,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.170
head to Rwanda and get it going.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
At that time, my wife had
a public health degree

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.350
from Harvard.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.350
She was sick and tired of taking
the subway down to Wall Street,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.350
where she was running a
executive public health

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.960
program at Goldman Sachs.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.600
And she said, sure, let's go.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.790
We'll go for a year or two.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.500
And we never came back.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.300
We got to Rwanda just 10
years after the genocide.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.360
And I'm sure when most of
you think about Rwanda,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.980
that is what you think
about, the "Hotel

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.990
Rwanda," the senseless
horrible slaughter of over

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.630
a million people in a
hundred days back in 1994.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.250
But we actually
arrived in a country

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.040
that, while it certainly bore
the scars of the genocide,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.010
was clean, secure,
beautiful, with wonderful,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.260
welcoming people that was
very much on the move.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.040
It was actually even
then growing at rates

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.830
that would make this
administration very jealous,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.840
nearly double-digit economic
growth rates every year.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.450
So I arrived to start working
at the Millennium Village

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.595
site, which is just down
south of Kigali in a place

00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:13.220
called Mayange.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.210
And it was not booming.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.970
It actually was suffering
from a horrible famine.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.850
The health center as
I found it back then,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.040
this was actually the
ambulance at the health center.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.390
Most days it was shut.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.780
The doors were just not open.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.440
And I asked, how
do you get a nurse?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.405
And they said, well,
you can go find her

00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:39.890
if you've got money
to go find her.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.230
And then compounding everything,
the land had no topsoil.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.640
All the topsoil had
rolled down the hills

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.440
because of deforestation.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.520
And people were
literally starving

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.470
because they couldn't
produce enough food to eat.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.430
So with my colleagues, we
started at the very beginning,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.879
which was, as long as people
are dying from starvation,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.920
no one's really going to
want to listen to a word

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.070
that we have to say.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.590
So we started working on
progressive terracing and line

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.680
planting.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.680
And pretty soon,
those very hills--

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.160
this is a picture taken
from the same exact angle--

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.270
started to green up and
started to produce food.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.620
And that was actually
the very first harvest.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.370
That ended up
changing everything,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.680
because lots of our thinking
around building community

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.150
grew out of the
notion that you need

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.760
to have an integrated
set of interventions

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.080
in order to reduce
poverty ultimately.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.150
And I'll never
forget, one day, one

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.097
of the early adopters in the
community-- who this might well

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:47.930
have been her field.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.750
I can't remember.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.300
Her name's Jacqueline-- she
came up to me, and she said,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.510
you know, Josh, I'm
really angry with you,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.500
because for years I was
the funeral director here.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.680
And we had deaths all the time.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.400
And I actually made
a decent living

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.750
directing those funerals.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.330
But you've put me
out of business.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.880
No one dies here anymore.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.890
And that was the moment that
the whole community really

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.410
started to take over its
development interventions,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.810
completely own it.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.580
And today, we've basically
scaled down that project.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.220
And if it's any sign
of the reduction

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.700
if not virtual
elimination of poverty,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.430
the real estate prices
have gone up fivefold

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.862
since the bottom in 2005 when
people were literally just

00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:39.070
leaving because there was
no reason to be in Mayange.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.440
Oh, that's Jacqueline,
by the way.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.000
So meanwhile, my
wife was in Kigali,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.630
and she was working with
the orphans of the genocide.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.040
And she was working on a
program called Generation Rwanda

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.860
helping some of
these kids get access

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.470
to scholarships for university.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.740
But the vast majority didn't
have access to scholarships.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.590
There weren't enough
donors to pay for them.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:18.220
And Alissa had a huge insight,
which was these kids need jobs.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.130
And with jobs,
they're going to be

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.990
able to put themselves
through university.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.430
I said, great, honey.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.144
What do you propose?

00:08:26.144 --> 00:08:28.060
She said, well, how about
we just open a cafe?

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.560
There's no good place to get
a cup of coffee around here.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.460
So, being a supportive husband,
I said, that sounds great.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.950
I had this vision
of plastic chairs,

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.460
and plastic tables, and maybe
a really nice espresso maker.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.170
And then some investors
put millions of dollars

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:55.230
behind a Starbucks-style
cafe in Kigali.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.770
And she said, OK,
second thought,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.270
let's do something different.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.307
Let's build the best gourmet
restaurant in East Africa.

00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:05.890
So this is actually
the building site.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.380
Alissa found this land.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.130
It's literally just two blocks
away from the famed hotel

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.230
Rwanda, the Hotel
des Mille Collines.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.510
And this is construction
back in 2007

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.360
when my wife was pregnant
with our first child.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.540
And this is the construction
of the magnificent deck

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.000
overlooking all of Kigali.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.310
And eventually Heaven emerged.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.380
That's what it looks like
today just before service.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.570
Most nights we have a lot more
customers than in that picture.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:55.850
And it's been an incredibly
rewarding but on a daily basis

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.220
hugely challenging endeavor.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.500
From the very beginning, most of
our servers, most of our chefs,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.870
most everyone who
works at Heaven

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.300
had never had a job
before and had never

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.460
even set foot in a restaurant.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.200
So the training element of
this hospitality business

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.810
has not gone away.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.210
In fact, we have rotating
chefs and rotating

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.280
front-of-house managers.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.970
So if anyone has any friends out
there, every six months or so,

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.210
people cycle through, usually
from the States and Europe,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.354
to really invest in
the team at Heaven.

00:10:34.354 --> 00:10:35.770
I can send you the
job description

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.470
if you're interested.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:44.170
So what does, I mean
as Artur set this up,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.300
what does serving
up great guacamole

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.406
or great filet mignon have
to do with poverty reduction?

00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:51.780
That was something
that I started

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.240
to figure out very early
on in the enterprise.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.510
One of our first cleaners
was a woman named Solange.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.630
Solange, I don't even
think I knew her name back

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.620
in 2008 when we opened up.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.550
And one day Alissa found
Solange in the kitchen,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.980
like around 11:00 or
so, preparing food.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.880
But she was the cleaner.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.830
And Alissa came
home, and she said,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.380
you won't believe who was
in the kitchen cooking.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.510
I said, who?

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.370
She said the cleaner was.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.380
This is ridiculous.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.150
We've got to sit
down with the staff.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.940
We've got to sit
down with the chefs.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.220
Why are they pawning off
the work onto Solange?

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.450
So that night, we sat down with
the whole kitchen staff just

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.060
before service.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.930
And I said, what
are you all doing?

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.570
Why was Solange in here cooking?

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:50.950
And they replied, well, she
was just making staff meal.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.950
I said, yeah, but
that's your job.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.830
They said, yeah, but
she's the best cook.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.880
So Solange today is actually
the sous chef at Heaven.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.770
She's worked under
Michelin-star chefs.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.910
She makes the best squash
risotto you've ever tasted.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.500
She can knock out without
even planning for it--

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.420
for some reason, when
people come into Heaven,

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.200
they don't make reservations.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200
So people will think
nothing of walking

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.590
into this restaurant in
Central Africa with 30 people

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.420
and expecting world-class
service and world-class food.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.370
And Solange is actually able
to knock those meals right out

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.530
of the kitchen with no problem.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.340
That's Heaven by
night out on the deck.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.540
That's Solange.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.960
Solange, by the way, is
the very first member

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.920
of her entire family
to go to university.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.630
There's about a dozen
kids and family at home

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.100
who are completely
supported by her income.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.710
She pays for their health care.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.020
She pays for their education.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:05.200
And yet Solange doesn't receive
a charitable contribution.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.300
She doesn't receive a
501(c)(3) annual check.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.500
She's working for pay.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.600
And that lesson about
financial sustainability

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.420
really changed my
outlook about how

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.230
to think about what I've been
doing in the public health

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.600
sector.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.787
So in public health, I've
got this organization

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:29.745
called Health Builders.

00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:33.640
You can check it out,
globalhealthbuilders.org.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.590
And we do two things.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.490
We actually take lessons
from Heaven in accounting,

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.780
and human resources,
and in management.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.640
We go into health centers.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.600
We help them improve these
public health centers

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.280
to the point where they
are cash flow positive.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.940
They're real
functional businesses.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.340
And then we do
something landmark.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.830
We actually let them go.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.000
Because that's one of the keys
to doing development right

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.970
is knowing when
you've done your job

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.230
and when everyone can
take over and manage

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.840
the future of the health
center or the restaurant.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.470
Though we're not
there yet with Heaven.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.970
And this is an example
of that thinking

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.580
around financial
sustainability put to use.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.240
This is a health center right
up by the mountain gorillas up

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.100
in the northern
part of the country.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.670
It was co-financed by a
donor, a very generous donor,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.550
and by local funds.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.470
So we put together a public
contract and built it.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.670
And then we trained the staff
up and opened the doors.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.320
There's no plaque there
that says Health Builders.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.910
It is a government of
Rwanda health facility,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.010
and it runs on its own.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.620
So that's really
the way that I see

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.690
the future of
development happening

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.940
is that in countries
like Rwanda, where

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.930
the government cares
about the public's health

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.850
and really cares about real
development and poverty

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.920
eradication, it's going to
be between the public sector

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.360
and the private sector.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.170
The very first night
that Heaven opened,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.980
my country director
for the health work

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.400
is a guy named [INAUDIBLE]
Carabucci, huge guy,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:21.980
really tall.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.400
He says he's 6 foot 6.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.110
I think he's over 7 feet.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:33.300
And he walks in, looks out
over 150 customers in Heaven,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.200
grabs my wife, and says,
we don't need aid anymore.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.430
We don't need donor
assistance anymore in Rwanda.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.180
What we need is a
thousand Heavens.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.460
We actually need
lots of businesses

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.950
like this that are investing
in management training, that

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.599
are generating salaries.

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:54.390
That's what's going to
change this country.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.095
That's what's going
to change the world.

00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:57.720
And actually that
was the working title

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.290
for a while for the book.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:06.210
So, I know that a lot of
people often ask me, well,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.307
how do I have impact?

00:16:07.307 --> 00:16:08.390
I want to become a doctor.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.431
I want to become a nurse.

00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:11.420
Or I want to go to
public health school

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.070
because I want to
make a difference.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:19.110
And my top-level
advice on that front

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.990
is, you don't have to do those
things in order to have impact.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.140
And for that matter, you
don't have to become a martyr,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.540
sacrifice yourself, in
order to have huge impact.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.110
I think that's a little bit
of the conventional wisdom

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.290
is you've got to
give everything up

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.180
in order to reduce poverty
and have social impact.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.780
And our experience has
been much different.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.140
We have a good life.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.130
We've got three kids.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.360
We have high stress, high
anxiety, just like everybody

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.830
does with their jobs.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.350
But we feel really
lucky to live in Rwanda

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.590
and to have the opportunity
to make a contribution

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.520
in a way that is dignifying
and in a way that

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.550
is led by the Rwandan
people and by our friends.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.359
So with that I wanted to
open it up to all of you

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.640
and have a little bit of a
discussion about this very

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.609
large restaurant.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:19.950
We can seat up to 200.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.000
In fact, there were 200 people
in last night, called Heaven.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.800
AUDIENCE: So, it's a high-end
restaurant, and it's serving,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.650
I'm assuming, wealthier people.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.530
Are the people that mostly
come in native Rwandans

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.600
or more tourists?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.840
JOSH RUXIN: It's a split.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.440
So, about a third
of our clientele

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.250
are tourists who have come to
see the gorillas in the mist.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.440
And about a third are expats.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.610
There's over 3,000
Americans, for example,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.160
who live in Kigali.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.100
And about a third are Rwandans,
mainly higher class Rwandans.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.930
But if it's Mother's
Day, if it's a birthday,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:03.340
if it's Christmas Eve or New
Year's, it is a total mix,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.560
and it's almost all Rwandese.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.390
Rwandans actually-- this has
been a real challenge for us--

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.730
don't have a culture of food.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.790
And eating was
actually something

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.050
done at home, done
behind closed doors.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.530
Maybe that grew out of
the scarcity of food

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.270
over generations.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:29.590
And so you will find Rwandese
who drive in Porsche Cayennes,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.650
but they insist
on eating at home.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.740
So it's been a challenge for
us to really teach and educate

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.589
the market about great food
and what that tastes like.

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:43.380
AUDIENCE: And then,
just a quick follow-up,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.630
I guess what I was
wondering is did you

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.780
get any backlash in terms of
having people lift themselves

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.390
out of poverty but also with
this kind of contrasting

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.624
high-end restaurant,
so the idea of people

00:18:55.624 --> 00:18:57.040
taking jobs to
lift themselves out

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.960
of poverty by serving people
that are wealthier than them?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.990
JOSH RUXIN: No.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.690
AUDIENCE: I mean just in
terms of a class issue.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.150
JOSH RUXIN: No, I
don't think over

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.410
the years we've ever
seen that class issue.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.670
AUDIENCE: So the focus is just
really positive on the job

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.522
creation and everything
that's going on?

00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:15.480
JOSH RUXIN: Absolutely.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.816
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:16.490
JOSH RUXIN: Yes.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.740
AUDIENCE: I have two question.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.460
The first one, you mentioned
that you left to Rwanda

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.355
and never came back.

00:19:22.355 --> 00:19:23.980
So the first question
is, what happened

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.755
with the rest of your family,
extended family, friends?

00:19:26.755 --> 00:19:27.630
Were they supportive?

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.090
JOSH RUXIN: Oh, the
family back here--

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.875
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:31.080
JOSH RUXIN: Oh yeah, I
was just about to say,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.827
that whole family's
in Kigali right now.

00:19:32.827 --> 00:19:34.660
AUDIENCE: No, exactly,
that's the first one.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.900
And the second one is that
because of those connection,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.940
maybe, did they help
either via donation

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.360
or some of your friends decided
to go there and help you?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.310
Or did they just
say, hey, good luck.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.780
We wish you the best.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.080
JOSH RUXIN: Well, we are
not independently wealthy

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.730
and when we were
building Heaven ran

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.830
into cost overruns,
cost overruns.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.010
We had actually taken
out a second mortgage

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.840
on our apartment back in New
York City, which of course we

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.530
had had every
intention to return to.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.790
And then we burned through
that second mortgage

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.830
and then contacted
our immediate family

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.540
and asked them to help us
out and write some checks.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.330
And then we burned
through all that.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.450
And we were feeling very
sheepish before even opening

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.350
the doors and turned
to friends and had

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.700
them write checks,
not as donations.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.600
And over the course of
the first two years,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.640
we actually paid off all
the friends and family,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.020
and then just last year paid
off the rest of the debt.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.380
So that's the debt
situation, which isn't really

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.870
what your question
was referring to.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.620
In terms of family
and their reaction,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.786
they come and they visit.

00:20:40.786 --> 00:20:44.230
They always expected
that we would come back.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.280
But here's something
interesting,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.590
which is, when I started
working in development

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.300
back when I graduated
from university,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.450
I remember this
is the early '90s,

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.160
and I was living in Bolivia.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.480
And I would receive a letter
and read the letter every day

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.420
for a month and a half
until I got another letter.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.950
And my kids on a
weekly basis get

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.230
to use Skype video with
their grandparents.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.820
I get to see my
friends all the time.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.790
It is completely transformed
what that experience is.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.730
Literally distance
has been destroyed.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.405
And it's so much easier than
it ever was before to do it.

00:21:30.405 --> 00:21:33.120
Of course, when I tell
my wife that who's

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.770
about to board 32
hours of transport

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.090
with the three kids this
Friday evening, she says,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.300
no, it's not any easier.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.400
Can't we just go on holiday
break in the neighborhood?

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.770
But outside of
that, the families

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.890
have been incredibly supportive.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:52.970
And they love Rwanda.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.430
I mean, everyone has
fallen in love with Rwanda.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.490
It really is this
incredible jewel.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.340
And I think they all see
our hope, and our dream,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.730
and our imagination,
which is, let's not

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.620
leave all the great things
in Rwanda in Rwanda.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.940
Let's expand it.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.500
Let's expand the health
work to other countries.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.820
Let's expand Heaven
to other places.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.350
Actually Alissa opened up a
little boutique guest house

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.230
just last year.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.840
It's been one of the best
parts of the whole business,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.480
and she wants to expand
it to create more jobs

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.255
and hospitality to really get
a feel for the whole spectrum

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:34.710
of what international
consumers are looking for.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.730
AUDIENCE: So you hear a
lot in Uganda and Nigeria

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.720
about sort of the problem
with brain drain and people

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.650
having aspirations to leave
the country for education

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.784
and maybe having
intentions to come back.

00:22:46.784 --> 00:22:48.200
I know Rwanda's a
little different

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.605
with the recent history,
but how is the education

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:51.230
infrastructure?

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.020
Do a lot of people want to
leave Rwanda for education?

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.270
JOSH RUXIN: They certainly do.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.600
But first off, Rwanda is
a tale of exceptionalism

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.190
because the genocide
didn't just happen in 1994.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.470
You've got to go back to
1959 to see its roots.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.120
And from 1959 to 1994, you
had hundreds of thousands

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.670
of people who left the country.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.520
Some lived in refugee camps
in Uganda and elsewhere.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.790
But some made their way to the
States, to the UK, to Belgium.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.220
They got educated, and as
soon as the war was over

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.680
and the genocide was over,
they started coming back in.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.200
And so you literally
had this case

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.930
of the reverse of brain drain.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.610
You had incredibly
skilled people

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.010
who were exposed to
the outside world.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.320
Bear in mind, you
saw the map before.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.410
Rwanda is landlocked.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.390
There's no poor.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.340
It was never on a spice route.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.920
And so critically,
that is in part

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.400
where the prosperity
and the future of Rwanda

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.540
has been pinned, all these
people who actually came back

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.945
with real knowledge
about what's going

00:23:58.945 --> 00:24:01.570
on in the outside world, what's
happening in technology, what's

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.150
happening in business.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.690
So today what
happens, certainly, I

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.000
know lots of students who have
gone abroad and stayed abroad.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.110
But I also know a whole lot who
have gone abroad and come back

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.760
for jobs in tech
and jobs in banking.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.390
I wish they would come
back for jobs at Heaven,

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.400
because that level of
management is really needed.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.416
It's needed at Heaven.

00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:28.790
It's needed in
the health sector.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.980
It's needed in all those areas.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.270
And it is building.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.790
But Rwanda is essentially
a new country, so reborn

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.890
just 19 years ago.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.780
The 20th anniversary is
coming up of the genocide.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.310
And I think a lot of
people with Mandela's death

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.730
are starting to think
about that and remember,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.800
oh yeah, when Nelson Mandela
was elected president-- that

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.420
was in April 1994--
all eyes were on that

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.890
while the genocide was
unfolding in Rwanda.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.640
And I think that
it's unfortunate

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.070
that we look to Africa now, and
we think about Mandela's legacy

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.210
and overlook the fact
that one of the best

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.260
stories of leadership, and
growth, and prosperity,

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.365
and stability on
the entire continent

00:25:13.365 --> 00:25:17.260
and in the entire world is
up to the north in the place

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.916
that I call home.

00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:22.490
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just want to
say I was in Rwanda in 2008,

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.740
and I went to your restaurant.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.280
JOSH RUXIN: Thank you
for being a patron.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.696
AUDIENCE: And it was one of
the most memorable experiences

00:25:26.696 --> 00:25:28.030
I had in Africa.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.630
And I also wondered if you
had any experience starting

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.740
restaurants in the US and if
you ran into any reluctance

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.444
from the local people about an
American starting a business.

00:25:37.444 --> 00:25:39.610
Because when I was there,
I was under the impression

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.770
it was an African-owned
restaurant.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.000
Because we were told
it was run by orphans.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.810
And it didn't have the
feeling of an American

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.607
or a foreign-owned business.

00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:51.940
JOSH RUXIN: That's good to hear.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.750
I guess I wasn't
working that night.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.840
So, I suppose if we had had
any restaurant experience,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.717
we might not have been so
naive as to have gotten

00:26:02.717 --> 00:26:04.300
into this business
in the first place.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.110
It's the world's
hardest business.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:12.400
And Alissa outside of a
short stint as a barista

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.610
had no experienced in
any related industry.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.370
I actually was
always the one who

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.050
wore the apron in
the relationship.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.350
She's cooked, in the
course of our marriage

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.400
and our relationship,
exactly one meal for me.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.139
And that was very early on.

00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:30.680
I've done all the
cooking ever since.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.540
And in the early
days, I actually

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.300
did a lot of the cooking
and a lot of the training

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.590
back in the kitchen.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.670
I love food.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.830
I love cooking.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.190
I am not a chef.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.010
I recognize my
shortcomings, and that's

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.250
why we started bringing
on international chefs

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.610
to think about the management.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.010
And there's so much to
think about in terms

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.030
of inventory and planing.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:57.630
And as Americans in Rwanda
starting up a business

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.440
and starting up a
restaurant, we were embraced.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.210
I mean, it took no
more than 48 hours

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.400
to incorporate the business.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.484
Anyone, any one of you
can come to Rwanda.

00:27:10.484 --> 00:27:11.900
If you've got a
business idea, you

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.270
can literally go to the
Rwanda Development Board,

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.300
incorporate your
business, and get moving.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.260
It is effortless there.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.560
So they really are
welcoming private investment

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.890
and bringing entrepreneurial
skills and management

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.590
to the country.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.635
AUDIENCE: So you said
you weren't there yet

00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:35.780
in terms of handing off
Heaven to be owned maybe

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.190
by the people that work there.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.580
Are there plans to do that?

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.560
What's the timeline?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.670
What does that look like?

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.350
JOSH RUXIN: Well, I think we're
in an interesting position

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.920
right now.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.120
The restaurant and the
inn are doing well.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.630
But it still does take an
enormous amount of effort

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.320
from my wife, and on a really
busy night from both of us.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.580
It's sort of still all
hands on deck because

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.830
of the unpredictability
of the business.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:11.570
And it's very hard to build that
management set in Heaven staff

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.680
and bring them up to
that management level.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.040
We're constantly working on
that and aiming for that.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.450
And I think one of
the solutions for it

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.060
is Heaven actually needs to
grow to be a little bit bigger

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.910
as a business in order to
have international trainers

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.670
constantly on board,
constantly on staff,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.190
so that we can move
on and do other things

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.680
and not be as engaged in
day-to-day management.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.530
That said, compared
to back in 2008,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.120
when Alyssa and I would be
at the restaurant until 1:00

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.960
in the morning
every single night,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.130
and then I went to my day job,
which was in public health.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.670
Compared to those days,
we are very, very far

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.210
advanced and much, much
closer to the realization

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.820
of that sustainability.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.556
But the restaurant business
is a little tricky.

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:03.430
It doesn't matter where
you are in the world.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.710
You know when the
owner is not around.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.750
That's just the
nature of the beast.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.070
And I hope that we can
really get to that point.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:18.630
At the same time, Heaven has
become this incredible platform

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.350
for Alissa in particular
to build out her ideas.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.490
So last Saturday, she hosted
on that beautiful terrace

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:29.100
the very first farmers
market in Rwanda's history

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.680
and got all sorts of
organic growers and people

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.410
producing really
interesting products

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.430
to come in and do that.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.290
There's theater that
happens that she brings in

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.620
and art exhibitions.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.540
And so it's a lot more than just
dishing up food and dishing up

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.210
a great customer experience.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.800
It's also about serving
as a real cultural venue

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.610
to show off all the great things
that are happening in Rwanda.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.860
AUDIENCE: So I was actually
born and raised in Kigali,

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.410
and I'm half Rwandan.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.779
And I went to your
restaurant in 2011.

00:29:58.779 --> 00:29:59.570
It was really good.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.070
And I want to thank you
for spreading the gospel.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.320
But my question was, you
have mentioned many times

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.700
how exceptionally run Rwanda
was and how safe it is.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.680
What are your thoughts
on aid for places

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.440
that aren't run like Rwanda?

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.650
JOSH RUXIN: So as you
will read in the book,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.310
I have pretty
strong views on this

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.920
that when you think about
aid and the level of aid,

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.960
for example, of the US
government in Rwanda,

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.630
it's been well placed
and well positioned.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.360
Rwanda is famous for having some
of the world's lowest levels

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.660
of corruption.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.710
And I'm all for
that kind of aid.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.710
Because when the
government in particular

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.810
cares about the public's health
and the public's development--

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.280
you haven't been
there since 2011?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:54.340
JOSH RUXIN: Wi-Fi is on the
public buses now in Kigali.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.850
It's just extraordinary
the ambition of the place.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.100
But I've worked in so
many other countries

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.440
where government
officials have asked me

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.140
for bribes, where I felt as
though the work of Health

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.190
Builders just could
not take off because

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.200
of the corruption of
the public sector.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.070
And in a world where
realistically, we've

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.430
got finite resources,
sadly, for doing things

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.420
like public health,
I would much rather

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.890
see those funds channeled to
countries like Rwanda that

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:34.120
have a plan for sustainability,
that have a plan for not

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.830
accepting donor
aid in the future

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.050
in building out a tax base
to do it on their own.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.200
And I get enraged
when I see countries

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.380
which have the resources, have
the means, have the wealth

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.530
and just aren't
doing it and yet are

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.800
receiving big chunks of aid.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:59.280
As a humanitarian, I'm compelled
and feel enormous sympathy

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.610
for the poor.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.030
But at the same time,
I feel as though we

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.520
need better systems
and better milestones

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.180
in order to get the
governments to take

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:14.240
this type of development on, and
internalize it, and build out

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.690
what has happened in Rwanda.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.610
In my book, I refer
to five lessons.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.830
And my lesson about what to
say to those countries that

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.690
are incredibly corrupt
that are looking for aid

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.207
relates to the middle finger.

00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:30.790
AUDIENCE: So you
said in the beginning

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:34.150
there was no local cuisine
because people just

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.610
don't eat out.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.560
What is your cuisine?

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.300
And what have you done
to maybe tease out

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.890
the locals to participate?

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.330
JOSH RUXIN: So we've done
a combination of things.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.530
So the main local cuisine
when Rwandese go out

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:51.340
for a traditional meal, it might
be goat brochette, rice, beans,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.950
relatively simple
food with piri piri,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.960
really spicy sauce,
and also maybe

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.520
some matoke in a tomato sauce.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.770
We have a very eccentric menu.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.810
We have got probably our
signature dish, which

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.470
has been on the menu now since
we opened, is our filet mignon.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.320
You want to talk about
green, pasture-fed cows,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.477
I mean, you're not going to find
more sustainably raised cattle

00:33:19.477 --> 00:33:20.810
than what you'll find in Rwanda.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.370
It is a fabulous piece of beef.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.240
And then we smother it in a
cassava chimichurri sauce.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.470
So we take cassava
leaves, which are often

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:33.820
served as a local food in
the form of a sombe, which

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.120
is with palm oil.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.910
And we do it with olive
oil, some garlic, and onion.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.380
And then sometimes we'll
actually take the matoke.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.660
We'll take cream.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.340
We'll take green bananas,
and we'll mash them up

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.560
with some butter
instead of potatoes.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.180
So it has these local
flavors, but it is clearly

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.630
an international dish.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.790
And then I got to
confess, probably

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.300
our most popular
dessert over the years

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.950
has always been our
molten chocolate brownie

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.120
with our homemade ice cream.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.340
Anyway, well, it is so great to
be here with all of you today.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.290
And I want to welcome
you to Heaven.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.605
Come on in.

00:34:12.605 --> 00:34:15.010
You can have a mojito on me.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.880
And come out to Rwanda, and
come have the experience

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.590
of seeing this country that
has so much to show the world.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.560
Lots of people say,
oh, can I come on,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.320
and can I volunteer for
two weeks or three weeks?

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.280
And I say, don't
think that you need

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.570
to come out as a
volunteer to have impact.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.760
You can have impact by
coming out as a tourist,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.620
spending money,
eating in Heaven,

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.210
eating in other restaurants,
giving good customer feedback,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.739
and spreading the word.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:48.909
Because that is a massive source
of national income is tourism.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.739
That really is one of
the top still growing

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.310
exports in the country.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.500
So that is a great
way to be helpful.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.400
Thank you so much.
