about the availability of certain types
 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.639
about the availability of certain types
of drugs and certainly they're going to

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649
of drugs and certainly they're going to
 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.200
of drugs and certainly they're going to
pay attention to it if that drug is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210
pay attention to it if that drug is
 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.900
pay attention to it if that drug is
specific to something that they might

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
specific to something that they might

sure what it does in terms of enhancing

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
sure what it does in terms of enhancing
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.199
sure what it does in terms of enhancing
the public perception of the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
the public perception of the
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.590
the public perception of the

relationship building and i think other

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
relationship building and i think other
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.110
relationship building and i think other
mechanisms and other modes of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
mechanisms and other modes of
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.180
mechanisms and other modes of
communication or definitely needed it to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
communication or definitely needed it to
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.620
communication or definitely needed it to
achieve those goals

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020
well you know I think you know in the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
well you know I think you know in the
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.570
well you know I think you know in the
short term what we can do with an adult

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580
short term what we can do with an adult
 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.520
short term what we can do with an adult
population there that is done with their

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
population there that is done with their
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400
population there that is done with their
formal education is we can figure out a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
formal education is we can figure out a
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.310
formal education is we can figure out a
way to use the media to engage with them

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
way to use the media to engage with them
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.980
way to use the media to engage with them
to present complex issues in ways that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990
to present complex issues in ways that
 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.720
to present complex issues in ways that
they understand and that matters to them

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
they understand and that matters to them
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.000
they understand and that matters to them
as personally relevant that's probably

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
as personally relevant that's probably
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.090
as personally relevant that's probably
the best we can do but in the long term

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100
the best we can do but in the long term
 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.310
the best we can do but in the long term
we need to certainly continue to invest

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
we need to certainly continue to invest
 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100
we need to certainly continue to invest
in really strong formal education and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
in really strong formal education and
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.500
in really strong formal education and
science about the scientific method

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
science about the scientific method
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.080
science about the scientific method
about the facts in the context in the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
about the facts in the context in the
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.440
about the facts in the context in the
history of science but also I think at

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
history of science but also I think at
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.560
history of science but also I think at
the college level especially students

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
the college level especially students
 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.840
the college level especially students
need to learn about the sociology of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850
need to learn about the sociology of
 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.540
need to learn about the sociology of
science the role that the institution of

science plays in our society how its
 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.150
science plays in our society how its
funded the politics of science kind of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
funded the politics of science kind of
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.420
funded the politics of science kind of
the social side of how science is done

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430
the social side of how science is done
 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.620
the social side of how science is done
you know scientists work within

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630
you know scientists work within
 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.270

with your formal education and science
and in that way we're achieving two

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
and in that way we're achieving two
 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.300
and in that way we're achieving two
things one we're providing a

choices about science policy but the
 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.780
choices about science policy but the
second thing that we're doing is we're

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
second thing that we're doing is we're
 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.020
second thing that we're doing is we're
actually socializing college students
