00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.060
We're told that ABCDEF
is a regular hexagon.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.129
And this regular part--
hexagon obviously

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.920
tells us that we're
dealing with six sides.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.169
And you could just count that.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.136
You didn't have to be
told it's a hexagon.

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:13.510
But the regular
part lets us know

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.920
that all of the sides, all six
sides, have the same length

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
and all of the interior
angles have the same measure.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.262
Fair enough.

00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:23.470
And then they give us the
length of one of the sides.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.735
And since this is
a regular hexagon,

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.026
they're actually giving us
the length of all the sides.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.640
They say it's 2
square roots of 3.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.079
So this side right over
here is 2 square roots of 3.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.870
This side over here is
2 square roots of 3.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.495
And I could just go
around the hexagon.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:36.570
Every one of their sides
is 2 square roots of 3.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020
They want us to find the
area of this hexagon.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.460
Find the area of ABCDEF.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.890
And the best way
to find the area,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.306
especially of
regular polygons, is

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:46.760
try to split it
up into triangles.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.710
And hexagons are a
bit of a special case.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.168
Maybe in future
videos, we'll think

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:52.354
about the more general
case of any polygon.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.270
But with a hexagon, what
you could think about

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
is if we take this
point right over here.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.730
And let's call this
point G. And let's say

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.335
it's the center of the hexagon.

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:03.640
And when I'm talking about
a center of a hexagon,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.879
I'm talking about a point.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.000
It can't be equidistant
from everything

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.746
over here, because
this isn't a circle.

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:10.120
But we could say
it's equidistant

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.910
from all of the vertices,
so that GD is the same thing

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.120
as GC is the same thing as GB,
which is the same thing as GA,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.310
which is the same thing as GF,
which is the same thing as GE.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.220
So let me draw some of those
that I just talked about.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.100
So that is GE.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.690
There's GD.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.750
There's GC.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.410
All of these lengths are
going to be the same.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.040
So there's a point
G which we can

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.562
call the center of this polygon.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:37.020
And we know that this length
is equal to that length, which

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.940
is equal to that length, which
is equal to that length, which

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.260
is equal to that length,
which is equal to that length.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.400
We also know that
if we go all the way

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.410
around the circle like that,
we've gone 360 degrees.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.500
And we know that these
triangles are all

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.341
going to be congruent
to each other.

00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.340
And there's multiple ways
that we could show it.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.484
But the easiest way is,
look, they have two sides.

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:02.150
All of them have this
side and this side

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.570
be congruent to each other
because G is in the center.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.220
And they all have
this third common side

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.400
of 2 square roots of 3.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.530
So all of them,
by side-side-side,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.910
they are all congruent.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.520
What that tells us is,
if they're all congruent,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.270
then this angle, this interior
angle right over here,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.970
is going to be the
same for all six

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.450
of these triangles over here.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.950
And let me call that x.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.730
That's angle x.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.750
That's x.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.600
That's x.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.440
That's x.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.340
That's x.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.030
And if you add them all up,
we've gone around the circle.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.720
We've gone 360 degrees.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.520
And we have six of these x's.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.890
So you get 6x is
equal to 360 degrees.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.350
You divide both sides by 6.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.830
You get x is equal
to 60 degrees.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.024
All of these are
equal to 60 degrees.

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:52.440
Now there's something
interesting.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.934
We know that these triangles--
for example, triangle GBC--

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.100
and we could do that for
any of these six triangles.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.204
It looks kind of like a
Trivial Pursuit piece.

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:02.370
We know that they're
definitely isosceles triangles,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.900
that this distance is
equal to this distance.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.360
So we can use that
information to figure out

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.560
what the other angles are.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.200
Because these two base angles--
it's an isosceles triangle.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.350
The two legs are the same.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.205
So our two base
angles, this angle

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:16.830
is going to be
congruent to that angle.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.570
If we could call that
y right over there.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.600
So you have y plus
y, which is 2y,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.090
plus 60 degrees is going
to be equal to 180.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.040
Because the interior
angles of any triangle--

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040
they add up to 180.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.090
And so subtract 60
from both sides.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.610
You get 2y is equal to 120.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.830
Divide both sides by 2.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.819
You get y is equal
to 60 degrees.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.860
Now, this is interesting.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.985
I could have done this with
any of these triangles.

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.690
All of these triangles
are 60-60-60 triangles,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.710
which tells us-- and
we've proven this earlier

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.110
on when we first
started studying

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400
equilateral triangles--
we know that all

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.270
of the angles of a
triangle are 60 degrees,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.520
then we're dealing with an
equilateral triangle, which

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.980
means that all the sides
have the same length.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.795
So if this is 2 square
roots of 3, then so is this.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:04.430
This is also 2
square roots of 3.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.350
And this is also 2
square roots of 3.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.070
So pretty much all
of these green lines

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.069
are 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.300
And we already knew, because
it's a regular hexagon,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.020
that each side of
the hexagon itself

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.930
is also 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.579
So now we can essentially
use that information

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.560
to figure out--
actually, we don't even

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.770
have to figure this part out.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.210
I'll show you in a
second-- to figure out

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.030
the area of any one
of these triangles.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.100
And then we can
just multiply by 6.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.350
So let's focus on this
triangle right over here

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.080
and think about how
we can find its area.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.110
We know that length of DC
is 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.820
We can drop an
altitude over here.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.910
We can drop an altitude
just like that.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.730
And then if we drop
an altitude, we

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.591
know that this is an
equilateral triangle.

00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:51.340
And we can show very
easily that these two

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.370
triangles are symmetric.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.250
These are both 90-degree angles.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.050
We know that these two are
60-degree angles already.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.324
And then if you look
at each of these two

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:01.490
independent triangles, you'd
have to just say, well,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.615
they have to add up to 180.

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:04.490
So this has to be 30 degrees.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.920
This has to be 30 degrees.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.500
All the angles are the same.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.360
They also share
a side in common.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.600
So these two are
congruent triangles.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.090
So if we want to find the area
of this little slice of the pie

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.600
right over here,
we can just find

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.760
the area of this slice,
or this sub-slice,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.070
and then multiply by 2.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.430
Or we could just find this
area and multiply by 12

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.050
for the entire hexagon.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.250
So how do we figure out
the area of this thing?

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.660
Well, this is going to be
half of this base length,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.380
so this length right over here.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.820
Let me call this
point H. DH is going

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.890
to be the square root of 3.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.835
And hopefully we've
already recognized

00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:42.070
that this is a
30-60-90 triangle.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.690
Let me draw it over here.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.000
So this is a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.849
We know that this length over
here is square root of 3.

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.390
And we already
actually did calculate

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.010
that this is 2
square roots of 3.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.734
Although we don't
really need it.

00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:00.150
What we really need to figure
out is this altitude height.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.300
And from 30-60-90
triangles, we know

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.380
that the side opposite
the 60-degree side

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.300
is the square root
of 3 times the side

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.180
opposite the 30-degree side.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.110
So this is going
to be square root

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.830
of 3 times the square root of 3.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.740
Square root of 3 times
the square root of 3

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.990
is obviously just 3.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.800
So this altitude right over
here is just going to be 3.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.980
So if we want the area
of this triangle right

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.290
over here, which is this
triangle right over here,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.560
it's just 1/2 base times height.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.370
So the area of this
little sub-slice

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.200
is just 1/2 times our base,
just the base over here.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.740
Actually, let's
take a step back.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.615
We don't even have to
worry about this thing.

00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:46.230
Let's just go straight to
the larger triangle, GDC.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.545
So let me rewind
this a little bit.

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:51.170
Because now we have the base and
the height of the whole thing.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.670
If we care about the area
of triangle GDC-- so now

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.490
I'm looking at this entire
triangle right over here.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.230
This is equal to 1/2
times base times height,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.589
which is equal to
1/2-- what's our base?

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:09.630
Our base we already know.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.369
It's one of the
sides of our hexagon.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:12.410
It's 2 square roots of 3.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.510
It's this whole thing
right over here.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.965
So times 2 square roots of 3.

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:19.090
And then we want to multiply
that times our height.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.910
And that's what we just figured
out using 30-60-90 triangles.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.710
Our height is 3.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.560
So times 3.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.420
1/2 and 2 cancel out.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.860
We're left with 3
square roots of 3.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.440
That's just the area of
one of these little wedges

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.270
right over here.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.000
If we want to find the
area of the entire hexagon,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.460
we just have to
multiply that by 6,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.690
because there are six of
these triangles there.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.840
So this is going to be equal
to 6 times 3 square roots of 3,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.810
which is 18 square roots of 3.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.650
And we're done.
