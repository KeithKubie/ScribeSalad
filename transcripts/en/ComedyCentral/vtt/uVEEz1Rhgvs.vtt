Hi, how are you?

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
Good. How are you?

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.211 align:start position:0%
We're protesting the use
of animals in circuses here.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.648
So, I hope you guys don't plan
on going to any animal circuses.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.984 size:88% position:56%
No, I don't like the circus.
It stinks.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.152 size:59% position:70%
Would you
consider yourself

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.155 size:66% position:67%
the Black Panthers

You know what I'm saying?

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.825 size:88% position:44%
I would say it's the civil-
rights movement for animals.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.693 size:78% position:61%
The civil-rights movement
for animals?

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.897
Yes, I think Martin Luther King
was an inspiration,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
and if we could be the
Martin Luther King for animals,

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.669 align:start size:97% position:3%
why not, you know?

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:38.137 align:start size:41% position:59%
What?!

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.440 size:88% position:56%
If you could be reincarnated
as any animal,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.741 align:start size:59% position:41%
what would you be?

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.409 size:66% position:33%
I'd probably choose
the wolf.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.012 align:end position:100%
Well, if you were a wolf,
you would be eating sheep.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.248 align:start position:0%
No, I'd probably make friends
with the baby lambs.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.250 align:end position:100%
So, you're saying you would be,
like, a vegan wolf?

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.119 size:66% position:33%
I'd probably be
a vegan wolf, yeah.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.521 align:start size:47% position:53%
All right.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.056
You ought to try
that good vegan diet.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.591 line:91%
You'll notice
a difference.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.591 align:start size:19% position:81%
Yeah?

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.226
Yeah, the ladies
will notice a difference

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.961

I swear to you.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.763 align:end size:94% position:94%
My performance
is top-notch.

it to even the next level.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.302 align:end position:100%
There's not many women
that can handle that.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.704 size:66% position:33%
I eat absolutely
no animal products.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.606 size:88% position:56%
Animals think
other animals are delicious,

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.808 align:end position:100%
so why shouldn't I think
that<i> they're</i> delicious?

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.877 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, pigs are
smarter than dogs.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.947
That's why they taste great --
'cause they got a better diet.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.015 align:start size:59% position:41%
They taste<i> so</i> good.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.917 size:63% position:31%
Is a palate
more important

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.819
than the life
of a sentient being that's born?

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.054 align:start size:44% position:56%
Yes. Yes.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:28.988 size:63% position:31%
Well, then,
you're not someone

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.690 size:75% position:38%
I would ever ask to have
as a friend.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.458 align:end position:100%
And I probably wouldn't want to
spend time with you, either,

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.127 align:end position:100%
'cause you'd be like,
"Why are you eating that?"

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.461 size:59% position:70%
You'd keep saying
stuff like --

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:38.231 align:start position:0%
No, I live with two meat-eaters
my entire last four years,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.899 align:start size:94% position:6%

any one of them.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.534 size:63% position:31%
I never questioned
what they did.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:42.702 size:63% position:31%
I have respect
for people.

Wait.
You have roommates?

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.774 align:end position:100%
So, you don't think
there's a couple elephants that,

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:51.310 align:end position:100%
despite the abuse, they get
out there, they see the people,

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:52.645 size:75% position:63%
like,
"It's my time to shine"?

If you could come back
as an animal, what would you be?

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.258
I used to want to be a dolphin,
but you know,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.661 size:88% position:44%
I don't know if you're aware
of the Taiji Cove.

No.

the documentary "The Cove."

"Game of Thrones" yet.

Dolphins rape sometimes.
Have you googled that?

Yeah, I have, actually.
