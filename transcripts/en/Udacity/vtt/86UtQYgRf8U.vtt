00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
So the first one, from a computational perspective, NP-complete problems

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.790
are the hardest ones out there.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.130
This is actually false. There are much harder problems.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.120
For example, problems that are in the complexity class P space,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.550
or exponential space, or any number of other complexity classes.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.810
The second one is also false.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
P=NP would not imply that all NP-complete problems are solvable in practice.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.260
We might still have huge polynomials.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.700
For instance, we might have a polynomial that is n to some very, very large number,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.200
and in practice this is still not going to be solvable.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.010
P=NP isn't necessarily going to imply that we can solve these problems in practice.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.080
The third statement is true.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.530
All NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM.

00:00:49.530 --> 99:59:59.000
That's more or less the definition of what it means for a problem to be an NP.
