00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.220
At last, we're ready to apply a model.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.430
As you know from other courses you may have taken,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.320
there are many options to choose from.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.170
For example, neural networks, kernel density estimators, or

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.310
KDEs, linear regression, or polynomial regression.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.640
Before telling you about which model I chose,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.860
why don't you tell us which model you would choose and why.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.150
It could be one of the models I mentioned or a completely different model.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.390
Why don't you share your thoughts with your fellow students in the forum post

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.630
that we have linked to in the instructor comments below?
