00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.770
The Inventor of the PEZ

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.860
As a teenager, the inventor of the PEZ confectionery
created one of the world’s first ready-made

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.000
cake mixes, popularly selling it throughout
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.570
The teenager was Eduard Haas III.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.280
Haas III’s grandfather, Eduard Haas I, was
a doctor who invented a type of “light”

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.760
baking powder which he advocated over yeast
in recipes as he felt it was easier on people’s

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.070
digestive systems.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.450
As a teen, Haas III began selling and promoting
his grandfather’s baking powder at his father’s

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.190
wholesale grocery store.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.680
While the packets of baking powder Haas III
sold came with a recipe book and suggestions

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.620
on how much to use as a substitute for yeast
in recipes, Haas III got the bright idea one

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.960
day to save people the trouble of having to
measure out all the ingredients for Gugelhupf

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.120
cakes, a type of torus shaped Bundt cake made
with raisins and almonds embedded in the cake.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.690
Thus, in 1914, he started putting together
packets of the necessary ingredients for Gugelhupf

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.190
cake all mixed together, called “Hasin,
the Ready-Made Health Sponge Cake Mix”.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.289
About four years later, the now 20 year old
Haas III began creating a line of other products

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.689
including Haas Pudding Powder, Vanillin Sugar,
and a gelling aid called Quittin, which also

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.929
all sold quite well.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.409
Now with his baking business booming, Haas
III decided to branch out and helped develop

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.829
a method of cold pressing peppermint into
small “peppermint bonbon” bricks.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.670
He distributed these to various friends and
colleagues to get feedback on the peppermint

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.429
candies and they were received well, so he
went forward with selling “Pfefferminze”

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.679
or “PEZ” to the public in small tins.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.090
Fast forward to the 1940s where Haas III decided
to start marketing PEZ as a substitute for

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.100
cigarettes, specifically targeting people
who were trying to quit smoking.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.349
(Haas III was a staunch anti-smoking advocate).

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.850
He reasoned that people who were trying to
quit smoking would have the habit of needing

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.889
to put something in their mouths, so hoped
they’d use his confectionery bricks.

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.729
His slogan for this was, “Smoking prohibited,
PEZing allowed”

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.539
Towards this end, in 1947 Haas III decided
that instead of putting PEZ in tins, as he

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.249
had before, they should be put in a device
that would look like a cigarette lighter,

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.129
which would also make it easy to share PEZ
with others in a hygienic fashion.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.230
Haas III then enlisted the aid of Oscar Uxa
to create this new dispenser, called a “PEZ

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.400
box”, or on the patent a “Pocket Article
Dispensing Container”, which sold very well

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.860
over the next few years.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.950
Up to this point, PEZ was marketed solely
at adults, including advertising with risqué

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.950
“PEZ girls”.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.530
They didn’t begin marketing to children
until the 1950s when Haas III and co. were

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.709
trying to sell PEZ in the U.S., without much
success.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.280
At the urging of Curtis Allina, VP in charge
of U.S. operations, they switched gears and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.219
began targeting children in the United States,
including creating fruit flavored bricks,

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.750
instead of just peppermint PEZ, and beginning
to create character based PEZ dispensers,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.610
which were initially full body molds, rather
than just heads on a uniform box base as they

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.610
are today.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.980
These character based PEZ dispensers were
a huge hit and helped make PEZ a relatively

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.380
popular confectionary, even to this day.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.459
Bonus Facts:
• While Haas III tried to use peppermint

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.439
(and the menthol in it) to help people stop
smoking, the cigarette industry went the other

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.569
way with that, using it to get people to smoke
more.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.560
Specifically, menthol works fairly well as
a short term reliever for sore throats and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.050
other minor mouth, nose, and throat irritations.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.599
Thus, adding menthol to cigarettes helps sooth
the smoker’s irritated throats, allowing

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.219
for more smoking without immediate added discomfort.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.819
• On that note, menthol also works well
to help sooth certain cold and flu symptoms.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.329
It also has been shown to help relieve bloating
and pain from menstrual cramps.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.030
Menthol also works well in conjunction with
aloe as a good sunburn treatment.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.739
The cooling sensation it provides helps ease
the pain.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.109
Besides that, Menthol works decently as a
low level pesticide and as a good mosquito

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.109
repellant.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.900
Not only will it repel mosquitoes, but mint
oil also will kill them if they come in close

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:08.829
contact with it.
