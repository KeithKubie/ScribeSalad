00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:04.661
 Most of us have experienced a rush of great fear - when your heart beats hard and your fingers are sweating 

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:10.740
 And breathe very quickly, but those symptoms can really be that-boo! Did you hide? It's an experience for the whole body 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.041
 And may be dangerous at times, but can you really die of fear? 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.331
 Science indicates that the majority of known fears today, often stop 

00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:25.011
 On those that killed our ancestors, animal phobia as spiders' terror, the phobia of the natural environment 

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:29.851
 Such as terror from the highlands, fear of certain conditions such as fear of closed places, fear of operations involving blood 

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.311
 Like the fear of the needles, these are the four famous sections today, 

00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:39.250
 It is really meaningful, because most of them have been relatively constant threat throughout our development 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.641
 As a result, the genes instinctively prepare to avoid them and thus become common 

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.461
 Because genes do not disappear, when you have one of those fears there are chances that you are their heir 

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:49.511
 Of your parents 

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.930
 Of course, learning things from day to day is your personal concern, and in the end 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 It's not a realistic threat, but instead it's just your perception of a threat that controls 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 How much fear you feel 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.411
 So, can fear kill you? The short answer is yes, do not try to scare you, of course 

00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:09.751
 The chances of dying of fear depend to a large extent on the health of your heart 

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.681
 When you are afraid, your reaction to the fight or the movement is triggered and the adrenaline is released, making the heart beating faster 

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.991
 To pump more blood and oxygen to your muscles, and as a result become - 

00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:23.491
 Stronger and faster, but something really scary can make this excessive 

00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.801
 And thus your heart can not endure, which may destroy the soft tissues of the heart 

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.321
 And may even make it stop the pulse 

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:33.510
 Thousands of athletes have experienced this deadly rush of adrenaline as a result of simulation 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.321
 Threats During intense competition, you are not immune to your presence in the stadium, studies have shown 

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.391
 The number of heart attacks during World Cup matches is more than double in the states 

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.741
 And cities, where the home team was defeated 

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:49.000
 So should you lock yourself in a closet away to avoid all these fears? The truth is 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 While scientists do not know exactly who is the most vulnerable, we know the incidence of this 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 Too low for people who have hearts that work properly. More food for thought is thought for itself 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 It turns out that our exercise for ourselves to think differently about fears can actually be reduced 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.500
 The amount of adrenaline to the amount produced 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.101
 But it is not always that easy, and some people have some crazy fears 

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:12.161
 In fact our friend Matthew has just released a video about 10 very strange concerns DH :)
