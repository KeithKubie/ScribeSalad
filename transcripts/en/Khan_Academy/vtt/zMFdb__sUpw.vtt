00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:01.983
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:04.438
is calculate a typical measure

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:07.049
of how well the actual data points

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.045
agree with a model, in
this case, a linear model

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.125
and there's several names for it.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.766
We could consider this to
be the standard deviation

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.330
of the residuals

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.833
and that's essentially what
we're going to calculate.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.870
You could also call it
the root-mean-square error

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.249
and you'll see why it's called this

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.848
because this really describes
how we calculate it.

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:30.230
So, what we're going to do

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.399
is look at the residuals
for each of these points

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.274
and then we're going to find
the standard deviation of them.

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:38.825
So, just as a bit of review,

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:42.992
the ith residual is going to
be equal to the ith Y value

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:46.112
for a given X

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.991
minus the predicted Y value

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:50.723
for a given X.

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.594
Now, when I say Y hat right over here,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:56.875
this just says what would
the linear regression predict

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:57.811
for a given X?

00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.695
And this is the actual Y for a given X.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.736
So, for example, and we've
done this in other videos,

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.937
this is all review,

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:08.218
the residual here when X is equal to one,

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:10.301
we have Y is equal to one

00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:13.982
but what was predicted by the model

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:17.232
is 2.5 times one minus two which is .5.

00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:19.780
So, one minus .5,

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.434
so this residual here,

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:26.246
this residual is equal to one

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:28.829
minus 0.5 which is equal to 0.5

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:32.799
and it's a positive 0.5

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.043
and if the actual point is above the model

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:38.128
you're going to have a positive residual.

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:40.378
Now, the residual over here

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:45.381
you also have the actual point
being higher than the model,

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.235
so this is also going to
be a positive residual

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:51.546
and once again, when X is equal to three,

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.213
the actual Y is six,

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.962
the predicted Y is 2.5 times three,

00:01:57.962 --> 00:02:00.962
which is 7.5 minus two which is 5.5.

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:04.907
So, you have six minus 5.5,

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:09.019
so here I'll write residual
is equal to six minus 5.5

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.852
which is equal to 0.5.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.560
So, once again you have
a positive residual.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.956
Now, for this point that
sits right on the model,

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:20.997
the actual is the predicted,

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:24.227
when X is two, the actual is three

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.459
and what was predicted
by the model is three,

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.623
so the residual here is
equal to the actual is three

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:32.018
and the predicted is three,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.814
so it's equal to zero

00:02:33.814 --> 00:02:36.231
and then last but not least,

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:38.231
you have this data point

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.394
where the residual is
going to be the actual,

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.894
when X is equal to two is two,

00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:47.938
minus the predicted.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:49.774
Well, when X is equal to two,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.906
you have 2.5 times two,

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:56.600
which is equal to five
minus two is equal to three.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.458
So, two minus three is
equal to negative one.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.579
And so, when your actual is
below your regression line,

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.467
you're going to have a negative residual,

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.725
so this is going to be
negative one right over there.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:10.150
Now we can calculate
the standard deviation

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.807
of the residuals.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.589
We're going to take this first residual

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:14.672
which is 0.5,

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.617
and we're going to square it,

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:20.970
we're going to add it
to the second residual

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.058
right over here, I'll use
this blue or this teal color,

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.641
that's zero, gonna square that.

00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:32.252
Then we have this third
residual which is negative one,

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:36.715
so plus negative one squared

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.992
and then finally, we
have that fourth residual

00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:40.939
which is 0.5 squared,

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.271
0.5 squared,

00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:47.899
so once again, we took
each of the residuals,

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.564
which you could view as the distance

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:52.436
between the points and what
the model would predict,

00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:53.898
we are squaring them,

00:03:53.898 --> 00:03:55.556
when you take a typical
standard deviation,

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:57.968
you're taking the distance
between a point and the mean.

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.200
Here we're taking the
distance between a point

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.628
and what the model would have predicted

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:04.818
but we're squaring each of those residuals

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:07.026
and adding them all up together,

00:04:07.026 --> 00:04:10.086
and just like we do with the
sample standard deviation,

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:13.505
we are now going to divide by one less

00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:17.162
than the number of residuals
we just squared and added,

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:18.816
so we have four residuals,

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:22.519
we're going to divide by four minus one

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.815
which is equal to of course three.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:30.595
You could view this part as
a mean of the squared errors

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:33.871
and now we're gonna take
the square root of it.

00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:38.029
So, let's see, this is going
to be equal to square root

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.946
of this is 0.25, 0.25,

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.833
this is just zero,

00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:50.538
this is going to be positive one,

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:52.625
and then this 0.5 squared

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.805
is going to be 0.25,

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:57.222
0.25, all of that over three.

00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.820
Now, this numerator is going to be 1.5

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.129
over three, so this is
going to be equal to,

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.005
1.5 is exactly half of three,

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:11.259
so we could say this is equal

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.842
to the square root of one half,

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.157
this one over the square root of two,

00:05:17.157 --> 00:05:20.240
one divided by the square root of two

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:24.881
which gets us to,

00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.545
so if we round to the nearest thousandths,

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:29.128
it's roughly 0.707.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.431
So, approximately 0.707.

00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.621
And if you wanted to visualize that,

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.649
one standard deviation of
the residuals below the line

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:44.151
would look like this,

00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:46.394
and one standard deviation above the line

00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:48.989
for any given X value would
go one standard deviation

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:50.946
of the residuals above it,

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:53.658
it would look something like that.

00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:57.048
And this is obviously just
a hand-drawn approximation

00:05:57.048 --> 00:06:00.948
but you do see that this does
seem to be roughly indicative

00:06:00.948 --> 00:06:03.476
of the typical residual.

00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:04.424
Now, it's worth noting,

00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:07.126
sometimes people will say
it's the average residual

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:10.227
and it depends how you
think about the word average

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.819
because we are squaring the residuals,

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.522
so outliers, things that are
really far from the line,

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:18.001
when you square it are going to have

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:20.121
disproportionate impact here.

00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.663
If you didn't want to have that behavior

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:24.058
we could have done
something like find the mean

00:06:24.058 --> 00:06:25.961
of the absolute residuals,

00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:27.874
that actually in some ways
would have been the simple one

00:06:27.874 --> 00:06:31.233
but this is a standard way of
people trying to figure out

00:06:31.233 --> 00:06:35.566
how much a model disagrees
with the actual data,

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:39.177
and so you can imagine
the lower this number is

00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.927
the better the fit of the model.
