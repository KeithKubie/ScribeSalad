1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180
I think,

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,580
I think the first time we spoke as I
had written that thing about Louis and

3
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:04,080
after Louise and the whole news,

4
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,810
but Louie [inaudible] you
had all that love that piece.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,560
But there was so honest.
Yeah, it was on Facebook.

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,200
What's where I did a lot of my best
way to explain what you were saying to

7
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:16,250
people that didn't read it after
Louis. A lot of people, uh,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,130
were rightly criticized and conduct
and you know, the whole me too thing.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,620
That's all valid and true.
100% needs to happen.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,540
But then there were people that were like,
you know,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,900
Louie was never funny or
literally was just, you know,

12
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,910
of course he got all these things. He was
a white guy or, and I'm like, wait, what?

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,250
And they were like, well, he
said this word I don't like,
we'll look at this joke.

14
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:39,510
And I'm like, guys, a week
ago he was a comic genius.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,220
We all agreed on that. That was a
widely held belief. Now out of nowhere,

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,170
he's not that funny.
And,

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,470
and these people are tweeting this from
parking lots where they're performing

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,950
some of the shows in la, or I'd
like someone's driveway, you know,

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,710
and which is fine. I do them.
I have no problem with that.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,940
But they're getting on Twitter
and knocking Louis from
the back of a parking lot

21
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,300
where they're doing a show. But what
you, the reason you gave for why? Well,

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,150
because these, there's, in any industry,

23
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,990
people are going to get
ahead by being agreeable,

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,620
by having the right opinions,
by crowd sourcing their opinions,

25
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,920
by taking the temperature of the room
and going, how does everyone feel?

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,430
And those people are,
you know,

27
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,590
they're careerists are very
good at office politics.

28
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,660
They're very good at
having the right friends,

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,810
but their contributions
are never really important.

30
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,130
Our long lasting because they never get
great because they don't take any risk.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,550
Because I think greatness is something
you have to risk constantly to get to

32
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:42,270
that level. So a lot of these people
do very well. They make money, they're,

33
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,350
they're successful,

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,400
but they are careerist and
they're looking for comfort.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,710
And so when it was comfortable and safe
to attack Louie and to bring Louie down

36
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:54,900
and to elevate themselves,
they did it.

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,130
But they didn't do it when it could
have hurt their career a week earlier,

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,120
you know?

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,120
So to me it was very disingenuous and
the fact that more people weren't calling

40
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,111
it out,
and I,

41
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:09,720
and I made that point where I said the
same thing on the other side of people

42
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,630
who styled themselves like
I'm a free speech warrior,

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm this anti PC in their
whole entire persona is,

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,940
is that the need to say the n word?
They're like,

45
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,650
I can't do a joke if the punchline isn't
fact. Like they're like, we have to. Yeah.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,270
So those to me are kind of
the same people and they're,

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,180
they're the people that are just trying
to arrange the world in a way that

48
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,750
allows them to succeed.
Those are the types of people also,

49
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,880
like you were talking
about the actor in the,

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,300
you mean they're putting on a facade?
Yeah.

51
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,400
That's not who they've adopted a
predetermined pattern of behavior.

52
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,520
100% that predetermined
pattern of behavior might be,

53
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,660
I'm a guy I drink every night.
We go hard. I'm an artist,

54
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:53,460
I smoked cigarettes, I don't give a
fuck. I'm not trying to get on TV.

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,250
Yes. So to me it was like
incredibly disingenuous.

56
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,130
You had all these people and a lot of
them are angry and they're doing fine.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,560
Yeah. Like some of them are telling
like some of these people are,

58
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:06,070
have their own shows and they're getting
angry at Louie and getting angry.

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,450
And I'm like, there's a, there's a real,

60
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,610
because here's the thing are you should
fear told me something made a lot of

61
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,440
sense once he goes,
it's,

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,490
it can really be a waste to get into
this type of business and ended up in an

63
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,820
office writing for show you
don't care about in a job.

64
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:23,320
You hate punching a clock.
And that stuck with me and always like,

65
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,490
it might be harder to go the other way
and to build a fan base and to do what

66
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,320
you want,
but it's gonna be,

67
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,170
it's gonna be better in the end
and you're not going to be angry.

68
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,790
You're not going to be resentful.

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,010
And I think a lot of the people that
were were against shitting on his comedy,

70
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,090
not so much his behavior,
but it's comedy are people that are,

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,010
would want more in this than they have.

72
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,520
And they're resentful at
guys like Louie because it,

73
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,250
it's not fair how talented he is.
Well, it's not just how talented he is,

74
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,420
his work ethic, every factors,
the risks that he does take.

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,770
I mean, he, he says controversial things.
He always has. Whether you agree or not.

76
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,610
Like one of the things about
the Parkland thing, you know,

77
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,600
when he got in trouble
about, uh, you know,

78
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,630
say that all you did was put some
fat kid out of the way. Yeah.

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,020
That is so consistent with his material.

80
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,220
The idea that anybody's saying
like, oh my God, he's punching down.

81
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,740
Like you need to go review his material.
Right.

82
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:24,741
Because he said a lot of
risky shit because it was
funny and he had really good

83
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,900
points about it. Yeah. No. Is
that something that I would
joke about? Probably not,

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,860
but he did. You wouldn't talk
about fat people? Uh, yes I would,

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,900
but I don't think I would joke about
kids getting shot. It's a tough take.

86
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,470
Yeah. Funny. But that's what
I, yeah, but I think he could.
I think honestly we were,

87
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,660
you're dealing with first
of all the embryo of a bit.

88
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,080
I mean he's really only been doing
standup again for a couple of months.

89
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:55,081
If back then it was even less and I think
ultimately his idea that bet is that

90
00:04:55,421 --> 00:05:00,070
bit rather is that kids today like they
want to be a VA and have them and they

91
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,700
have 78 different genders and why am I,
why are you interested?

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,030
You're interesting because
you didn't get shot. Right.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,120
That is his take on it and he probably
with overall reaction and anticipation of

94
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,410
reaction probably would have
eliminated that part of the bit. Sure.

95
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,140
And you know what I'm saying,
like you know how it works and destruct.

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,760
I think part of it is too,

97
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,810
I was attracted to comedy because
of guys like Bill Hicks or Patricia,

98
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,800
that people that can think the
things that those guys said.

99
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,710
You could only say on a stage
if you were really funny. Right.

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,690
That's what I love about comedy.
Me Too.

101
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,400
That doesn't mean that
everyone has to love that.

102
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,410
There's people that love it for a
million different reasons. Sure.
