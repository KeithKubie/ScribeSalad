00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.150
ERIC BIDELMAN: All right,
hey everybody.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.540
So we're here with a couple of
folks from the Geo Developer

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.840
Relations Team, and I'm
from the Chrome

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.650
Developer Relations team.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.840
My name is Eric Bidelman.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.000
I guess go ahead and
introduce yourself.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.130
Tell the world who you are.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130
LUKE MAHE: My name's Luke Mahe,
I'm from the Sydney

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.130
office working on
the Maps Team.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And much like
Luke, except my name is

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.360
different, my name is Chris, I
also work in the Syndey office

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.390
on the Maps Developer
Relations Team.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.516
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:49.210
And I'm on Chrome Developer
Relations, as I said, and we

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.420
just got done launching Santa
Tracker this year.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.220
In years past, Santa Tracker's
been this thing that we've

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.420
done in the Geo developer
relations team, and this year,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.160
we kind of beefed it up and we
want to talk a little bit

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.980
about the tech behind
what we worked on.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.010
So who wants to show off
some cool stuff first?

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.580
LUKE MAHE: Hey, we can
start with me.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.230
ERIC BIDELMAN: Start with you?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.490
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.190
ERIC BIDELMAN: You
got the goods?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.920
LUKE MAHE: I got the goods.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.530
ERIC BIDELMAN: All right.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.370
LUKE MAHE: So what we got
here is Santa's village.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.713
This is Santa's village and
it's just counting down to

00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:17.050
when he takes off.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.570
Christmas is coming up, and
he's going to fly around.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.480
ERIC BIDELMAN: So this is the
web experience of this year.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.300
This is much different than
last year, I would say.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.830
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.940
So this year, we've got a hold
a couple of components with

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.895
web, but we really went and
targeted modern browsers this

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.470
year and did some really
cool things.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.930
So you can see we've got
a plane flying along.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.020
You can do some fun things like
a change the time of day.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.310
And you can also then
go and interact.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.680
So we've got this whole village
which parallaxes as

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.926
you move across the screen,
which is kind of cool.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:45.270
ERIC BIDELMAN: Actually,
how are you doing that?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.020
Maybe explain a little bit.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.720
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, so CSS
transformations.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.500
Obviously, that's the best way
we found out the way to do

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.515
this instead of just moving
backgrounds and

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:54.020
that sort of stuff.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.102
So we have a couple of divs and
we're just shifting them

00:01:57.102 --> 00:01:58.050
left and right.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.240
And the ones at the foreground
are really massive, the ones

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
at the background
aren't so big.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.240
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool, so
they're just images with CSS.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.450
LUKE MAHE: Just images
with CSS.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.010
ERIC BIDELMAN: So see, it
turns out CSS is pretty

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.150
powerful these days,
if you haven't

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.310
played with it recently.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.090
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, it's cool.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.320
ERIC BIDELMAN: What
is the count down?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.500
So that's until Santa arrives,
or what's going on there?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.920
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, this is until
he arrives at his village and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.440
about to take off.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.730
So he's still gathering
all his toys and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.200
that sort of stuff.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.520
So he hasn't done
his flight yet.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.450
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, well this
countdown's pretty cool.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.670
ERIC BIDELMAN: How the
heck did you do that?

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.450
That looks complicated.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.730
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, it was
kind of complicated.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.750
So each digit is actually
four divs.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.030
So I've got a back face div,
and then we've got the top

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.510
half of an image, the letter,
at the top, and we've got

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.790
another two at the bottom.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.440
And so we've got one
transformation which moves

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.970
something halfway, and then
timed as another one starts to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.745
finish it off, and then that's
how we get the back face, and

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:47.390
it just flips.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.000
ERIC BIDELMAN: So again, just
a little bit of CSS.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580
LUKE MAHE: Just a
little, all CSS.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.010
And if you don't have CSS
animation, so your browser

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.640
doesn't support it,
it just changes.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.900
So it just works

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.420
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.650
It's really cool.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.170
So is that being calculated
client side as far as the time

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.750
count down?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.230
Or how is that?

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.770
LUKE MAHE: Oh, we have a special
magical Santa server

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.180
which tells us when Santa
is going to go off.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.328
ERIC BIDELMAN: Oh wow,
did you work with the

00:03:10.328 --> 00:03:10.440
elves on that one?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.870
LUKE MAHE: We did.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.310
We worked with them for a while
now to try to coordinate

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.620
the right time for
him to take off.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.334
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
cool, man.

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:17.950
All right.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.670
LUKE MAHE: It's fun.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.620
Some interesting things around
the village, like you can

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.370
click on the balloons and
they will fly around the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.190
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.702
ERIC BIDELMAN: So kids are
going to have a ball with

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:25.950
this, right?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.800
LUKE MAHE: We hope so.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.490
ERIC BIDELMAN: There's a
lot of interactivity.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.590
Any sort of hidden gems that
you want to talk about?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.030
LUKE MAHE: There's going to be
easter eggs throughout the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.680
whole site, so I'm not going
to show a lot of them.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.560
But we've got some fun things
like if we go along,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.810
you can click on--

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.010
this is one of my favorite.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.810
So you've got a little scene.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.545
ERIC BIDELMAN: Oh, wow.

00:03:46.545 --> 00:03:47.290
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.070
So these are Santa's elves
at the moment testing his

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.740
reindeer in a wind tunnel to
make sure they're aerodynamic.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.310
It's a lot of fun.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.970
ERIC BIDELMAN: He looks
pretty aerodynamic.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.760
LUKE MAHE: He does
look aerodynamic.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.060
ERIC BIDELMAN: So is
this Canvas, or how

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.311
are you doing this?

00:03:58.311 --> 00:03:58.460
Is this HTML5?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.250
LUKE MAHE: This is all
CSS3 animations.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.140
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's all CSS?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.950
LUKE MAHE: All CSS.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.010
The whole thing is all CSS.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: Wow.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.000
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.070
There are a bunch of images
all over the place and a

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.080
couple of repeating images, but
just like the little dials

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.450
and everything is all CSS.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.370
ERIC BIDELMAN: So why CSS over
something like Canvas, or SVG?

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.610
LUKE MAHE: Well, we wanted to
support a lot more browsers.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.300
We wanted to easily fall back.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.080
So if you didn't have
animations, they'd just stand

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.970
still, but it's still an
experience that you'll like.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.820
ERIC BIDELMAN: So what
browsers can

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.960
folks enjoy Santa on?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.590
LUKE MAHE: All modern
browsers.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.200
And then for special stuff
like the interaction and

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.990
animations and that sort of
stuff, anything that supports

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.560
CSS3 and keyframe animations.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.290
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.255
Which is pretty good support
these days, as far as the

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:44.530
modern [INAUDIBLE] browsers.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.810
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.220
And if you don't have it,
it just falls back.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.310
Let's find some other
fun things.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.520
So there's this whole village
where you can explore some

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.790
really cool things.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.700
ERIC BIDELMAN: So this is very
much more of an interactive

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.000
experience than last year.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.992
Like last year, I think you get
to track Santa, know where

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:01.980
he is, and sort of see him
as he flies through.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.260
But this is much more of like,
interacting, playing some

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.460
games is really cool.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.740
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I'd say
it's much more playful.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.680
Last year was more of a Google
Earth experience, where you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.190
sort of track Santa in a sort
of realistic way, where this

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.960
is, I think it's more jovial.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.255
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:05:17.255 --> 00:05:19.270
LUKE MAHE: It's a bit more fun
before Santa takes off.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.820
So you can explore
the village.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.480
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The games and
the easter eggs are amazing.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.110
LUKE MAHE: Speaking of games.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.930
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
Oh you got one.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.230
LUKE MAHE: Got a game here.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.020
Got some sounds.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.700
Yeah.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.730
So here's a little Santa
racing game.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.780
ERIC BIDELMAN: I think Paul
Lewis did this game, right?

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.060
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.510
ERIC BIDELMAN: The infamous Paul
Lewis, who is big fan of

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.793
WebGL and has done a lot
of great stuff if

00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:40.810
you're in that community.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.400
This looks really fun.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.580
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So how's
this one built?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.920
Is this a Canvas?

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.220
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.320
So we did a couple of
limitations with our games.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.255
We did another one of
the games, which

00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:49.840
was all done in CSS.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.990
Let me just pause.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.760
As much as we love the sound.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.370
This one is actually
all done in Canvas.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.822
So it's really smooth and fluid,
and we can do a lot of

00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:01.210
cool things.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.555
So we've got another game,
which if we're lucky,

00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:04.170
we might show you.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.500
And that was all done on CSS.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.420
So we wanted to like, push the
boundary, but not always

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.850
concentrate on just
one technology.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.060
We wanted to see if we
could do a couple

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.860
of different things.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.320
ERIC BIDELMAN: You
might as well.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.500
I mean, we have all this stuff
in HTML5 now that we can do.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.460
And certainly, even more than
last year, I would say, and

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.050
every year it gets
more powerful.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.245
So why not have a game with
awesome physics and sound, and

00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:26.756
web audio API?

00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:27.550
All the cool stuff.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.980
LUKE MAHE: I can almost
drift Santa's sleigh.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.930
ERIC BIDELMAN: You've clearly
been practicing.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.560
LUKE MAHE: Oh, yeah.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.140
Well, someone has
to test this.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.660
ERIC BIDELMAN: This is
important QA testing.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.900
LUKE MAHE: Yes.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.315
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:37.840
Is there anything else that
you want to highlight?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.150
LUKE MAHE: Also, this
is the countdown

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.630
before Santa takes off.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.360
And then I can actually
switch to once

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.930
Santa's actually in flight.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.310
We can show what that's
about, if you like.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: Let's do it.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.330
I mean, that's what Santa
Tracker's all about, right?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.550
Is actually tracking
to see where he is.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.750
LUKE MAHE: So here's Santa as
he's actually flying around.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.850
So we've got a dashboard
of Santa.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.890
So we can see where he's flying
to, where he was, and

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.250
we can get some fun facts, like
presents delivered, and

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.250
what he's currently doing.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.850
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.400
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.100
ERIC BIDELMAN: And his little
status message updates when he

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.120
visits a new location.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.890
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.240
Yeah.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.825
And then if you are kind of
bored of watching Santa for

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:15.850
the moment, you can
zoom out, and kind

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.590
of explore the village.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.920
I mean, explore the
world, sorry.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.490
And see all the locations
where he's been so far.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.950
And you can click on these and
find out some fun facts about

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.880
that location.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.060
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Could
be educational.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.940
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, a
bit educational.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.900
You can see some cool photos.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.470
You can go through the photos.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.880
ERIC BIDELMAN: What is powering
all the photos and

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.300
everything like that?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.960
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we have a
content service that's built

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.310
on App Engine.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.230
So we've basically aggregated
a whole bunch of content so

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.970
the photos come from Panoramio
via their API, and Wikipedia

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.870
have provided us content.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.800
It's a Creative Commons.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.360
So that's all served
up when you click

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.920
through to a location.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.335
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's nice.

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:56.695
LUKE MAHE: And then we
also have Wikipedia,

00:07:56.695 --> 00:07:58.940
which is kind of cool.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.860
Santa's reading Wikipedia
on his Nexus 10.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.520
ERIC BIDELMAN: Nice.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.710
I see Santa's technologically
advanced.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.160
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, he is.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.180
ERIC BIDELMAN: He's got the
latest and greatest.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.460
LUKE MAHE: Yep.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.190
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
very cool.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.450
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.070
And that will CSS3 as well.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.260
ERIC BIDELMAN: I'm just
impressed with like, all the

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.580
cool CSS stuff that can
be done these days.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.460
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.080
So we can see some fun things
that right now, actually

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.360
Santa's doing.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.070
ERIC BIDELMAN: And so the m
itself, the map is just, the

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.590
maps Google Maps.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.340
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.900
Just a Google Map.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.980
We've styled it.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.060
We've just got normal markers.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.950
Santa's a marker.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.310
See right now, he's delivering
presence.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.090
He's having a lot of fun.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.950
We can see the presents
delivered, and weather.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.780
And all that sort of stuff.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.919
And then we've got an Earth
button as well.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.610
So you can watch Earth.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.150
ERIC BIDELMAN: Oh, so Google
Earth is still part of that.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.309
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, Google Earth
is still part of it.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.122
So you'll sit there and watch
Earth, and go from there.

00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:40.946
ERIC BIDELMAN: Nice.

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:43.230
Well, this certainly wouldn't
be possible without all the

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.690
work that Chris has done.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.200
I know you've spent countless
hours on developing sort of

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.000
the, what are we calling it?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.350
The Santa Service?

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.635
LUKE MAHE: Yes.

00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:51.330
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's all
about the children.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.390
LUKE MAHE: It is.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.260
ERIC BIDELMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.450
So do you want to talk a little
bit about sort of

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.090
what's powering?

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.180
So we have the web experience
that Luke has been showing.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.200
All the sort of where
Santa's visiting.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.830
All that information's coming
from someplace.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.870
Where is it coming from?

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.685
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So all of the
things that, ways you can

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:11.080
track Santa run from this
App Engine app.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.640
So that includes the web that
we've looked at, the Chrome

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.190
extension, which we'll
look at soon.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.290
There's a Google Earth
experience, if you have Google

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.480
Earth on your mobile.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.400
And there's an Android
app, as well.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.770
So yeah.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.480
These all come from an App
Engine app that basically

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.530
tells you where Santa is.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.440
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.880
So it's a service that
scales very well.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.100
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
very well.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.900
LUKE MAHE: So it's built on
Go, so it's very fast.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.240
We've paid a lot of attention
to caching, and making sure

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.700
that things run smoothly.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.020
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.300
You have any code to show?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.855
Do you want to give a little
sneak peak of the API itself?

00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:48.348
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Nope.

00:09:48.348 --> 00:09:48.810
ERIC BIDELMAN: OK.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.700
So Santa's top secret?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.920
Top secret.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.610
Yeah, I mean, it's probably
best described, I think.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.720
So when you go to the website,
the service will tell you the

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.890
time according to Google.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.320
So if you've got some computer
with a clock that's incorrect,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.660
you're going to see where
Santa actually is.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.630
So that's what happens first.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.460
Then it'll go and
fetch the route.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.090
So Santa's giving us his
itinerary ahead of time.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.410
And everyone's synchronized
on that.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.240
ERIC BIDELMAN: So
that serves as

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.540
powering all of the clients.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.600
So the Chrome extension
that we haven't seen

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.720
yet, the web app here.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.740
All the Android and
mobile apps.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.645
So everybody theoretically,
you fire up the app under

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:31.930
these respective devices,
or these platforms.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.420
And everybody's kind
of in sync.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:33.780
That's really cool.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:33.830
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.570
I mean, if you had them side by
side, the idea is to create

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.620
that realism that Santa's
actually in that place.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.890
ERIC BIDELMAN: He's only in
one place at one time.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.170
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's true.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.110
And he is real.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: Absolutely.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.620
So this is really nice, man.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.785
This is definitely a way, way
cooler experience than last

00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:50.550
year, I would say.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.100
Much more to it.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.090
Luke, do you want to show
the portion I worked on?

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.035
LUKE MAHE: I was going
to say, you know,

00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:57.550
we've had all the glory.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.390
Do you want to see--

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.620
we should show what
you've done.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.550
ERIC BIDELMAN: So again, I
work on the Chrome team.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.750
So we wanted to come out with a
nice little Chrome extension

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.400
that folks could use to sort of
experience and track Santa,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.190
interact with the Santa
Tracker before he

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.320
takes off on his route.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.490
And so we put together an
extension, a nice little

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.450
Chrome extension.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.320
LUKE MAHE: Turn the sound
on, because you

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.120
added some cool stuff.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.710
ERIC BIDELMAN: I do.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.180
So I have a little click when
the tick tock, the countdown

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.380
timer flips its little bit.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.060
So that's using Web Audio API,
if you guys are into the HTML5

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.760
audio scene.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.930
Brand new API.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.370
And what's kind of nice about a
Chrome extension is I don't

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.540
have to worry about browser
support, right?

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.500
I know my browser's--

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.100
LUKE MAHE: That would
have been nice.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.530
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.985
So you guys couldn't,
unfortunately,

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:39.780
have the same guarantee.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So what's good
about the Web Audio API?

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.250
What does that give us?

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.370
ERIC BIDELMAN: Web Audio
API is great.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.590
I'm a big fan.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.580
Essentially, you can schedule
sound at very precise times.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.460
So in the case of something
like this countdown timer

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.102
where the digits are flipping,
Luke has a nice little library

00:11:55.102 --> 00:11:57.830
that he wrote to do a lot
of this animation work.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.900
And so he fires off an event,
and I just attach a listener

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.610
to that event, and then
call the Web Audio

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.390
API with a tick sound.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.660
LUKE MAHE: The event
was Tick Tock.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.626
ERIC BIDELMAN: I think it was
Tick Tock, yeah, which makes a

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:11.270
lot of sense.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:11.470
Yeah.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.920
And so actually,
it was really.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.270
We got to share a lot of
the same code base.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.110
I took your counter stuff, and
basically I just made a media

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.220
query out of it, right?

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.900
LUKE MAHE: This counter
is the exact same one

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.350
that's on the village.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.320
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.570
So we didn't have to duplicate
any work there.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.410
And same parallax the fact.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.410
Did the little animations.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.860
And the idea is that folks will
hit that Explore Santa's

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.350
Village big red button there,
and jump into the web app

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.130
experience and sort of do the
games, and all the other stuff

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.650
we built up.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.740
LUKE MAHE: But if I don't want
to go to Santa's Village just

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.720
yet, is there some
other fun things?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.830
ERIC BIDELMAN: You
don't have to.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.640
I'm glad you asked.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.750
So you're on Google.com right
now, and one thing you can do

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:50.240
it with Chrome extensions is
inject CSS and JavaScript and

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.220
HTML in the page.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.320
So we have a couple of buttons
at the bottom.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.530
And do you want to show
off [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.150
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, which one
do you want to pick?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.280
We'll click on it first.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.030
ERIC BIDELMAN: Let's go
for the Blimpies.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.900
LUKE MAHE: Go click
on the blimp?

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.570
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.070
So this is all very reminiscent
of all the assets

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.990
you saw on the web experience.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.070
LUKE MAHE: So we
got the blimp.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.460
ERIC BIDELMAN: We
got the blimp.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.320
Now he's injected on--

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.180
[HONKING]

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.300
LUKE MAHE: Wow.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.120
ERIC BIDELMAN: So that's our
good buddy, the Web Audio API.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.430
But yeah, I think it's going to
be really fun for kids to

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.500
play with and sort of see this
blimp on any website you kind

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.870
of come across using CSS filters
there, and animations

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.500
and transitions and stuff.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.120
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So how can you
get the Chrome extension?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.370
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.705
So you can go to the Chrome Web
Store to get the Chrome

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:30.910
extension, or we have a special
build of Chrome that

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.360
you can download, which also--

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.030
LUKE MAHE: Will have a
nice Chrome theme.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.110
ERIC BIDELMAN: Has a great theme
for the holidays, and it

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.580
has the extension
pre-installed.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.460
So you can get that and kind
of play with things,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.960
and check them out.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.600
LUKE MAHE: What else
have we got here?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.070
Because I know that you did
some other cool things.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.280
ERIC BIDELMAN: The snowflake
is really cool.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.560
LUKE MAHE: The snowflake
is really fun.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.639
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
one of my favorites.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.000
LUKE MAHE: Have a look here.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.490
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
very cool.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.950
LUKE MAHE: That's very cute.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.680
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
very festive.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.501
ERIC BIDELMAN: This is actually
using Canvas, which

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:57.710
is kind of--

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.610
LUKE MAHE: I'll turn
the sound off.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.240
As much as we love that.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.200
ERIC BIDELMAN: As festive
as it is.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.730
This is using Canvas, and
essentially using some of the

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.840
properties with alpha
transparency in Canvas.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.350
So if you want--

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.080
LUKE MAHE: What can
I do with this?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.490
ERIC BIDELMAN: You can draw.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:11.980
LUKE MAHE: I can draw with it?

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.950
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's a palette,
so why don't you write the

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.230
folks a message?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.410
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So sort of
like you're painting on a

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.040
window, right?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.140
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.410
And so there's an alpha
transparency property you can

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.380
set in Canvas, and then it just
basically bleeds through.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.170
So the whole screen has been
filled up with Canvas.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.960
I've injected a Canvas on the
page, and now we're--

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.510
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So I know how
to paint things in Canvas.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.730
How do I do the arrangement?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.590
How did you do that?

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:34.800
The arrangement?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.090
Yeah.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.760
It was tough.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.960
I actually looked at a
few examples online.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.680
Getting it right so that you
have sort of the snow that's

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.120
overlaying the page, and then
bleeding the pages through was

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.170
kind of tricky.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.840
But it's basically just
mouse events, right?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.460
And you subscribe to those.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.170
And the touch events, and
then folks can paint.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.460
Canvas just takes care
of everything,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.370
which is really nice.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.375
LUKE MAHE: And then I can
defrost my browser.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:57.770
ERIC BIDELMAN: Defrost, yeah.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.050
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Goes away.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.220
ERIC BIDELMAN: Well, in case
you want to do a Google

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.084
search, right?

00:15:00.084 --> 00:15:01.780
LUKE MAHE: In case I
want to keep going.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.570
Want to draw something new.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.600
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.220
So it's cool.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.040
The Chrome extension's very much
a companion to the other

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.280
stuff that you guys
have worked on.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.860
LUKE MAHE: Was there any
interesting things you did

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.360
about, how getting it from the
Chrome extension and actually

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.512
putting stuff in the browser?

00:15:14.512 --> 00:15:15.990
You know, communicating
between the two.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.000
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.630
So you guys probably know this
better than I do, but the Maps

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.190
API in a Chrome extension is
pretty difficult to use,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.110
actually, because the Manifest
v2, there' what's called the

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.300
content security policy
restrictions.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.450
So you can't load in content
from external domains, which

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.420
means Maps API is kind of
out of the picture.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.530
But we got to some interesting
things with the sandbox iframe

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.380
of the map.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.160
And then kind of communicate
with the Maps API to update

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
Santa's position and whatnot
on the map, and sort of do

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.990
post message, and use iframe
communication.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.820
So it was a little bit trickier
than it really needs

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.570
to be if you're building a web
app, but ultimately the CSP

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.400
restrictions are there to keep
users safe and secure.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.570
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Any
other details

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.460
in the Chrome extension?

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.220
ERIC BIDELMAN: What
else are we using?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.290
RequestAnimationFrame.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.000
Again, since it's a Chrome
extension, we can take

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.600
advantage of some of the latest
features for animation,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.700
and requestAnimationFrame
is a great one.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.840
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, and that's
exactly how we're doing the

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.510
Parallax as well where we're
doing the movement, we're

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.600
doing transformations, but
we're doing it in a

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.570
requestAnimationFrame.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.460
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's cool.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.870
And again, we're using Sass.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.160
So for our CSS I think we all
chose that route just because

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.250
it's a lot easier to maintain.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.630
LUKE MAHE: And that way, we can
have lots of individual

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.890
files so that you're just using
the countdown Sass file

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.320
that I was using as well.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.790
So we're not duplicating.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.940
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It helps with
cross-browser, vendor

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.740
prefixes, things like that.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.360
ERIC BIDELMAN: And I think you
guys defined variables and I

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.630
imported them into my
stylesheets, and then--

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.790
LUKE MAHE: You just get them.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.570
ERIC BIDELMAN: It
came for free.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.870
LUKE MAHE: So when you're
working in a big team that's

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.430
kind of doing independent things
but sharing a lot of

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.430
stuff, that's a nice
way to do it.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.820
So we're also sharing a
lot of JavaScript and

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.880
HTML as well, right?

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.330
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.450
LUKE MAHE: And we're doing the
standard Google stuff.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.430
All that code is compiled
with Closure.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.130
So, all minified.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.430
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We had a lot
of hits, so we've got to

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.210
reduce the bandwidth.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: So a lot of
people are interested in where

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.220
Santa is going.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.060
LUKE MAHE: But one fun factor we
found when we were building

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.260
this on a high DPI laptop, the
performance when we first did

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.520
it was really quite poor.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.480
And then what we did is, once we
replaced every image with a

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.200
high DPI version, the
performance improved

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.300
dramatically.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.180
And it was because the browser
didn't have to spend time

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.150
scaling up the image
for the right size.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.320
The performance was just
magically different.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.610
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.630
So that was actually something,
I hadn't worked on

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.250
a big project yet that required
us to think about

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.860
high definition retina displays,
but these are

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.470
prevalent now, so we had to have
2x images all over the

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.740
place and make sure that it
looks good on the folks that

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.620
are having high displays.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.090
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So do you guys
want to talk a bit about

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.090
mobile performance?

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.940
Because I know that they have
their limitations and they're

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.250
a lot slower.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.640
LUKE MAHE: Well, the good thing
about that as well is,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.820
because we're doing high DPI
images for this, we could just

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.290
give them to the mobile guys
as well for the native app,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.930
because they could then
also render, use those

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.180
for high DPI images.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.306
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So are there
any other performance tricks?

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:19.160
LUKE MAHE: Well, there's a
nifty one with the game,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.540
especially to make the game work
well on a mobile device.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.280
So instead of having your asset
and then saying display

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.510
none and then showing it when
you want, to keep it in the

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:32.430
GPU memory, just transform it
out of the screen space.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.840
But it will still essentially
stay in GPU.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.880
So then it doesn't have to keep
reloading that texture

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.740
and that actually improved
performance a lot for the

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.280
commonly used images.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.740
ERIC BIDELMAN: And I know for
a lot of mobile devices, the

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.770
start up time for GPUs is
a little bit slower.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.140
So you apply a CSS transform
or something and it takes a

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.610
little bit more time
and so you get

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.150
kind of a janky effect.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.950
So doing something offscreen
is always the way to go.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: But yeah, I
mean, we're really happy to

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.890
offer mobile experience
this year.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.860
Last year was not really much
to speak of, so we're

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.550
definitely paving the way.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.580
ERIC BIDELMAN: Media queries
for the win, right?

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.090
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, totally.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.900
When this gets too small as
well, we've got a nice,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.920
responsive way that works well
for a mobile or small screen.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.500
CHRIS BROADFOOT: No completely
separate experience.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.751
All the same code, which
helps a lot.

00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:21.100
ERIC BIDELMAN: Can you click
on the sun again?

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.690
That was really cool.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:24.120
LUKE MAHE: I like it.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.970
All the clouds are
done in CSS.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.380
ERIC BIDELMAN: I wish I had
that the power to--

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.890
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh, I don't
want turn the balloon.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.300
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, I've done the
balloon, but there'll be a

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.810
couple more easter eggs around
that you'll have to hunt for.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.555
ERIC BIDELMAN: Very cool.

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:35.050
So you saved the
best for last.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.750
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Any Gangnam
style easter eggs?

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.940
ERIC BIDELMAN: TBA, maybe?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.650
LUKE MAHE: Maybe we'll put some
easter eggs in here, but

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.830
you'll have to go
look for them.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.270
We're not going to make
them easy to find.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.750
ERIC BIDELMAN: Very cool.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.040
So, Santa Tracker 2012.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.740
Way, way more than last year.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:57.090
Chrome, [? GEO ?], social,
Android, a lot of different

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.110
product areas and APIs
at play here.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.830
So, very cool.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.220
We all came together
and pulled it off,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.460
which is really neat.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.240
And App Engine as
well, I guess.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.950
LUKE MAHE: Well, because
we all love Santa.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:07.900
ERIC BIDELMAN: Everybody
loves Santa.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And it's
all for the children.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.450
LUKE MAHE: It is all
for the children.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.720
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.100
Well, thanks for joining
us everyone.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.140
I really appreciate your time.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.450
And check out Santa Tracker.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.650
You can get Santa Tracker
on the Chrome

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.850
Web Store, the extension.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.150
LUKE MAHE: And
google.com/santatracker for

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.290
the actual site.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.040

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.790
Then of course Google Play
for the Android App.
