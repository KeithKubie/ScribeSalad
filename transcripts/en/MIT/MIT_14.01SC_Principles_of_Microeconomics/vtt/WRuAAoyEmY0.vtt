00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.300
PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome back
to the 14.01 problem solving

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.990
videos.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.620
Today, we're going to work on
Fall 2010, problem set one,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.727
problem number four.

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.310
And in this problem,
we're going to be

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.062
working with elasticities.

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:36.020
But instead of starting
with a demand function,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.980
and starting with
a supply function,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.210
and calculating the elasticity
given those functions,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.210
we're going to be given
the elasticity of demand

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.672
and the elasticity of supply.

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:46.130
And we're going to
have to back out

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.741
what the demand functions
and the supply functions

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:49.740
should have looked like.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.620
So we're basically
just working in reverse

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.570
from what we did in lecture.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.210
Let's go ahead and read the
full problem up through part A.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.040
You have been asked to
analyze the market for steel.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.870
From public sources,
you are able to find

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.120
that last year's price
for steel was $20 per ton.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.750
At this price, 100 million tons
were sold on the world market.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.810
From trade association
data, you are

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.170
able to obtain estimates for
their own price elasticities

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.690
of demand and supply on the
world markets as negative 0.25

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.610
for demand and 0.5 for supply.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.440
Assume the steel has
linear demand and supply

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.960
curves throughout.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.850
Part A asks us to solve for the
equations of demand and supply

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.010
in this market, and to sketch
the demand and supply curves.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.580
So looking at the formal
definition of elasticity

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.300
of demand and
elasticity of supply,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.500
we basically are going to have
three different parts to it.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.360
We have the derivative of
either demand or supply

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.180
function with respect to P, in
this case the own price of P,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.300
or the price of steel.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.470
And we also have the
equilibrium price,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.270
or any price at the point on
the curve, and a quantity.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.420
In this case, it's going to
be the equilibrium quantity.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.820
So basically, what
we have now is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.740
we are given-- for the
elasticity of demand,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.080
we're given three variables.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.509
We're given the
price, the quantity,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390
and the elasticity of demand.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.730
And that means the only
thing that we don't know

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.260
is the derivative of the
demand curve with respect to P.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.940
So if we can isolate
this derivative,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.750
then we can integrate
the number that we're

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.280
able to solve through for.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.210
And then we can solve
out for what our demand

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.510
curve is going to look like.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.230
So let's go ahead and walk
through that process together.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:49.510
Substituting in for the
elasticity of demand P and Q,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.909
we're gonna have this equation.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.700
And the one thing that
I want you to notice

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.810
is since the derivative of the
demand curve with respect to P

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.670
is negative 0.25, in this
case, we know that it's linear.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.480
But just because it's
linear at the point

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.120
where price is 20
and quantity is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.620
100, that doesn't
necessarily mean it's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.880
gonna be linear throughout.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.470
So it's useful to know that
at any point on this line,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.660
it's always going to
have the derivative equal

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.682
to negative 0.25.

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:17.390
So that's useful.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.170
We know we can integrate
and have the correct answer.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:35.450
Solving for dQD dP, we're
gonna have negative 1.25.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.580
And we're just going to
integrate this with respect

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.825
to P. And after we
integrate, we're

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:42.200
going to be left
with a constant.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.834
In this case, we're going
to call the constant a.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.750
This is how much the
demand curve has actually

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.220
shifted up to begin
with, shifted up or down.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.390
And to solve for a,
all we have to do

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.690
is we can just plug back in for
the $20 and the 100 quantity,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.970
and we can solve through for
what a is going to be equal.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.250
When you solve through
plugging in Q and P,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:32.610
you're going to find
that a is equal to 125.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.260
So we're gonna have that our
final demand function is gonna

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.500
be negative 1.25P plus 125.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.830
Now we can go through
this exact same process

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.340
with the elasticity
of supply now.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.000
And all we have to do now is
use the number 0.5 instead,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.130
and we can solve through.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.270
We can integrate.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.500
And then we're going to
solve for the other constant

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.400
to, again, get our supply curve.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:10.020
Substituting in the
information we have,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.770
we're going to be left
with this equation.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.400
And we're gonna go
ahead and isolate

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.620
the derivative that we have.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.910
And when we integrate
again, we have

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.160
to remember that we are going
to have a constant that we're

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.180
gonna have to solve for.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.270
And I'm gonna just
call this constant c.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.990
Again, plug in the price of 20
and the quantity equal to 100

00:05:46.990 --> 00:06:02.300
and you're gonna find that the
supply curve is gonna be equal

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.880
to 2.5P plus 50.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.141
And we can do a quick sketch
of this on our axes here.

00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:11.640
We're just gonna go ahead and
draw our upward-sloping supply

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.050
curve, our downward-sloping
demand curve.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.960
And we're gonna mark
the equilibrium point

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.870
and label the equilibrium
quantities and the equilibrium

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.620
prices, as well.

00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:35.720
And before we move on to the
second part of this problem,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.510
we can pause here.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.843
And we can think about what
did the elasticities that we

00:06:38.843 --> 00:06:40.590
started with actually mean.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.230
Well, if we were to look at
this point of intersection

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.540
at the equilibrium
of the demand curve,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.680
we're looking at the
percentage change

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.960
at this point in quantity per
percentage change in price.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.850
So we're basically just
saying, for that tiny change,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.060
an infinitesimally small change
at this point for the demand

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.020
curve, how much does quantity
change, percentage-wise,

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.380
relative to price?

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.800
And that's also
what we're looking

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.000
at with the supply curve.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.030
So when you're
given a elasticity,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.690
if you have an
elasticity of supply,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.150
it makes sense that it's gonna
be positive, in this case 0.5,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.480
because when price
increases, suppliers

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.080
are willing to supply more.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.620
And it makes sense that the
demand elasticity that we're

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.980
given is negative,
or negative 0.25,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.810
because when price
begins to increase,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.410
the consumers are gonna
want less of the product.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.960
Now, the second
part of this problem

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.120
is going to give us new
elasticities of demand

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.820
and supply.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.484
And I'm gonna just quickly run
through the actual calculation,

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:46.525
because it's gonna be the
same as our calculation

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:47.960
that we just did.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.020
And instead, we're gonna
think about possible causes

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.360
for the shifts that we see
in the supply and the demand

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.220
curve.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.410
Part B says, suppose
that you discover

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.820
that the current price
of steel is $15 per ton

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.590
and the current level of
worldwide sales of steel

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.130
is 150 million tons.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.890
The most recent
elasticity estimates

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.540
from the trade
association this year

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.820
are negative 0.125 for
demand and 0.25 for supply.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.140
Describe the change in the
supply and the demand curves

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.280
over the past year
using your diagram

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.410
from part A. What sort of
events might explain the change?

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.670
Now, I've given us the
information for this part

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.260
of the problem on this board.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.850
And you'll notice that our
inputs, or our variables,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.570
have changed now.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.380
The price has dropped from $20.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.600
Now it's gonna be down to $15.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.419
You're gonna notice that
the quantity has actually

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.720
increased from 100 up to 150.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.005
And our elasticities of demand
and elasticities of supply

00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:51.630
have changed, because the price
and the quantity are different,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.210
and we're at a different
point on our graph.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.800
The process we're gonna
do to solve for our demand

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.340
curves and our supply curves are
going to be exactly identical.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.100
And when you follow
the same process--

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.020
I'll just do the
first step up here--

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.726
you're gonna substitute in
for the information that's

00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:08.600
given in the problem.

00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:46.410
And all you're going
to do is you're,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.170
again, gonna solve through
for the derivative.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.128
You're gonna integrate.

00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:50.960
And you're gonna
find the constants.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.120
After you do that
entire process,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.370
you're gonna find that
the demand curve is

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.420
given by this equation.

00:10:05.094 --> 00:10:07.010
And you're gonna find
that the supply curve is

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.135
given by this new equation.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.990
Now, if we look
at this new demand

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.310
curve and this new
supply curve, we'll

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.870
actually notice that the
slope, with respect to P,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.910
is going to be identical
in both of the cases

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.020
that we solved for, both the
beginning case and the case

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.860
in the end of the problem.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.780
The only thing that's shifted
between our quantities demanded

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.760
and our quantities
supplied, or the curves,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.240
is there's been a shift.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.610
And the shift for
the demand curve--

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:57.270
it went from an intercept of 125
now to an intercept of 168.75.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.200
So our demand curve is
shifting up and out.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.330
So we can represent this
shift in demand like this.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.040
Notice that the slope is
going to be exactly identical.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.597
I'm going to write a
small db for part B.

00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:16.680
And then we can do the
same sort of interpretation

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.150
for our supply curve.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.420
Looking at our supply curve,
the intercepts, now, is 112.5.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.070
But before, it was only at 50.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.920
And what this means, this
means that the supply curve

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.320
is going to shift in and down.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.554
And so my graph with
the equilibrium price

00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:44.220
that I've drawn--
it's a little bit off,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.690
but what you should
see-- you should

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.960
see that the new equilibrium
price has fallen.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.790
In this case, it's fallen to 15.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:04.090
And the equilibrium quantity
has increased from 100 to 150.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.130
So since we had both a shift in
supply and a shift in demand,

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.060
necessarily we see that
quantity is going to increase.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.310
But if the demand curve
had shifted way up here,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.300
we could see that price
could have increased.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.370
So the effect on the price
in this market is ambiguous.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.250
We can say that, necessarily,
the effect on quantity

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.170
is going to be clearly
towards an increase.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.990
So to wrap up this
problem, we saw

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.190
that changes in
elasticities can also

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.990
represent changes in the
underlying demand and supply

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.922
functions.

00:12:37.922 --> 00:12:39.630
Let's wrap up by just
thinking about what

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.040
could have caused the demand
shift that we've seen.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.210
And what could have caused
the supply shift that we saw?

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.305
Now, there are a couple of ideas
that we can have for demand.

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:55.270
The first idea that
we could have is we

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.750
could just have had an increase
in the income of a consumer.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.090
If a consumer has
more income, then they

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.940
might be willing to
spend more on steel.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.120
A second idea that
we have, we could

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.420
have that the price of a
substitute-- perhaps you're

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.450
considering building a bridge
out of iron instead of steel--

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.460
if the price of the
substitute has increased,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.960
then perhaps the
consumers are going

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.650
to be willing to pay more to
get the steel since the iron

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.460
is more expensive.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.400
A third possible idea
is that the number

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.690
of goods that you need to
make from steel is increasing.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.200
So if you suddenly find
new uses for steel,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.060
then the price that you're
willing to pay at any given

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.640
point is going to be higher.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.704
Basically, to affect
the demand curve,

00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:41.370
you have to think
about why would people

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.280
be more willing to pay
more for a fixed quantity.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.340
And I just listed off a
couple of ideas there.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.930
We can also think about
reasons about why the supply

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.850
curve could be shifting in.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.075
In this case, why
is it-- why are

00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:02.550
sellers willing to offer a
cheaper price at any fixed

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.594
quantity?

00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:05.260
And one idea that we
could have for this

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.100
is just that there are
more firms in this market.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.440
If this market isn't perfectly
competitive to start off with,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.950
then increasing
the number of firms

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.470
is gonna increase
competition, and the producers

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.790
are gonna have to
drop their prices.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.700
A second idea for why
we've seen the supply curve

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.570
shift out and down could be the
fact that input price for steel

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.340
has dropped.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.329
Perhaps the way of manufacturing
or getting the raw material

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:32.870
is cheaper because the machine
they're using to get the steel

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.030
is cheaper.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.280
Basically, when you're
thinking about the shift that's

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.540
making it cheaper for
suppliers to produce the good,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.000
all you need to
think about is what

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.208
could make it so that they're
more willing to produce

00:14:43.208 --> 00:14:45.090
at a lower price.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.970
So again, with this
problem, we went

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.350
through working with
elasticities and demands.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.000
We've seen that we can go from
a demand curve or supply curve

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.650
to elasticities, or we can go
from elasticities to demands.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.880
And then, once we've had the
supply and the demand curves,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.667
we looked at how do we
interpret the shifts and shocks?

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.250
And we looked at
possible explanations

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.910
for those shift and shocks.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.320
I hope you found
this problem helpful.
