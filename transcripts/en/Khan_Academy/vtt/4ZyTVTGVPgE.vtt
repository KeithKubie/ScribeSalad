00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.730
Put the vertex of the angle
at point A. So let me do that.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.280
Make one of the rays
go through point

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.613
B. Make the other ray go
through one of the other points

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.300
to make an acute angle.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.040
So an acute angle is an
angle less than 90 degrees.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.340
So we could make one of these
rays go through point B.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.100
And then we have to pick where
to put the other ray to make

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.650
it go to one of
the other points.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.280
And we have to be
very careful here

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.300
because we have to look at
this arc that shows which

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.290
angle the tool is
actually measuring.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.019
Because we might be tempted
to do something like this,

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.810
thinking that, hey,
maybe this is the angle

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.010
that we're thinking about.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.890
But the tool thinks we're
referring to this outer angle

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.660
right over here, this
larger huge angle.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.270
This angle right over here
is well over 180 degrees.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.610
So we have to pay
attention to this arc

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.540
to make sure that the tool
is looking at the same angle

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.640
that we are.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.670
So once again, we
want an acute angle.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.610
So this right over here
looks like an acute angle.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.100
It looks like it is
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.470
And we have to be very
careful that we go exactly

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.520
through that point.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.019
So that looks about right.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.630
This is an acute angle
because its measure

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.140
is less than 90 degrees.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.800
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.470
Make an obtuse angle
using the black points.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.280
Choose one of the
points as the vertex

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.910
and make the rays go through
the other two points.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.510
The angle should also be
less than 180 degrees.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.670
So you could think
of it several ways.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.290
You could just try
to pick that point.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.440
But then when you go through
these other two points,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.120
this right over here
is an acute angle.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.160
This is less than 90 degrees.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.780
You could do something
like this where now when

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.760
I switch the rays, the tool is
now thinking about this angle,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.930
not this outer angle
right over here.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.770
But this is larger
than 180 degrees.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.240
So this also doesn't apply.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.210
So we really picked the
wrong point for the vertex.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.470
If you just move this out
of the way and eyeball it,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.800
it looks like you get
the largest angle that's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.190
less than 180 degrees if you
put the vertex right over here.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.590
So let me do that.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.930
Put the vertex right over there.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.537
And now it looks like I have
constructed a 180-degree angle.

00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:09.120
And we have to be
very careful that we

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.203
go right through those
points because otherwise it

00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:13.330
might mark us wrong.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.540
So that looks pretty good.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.480
That's an obtuse angle
because its measure

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.030
is greater than 90 degrees.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.720
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.350
So another obtuse
angle using the points.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.870
Same general idea so that would
be an exactly 180-degree angle.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.217
And there we go.

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:35.800
And this is an obtuse
angle because it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.920
is greater than 90 degrees.
