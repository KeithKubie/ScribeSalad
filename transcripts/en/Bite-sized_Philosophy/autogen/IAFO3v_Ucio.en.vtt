00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I began to watch closely what I was saying. 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.959
 I do not know whether this is intentional or not. 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.519
 But I felt a rash grow in my mind and spirit. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.659
 Some of my students told me that the same thing had happened to them yet 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.179
 Listen to some of the articles I have explained to you. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.420
 Divided into two parts, 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.469
 To move ... I was the old one who most talked 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.019
 I like arguments and ideas, and another part watched the first with open eyes 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 He is tried impartially. The latter was watching first and saying, "That's not your idea" 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.640
 "You do not really think so" 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 "I'm not really learning what you're saying" 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.280
 "That's not true." 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.460
 I found it very interesting. Since that happens 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 With 95 percent of what I say, I did not know what to do. I said well, this is strange. Maybe 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 Broken, not that good. I did not hear sounds or anything like that. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740
 I mean, it was not. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.920
 I've had ... well, people have several parts. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.200
 I was going through a strange puzzle. Which two are I? Is it the part that listens and then says: 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.380
 "No, that's nonsense." "this is a lie". "This..." 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.180
 "You do it to excite people," "You just want to win the controversy." 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.980
 Whether that's the part I was released from 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.400
 My usual verbal? I did not know. But I decided to choose a critic. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.160
 What I tried and learned to do, I think, 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.020
 Is to stop saying things that made me weak. 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.580
 I still try to do it, because I always do 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 I feel as I speak, 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.229
 Whether what I say makes me consistent or divided 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 I think the consistency 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 It's the best way to imagine it, because I think you're saying things 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 As true as you can, they come 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.520
 From the depths within you, because we do not know the source of ideas. We do not know how deep 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.020
 In our internal structure generate ideas. We do not know any operations 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 Physiological consistency required to speak from the very core of your being. We do not understand either. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.180
 I do not even imagine it, but I believe you can feel it, and I learned some from my reading of Karl Rogers 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.560
 A great clinical psychologist, speaking of mental health as being partly interconnected 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.740
 Between spiritual or abstract, and physical. And that the two are consistent. There is a lot 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.570
 On the consistency of analytical and clinical psychological thought. On each, I decided to start 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.510
 Practice not to say things that make me weak. What happened is that I am 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 I had to stop saying 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.040
 Almost everything you say. 95 percent in my estimation 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.000
 Over a few months, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.240
 It was very shocking, to wake up and realize that you are almost a dead branch! 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.600
 It's a shock! You may ask: "Do you really want all that to fade?" 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.740
 Only 5% of you are left. 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.800
 If those 5% ... well established, 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.440
 So maybe that's exactly what it wants to happen 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 I told you that that story is a detail of the verse: "The Lord saw that the evil of man had multiplied in the earth, 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.380
 And that every conceivable thought of his heart is evil every day. " 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.260
 Question worthy of answer: 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.420
 "What are your motives exactly?" 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.720
 Perhaps it is cleaner than my motives, and this is certainly possible. 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.410
 I do not think I'm a good person, exactly, by nature. 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.320
 I think I have to work hard on this, and I do not think all people necessarily do 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.120
 But some people are worse than that, and everyone is pretty well. 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920
 So it's worth thinking about. 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.020
 Exactly, how much trouble do you want to cause? 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.860
 You may also think, if you do not do something important in your life, according to your own definition, 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.700
 - That's the game we're playing - you're the one who sets the rules, at least initially, 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.160
 You may be inclined to make trouble just because you do not know otherwise. 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.780
 Because trouble at least more exciting than boredom! That's what you learn if you read to Dostoevsky. 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.660
 Dostoevsky knew that well. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.900
 So if you do not do anything. If you do not pay yourself within your limits 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.060
 You'll have plenty 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.980
 Of will, energy, and resources to devote them to causing dramatic trouble. 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.100
 Also, I think this is a classic scenario. 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.680
 "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was abundant in the earth, and that every conceivable thought of his heart was evil every day." 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.460
 That is something worth pondering. 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.540
 This is not self-destruction 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.080
 Because in fact trying ... it's like diagnosing a disease 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.840
 The coincidence that it applies to you to some extent 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.479
 Maybe it's 10% of you, or maybe 90% 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.579
 So, you are treated as excellent, because then you may stop doing so. 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.340
 The negative side of it? 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.510
 You must leave your resentment, of course, your hatred and all that. 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.140
 This is really annoying, because these feelings make it very easy to practice. 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 It is fun, with a sense of accompaniment. 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.380
 But, 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.700
 You do not do this to harden yourself with criticism, 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.120
 But to distinguish the nausea from the fat, and leave all the money you would like to be behind you.
