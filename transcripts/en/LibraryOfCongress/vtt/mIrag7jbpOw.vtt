00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.910
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Well, good
afternoon ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.590
and welcome to the African
and Middle East Division

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.290
of The Library of Congress.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.720
Today's lecture on
Analysis and Curation

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.720
of the American Traveler's
Visual Documents of 1870 to 1936

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.020
on Central Asian Nomadic Culture
by Saule Satayeva is brought to you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.950
and sponsored by the
Near East Section

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.200 position:56%
of the African Middle East Division.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.520
I'm Joan Weeks, Head of
the Near East Section.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.460
And on behalf of all my colleagues

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.670
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Deeb
[assumed spelling] who couldn't be

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.170
with us today due to
a conflicting program,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.140
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.670
And before we start
today's program I'd

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.340
like to give you a brief overview
of the division and its resources

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.750
in the hopes that you'll come again

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.700
and use our collections
for your research.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080
This division, as many of you
know that have attended a lot

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.440
of these programs, is
comprised of three sections

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.740
that serve the collections to
researchers from around the world.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.150
We cover 78 countries and
more than 35 languages.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.210
The African Section includes
all of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.030
The Hebraic Section is responsible
for Judaica and Hebraic worldwide.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.530 position:56%
And the Near East Section covers all

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.720
of the Arab countries including
North Africa, Turkey, Iran,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.470
Afghanistan, Central Asia,
the Muslims of Western China,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.310
Russia and the Balkans as well
as the People of the Caucuses.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.910 position:56%
So we really cover an extensive area

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.800
with our collections
and our programs.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.510
Just a couple housekeeping
things first.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.770
After the program we invite you
to fill in the evaluation forms

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.800
that we placed on your seats.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.400
And please leave them in the box

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.280
at the information
desk as you're leaving.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.490
Secondly, we would like to invite
you to ask questions at the end.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.570
But just remind you that
you're being videotaped so that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.660 position:56%
if you do ask questions you are
giving us permission to be recorded.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.170
Now, I'd like to introduce
our speaker.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.530
Soule Satayeva is Vice-Director of
the Kazakh Central State Archive

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.720
of Cinema, Photo and Recording
Documents in Astana, Kazakhstan,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.940
a position she's held since 2010.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.160
Saule was born into a family of a
famous Kazakh writer, play writer,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.310 position:56%
archivist, Amante Satayeva, and grew

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.220
up among old manuscripts
and photographs.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.240
And you could see how now this
has influenced her life career

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.560
and passion.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.330
Her father's dream was for her to
graduate with a scientific degree

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.860
and become a Fulbright Scholar.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.560
Quite an ambitious
dream for your daughter.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.680
Well, she did graduate with
a degree in engineering

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.910
from Almaty Technical University
and was a Fulbright Scholar

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.710
at American University here in
Washington from 2012 to 2013,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.240
where she did archival
research relating

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.960
to illuminating the
Kazakh nomadic culture.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.050
She is a member of the
Kazakh Society of Archivists.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.650
Today's program draws
upon her archival research

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.610
of the American Travels who
illuminated Kazakh nomadic culture

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.810
through their visual documents.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.680
And please give me a warm welcome
to invite Saule to the podium

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.150
to show us all of her
photographic collection.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.950
Thank you.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.540
[ Applause ]

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.670
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Thank you so
much for so warm introducing.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.070
I am very happy to be in this
great country and great library.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.750
And let me start my talk.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.360
It is recognized today
that the latest stage

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.440
of our global consumer culture
have created a new crisis.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.070 position:56%
And many scholars now are looking
for the ways and discuss the futures

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.040
of a new ideology that will prolong
the existence of human beings

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.480
by reducing competition
for land, water and food

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.590 position:56%
and by preserving natural resources.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.300
And scholars now realize the
correlations between this ideology

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.140
and ideology of nomadic cultures.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.440
And they explore the way in which
this ancient culture can inform our

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.060
lifestyles in the future.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.150
And this project represents that
outgrowth my dissertation based

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.220
on a comparative analysis of visual
documents and writing sources.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.380
And also, I have been
studying this project,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.880
the subject of nomadic culture and
visual documents for many years.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.940
And since I have made
research in Kazakh libraries

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.580
where I was fortunate to
uncover several printed works

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.050
of foreign travelers to Asia

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:55.070
and also a bibliographical edition
listing travelers to Central Asia.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.120
And the second was my Fulbright
Scholarship where I was fortunate

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.610
to uncover visual documents
of American travelers

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.140
to Kazakhstan while presenting
lecture at Harvard, Columbia,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.900
Wisconsin Medicine, Indiana, Texas
and Maryland universities as well

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.790
as at Wilson Center,
Smithsonian Institution

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.460
and American University
in Washington, DC.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.060
But it was one of your
best librarians,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.490
Harold Leich who I contacted
when I just have a dream

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.470 position:56%
to come here as a Fulbright Scholar.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.080
It was early two millennium.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.160 position:56%
And I got his very warm invitation
to come sometimes and to do research

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.400
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.220
And when I came here Harold
Leich and Patrick Longhney,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.890
they gave me a tour to Packard
Campus, which was a huge collection

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:02.010
of audio-visual documents
from all over the world.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.850
And you can see here where
Patrick opened me a door

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:13.760
to explore the treasures
of the Library of Congress.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:21.100
And I'm very grateful for the
library and for my colleagues.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.460
And also, I hope to
contact a new audience here

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.270
in DC now during my
very short stay here.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.900
Because it is the ninth
largest country in the world.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:44.330 position:56%
And it is strategically vital region
in Eurasia as well as very peaceful

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.030
and reliable country
in Central Asia.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:54.740
And Americans, in my experience,
know very little about Kazakhstan.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.000
And this is the map of my country.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.740
And you can see in
the center Astana.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.320
My archive and I live in Almaty,
which is -- I cannot show it.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.130
Which is -- Almaty, on
the border with Kurdistan.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.820
And you can see, we are situated
between two huge empires,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.080
the Russian Federation and China.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.500
And also Central Asian Republics.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.030
In our country we have
everything except ocean.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:32.780
To see Caspian and Aral Sea, a lot
of rivers, beautiful mountains.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.150
We have a western range
of Tien-Shan mountains.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.400
We have steppe, lakes,
desert, semi-desert.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.450
Everything.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:49.270
And we have very beautiful nature.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.910
And also, that I would like to
show the pictures of my father,

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.700
who was a student at the Moscow
Historical Archival University

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.520
in late 1940s.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.450
And exactly at that time he
started American traveler's diaries

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.300
at the Lenin Library.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.890
So he kept these notes until I
grow up and make me interesting.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.530
He made me interesting in
this very interesting subject.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.580
And he also was the author of a
number of documental movies related

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.980
to the history of Kazakhstan.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.640
And today my talk would be
focused on three questions.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.610
Why the history and culture of
nomads must be started today.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.100
And about the exceptionality
of the Kazakh nomadic culture.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.000
And about Americans who contributed
in preserving our nomadic history.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:55.030
The understanding how human
nowadays shaped the planet shows us

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.890
that nomadic economy now
exists in almost 30 countries,

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.340
nvolving in total about
40 million people.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.710
And nomads in China and Mongolia.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.530
Nomads in Siberia.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:19.350
In South Africa and
in North America.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:25.240
They live desert, semi-desert,
tundra and steppe

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.980
where agriculture is impossible.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.870
And in the 21st Century Mongols
and Kazakh who historically lived

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.170
on that territory as the
so-called iridienta [phonetic].

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:44.260
And some tribes migrated trying
to escape the Soviet policy.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.460
They well adapted to
a modernizing world.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.350
And their tradition and isolation
helped preserve their lifestyle.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.400
They use achievements
of civilization.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.700 position:56%
They not prevent them from migrating
while maintaining their ancestor's

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.770
heritage, including principles

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.430
of sufficient consumption
and also genetic health.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.840
Nomadic society has
been transforming.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.170
However, in psychology
and life attitudes traces

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.940
of nomadic culture habits
have been preserved.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.680
If over time reminiscences

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.830
of nomadism will be
a thing of the past.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.310
Today there is less
time for construction

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.660
of this very unique culture.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.280
With the example of Kazakhs,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.820
it is known that the
longest preserved elements

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.700
of sacred property, even
with the full replacement

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.160
of traditional livelihood
systems by innovations.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.890 position:56%
And also, in the modern educational
system, the young generation is used

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.730
to get very fast and
visual information.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:49.900
And we have to help them to urge
a deeper interest in cultural

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.750
and artistic disciplines.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.690
And there is a task to
educate tolerant people

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:02.170 position:56%
which would be interesting to
create conditions for identification

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.920
with native culture and exploration
of the variety of cultures, beliefs

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.270
and social political systems.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.660
About exceptionality of
Kazakh nomadic culture.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.680
The Kazakh have been the
object of Western research

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.860
in Oriental studies, cultural
studies, linguistic, anthropology,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:33.020
archeology, historical geography
because their territory included

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.960
in the vast steppe empires such as
[inaudible], Huns, Turkik Empire,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.630
Western and Eastern Kipchaks,
Timurids and Mongol Empire.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.300
And also the Kazakh
language consists of two

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.130
and a half million words.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.070
And it is very valuable source.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:05.570
Also, the Kazakh ancestors'
brilliant epic oral tradition was

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.050
continued in the Kazakh culture.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:19.480
And another point is that the
Kazakhs ethnically emerged

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.800
from a union of different nations.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.890
And the uniqueness of their
nomadic culture is a combination

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.190
of steppe and town.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:39.230
A major characteristic of
the Kazakh nomadic culture

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.190 position:56%
that in difficult climatic
conditions the people kept a harmony

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.140
with nature and created a symbiosis

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.610
between urban and rural
environments.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:55.380
In the nomad society,
however, existed the contempt

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.940
of agriculture employment,
which they view as [inaudible].

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.160
In their mind an inability to
migrate and lack of cattle,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.720
considered almost a
humiliation and shame.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.450
And in 1897 the general
population survey data

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.560
of the Russian Empire
indicates that 80%

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.370
of 6 million Kazakhs' livelihood
stemmed from pastoral products

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:30.610
and 18 came specifically from both
integrated cattle and farming only

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.730
in natural irrigated areas.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.700
The Kazakh migrated up
to 120 times a year.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.090
So some clans had normal
to [inaudible]

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.390
to migrate along the
natural water sources.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.710
And some, they had to migrate
along the artificial water sources

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.810
and draw wells.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:55.050
And it was settlers in ancient time
during -- the Kazakhan [phonetic],

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.320
it was organized in
the early 15th Century.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.390
So it was settled by Kazakh Khans.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:09.110
Which clan have this
certain way of migration.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:16.860
And in addition, the Kazakhs,
because they draw wells

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:24.450
and archeological finds of
how they watered the cattle.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:31.930
In addition, the Kazakhs were
engaged in fishing and hunting.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.050
The Kazakhs hunted with falcon.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:41.750 position:56%
And also, they had a special breed
of hunting horses named [inaudible].

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.210
And also they hunted
with the golden eagle.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.220
And also, in a variety
of arts and crafts.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.740
Because the Kazakh had this
nomad way of life and they had

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.610
to migrate many times a
year, they couldn't keep

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.470
with themselves decorations,
special decorations.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:07.700
So they make every piece, every
bedding, furniture, dishes,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:14.410
cupboards, they made
it as a piece of art.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.640
And they also used other things.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:29.000
And this thing they passed
from generation to generation.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.880
In springtime they left winter
[inaudible] for meadows.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.130
And the camels and horses and sheep
grazed freely in the vast area.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.690
And this [inaudible]
nomadic modification lasted

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.990
until the early 1940s.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.100
And for such sanctuaries Kazakhs
absorbed cultural influences

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.930
assimilating some of them.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.860
Mongol, Islamic and Russian
influence did not change

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.160
them radically.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.300 position:56%
They demonstrated their adaptability

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.660
under the constantly
changing environment.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.380
Because Kazakhstan was
always on the crossroad

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.790
of different cultures
from West and East.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.790
And it was the Silk Way.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.390
And through Kazakhstan [inaudible]

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:24.800
through Almaty there were
several ways to get from Europe

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.480
to China, India or Mongolia.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:36.570
And the extinction of Kazakh
nomadic culture was [inaudible]

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:41.130
by the colonization
policy of Russian Empire.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:45.460
Civil war, Russian Revolution
and followed civil war

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.650
and Soviet agricultural policy
that brought to the great famine

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:56.520
in the 1930s and migration
to neighborhood countries,

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.000
thousand hundreds of Kazakh nomads.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.660
And also, another huge impact
was the Stalin oppression regime

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.110
against the so-called
people's enemies.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:18.560
When almost all our
intelligent, progressive

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.960 position:56%
and well-educated personalities were
killed as the peoples of enemies.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.270
Collectivization and [inaudible]
in the 1928 caused a wave

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.160 position:56%
of huge uprising in the entire
country, in the entire Soviet Union.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.560
But in Kazakhstan they
were most widespread

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.860
because they have not been yet
destroyed traditional clan system.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:51.990
According to archival documents
from 1928 till 1933 there were

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.850
over 400 uprisings and riots.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.920
But the rebel sources with their
limited arms couldn't be compared

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:09.050
with the well-trained Red Army
units and [inaudible] divisions.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.790
And one of the Soviet
power achievements was

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.290
that it's totally changed
the face of the society,

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.270
especially the young
generation psychology.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.840
That all the authority's action

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.500
to suppress people's
enemies were supported,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.000
silently supported,
in the community.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.010
And the origin of Stalin's struggle
with nationalism can be found

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:45.100
in his total rejection of our
intelligent people's strive

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.970
for independence, which
he considered as, again,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:57.150
taking too seriously by our
advanced and well-educated people.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:02.620
The Communist Party needed
money to convert the country

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.870
from agricultural into industrial.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.850
Therefore, they needed
rich people properties.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.550
In the minds of Stalin and
Galashurkin [phonetic] the ruler

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.350
of Kazakhstan, the
Kazakhs were a rich nation.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:20.740
Because less than 5 million people,
they had 40 million head of stock.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:30.670
And starting from 1928 they erected
several factories to produce meat

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.310
and sell it to the
Western countries.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.280
And also sell a lot of
wheat to Western countries.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:48.240
And from 40 million head of stock
in the 1933 left only 4 million.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.420
And analysis of our historians
and demographers shows

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.990
that my people lost
2.2 million people.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:06.270
And that was 49% of the
population at that time.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:11.120
And 600,000 Kazakh migrated
to neighborhood countries.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.190
And that was the end of
Kazakh nomadic culture.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.620
The problem of the Kazakh famine

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.710
and nomadic cultural research
should be studied for the sake

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.690
of historical truth and justice.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.000
And also in order to
prevent repetition

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.560
of similar tragedies in the future.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.160
And my work and research will
have further understanding

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.540 position:56%
of Kazakh culture and how it relates
to other unique nomadic cultures.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.310
Philosophers and culturalists know

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.810
that the more [inaudible]
the world unites,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.570
the more actively people connect
to protect their national identity.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.300
And believe that in order to
survive in the global world,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.860
they should change in
their cultural roots.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.880
And this has brought
[inaudible] processes

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.280
of [inaudible] dialectic
of globalization law.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.930
And we have a general
crisis of values now.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:13.460
Because the manufacture of human
happiness has become the central

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.630
problem of new technological age.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.650
There are free will, but to
change this is impossible

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:25.950
without changing the
individual's relation to the world.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.670
And we need the more highest and
more reliable reference points.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:39.160
When I did research in the Kazakh
library of Academy of Science,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.630
I have found the printed manuscript

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.940
of Armeni Vanbili [assumed
spelling], the Hungarian traveler,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:51.010
who in the 1880s as a
pilgrim, he made journey --

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.120
he was Turkologist linguist.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200
He made journey from
Hungary to East, to Asia.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.620
And he wrote that he had to
sleep with only one closed

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.900
because he was afraid
that when he would speak

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.030
in his native language
in his dreams.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.630
So at that time, for foreign people
from Europe, it was very dangerous

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.650
to do such kind of trips.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:26.340
And he wrote in that book
that he met one Kazakh woman.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.090
And he asked her about the
reasons inducing them to migrate.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.420
And she answered him with laughter.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.180
"We are not so lazy as
you are [inaudible].

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.950
We cannot sit on one
place whole days.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:44.060
You see, the men should move
because the moon, star, sun, water,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.010
animals, birds, fish all move.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:53.310
Only ground and dead
remain on the place."

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:58.930
And two years ago I was
on conference in Moscow.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:06.650
And I realized my long plan to
visit the Museum of Nomadic Culture

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:12.220
in Moscow and meet the director of
that museum, Constantine Kuksin,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.780
which I knew by his
publication before.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.000
And Constantine Kuksin, he
travels all over the world.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.520
And he has a number of dwelling
houses of different nomadic people.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.330
And it's very nice museum.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.630
This is Kazakh yurt.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.710
He collected all that material.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.210
And he said that if you want

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:42.480
to study Kazakh nomadic culture
you should go to Mongolia.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.730
So, that is his citation
from his article.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.600
And I'm totally agree that
"nomadic people with their way

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.600
of life are not an echo
of bygone centuries.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.350 position:56%
They live in the 21 Century among us

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.810
and keep their modest
life despite the fact

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.020
that many great empires collapsed,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.910
leaving us with only
records and monuments.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.920
Because they took just like that,
not giving anything in return.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.810
In fact, nobody knows where is
going the Western civilization.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.550
And if the world will suffer from
a catastrophe, it's more likely

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.460
that only nomads will survive."

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.080
That's why decided that
nomads are very strong reserve

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.810
of human civilization.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.740
So, I came to my last
part of my talk.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:37.250 position:56%
And I'm very happy to say, to
speak, to talk about brave, curious,

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:43.920
intelligent, well-educated American
travelers who did not afraid to go

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.900
to the land of terra incognita

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.540
in the late 19th Century,
beginning of 20th.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.480
And the reconstruction
of [inaudible] picture

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.650
of the past demands the
examination of new sources

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.800
which offer us the possibility to
expand our past representations.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.240
And the study of nomadic culture
is impossible without bringing

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.560
in writing and visual
documents created

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.980
by participants or
direct eyewitnesses.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.640
So, there is all foreign
travelers, scholars, diplomats,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.670
merchants falls into that category.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:29.080
And they have great value because
they brightly express the color

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.070
of the epoch and give certain
information or historiography,

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:39.360
economic employments, way of
life, traditions and customs.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.300
And that is the information how
man study man in all variety

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.540
of [inaudible] his display.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:52.350
And also, audiovisual documents.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:59.560
This is George Kennan, one of the
famous journalists and traveler.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.250
In 1885 he researched the life of
peoples of Siberia and Kazakhstan.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.480
And from the American
biographic sources follows

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.390
that he was typical self-made man.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:20.410
In 1855 at orders of "Century
Illustrated" monthly magazine

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.580
together with the artist George
Frost, he studied exiled places

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.390
of political prisoners
of imperial Russia,

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.050
located on the [inaudible]
of Kazakhstan.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.320
The Imperial administration
[inaudible] was exiling unreliable

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.310
people, carried out the policy
of colonization of Kazakhstan.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.090
And travelers were occupied
with bulky photographic devices.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.810
And George Frost did it numerous
drawings and photographs.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.760
And this is a marketplace
in Semipalatinsk.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.540
This is one of the biggest
our city in Kazakhstan.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:04.350 position:56%
Kazakh nomadic they documented also.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:10.650
Semipalatinsk we have a very big
Irtysh River and ferry on it.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:18.530
In his archive there are a lot
of photographs of exiled people.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.090
And very interesting photographs
when Kazakhs had a meeting

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.440
with official general
government in Semipalatinsk.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:36.000 position:56%
And also they documented some
nature, the Kazakh steppe in spring.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:54.150
So, you can see that a witness of
this visual documents, photographs,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.970
cinema documents, they can
offer previously unknown facts

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.690
or already forgotten facts,
which is sometimes the same.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.880 position:56%
And or important data to triangulate
with already known events.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.980
And they fix information
that cannot be reflected

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.600
in other kind of sources.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.290
Eugene Schuyler, he
was consul at Moscow

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.520
and St. Petersburg in 1870, 1876.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:29.430
And he was familiar with the
very well-known Russian writers,

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.600
scholars, military men.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.430
And he was very well, in good
relations with Leo Tolstoy.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:44.130
And Leo Tolstoy, he advised him
to go to Arinbourg [phonetic]

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.740
which used to be the capital
of Kazakhaned [phonetic]

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.720
which is up of the Caspian Sea.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.280
And he advised him
to go to the east.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.740
And supplied him with
letters and recommendations

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.190
to his friends and relatives.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:09.050
So, Schuyler traveled
by train to Arinbourg.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.300
And from Arinbourg he traveled
along Caspian Sea, Aral Sea

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:21.060
and also the cities that
placed in that area.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:27.650
Later he appeared with the reports
about his trips at the session

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:33.100
of Russian Geographic Society
and became its full member.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.160
And also, he met the son of the
last khan of the [inaudible] horde,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.140
Gubaydolla Zhangirov, who
introduces Schuyler to the history

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.150
of the Mausoleum Hodzha Akhmet
Yassayi and its unique exhibits.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.770
And he wrote: "Almost
our only fellow passenger

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.330
in the carriage was Prince
Tchinghiz, a lineal descendant

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.280
of famous Tchinghiz Khan,
and the son of the last Khan

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.550
of the Bukeief Horde of Kirghiz.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.550 position:56%
Strange that that on the threshold
of Asia I should meet the descendant

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.340
of its greatest conqueror.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.940
After the death of his
father, he, the eldest son,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.860
was given the Russian
title of Prince in memory

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.550
of his ancient lineage, and of
the services of his father."

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.580
Really, Gubaydolla Zhangirov
was a very interesting

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.570
and outstanding companion
of American diplomat.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:30.980 position:56%
He left from [inaudible] of pages in
St. Petersburg and for participation

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:36.590
in Russian-Turkish war in 1877 he
received the rank of general major.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:41.480
Schuyler characterized him
as a cultural diplomat,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.110
deeply knowing French literature.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:50.000
And he helped Eugene Schuyler

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.290
to visit Mausoleum
Hodzha Akhmet Yassayi.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:58.690
And later Schuyler wrote
about this majestic structure.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.400
He was there at the restless time.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.200
Mausoleum was in the center
of events when Imperial Army

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.670
of Russia started its
military expansion

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.050
against Central Asian Khans,
[inaudible] and [inaudible].

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:16.190
Today the information written by
the American diplomat, interesting,

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.260
first because his own
vision of the Mausoleum.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:28.410
And second, at that time, the
Mausoleum was used as an armory.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:33.320
And all the gravestones and
monuments were taken out.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.050
And Schuyler's records
provide some information

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.650 position:56%
about where exactly Kazakh Khans and
their descendants have be buried.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.470
And the fact that the
Imperial conquerors intended

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.460
to destroy this unique
structure is well known.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.760
And all the intervention

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.400
of the advanced democratic
people opinion rescued it

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.900
from the destruction.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:01.340
And there is the pictures of the
nowadays mausoleum, which is --

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.600
it is very unique structure
in Central Asia.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.470
It is one of the biggest.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.910
And there is some elements
of the mausoleum.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:20.810
And it's very crowded for
tourists and also for people

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:26.000
who follow Islam in Central Asia.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.880
And also, it's interesting how
Schuyler wrote about the area

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.100
where he visited: "The
whole area carries

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.720
on itself the traces
of ancient cultivation.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.510
It is obvious there was
existed a vast settlement

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.120
of the people Here the hills
covered by brakes of haloxylon

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.780
and other bushes here
and there, apparently.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.920
They are ruins of ancient
cities, evidently.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.080
There exists an old legend that
all valley of Syr-Dar'ya was

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.350
so dense populated one time that
a nightingale flying from a branch

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.020
to branch of fruit trees, and a
cat running from a wall to wall

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.890
and from a roof to roof could reach
from the Kashgar up to the Aral.

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:16.240 position:56%
By traces of this part of the river,

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.730
here there were large prospering
cities here, among which Otrar,

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.480
Sauran, Tend and Tani-Kend
were allocated."

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.780
And that's true.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.960
Later Kazakhstan is
one of the unique place

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.120
where lived people
since ancient time.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.080
And we have over 300 places
of ancient petroglyphs.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.990
And also, our archeologists
discovered

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:48.710
over 150,000 settlements
only along Syr-Dar'ya River.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.330
And also, a lot of towns were
discovered in the north, east,

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.540
west and center of Kazakhstan.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.040
For example, this is a burial mound
of Skiffen [phonetic] culture,

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.250
which could be found from the
Pacific Ocean to the Black Sea.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.500
[Inaudible] from the
Turkey [inaudible].

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.740
And also a number of mausoleums.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.970
Another great American
traveler, Januarius MacGahan,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.260
correspondent of "New York Herald."

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.470 position:56%
He was another Schuyler's encounter.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:28.970
In 1873 with extreme hardship he
reached the Russian army before

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.920
[inaudible] and sent to the
Herald reports of his companion,

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.410
which won him high admiration
both at home and in Europe.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.610
His account of capitulation
of the city being regarded

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.480
as a masterpiece of
military journalism.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.950 position:56%
It is known that MacGahan gave
description of historical monuments,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.790
music, culture, way
of life of Kazakhs.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.840
And what is the more interesting
and unique for us that he wrote

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.790
about Kazakh national
instrument dombra,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.950
which was popular and
now very popular.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.620
And usually it has two strings.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.290
But he wrote that this dombra
has third string made of copper.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:17.170
And it's very rare musical
instruments and Kazakh used it

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:24.170
since ancient time
from AD centuries.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:29.360
The famous American geologist
William Davis Morris visited our

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:35.390
southeast territory in 1913.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:43.100
And he studied Tien-Shan Mountains
in connection to the global problem

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.620
of interrelation of nature.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:50.850
Specifically he looked how
changing climatic condition

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:58.120
of Asia influenced the history of
people who lived in that territory.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.450
And when I was presenting lecture

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:05.350
at Harvard University
I had only three days.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:09.780
And that university has
a number of libraries.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.320
So just on the last day, just
a few hours before my plane,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:24.360
I found his diaries, named
"Turkistan 1" and Turkistan 2."

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.760
And I managed to make a
pictures from my cell phone.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.440
And I was very happy.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.390
And this album has a lot
of beautiful drawings.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:41.730
And also some of the drawings
not only about his profession,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:47.300
about geology and also
about our culture.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:56.380
And that was very interesting
that I lived in Harvard.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.410
And I had to go to Boston.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.700
So I had to be in Boston as well.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.000
So, I made a stop in Boston.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.420
Went up from Metro.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.750
Made pictures in four direction.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.410
And now I can say that
I was in Boston as well.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.500
But, it was just maybe one minute.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.260
So, in that way I managed
to discover photographs

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.970
when I did my talks in
different universities.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:32.630
So, one of the brightest collection
I discovered in the archive

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:37.530
of New York Natural History Museum.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.510
In 1926 they sent expedition
to Asia.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:47.600
The so-called Morden and
Clark Asiatic Expedition.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:54.700
And in that expedition included a
lot of botanists, anthropologists,

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.910
zoologists, photographers.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:06.260
And they documented everything they
saw including our flora and fauna

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:12.350 position:56%
of the region they visited and also
way of life and economic employments

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:18.140
of the nations who lived in that
territory, including Kazakhs.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:24.050
And this is screenshot
from the silent movie.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.580
They provided me the
copy of the silent movie.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.830
And you can see they
started from Bombay.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.300
They crossed India.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.750
They crossed Tibet.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:38.700
Then they crossed China
and Kazakhstan.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.150
And also the places
where lived Kyrgyz,

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:46.000
Oygurs [phonetic] and also Russia.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.840
And in Biskh [phonetic]
they took train to Beijing.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.340
So, it was a very long,
very interesting expedition.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.860
And if we will have time,

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:01.360
I would like to show you a
little bit of this movie.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:07.460
And later, William Morden, he
wrote this unique publication,

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:15.000
published this about their
life during this expedition.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.560
On this picture you can see camels.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.940
Camels are very important
animal for the caravan.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:33.720
Only camel can see straight
to the face of the hurricane.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:40.290
And he can bring you to the place
you need even no one can see

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.860
anything except snow and wind.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.120
So it was very -- it is very
valuable, very reliable,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.000
wise and stable cattle
in our culture.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:06.340
Red Army soldiers, 1926.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.640
Kazakh hunter.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:24.810
In my last days of my Fulbright
Scholarship, all the 11 months

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.500
when I have been here, I tried

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.810
to see the collection
of National Geographic.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:35.000
But I was denied because they
said that their archive are not

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.170
for the international researchers.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.200
So, but we lived here.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.250
We made a lot of friends
and colleagues.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:50.870
And one of my friend,
who adopted Kazakh boy,

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:57.490
his brother's wife worked for
that National Geographic Society.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.050
So again, in the last days
of my stay here I was allowed

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.630
to see archives of
National Geographic Society.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.300
And they said: You
have only one hour.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.450
So I had to be very fast.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.380
And I made pictures
of their archive.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:24.780 position:56%
And it was amazing because in 1936
there was a sun icplease [phonetic].

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.740
Icplease?

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.040
&gt;&gt; Eclipse.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.340
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Eclipse.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.640
Sun eclipse.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:37.520
And in the entire Soviet Union
there were about 40 expeditions,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.310
including Soviet expeditions.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.740
And American Bureau
of Standards as well.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.570
So they were in Kazakhstan
in our [inaudible] city

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.390
and Abulak [phonetic] village.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:54.960
And they documented this
very rare astronomical event

00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:01.790
on the June 19, 1936.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:06.720
And at that time they [inaudible]
from the Black Sea to Kamchatka.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.680
And among them were photographers.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.980
Irving Gardner, Paul
McNealy and Robert Moore.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:22.700
And they documented also the life

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:29.350
of ordinary citizens
and the Kazakh people.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.420
And why they're available?

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:42.050
Because that is unique visual
information about Kazakhs

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:51.000
that survived after the great
famine in 1933 -- 1931, 1933.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.730
So the English proverb says

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.110
that [inaudible] see the
most of the [inaudible].

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:06.450
And I believe that
American travelers document,

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.330
visual documents, [inaudible]
a lot of [inaudible]

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.360
that should be discovered.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.120
And it is especially
important to know

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.620
that Americans travels photographs
have not been yet the subject

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:24.360
of a special study in the history
to study the nomadic culture.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:30.640
In travels, a personal photographs,
they are obviously less official,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.510
less political than
official publications.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:37.960
In the ancient nomadic tradition,
material culture are less present

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.580
in material data because
felt, leather

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.640
or wood are not easily preserved.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:51.500
And it is hard to imagine,
original text hard

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.000
to imagine how nomads
dressed, looked like and lived.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000 position:56%
And also, one of the obstacles of
Kazakh historiography is the lack --

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:10.680
or is not relatively not big amount
of writing and visual documents.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.720
And most documents were made
by neighborhood countries.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.800
And because of political influence,
they are not full and objective.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.750
And for the long time the Kazakhs

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.730
in Russian historiography were
called Kyrgyz, which was a mistake.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:36.780
And also, it's very difficult
for researchers to study,

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.470
to identify which belong
to Kyrgyz culture nomadic

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.300
or to Kazakh culture.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.750
And thanks to the Library
of Congress

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:53.140
that accumulated a huge amount
of documents, visual and writing.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:46:04.960
And our task is to find the most
appropriate usage of this heritage.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:10.790
And I have applied for the
Library of Congress Scholarship,

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:19.130
the Kluge Scholarship with the
idea to create digital album

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:23.090
about named American
travelers to Central Asia

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.230
with their portraits, photographs.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.530
They made drawings.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.530
And also concise and
to the point citation

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.850
from their writing documents.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:37.420
These two documents
would support another.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:45.550
And for us archivists and scholars,
it's very important to find

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.850
as much documents as
possible and to enter them

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.390
into scholarly circulation.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:57.440
And help the other researchers
to write their works based

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.130
on comparative analysis of
writing and visual documents.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:09.510
And only that archival documents
that enter into the circulation

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:13.630
and published can pass the
stage of unit of storage

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.810
into the historical source.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:22.300
So I'm very grateful for the
Library of Congress for this chance

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.350
to talk to this audience.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:32.460
And even to the global audience
that will see my presentation.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:37.640 position:56%
And also very grateful that American
travelers also made me travel.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.850
And very skilled traveler.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.910
Very fast traveler.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.460
So, thank you so much
for your attention.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.850
And this is the end of my talk.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:52.280
And I would be happy to
answer to your questions.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.580
Ah!

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.880
[ Applause ]

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.180
Would you like to see a short?

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.000
&gt;&gt; Let's see the [inaudible] film.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.510
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Now,
just this [inaudible].

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.810
It's silent.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.030
William Morden.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.000
James Clark.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:40.880
[Inaudible] that he saw
that one family with camels,

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:48.970
sheeps and horses came to stay on
one place that was in 45 minutes

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:53.980
that house was already finished.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:59.320
Cattle was grazing nearby.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.850
Fire was on and food
already prepared.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:07.850
Because every member of the
family, they worked as a team.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.000
Very fast.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:39.900
So, also, I would like to
present this archival journal

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.300
to the library with
my article in it.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:50.010
And also with a lot of articles
of our archivists and scholars.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:54.840
This is one of the famous
archival journal in Kazakhstan.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.440
And it would be a great honor for
us to have it in your library.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.510
Thank you so much.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:06.970
[ Applause ]

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:10.860
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank
you so much for this

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:15.010 position:56%
and for this brilliant presentation.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.400
It's been fantastic.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.670
I think we've all seen new things

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.880
that we would never
have seen before.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:29.000
And I certainly am going to try
to a better job of traveling

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.510
and documenting as a result.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:41.340
We do have a few minutes
for a couple questions,

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.910
if someone wanted ask them.

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:48.360
Somebody have a question.Yes.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.510
&gt;&gt; This is about your
father's films.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.810
You said he made documentary films.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.110
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Yes.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:57.410
&gt;&gt; Are they available somewhere?

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.070
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Yes,
they are available.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:05.820
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Repeat the
question for the audience.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.120
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Ah.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.430
About my father, who was the author

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:21.080
of several documental movies
relating to the history

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.800
and culture of Kazakh people.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.400
They are available, yes.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.340
They're available.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.330
They are in our archive.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:44.020 position:56%
Because my archive is a cinema,
photo and sound recording documents.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:55.410
And also they are available
in our Kazakh film studio.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:08.360
&gt;&gt; Can you upload them, maybe
to YouTube or something?

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.660
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Yes.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:17.660
I will try to do this.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.960
Definitely.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.670
Thank you.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:22.970
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Yes.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:32.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the wonderful,
really interesting talk.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:39.450
You could see, I was
writing lots of notes

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.840
because I'm very interested
in this topic.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.370
I have, well, two brief questions.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:48.190
One is just a thought.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:51.120
Have you looked at the
writings of Langston Hughes?

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:58.650
Because he went to Central Asia,
I think mostly to Uzbekistan,

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.980
but I think he might
have gone to Kazakhstan.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.980
And I'm curious.

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.170
This was also in the 1920s.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.760
I wonder if he took
any photo [inaudible].

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.810
We could talk afterwards.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.310
But I think he might have taken --

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:18.560
maybe he took some
photos of Kazakhs.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:23.410
So that could be another American
to add to your collection.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.710
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Yes, exactly.

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:29.290
&gt;&gt; And then, the second question
is, I'm wondering sometimes,

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:34.130
and this is my own curiosity,

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.490
because I find it very
difficult, you know.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:40.390
As you mentioned, there
was this confusion

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.940 position:56%
about what Kazakhs should be called.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.660
Whether they should
be called Kyrgyz.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.870
Whether they should be
called this other name.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:52.700
And sometimes also
people on the ground,

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.590 position:56%
especially these American travelers,

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.860
didn't understand maybe
who they were meeting.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:01.980
Whether it was a Kazakh
or Kyrgyz or so on.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:06.690
And I imagine that's
particularly difficult in the film

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.890
versus when they go through
many different places.

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:10.530
And I'm wondering how you tell.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.950
How do you tell if [inaudible]
when you're using these images?

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.290
How do you tell, you
know, what group it is?

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.590
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: Mm-hmm.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.600
So, about the first question about
American traveler Langston Hughes.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.120
I didn't heard about him.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.020
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you about him.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.550
&gt;&gt; Saule Satayeva: That would
be great because I always

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.990
like to add traveler to my list.

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.720
And about second question about
this very huge obstacle that we are

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.020
in Russian historiography
we're all called Kyrgyz.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.320
Yes. And this is quite
easy if I do research

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.620
about travelers who did in Siberia.

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:37.920
So in Siberia there were no Kyrgyz.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.220
They were Kazakhs.

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.520
And it's quite difficult
if it's Turkistan area.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.820
So, the way I can tell is
that in that movie especially,

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.120
the Kyrgyz were first, after Tibet.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.420
Kyrgyz were first.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.720
And they used in their
nomadic economy yaks.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.020
And after that, we are.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.320
So, that's why I --
because it's chronological.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.620
They went up through -- so
Kyrgyz were on that side of --

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.920
south side of Tien-Shan Mountains.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.220
And we are on the north side.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.520
So it's only chronological.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.820
And also, of course, our
specialist can see the --

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.120
the yurt, especially,
dwelling house.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.420
It's similar at first sight.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.720
But it has some differences.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.020
And our specialists
can differ, can differ.

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.320
And also by style of
dress, by animal they used.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.620
So there's some hinges
that scholars can use.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.920
But it is, of course,
it would be easy

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.220
if we were Kazakhs
everywhere in many sources.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.520
So that was unfortunate for us.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.820
So, thank you for that question.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.120
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Just
one more question?

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.420
Okay. Well, thank you so much

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.720
for this wonderful
addition to the collections.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.020
Let's give another
round of applause.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.320
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
