00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
People spend a lot of time looking forward to their next meal.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.800
Will it be pizza, a burger, a salad or... a bus?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.980
I mean, could you eat a bus?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.740
A strange question, it seems, but let's find out!

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.760
The point of eating is to provide your body with energy.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.340
Food enters the mouth where it's broken down into smaller pieces by saliva and chewing.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
It then enters the belly where the movement of the muscles around the stomach and gastric juices

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.020
break it down further.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.200
From the stomach the mixture of food passes into the small intestine

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.500
and large intestine where useful nutrients, and water from your meal are absorbed.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.080
The remaining material is waste and a poop which exits through... your butt hole.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.820
Enzymes are molecules in our body which help speed up the reactions and

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.120
chemically break down food.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.940
They are present throughout most of the digestive process but are picky

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.880
about what they want to break down. For example, in your saliva,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.220
the enzyme amylase starts breaking down carbohydrates to maltose, a type of sugar.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.780
But, in the small intestine, another enzyme called maltase converts the maltose to glucose

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080
which is then used for energy by the body.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.220
However, some people lack the necessary enzymes to break down specific foods.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.820
Consider the case of Lactose Intolerance where the body is unable to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.460
produce sufficient levels of the enzyme lactase to break down lactose found in foods like milk,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.300
yogurt and cheese. As a result they can have problems with digestion such as:

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.280
abdominal bloating, farting or nausea. When it comes to eating a bus,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.700
we don't have enzymes specifically designed to chemically break down

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.400
glass, steel or plastic, but that hasn't stopped humans from eating remarkable things.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.260
Mashalla Tito, a French entertainer known as Mr. Eat Everything, consumed,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.140
among other things, a computer, a pair of skis, six chandeliers and an airplane!

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.000
This task took two years to finish.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.220
To do it, he disassembled items and cut them into small pieces which

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.000
he ate with regular meals.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.660
He added mineral oil to lubricate the passage of the small pieces

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.800
and lots of water to wash them all down.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.520
Lotito claimed to eat approximately one kilogram of non-food material daily

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.720
while doing these stunts, from which he amazingly suffered no ill effects to his health.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.880
It turns out he had an insatiable desire to eat things like dirt, rubber and metal,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.220
a condition known as "Pica". Pica differs from person to person.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.440
Some people consume non-food items to satisfy an appetite due to exterme mineral deficiency

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.580
whereas other cases of pica are related to psychological disorders.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.940
Pica can be quite dangerous as severe complications may arise from eating things our bodies weren't

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.380
designed to process.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.360
So, then, how did Mashalla Lotito do it?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.560
It's said that Lotito had an abnormally thick stomach lining which prevented

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.320
structural damage as the metal passed through his system.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.060
In this case, he just got lucky that his pica coincided with a well suited biological abnormality.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.420
So, could you eat a bus? Hypothetically, maybe, with a rare thick stomach lining and the bus chopped into

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.760
tiny pieces over many years, it might be possible.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.360
But, technically, since you don't produce any enzymes for it, and you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680
absorbing any nutrients, you aren't actually eating the bus, just simply...

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.740
passing it through. And, we don't exactly recommend trying to find out if you can.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.280
Just... don't.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.760

This week we wanted to recommend the book: "What If?", by Randall Munroe, which does an amazing job

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.460
at answering hilarious, and sometimes absurd, hypothetical questions.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.320
It's honestly a fantastic book. You can get a free 30-day trial at audible.com/asap and choose from their massive selection.
