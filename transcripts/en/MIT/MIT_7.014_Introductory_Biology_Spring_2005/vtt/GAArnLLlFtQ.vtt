00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.642
So, today we're going to
continue with our series of

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:12.502
lectures to come to a conclusion
from the section on population

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.936
and community ecology.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.808
At last time,
or three lectures ago,

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:26.000
we were talking about the
regulation of population growth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.217
And this time,
we're going to move into,

00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:37.638
just wanted to make sure the
boards are in order,

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.046
community ecology.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:47.806
And as I said of the first
lecture, this is one of the most

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:55.030
difficult branches of the
ecological sciences to really

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.254
describe because an ecological
community is a bit of an

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:06.000
abstract concept.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.937
And one definition is that it's
a collection of species that are

00:01:18.937 --> 00:01:39.000
linked together by their feeding
relationships.
00:01:29&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.125
OK, so it's sort of like the
ecosystem without the

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.949
biogeochemistry in a sense.

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:53.435
So really what we're looking at
here is the interaction between

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:59.815
species in a localized area with
respect to how they influence

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:04.000
each other's fitness,
in a sense.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.642
And these interrelationships
between these species govern all

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:13.053
of the things that we talked
about in the first half of my

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:14.059
lectures set.

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.392
It's these interactions that
shape the biogeochemistry of

00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:19.476
those systems.

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:23.035
So, this is the structure of
the system and the

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:26.517
biogeochemistry is the function
of the system.

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:30.000
And it's also these
interactions.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.827
So, they affect the flow of
energy, which we talked about.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:45.862
They affect the cycling of
elements.

00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:55.344
They affect the evolution,
the very evolution of species

00:02:55.344 --> 00:03:00.000
within the community.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.466
And these communities self
assemble.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:08.022
In other words,
if you start with an empty plot

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:11.389
of bare land,
we talked about this.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:17.035
Remember the example of the
glacier retreating and showing

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:21.987
the succession of species as the
glacier retreated?

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:27.830
We started with a bare rock,
and you'll start getting lichen

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.000
growing on the rock.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.785
And then that lichen will
create a little bit of soil,

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:38.714
allowing plants to come in,
and that the plants increase

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:39.642
productivity.

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:43.714
Some of them bring nitrogen
and, allowing shrubs and trees

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:44.785
and everything.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:48.000
And that's the self-assembly of
the community.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.785
Once you have plant there,
you can have insects there.

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:55.285
Once you have insects there,
you have birds there.

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:56.571
It self assembles.

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:59.928
And one of the questions that
ecologists ask is,

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:03.000
how deterministic is that?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.052
I mean, we know there are some
random components to it,

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:13.853
and we know that there are some
things that will happen because

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:17.690
we see it happen over,
and over, and over.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.339
So the big question is what
must happen?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.023
What could happen?

00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:25.923
And what might not ever happen?

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:30.976
That's really one of the
challenges of ecologists is to

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:37.578
understand those assembly rules
of community if there are any.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:41.359
Now, we're not going to really
get into that.

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:46.343
We are just going to start
looking at the real fundamentals

00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:51.757
of community [SOUND OFF/THEN ON]
which is, what are the possible

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:55.968
interactions between species
that shape evolution?

00:04:55.968 --> 00:05:07.000
OK.
00:04:57&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.257
Species interactions:
so, when we talk about species

00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:19.024
interactions and how they
structure communities,

00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:23.196
we have to first define some
terms.

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:36.000
One is Darwinian fitness.
00:05:27&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:48.669
And the fitness of an
individual is the relative

00:05:48.669 --> 00:06:03.226
ability of an individual in a
population to survive and

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:16.000
reproduce.
00:06:07&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.274
So, it's all relative,
OK, within a population.

00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:25.199
And we're going to define also,
we'll be talking about

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.380
adaptations, and I know you know
what this is,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.769
but let's just make sure that
we are all operating with the

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.000
same assumption.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.576
And an adaptation,
which is something that affects

00:06:48.576 --> 00:07:02.516
the fitness, is a heritable
trait that increases the fitness

00:07:02.516 --> 00:07:15.983
of an individual with respect to
other individuals in that

00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:20.000
population.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.094
So, these are just some
operating assumptions so that

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:27.165
when we talk about species
interactions,

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:30.000
there are several
possibilities.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.948
If we have organism one and
organism two,

00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:39.278
we can have,
and we ask how does the

00:07:39.278 --> 00:07:47.072
presence of organism two and the
presence of organism one affect

00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:51.030
the fitness of the two
organisms?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:58.082
And if the fitness of both
organisms is increased by being

00:07:58.082 --> 00:08:06.000
in the presence of the other,
that's called mutualism.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.647
Being together increases the
fitness of both relative to when

00:08:13.647 --> 00:08:15.431
they're alone.

00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:21.421
If being together decreases the
fitness of both,

00:08:21.421 --> 00:08:24.735
that's called competition.

00:08:24.735 --> 00:08:32.000
And if you have the situation,
what we recall that?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.054
It could be parasitism,
yeah, parasitism.

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:39.567
What else?

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:45.621
Was the ultimate form of
reduced fitness?

00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:51.978
Predation, yeah,
being dead is the ultimate

00:08:51.978 --> 00:08:54.399
reduced fitness.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:09:00.000
So, parasitism and predation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.018
And then there are some other
sort of rather vague

00:09:05.018 --> 00:09:10.753
interactions where when you put
two individuals together,

00:09:10.753 --> 00:09:16.283
the fitness of one is not
influenced but the fitness of

00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:21.915
the other is either influenced
positively or negatively,

00:09:21.915 --> 00:09:25.909
and we're not going to talk
about those.

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:29.391
But this one's called
commencalism.

00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:34.000
And this one's called
amensalism.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.219
And obviously there are
gradients.

00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:44.995
Actually, an example of
commencalism is something that

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:47.424
we've talked about.

00:09:47.424 --> 00:09:54.584
Can anybody think about what
that is when we talked about

00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:55.863
food webs?

00:09:55.863 --> 00:10:02.000
It's kind of a stretch,
but detritivory.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.583
An organism eating detritus,
in a sense, is commencalism

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:11.500
because it doesn't affect the
fitness of the dead individual

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.666
because it's already dead.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:17.416
So, that gets to not having
that much meaning.

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:21.583
So anyway, these we are not
going to spend time on,

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:25.500
but they are forms of
interaction that do exist.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.583
And there are gradients between
these.

00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:33.000
Obviously, it's not all black
and white.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:44.483
So, we're going to start by
talking about competition.

00:10:44.483 --> 00:10:56.183
And just to remind you,
competition comes in two forms.

00:10:56.183 --> 00:11:07.666
There is intraspecific
competition, which means within

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:12.000
a species, OK?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.468
And that's not what we're going
to be talking about today,

00:11:19.468 --> 00:11:26.544
but we've already talked about
this without explicitly,

00:11:26.544 --> 00:11:33.559
remember our logistic equation
and the density dependent

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:38.986
feedback mechanisms in that
population that caused the

00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:44.617
population to deviate from
exponential growth was due to

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:50.146
intraspecific competition:
individuals within a species

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:54.139
competing with each other for
resources.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:12:11.000
We are going to talking about
now is more interspecific --
00:12:01&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:29.000
-- which is competition between
species, OK?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.192
So, I want to show you some
slides that are just from your

00:12:33.192 --> 00:12:37.385
textbook, but just to get you in
the mood for competition.

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:41.799
So, it comes in all different
forms, and I don't care whether

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.858
you know the names of these.

00:12:43.858 --> 00:12:45.182
It doesn't matter.

00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:49.375
This is just to give you an
idea of the different types of

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:51.803
competition that we see in
nature.

00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:55.113
This is what's called
consumptive competition,

00:12:55.113 --> 00:12:59.526
and this is just showing the
roots of the trees competing for

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:01.145
nutrients in the soil.

00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:06.000
Preemptive competition shows
these are barnacles.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.880
We're going to talk a little
bit more about that later,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.611
just totally taking over the
substrate.

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.061
So no other organism could
possibly settle there.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:20.158
Overgrowth competition in
plants where this plant would be

00:13:20.158 --> 00:13:24.542
shading, so other plants that
require a lot of light could not

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:25.691
grow underneath.

00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:29.429
Chemical competition also
occurs where one plant will

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:33.094
actually excrete certain
chemicals that create these

00:13:33.094 --> 00:13:37.334
corridors of no growth around
them so other plants can't get

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:41.000
near to compete for the
nutrients.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.120
The classic form of
competition, say,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.973
in birds and a lot of higher
organisms is competition for

00:13:48.973 --> 00:13:49.840
territory.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.126
So these are displays so that
an individual can keep a certain

00:13:55.126 --> 00:14:00.240
territory, and therefore make
that food available to itself,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.746
therefore increasing its
fitness because it's able to

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:07.000
feed its young.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.918
And then this is sort of the
classic, really tooth and claw

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:18.428
competition where encounter
competition where all these

00:14:18.428 --> 00:14:23.020
species are competing over this
zebra carcass,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.061
hyena, vultures,
etc.

00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:30.673
OK, now before we can talk more
and more in detail about

00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:37.000
competition, we need to define
the ecological niche.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.656
And this is an interesting
concept in ecology that has been

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:45.912
around for quite some time,
and it kind of went out of

00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:47.759
popularity for a while.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:52.335
And I was gratified to see that
it's made it back into the

00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:56.912
introductory biology textbooks
because I think it's a very

00:14:56.912 --> 00:14:59.000
profound concept.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.949
In this particular competition,
the fundamental ecological

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:05.598
niche comes from G.

00:15:05.598 --> 00:15:09.679
Evelyn Hutchinson,
who is one of the founders of

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:10.982
modern ecology.

00:15:10.982 --> 00:15:15.757
He defined as the fundamental
niche of an organism as an

00:15:15.757 --> 00:15:20.619
N-dimensional hypervolume,
every point on which a species

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:25.395
can survive and reproduce
indefinitely in the absence of

00:15:25.395 --> 00:15:28.000
other species,
OK?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.361
So, this is an abstract
concept, because those species

00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.817
are rarely in the absence of
other species,

00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:38.122
except maybe in a test tube.

00:15:38.122 --> 00:15:41.990
But it defines the,
and also we can't even think

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.047
about N-dimensions,
right?

00:15:44.047 --> 00:15:47.915
We're able to think about,
we can envision three

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:48.820
dimensions.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.593
But what he's talking about
here, is every single dimension

00:15:53.593 --> 00:15:58.448
in the environment that would
have any effect on the fitness

00:15:58.448 --> 00:16:01.000
of an organism.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.893
So here, just to wrap our
brains around this,

00:16:03.893 --> 00:16:06.063
we're looking at three
dimensions.

00:16:06.063 --> 00:16:09.614
Our organisms here is a
ladybug, and this would be food

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:09.943
size.

00:16:09.943 --> 00:16:12.507
These guys eat little aphids
and things.

00:16:12.507 --> 00:16:16.190
I don't know if you've ever
used them under house plants,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.004
but it's a good way to keep
aphids off your house plants if

00:16:20.004 --> 00:16:23.160
you want to introduce ladybugs
to your dorm room,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.607
which maybe you don't.

00:16:24.607 --> 00:16:27.632
But there's a certain range of
size, food size,

00:16:27.632 --> 00:16:30.000
that they can eat.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.963
And so, that's three
dimensions.

00:16:32.963 --> 00:16:38.317
There are undoubtedly many
other dimensions that we don't

00:16:38.317 --> 00:16:42.428
even know about,
elements that they require,

00:16:42.428 --> 00:16:42.811
etc.

00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:48.452
So, this would be everywhere,
in this space is a space where

00:16:48.452 --> 00:16:53.614
this organism could survive and
reproduce indefinitely.

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:59.160
And the reason this concept
lost favor is its something you

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.322
could never ever measure this
because we can't know the

00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:07.000
N-dimensions.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.163
Well, you can never say you
can't know anything,

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:13.663
but it's very difficult to say
you could know all the

00:17:13.663 --> 00:17:17.163
dimensions that influence the
fitness of an organism.

00:17:17.163 --> 00:17:21.269
But it's still a very important
concept for thinking about it.

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:24.028
And the niche is not a physical
place, OK?

00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:28.000
The niche of an organism is not
a physical place.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.555
In an N-dimensional
hypervolume.

00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:32.617
It's an abstract concept.

00:17:32.617 --> 00:17:36.821
So this is the fundamental
niche, and here's another

00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:41.851
closely related species whose
niche has some overlap with this

00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:45.561
one, but has different ranges
for temperature,

00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:47.539
humidity, and food size.

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:52.156
And when you have overlapping
niches is when you have the

00:17:52.156 --> 00:17:55.702
possibility, the potential,
for competition.

00:17:55.702 --> 00:17:59.000
And two things can happen.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.026
If they overlap a lot,
than those two species cannot

00:18:03.026 --> 00:18:05.552
coexist in the same environment.

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:10.052
One will outcompete the other,
and it will move on to some

00:18:10.052 --> 00:18:14.236
other place where it doesn't
have a strong competitor.

00:18:14.236 --> 00:18:18.184
But if they overlap a little,
you can actually have

00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:20.078
competitive coexistence.

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:24.815
And we're going to talk about
the results of these degrees of

00:18:24.815 --> 00:18:29.000
niche overlap as we go on in the
lecture.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.607
So, if the species can makes it
realized, so this is its

00:18:33.607 --> 00:18:37.544
fundamental niche,
this one's fundamental niche,

00:18:37.544 --> 00:18:42.738
and what happens if it can make
its realized niche small enough

00:18:42.738 --> 00:18:46.926
so that there's no niche
overlap, then you can have

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:51.366
coexistence of those two
species, or very little niche

00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:54.047
overlap in the same environment.

00:18:54.047 --> 00:18:58.654
So that's the difference
between the fundamental and the

00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:01.000
realized niche.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.765
I think this is from your
textbook.

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:09.526
This is just one dimension,
seed sized, for,

00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:14.288
say, a bird eating seeds of
this size range.

00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:18.939
We'll be talking about birds a
lot in this.

00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:24.919
And here's partial niche
overlap, species to where they

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:31.563
eat some seeds of the same size,
but by and large the mode is

00:19:31.563 --> 00:19:34.000
different.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.129
You can have species
coexisting.

00:19:37.129 --> 00:19:42.883
Partial niche overlap can lead
to competitive coexistence.

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:48.738
And here's the complete overlap
in just this one dimension,

00:19:48.738 --> 00:19:52.876
which would lead to competitive
exclusion.

00:19:52.876 --> 00:19:59.236
But obviously it matters what's
happening on all the dimensions.

00:19:59.236 --> 00:20:02.668
This is just an
oversimplification,

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:06.000
to give you the idea.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.484
OK, so before we go to that,
I want to talk about the

00:20:15.484 --> 00:20:26.610
classic experiment that led to
this, they're going to put this

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.433
screen up.

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:53.000
Screen, screen,
screen, screen.
00:20:35&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.270
Can you see,
or do I need to turn the lights

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.000
on?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.659
Thank you.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:03.626
I'm sorry, I always ask my
questions that way,

00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:19.000
where there's no possible
answer.
00:21:06&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.578
There were some classic
competition experiments that's

00:21:24.578 --> 00:21:29.000
carried out by Gause way back in
1934 --

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.872
-- that I'm just going to use
to illustrate the concept of

00:21:34.872 --> 00:21:40.024
competitive exclusion,
because these were done with

00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:44.763
very simple protozoa in a test
tube, paramecia,

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:50.121
and actually this was back in
the days when they were

00:21:50.121 --> 00:21:54.963
developing these theories for
population growth.

00:21:54.963 --> 00:21:59.909
And these organisms were
growing according to the

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:03.000
logistic equation.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.565
So here we are with,
and this is the classic

00:22:06.565 --> 00:22:11.458
experiment actually in your
textbook that they talk about in

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:14.360
the context of the ecological
niche.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.848
So this is Paramecia caudatum.

00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:19.253
These names aren't important.

00:22:19.253 --> 00:22:22.985
Don't worry about it,
but we have to call them

00:22:22.985 --> 00:22:23.814
something.

00:22:23.814 --> 00:22:25.224
P.
aurelia, which,

00:22:25.224 --> 00:22:30.282
when grown alone in a test tube
grow according to the logistic

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:35.092
equation, they grow up and then
they level off at a certain

00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:37.000
level.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.559
And what Gause did is that he
wanted to see,

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:51.796
look at this phenomenon of
competition and he grew them

00:22:51.796 --> 00:23:00.338
together, and he found that,
actually that no matter what

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:08.423
combination he put in,
aurelia would always win out in

00:23:08.423 --> 00:23:21.000
competitive exclusion.
00:23:13&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.577
And he learned through a series
of experiments,

00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:28.933
we don't have time to go into
the details, but this would

00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:33.599
always occur if you made two
species compete in a very simple

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:35.000
environment.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.462
In the test tube where he was
feeding these guys exactly the

00:23:39.462 --> 00:23:43.394
same food, some form of
bacteria, in a test tube this

00:23:43.394 --> 00:23:47.630
one would always outcompete the
other, and there would be

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.294
competitive exclusion.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:54.058
If he made the environment more
complex, where there were layers

00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:58.521
in it, or there was sediment in
the bottom of the test tube,

00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:02.000
that allowed more niche
dimensions.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
There were conditions under
which the competitive

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.416
coexistence would be allowed.

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:13.333
And he actually developed a set
of equations to describe his

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:16.916
competition that I'm going to
write for you.

00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:21.833
We're not going to use them;
we're not going to analyze them

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:26.833
in detail, but I'm just going to
show them to you so that you

00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:31.250
have an appreciation for how
population ecologists and

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:37.000
community ecologists start to
think about these systems.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.172
So, he said we can model this
interaction using our logistic

00:24:44.172 --> 00:24:45.266
equation.

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:50.615
So he said dN/dt would be the
growth rate of,

00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:54.019
let's call, the top one,
one.

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:58.517
It doesn't matter what you call
which.

00:24:58.517 --> 00:25:01.313
The dN/dt equals r1,
N1.

00:25:01.313 --> 00:25:08.000
Now here's our logistic,
K1 minus N1 over K.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.032
But he said I'm going to modify
this equation so that the actual

00:25:15.032 --> 00:25:21.060
growth of the organism is
reduced to some amount that's

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:27.423
proportional to the number of
the other organisms that are

00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:28.093
there.

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:32.000
So, he called that alpha-N2.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.673
OK, so some amount that's
proportional to amount the other

00:25:40.673 --> 00:25:43.717
species that's here.

00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:50.260
And then, he said dN2/DT is
equal to r2, N2,

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:57.717
K2 minus N2 minus beta-N1 over,
this should be K1,

00:25:57.717 --> 00:26:00.000
over K2.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.251
So, the growth rate of species
to in the presence of species

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:10.146
one is reduced by some amount
that's proportional to the

00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:12.371
abundance of species one.

00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:17.623
And these, the values of these,
these are called competition

00:26:17.623 --> 00:26:18.780
coefficients.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.675
You can actually do experiments
and put values on these,

00:26:23.675 --> 00:26:28.659
and they are a measure of how
strong a competitor each of

00:26:28.659 --> 00:26:34.000
these species are with respect
to the other one.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.854
So, you're not going to have to
deal with these,

00:26:37.854 --> 00:26:42.447
but I just wanted you to see
them, and see how population

00:26:42.447 --> 00:26:45.646
ecologists began to model these
systems.

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:50.239
And so, it's the relative
values of these relative to the

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:54.914
carrying capacities that will
ultimately determine whether

00:26:54.914 --> 00:27:00.000
species will coexist or not when
they are competing.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.457
OK, so that's more of a
theoretical analysis.

00:27:03.457 --> 00:27:05.972
Now let's look at the real
world.

00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:09.981
Competitive exclusion,
that is, the exclusion of one

00:27:09.981 --> 00:27:14.617
species from an environment
because of strong competition in

00:27:14.617 --> 00:27:18.940
another, is very difficult to
study, because if it's not

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.398
there, you don't know it was
excluded, right?

00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:26.878
I mean, you don't go to some
place and say I don't see the

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:29.000
species here.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.694
It must have been eliminated by
competitive exclusion.

00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:36.440
It might never have been there.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.665
So, the way we learn about this
phenomenon is either through

00:27:41.665 --> 00:27:46.537
inadvertent experiments,
and that is the introduction of

00:27:46.537 --> 00:27:51.231
species to new environments and
then see what happens,

00:27:51.231 --> 00:27:55.128
or actual intentional
ecological experiments.

00:27:55.128 --> 00:28:00.000
So, we're going to talk about
both of those.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And the first one --
00:28:01&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:26.000
-- we'll talk about invasions --
00:28:12&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.022
-- and competitive exclusion.

00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:38.206
And one of the classic examples
of this is the zebra mussel.

00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:41.951
I don't know what happened.

00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:44.170
Oh, there it is.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:48.887
I didn't realize this was
animated.

00:28:48.887 --> 00:28:53.603
That's why there was nothing
there.

00:28:53.603 --> 00:29:01.787
So, the zebra mussel is a tiny
mussel that was introduced to

00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:09.000
the United States back in,
I guess, 1988.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.857
And up here,
introduced into the Great Lakes

00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:16.044
by ships just being attached to
ships, or it's possible it might

00:29:16.044 --> 00:29:18.636
have been the larvae in ships'
ballasts.

00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:21.825
Ships go into port,
they take on water into their

00:29:21.825 --> 00:29:25.082
ballasts to stabilize,
and then they go to another

00:29:25.082 --> 00:29:26.411
port and let it out.

00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:30.000
And they're filled with larvae
and species.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.785
So, the entire world oceans are
now filled with introduced

00:29:37.785 --> 00:29:41.609
species from ships ballasts.

00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:43.658
So here's 1988.

00:29:43.658 --> 00:29:48.712
The zebra mussel is there.
1990: here.

00:29:48.712 --> 00:29:52.126
92: here.
94, 90 whatever,

00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:53.356
oh, 2001.

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:58.000
It spread amazingly fast.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.631
And it is this tiny little
mussel that seems to thrive

00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:07.562
everywhere: clogs,
all kinds of pipes,

00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:13.406
settles on top of other native
shellfish and kills them,

00:30:13.406 --> 00:30:19.250
and has led to extensive
competitive exclusion of native

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.968
shellfish in a number of
ecosystems.

00:30:22.968 --> 00:30:29.343
Some of the effects of these:
in some ecosystems they cleared

00:30:29.343 --> 00:30:32.000
up the water.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.701
They are able to filter just an
amazing amount of water when

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:37.976
they're feeding.

00:30:37.976 --> 00:30:42.997
So they actually have increased
the clarity of the water in many

00:30:42.997 --> 00:30:47.539
ecosystems, filtering out
plankton, which allows the light

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:52.321
to penetrate deeper in those
systems, allowing aquatic plants

00:30:52.321 --> 00:30:54.233
to grow from the bottom.

00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:59.015
So the introduction of this one
species can completely change

00:30:59.015 --> 00:31:03.000
the structure of the entire
ecosystem.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.491
I just heard a lecture.

00:31:04.491 --> 00:31:07.992
I was just visiting the
Institute for Ecosystem Studies

00:31:07.992 --> 00:31:09.872
which is out in Millbrook,
NY.

00:31:09.872 --> 00:31:13.698
By the way, if any of you are
looking for summer internships

00:31:13.698 --> 00:31:17.394
and are interested in ecology,
they have a fabulous summer

00:31:17.394 --> 00:31:18.625
internship program.

00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:22.062
I've had several students go
there that have had great

00:31:22.062 --> 00:31:22.840
experiences.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.147
But there's somebody there
studying the zebra mussel

00:31:26.147 --> 00:31:29.000
invasion in the Hudson River.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.191
And he showed this incredibly
depressing graph of over the

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:37.602
last ten years of the native
mussels in that river going down

00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:39.367
to basically extinction.

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:43.044
And then, this is the weird
thing about ecosystems,

00:31:43.044 --> 00:31:45.985
just last year it started to
turn around.

00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:50.470
And they haven't done anything
to eradicate the zebra mussels,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.441
but the native mussels are
starting to have a comeback.

00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:58.264
And nobody knows why,
and nobody knows whether it's a

00:31:58.264 --> 00:32:04.000
real comeback because it could
come back for a couple of years.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.742
So, it's really interesting how
unpredictable these complex

00:32:09.742 --> 00:32:10.930
systems are.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:16.772
But these mussels can cause
millions and millions of dollars

00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:17.762
of damage.

00:32:17.762 --> 00:32:23.702
And I also learned on that trip
that ecologists are trying to

00:32:23.702 --> 00:32:29.742
get in place policies that if an
industry for whatever reasons

00:32:29.742 --> 00:32:34.000
wants to intentionally
introduce,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.786
Here's an example of an
application of fundamental

00:32:37.786 --> 00:32:39.409
ecological knowledge.

00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:43.659
The reason people study the
ecology of invasive species,

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:47.754
understanding this competitive
exclusion and all that,

00:32:47.754 --> 00:32:52.004
is that you want to use that
understanding to be able to

00:32:52.004 --> 00:32:56.331
predict, if you introduce a new
species to a new habitat,

00:32:56.331 --> 00:33:01.045
whether it will be invasive or
not, there are some species you

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:05.759
can introduce and they will fit
right in and not exclude every

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:08.000
other species.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.672
And so, what they're trying to
put in place is insurance that a

00:33:12.672 --> 00:33:16.742
company would have to buy that
was either intentionally

00:33:16.742 --> 00:33:20.660
introducing a species,
or whatever practice that they

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.976
were doing was likely to
introduce a species,

00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:28.197
and the cost of that insurance
would be a function of the

00:33:28.197 --> 00:33:32.342
probability of that species
actually causing competitive

00:33:32.342 --> 00:33:34.000
exclusion.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.981
And this is something that
people are trying to put into

00:33:38.981 --> 00:33:42.695
place in to the economic system
basically.

00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:47.586
So, it puts a new meaning to
limited liability company,

00:33:47.586 --> 00:33:47.949
LLC.

00:33:47.949 --> 00:33:53.112
So, you have to insure your
liability, which I think would

00:33:53.112 --> 00:33:59.000
go a long way to reduce some of
these ecological crises.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.035
OK, so that's an inadvertent
experiment.

00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:05.227
Now there are many,
many examples of this.

00:34:05.227 --> 00:34:08.419
There's books written on
invasive species.

00:34:08.419 --> 00:34:13.089
And if I can get this thing to
work, I'll show you some clips

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:15.191
of invasive species,
snakes.

00:34:15.191 --> 00:34:19.550
And the biggest impact is on
islands because islands have

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:24.143
been isolated ecosystems for so
long that if you introduce a

00:34:24.143 --> 00:34:26.790
species, you have dramatic
changes.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.904
In Australia,
a big example was a prickly

00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:34.808
pear cactus which was introduced
many years ago to create living

00:34:34.808 --> 00:34:38.000
fences for livestock.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.693
They completely took over not
all of the grasslands,

00:34:42.693 --> 00:34:47.754
but a lot of the grasslands and
turn them into thickets.

00:34:47.754 --> 00:34:52.263
OK, so invasive species are
inadvertent ecological

00:34:52.263 --> 00:34:53.368
experiments.

00:34:53.368 --> 00:34:57.049
Let's talk about intentional
experiments.

00:34:57.049 --> 00:35:02.662
And this is also very classic
textbook experiment that was one

00:35:02.662 --> 00:35:08.000
of the first ecological
experiments to be done.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.487
And it was done with barnacles.

00:35:10.487 --> 00:35:15.220
This was Joseph Connell was a
professor at the University of

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.306
California, Santa Barbara.

00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:21.638
Barnacles have a larval stage
that floats around in the

00:35:21.638 --> 00:35:24.767
plankton, and then they settle
on rocks.

00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:28.939
So this was a classic barnacle
ecosystem in Scotland,

00:35:28.939 --> 00:35:33.593
actually, in which the upper
inner tidal there is a species

00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:36.000
called Chthamalus.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.816
And then the lower was
dominated by a species of mussel

00:35:39.816 --> 00:35:40.876
called Balanus.

00:35:40.876 --> 00:35:44.835
So, he asked the question,
is this distribution where the

00:35:44.835 --> 00:35:48.015
two are exclusive of one
another, is it due to

00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:51.691
competition between them,
or is it just that this one

00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:54.659
tolerates desiccation longer
than this one?

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:57.981
The inner tidal zone,
the tide goes up and down,

00:35:57.981 --> 00:36:03.000
so this one's going to be
exposed to dryness a lot longer.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.596
So, how do you answer that
question?

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:10.195
Well, you do an experiment and
so what he did was he took rocks

00:36:10.195 --> 00:36:13.087
from the upper,
inner tidal that had the

00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:16.722
Chthamalus on them,
and he moved them to the lower

00:36:16.722 --> 00:36:17.019
one.

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:21.024
And he let the Balanus,
the species that dominates down

00:36:21.024 --> 00:36:23.175
here colonize on those rocks.

00:36:23.175 --> 00:36:27.329
But then he divided them in
half, and removed the Balanus

00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:30.000
from half of the rock.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.451
And then he monitored the
survivorship of the Chthamalus.

00:36:34.451 --> 00:36:39.300
And remember the survivorship
curves that we talked about when

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.194
we created those life tables,
he actually measured

00:36:43.194 --> 00:36:45.500
survivorship curves on these.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.951
If you go to the original
paper, you see LX is a function

00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:50.587
of time.

00:36:50.587 --> 00:36:54.482
So that's a tool that we use,
to ask the question,

00:36:54.482 --> 00:36:58.376
is the survivorship of
Chthamalus increased in the

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:01.000
absence of Balanus?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.800
And this is all from your
textbook, showing that the

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.675
percent of mortality,
when a competitor is present is

00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:11.730
much higher than the competitor
is absent.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.903
So, he's able to show directly
that there was competition

00:37:15.903 --> 00:37:17.096
between the two.

00:37:17.096 --> 00:37:19.555
And in fact,
this was that kind of

00:37:19.555 --> 00:37:24.100
aggressive kind of competition
where one just plucks the other

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.367
one off the rock.

00:37:25.367 --> 00:37:28.125
I mean it's direct:
you're on my rock;

00:37:28.125 --> 00:37:32.000
get out of here,
and it pops it off.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.545
He also was able to show that
tolerance to desiccation is also

00:37:37.545 --> 00:37:39.727
a factor in this system.

00:37:39.727 --> 00:37:43.181
It's not like it's totally
competition.

00:37:43.181 --> 00:37:48.363
But competition was playing a
role, and so I've summarized

00:37:48.363 --> 00:37:52.000
that in this slide using our
terminology.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.454
He was able to show that the
fundamental niche of Chthamalus,

00:37:57.454 --> 00:38:04.148
in other words --
-- the region in the inner

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:13.723
tidal, where the larvae could
actually settle and live in the

00:38:13.723 --> 00:38:23.776
absence of competitors was much
broader than the realized niche.

00:38:23.776 --> 00:38:30.000
All right, so let's get this
over.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.039
This is from your textbook.

00:38:36.039 --> 00:38:49.013
And we're going to just use,
I'm going to use an example of

00:38:49.013 --> 00:38:50.131
that.

00:38:50.131 --> 00:39:14.000
So, competition can also lead
to character displacement --
00:39:04&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.869
-- which in turn can lead to
actual competitive coexistence.

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:30.084
And an example of this,
we're going to talk about

00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:37.000
Darwin's finches in the
Galapagos Islands.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.229
And one of the ways that
ecologists actually measure,

00:39:47.229 --> 00:39:55.688
that's a bird,
in case you didn't notice it.

00:39:55.688 --> 00:40:01.000
And this is beak depth.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.785
The shape and size of a beak
tells you what kinds of seeds a

00:40:07.785 --> 00:40:12.846
bird can eat,
and so they measured beak depth

00:40:12.846 --> 00:40:18.827
as a niche dimension,
basically, because it tells you

00:40:18.827 --> 00:40:22.507
what size seeds the bird can
eat.

00:40:22.507 --> 00:40:28.488
And a study was done;
we're going to make the islands

00:40:28.488 --> 00:40:29.063
here.

00:40:29.063 --> 00:40:37.000
What is going to call them A,
B, C, D; these are islands.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.982
And there are two species of
finches, which we are just going

00:40:45.982 --> 00:40:47.479
to call F.

00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:51.221
Well, they're fuliginosa.

00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:59.005
Again, the name's not
important, and the other one is

00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:02.000
called fortis.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.087
So, we'll just call them,
on islands that have both of

00:41:08.087 --> 00:41:13.945
them, and there are some islands
that have only one.

00:41:13.945 --> 00:41:20.148
So, what was done is they
measure the beak depth of the

00:41:20.148 --> 00:41:27.270
different finches on the islands
where they were found together

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:33.932
versus islands where they were
found alone in the Galapagos

00:41:33.932 --> 00:41:36.000
Islands.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.714
And what they found,
and this has been shown for

00:41:42.714 --> 00:41:46.857
many, many different studies.

00:41:46.857 --> 00:42:07.000
You look at the beak depth
distribution.
00:41:53&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:17.434
This is percent in size class.

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:31.000
And this is island C,
D, and A, and B.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.307
And they found that when the
species were on islands where

00:42:38.307 --> 00:42:44.461
they lived alone,
they had almost complete niche,

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:47.282
oh this is beak depth.

00:42:47.282 --> 00:42:53.564
They had exactly the same size
beak distributions.

00:42:53.564 --> 00:42:59.205
In other words,
they were feeding on the same

00:42:59.205 --> 00:43:01.000
food.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.244
And on the islands where they
were together,

00:43:07.244 --> 00:43:15.666
A and B, I'm just making sure
this actually holds together,

00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:22.636
they found what is called
character displacement,

00:43:22.636 --> 00:43:31.204
and that is that the birds that
had longer beaks and smaller

00:43:31.204 --> 00:43:39.481
beaks, were preferentially
selected for such that reducing

00:43:39.481 --> 00:43:45.000
the amount of niche overlap.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:44:03.000
So, and this leads to
competitive coexistence.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:18.921
OK, and that's what we're
looking at here.

00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:29.794
This is from your textbooks.

00:44:29.794 --> 00:44:51.929
This is from African seed
crackers showing that birds with

00:44:51.929 --> 00:45:10.958
smaller bills consume soft seeds
more efficiently.

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:34.646
Birds with larger bills crack
hard seeds, and you can see that

00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:37.246
the width of the bill here is
different.
