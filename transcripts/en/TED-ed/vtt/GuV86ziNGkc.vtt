00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:05.119
What advice would you give to your 16-year-old self?

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:08.599
When someone challenges you or a group,

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.112
sometimes know when not to take the challenge on,

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:12.932
like I'm going to lose, that's going to suck,

00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:15.353
but sometimes know when to take the challenge on.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:16.958
In my freshman year in college,

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.222
a professor said, "If no one takes the final exam,

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.440
everyone will get an A.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.692
But if one person takes it,

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:25.046
everyone in the class will get a double F, get a zero,

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.673
and the whole class will fail."

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:28.631
And for ten years, he had been doing this challenge.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.589
And this was most popular class in college,

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.301
and there were students of all years,

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.195
two valedictorians from their respective classes were in there.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:36.978
And as a freshman, I didn't know any better.

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:38.714
I just said, "Alright, I'm going to organize this,"

00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:41.592
and I helped everyone not to take the exam.

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:42.385
We all got A's,

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:44.453
and then I became infamous for organizing this.

00:00:44.453 --> 00:00:46.768
And so, a part of the reason why I'm an organizer

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:47.996
at the media lab,

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.509
in the domain of education,

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:51.842
was probably because of that experience.

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.679
So, what I would say to myself

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:54.776
or any 16-year-old,

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:56.257
that if someone challenges you,

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:57.645
know when to take it on

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.143
and take it on big.

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:01.258
And if you win and it's epic,

00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:02.717
that becomes part of who you are,

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:03.991
part of how people see you,

00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.188
and part of how you approach doing future things.
