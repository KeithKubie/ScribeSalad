00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:03.270
PROBLEM: "Write a mathematical expression which

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.686
corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:13.398
So let's just think this through: "x times y."

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:14.545
Well I could write that –

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.844
I could either write that as x × y,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.314
or I could just write that as xy.

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:22.227
And from that, I'm going to subtract a times b times c.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:24.996
So: minus a times ...

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.827
And I could write it a [asterisk] b [asterisk] c.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.876
I could write it like that.

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:32.493
Or I could just write -abc.

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:34.252
And you can see how it's being interpreted

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:35.602
by the computer right over here.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.435
It understands that I'm saying

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.264
x times y minus a times b times c (or xy - abc).

00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:42.408
And I'm done.
