00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.860
Hey, it's Molly Webster from radio lab. Before we get into the show today,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480
I wanted to tell you something and that's it. Radio lab has a newsletter. We do.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.550
It's awesome. You should sign up for it.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.100
You'd be the first to know about new episodes.

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.280
You'd get updates on old ones and lots more to sign up.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.820
Go to radiolab.org/newsletter see ya.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.510
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad rubber Coolidge today.

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.830
Our Program's about music.

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.570
We ended our last segment with a a look back at a very famous riot in 1913 in a

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.490
composer, Igor Stravinsky,

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.790
whose primary objective was to create something new and dissonant and

12
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.804
disturbing.

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.920
Right now we'll present the opposite [inaudible],

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.250
the Anti Stravinsky anyway, and what we mean is he,

15
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.960
we're going to introduce you to a guy who has invented a new,

16
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
radically innovative and ingenious way of creating something.

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.400
<v 1>Oh, interesting. Hey there. Are you rolling? I am rolling.</v>

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.890
<v 0>His name is David Coke.</v>

19
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.920
He works and teaches composition at UC Santa Cruz in California and recently our

20
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:11.360
producer Ellen Horn was in the area.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.190
<v 1>It is a beautiful area. It's 22.5 miles. Wow.</v>

22
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.060
And she paid him a visit. It's extraordinary. And they're like birds.

23
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:22.490
We've got a, we've got, you know, I have nest in each window each year, years.

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.990
Sure. And this one's over here. You can just take a look at you, hike,

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.390
come back in. It's okay. It's just me. Come on, get back in your nest. Um,

26
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.870
she's usually, she'll just hop right back in when she hears me talk here.

27
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890
Aren't you gonna listen to me?

28
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.130
<v 0>Oh, this was beside the point because we'd actually come to talk to David, Cope,</v>

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.630
not about nature, but actually about something unnatural that he'd done,

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.440
which started about 20 years ago

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.980
<v 1>in 1980, I had a, a commission for an opera,</v>

32
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.610
which involved actual money, which we had been given up front.

33
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.330
And which by the way, since I had four small children, I had already spent.

34
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.740
And uh, for the first time in my life, uh, I suffered a composer's block.

35
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.390
<v 3>It was like, somebody just shot me and you know, you're,</v>

36
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.370
I should be at the height of my creative power and I can't find a reason to

37
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:16.450
compose a first note.

38
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
The c-sharp decided no more interesting in c natural or d and notes just didn't

39
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:27.410
make any sense to me. I was really lost.

40
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.510
I can't think of anything worse cause it's not my profession,

41
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.423
it's what I am.

42
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.860
A short time time

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.260
<v 1>later,</v>

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.220
David Cope is at a party and he finds himself talking to a guy who programs

45
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:45.650
computers and he was asking me how things were going and I just simply said,

46
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.160
you know, it's a nightmare. And we talked through it. You know, I,

47
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.960
I think I must have initiated it by saying,

48
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:53.000
are there any intelligent programs out there that could,

49
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.630
I could possibly use to help me through this? And he said, well,

50
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.650
there aren't any intelligent programs, period. But he said,

51
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.310
you don't really need one. Don't you really just need some kind of a foil.

52
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.770
He called it that. And I,

53
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.060
I really had an epiphany.

54
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.060
What I would do is build not so much composing engine, but an analytical engine,

55
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.140
<v 0>a computer. It took them years to build it. This is, this is,</v>

56
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.260
this is Emmy right here. This is this and these. The computer's name,

57
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.150
it's spelled e, m. I, m.

58
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.510
E is an acronym for experiments in musical intelligence,

59
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.770
and what he built me to do is analyze things. This is specifically notes,

60
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.720
treat notes like data. In other words, he'll feed me a bunch of sheet music.

61
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.220
For example, buck, Krells,

62
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.093
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

63
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.000
<v 0>any will then convert every single note on the page into numbers.</v>

64
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.450
Can you describe what you see on the screen? Well,

65
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.160
there's subs and thousands of numbers there. Five numbers for each note,

66
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.500
numbers which represent all kinds of things. The on time, the pitch,

67
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.890
the duration chorale becomes a huge mass of information.

68
00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:02.520
Which Emmy then sorts through looking for patterns. Hmm. Nope.

69
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.720
Four 50 always seems to be falling by note, four 56 loud and then soft.

70
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.800
She will find the patterns. Every composer has them, the little things they do,

71
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.590
the DNA of the individual now finding all the patterns,

72
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.480
mapping the creative DNA of a composer is in and of itself.

73
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.800
Not all that interesting. It's what happens next, which is the spooky part.

74
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.570
Cope hits a few buttons and all the DNA starts to recombine.

75
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.210
Ghosts stir in the machine,

76
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.603
<v 1>any Mahler,</v>

77
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.013
<v 4>any Beatles,</v>

78
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.030
<v 5>[inaudible],</v>

79
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.930
<v 0>Ethan Scott, Joplin</v>

80
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.440
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

81
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.360
<v 0>and of course his favorite Bach</v>

82
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.241
<v 1>of course.</v>

83
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.720
Then I became very excited about this prospect and immediately put in some coke

84
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.890
and sure enough, my opera, which had taken high on know by the time I was,

85
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.310
I put it in the Copay, it was maybe five years of past, uh,

86
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.680
the opera was written in about 10 days.

87
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.450
So as a demonstration,

88
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.050
I'm going to play for you the opening of a corral that was composed in 1987,

89
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.320
uh, in the style of Bach, one of the first ones that came out of the program.

90
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.040
Now, this corral was so bad, it sounded to me when I first heard it that I,

91
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.150
I um, I threw it away at Britain, the trashcan. And then I said, well,

92
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.180
there's something about that that I kind of like and I pulled it out again.

93
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.850
I thank God I did because this is one of my favorite pieces that program ever

94
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:40.500
produced. So here's what it sounds like as a machine replant

95
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.830
<v 3>[inaudible] you can hear the rigidity of the performance, the machine,</v>

96
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.160
like n****r of the meter being processed and all the notes being processed at

97
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:58.040
precisely the right time with these timbers sooner orders,

98
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.710
which are egregious. I mean, they're just terrible.

99
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.570
[inaudible]

100
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.980
<v 1>now I'm, I'm going to play for you the same corral as performed, uh,</v>

101
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.880
by a group of singers, a awhile liter [inaudible]

102
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.993
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

103
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.060
<v 3>same person music, incredibly human,</v>

104
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:38.380
personal musical going someplace intriguing.

105
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.360
I want to hear more of the second one. I'm glad I turned off the first one.

106
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.203
One idea.

107
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.163
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

108
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.200
<v 1>oh yes. So yes. Oh, the number of negative reactions, uh, far, far out number,</v>

109
00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:02.010
the positive reactions. I don't remember recall one in particular, one that,

110
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.420
oh yeah, I was at a conference in Germany in which a colleague,

111
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.760
uh, hit me in the nose with his finger. I'm a,

112
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:13.770
I'm pretty much at a coward physically, you know, he was bigger than ice.

113
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:18.720
So it was, it was a quite a moment. But there have been many, many occasions,

114
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.981
you know,

115
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:24.981
shouting matches if you've spent a good portion of your life being in love with,

116
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.590
you know, these dead composers. I mean that sounds horrible,

117
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:29.250
but you know what I mean?

118
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.250
And along comes some Twerp who claims to have this little piece of software

119
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.960
would use, isn't in much at all that can, can, can move you in the same way.

120
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.540
Suddenly you're saying to yourself, well,

121
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.360
what's happened here? Certainly my, my,

122
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.250
my relationship to the original pieces of music is cheapened in some way.

123
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.330
I mean,

124
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.140
what is Chopin really just nothing more than a bunch of cliches drum together.

125
00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.730
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.710
<v 1>I hurt with them in a way and when they hurt, um,</v>

127
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.050
I feel successful

128
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.140
and I also feel very bad. I mean,

129
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:17.700
I'm missing with some pretty powerful relationships here and doing so in a

130
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:21.810
mechanical way. If I had done it myself as a human being,

131
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.640
these individuals could probably live with it because after all they could say,

132
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:28.470
well, you know, he's just really good at that sort of thing.

133
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.740
But somehow using hell, you know,

134
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:35.910
or some version of how is the ultimate insult.

135
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.660
There is nothing intelligent about my program and this lightest.

136
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.760
Nothing intelligent about it.

137
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.850
I could do everything it did if you gave me 10 years.

138
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.590
I just don't have that amount of time. I'd rather spend five minutes.

139
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.610
Thank you very much.

140
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.990
We did a concert here at,

141
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.600
at Amy Bach and the Middle Moon is just a dorm.

142
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.790
I mean it's just lovely. And,

143
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.080
and a friend of mine was sitting in the back of the hall next to an ancient

144
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.351
lady.

145
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:12.000
She must've been in her eighties late eighties and she couldn't read very well.

146
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:15.240
So she hadn't read the program notes and she really just was at this concert

147
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.360
because friends told her she didn't know what was all about or anything like

148
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:21.780
that. But she knew all about music and she loved ball and,

149
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.310
and she listened to that

150
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.400
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.870
<v 1>and she turned to my friend and said,</v>

152
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.153
<v 4>oh,</v>

153
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.960
<v 1>that was just beautiful. And my friends started to say,</v>

154
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.250
but do you know that it was, and then he said,

155
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.240
well, the hell with that.

156
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.840
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

157
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.330
<v 1>it was the reaction that I hope people will have a hundred years from now. If,</v>

158
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.420
if by some weird fluke,

159
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.640
this stuff hangs around long enough to still be around them. Um,

160
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.230
but I hope we can put aside all this machine trapping this stuff and,

161
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.450
and really just deal with the music itself.

162
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.243
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.750
