00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.180
Model building is a way to understand phenomena that are often complex and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.710
a result of multiple interactions.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.640
It is seldom possible to to clearly write down mathematical formulas that can

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.500
describe the phenomena at all scales and complexities.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Moreover, many phenomena can be repetitive or

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.360
periodic with a pattern that we can identify.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.280
While other phenomena can be non-periodic, unusual, and anomalous.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.320
We will in this lesson look at some simple ways we can model phenomena.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.580
It is often a matter of experimenting with different techniques to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.660
understand what works best.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.630
The goal in this lesson is to get you to start

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.830
thinking iteratively through asking questions and making models.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.150
We also want you to start thinking in terms of probabilities.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.340
Given that you have already had some background in machine learning,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.540
we will choose for an example non-parametric statistical models.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.980
The techniques we illustrate should carry over to parametric models,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.400
mathematical models, and machine learning models.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.860
We invite you to try these other models that we will not have a chance

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.910
to explore in this lesson by using the methods that we demonstrate here.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.710
So, follow along.
