00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.940
So all of these answers look pretty good, but the

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.520
second one is the least compatible with Debbie's persona. If

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.060
she cares about locally grown ingredients or organic ingredients, these

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.560
will probably cost more, and we see here that Debbie doesn't

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.200
have a lot of money. So she's probably going to be

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.600
pretty price conscious. So this is kind of a hard

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.760
one. But in real life, there's oftentimes pretty difficult choices

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.490
to make. So I think B would be the most incompatible.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.780
&gt;&gt; I agree.
