00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.111
- [Voiceover] Let's now explore the first

00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:04.094
law of thermodynamics.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.291
And before even talking
about the first law of

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:08.312
thermodynamics, some
of you might be saying,

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.961
"Well, what are thermodynamics?"

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.331
And you could tell from
the roots of this word.

00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.270
You have thermo, related to thermal,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.826
it's dealing with temperature.

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:18.403
And the dynamics, the
properties of temperature,

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.838
how do they move, how
does temperature behave?

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:22.781
And that's pretty much
what thermodynamics is,

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.138
it's about, it's the study
of heat and temperature,

00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:27.695
and how it relates to energy and work,

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.284
and how different forms of energy can be

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:31.226
transferred from one form to another.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:32.725
And that's actually the heart of the

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:35.061
first law of thermodynamics
which we touched on

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.770
on the introduction to energy video.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.240
And the first law of
thermodynamics tell us

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.079
that energy,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.592
this is an important one,
I'm going to write it down,

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:47.140
energy cannot be created or destroyed.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.861
Cannot be created,

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.090
or destroyed.

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.786
It can only be converted
from one form to another.

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:04.140
It can only

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.976
only be converted

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:09.956
only be converted,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.735
I'm having trouble writing today.

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:15.110
Converted from one form,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.446
from one form,

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:21.090
to another.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.226
Or you could transfer it
but you're not going to,

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.669
you're not going to create or destroy it.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.586
And the whole thing that
I, the rest of this video

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.211
I just want to really
have you internalize that,

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.420
and I want to look at a bunch
of examples and think about,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.266
well, what is the energy
that we're observing,

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.132
or that we're seeing in a system?

00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:37.551
And then thinking about
where is that energy

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.578
coming from, to appreciate
that it's not just

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.749
coming out of nowhere,
and that it's not just

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.988
disappearing, it's not
getting destroyed either.

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:47.263
And so let's start with
this example of a lightbulb.

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:49.144
And I encourage you to pause this video,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:52.061
think about the forms of
energy that we can see here,

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.286
and then think about where
is that energy coming from,

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:56.226
and where is it going?

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:59.382
Well, the most obvious form
of energy that you see here,

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:01.556
and this, the whole point of a lightbulb,

00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:03.738
is you see the radiant energy, you see the

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:06.519
you see the electromagnetic
waves, the light,

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.200
being emitted from it.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.040
And that light, so this is radiant energy.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.104
Radiant energy.

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:18.300
And that radiant energy,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.197
is due to the heat in the
filament right over here,

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:25.272
as the electrons go through
it, it generates heat,

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:27.274
so you have thermal energy.

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:30.050
So you have thermal energy as well.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.935
Thermal energy.

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:34.857
But where does this radiant and thermal

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:36.244
energy come from?

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:38.496
Again, first law of
thermodynamics it tells us,

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:40.363
it's not just being
created out of thin air,

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:43.731
it must be converted or being
transferred from some place.

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.856
Well, I just gave you a
hint, this thermal energy

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:50.008
is due to the electrons
moving through the filament.

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.346
They're moving through
the filament which has

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.980
some resistance, and that generates heat.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.323
So the electrons are moving through this,

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.473
and as they move through that
resistor, they generate heat.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.258
So you actually have the
kinetic energy of the electrons.

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:07.032
I'll just write KE for
short, kinetic energy

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.445
of the actual electrons.

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.894
Well, where is that
kinetic energy coming from?

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:14.382
Well that's coming from
the potential energy.

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.737
You know maybe this thing is plugged into,

00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:19.731
is plugged into a socket of some kind.

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:21.646
So let me draw a little electric socket

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:23.050
right over here.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.552
And the electric socket, I'll draw,

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:28.436
the electric socket if
this is the electric socket

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:30.653
in your home,

00:03:30.653 --> 00:03:33.623
there is an electrostatic
potential between

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:35.331
these two terminals.

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:37.100
And so when you make a connection,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.599
the electrons are able to move.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.863
And we'll get into the
details of AC and DC current

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.195
in the future, but there's
an electrostatic potential,

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.427
from this point to this
point if we assume that's

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:50.236
the direction that the
electrons are going in.

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.169
And so that, it's that
potential energy we convert to

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.992
this kinetic energy of the electrons,

00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:57.752
which is really in the form of a current,

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:00.349
and then that gets converted
into thermal energy

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.010
and radiant energy.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.811
Now what happens after, let's
say you unplug the light,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.407
the light goes dark, what
happened to all of that energy?

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.091
Is it still there?

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:11.252
Well yeah, that thermal
energy is going to continue

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.633
to dissipate through the system.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.562
And this right over here
would be an open system,

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:16.603
it's going to,

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:19.701
the air inside the lightbulb,
you can't fully see

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:22.335
the lightbulb right here, but
it looks something like this.

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:25.052
That's going to heat up, but
then it's going to heat up

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:26.993
the glass surrounding the lightbulb,

00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:28.971
and that's going to heat
up the surrounding air.

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.976
So the thermal energy is
going to be transferred,

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.622
and that radiant energy
is going to move outward.

00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:35.805
And it could be used, it
could be converted into other

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.148
forms of energy, most
likely thermal energy,

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.861
it is also probably going
to heat up other things.

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:42.835
Well, what about a pool table?

00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:45.537
When I hit a, if I hit a pool,

00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.942
a billiard ball or a pool
ball right over here,

00:04:47.942 --> 00:04:49.868
well, where is that energy going?

00:04:49.868 --> 00:04:52.058
Well some of that energy
might be going to go hit

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.156
the next ball, which might
go to hit the next ball.

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:58.176
But as we all know, if
we've ever played pool,

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.108
at some point they're going to stop.

00:05:00.108 --> 00:05:01.925
So what happened to all of that energy?

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.805
Well, while they were rolling,

00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:06.552
there was some air resistance,

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:11.096
so they're bumping against
these, the air molecules,

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.121
and it's really friction due to air.

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.932
And that energy is essentially going to be

00:05:14.932 --> 00:05:16.215
converted to heat.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.956
And one trend that you're going to see

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:21.565
very frequently, is as systems progress,

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:25.756
a lot more of the energy
tends to turn into heat,

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.441
rather than doing useful work.

00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.888
And so you're going to
have, as the billiard balls

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:33.349
move, there's the air,
and so that's going to be,

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.050
that's going to be converted,
some of that kinetic energy

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.102
is going to be turned into heat energy.

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:40.319
You're also going to have friction with

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.168
the actual felt on the table.

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.950
And that friction, you're
going to have molecules

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.236
rubbing up against each other,

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:48.332
that's also going to
be converted into heat.

00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:51.577
And so that, because that
kinetic energy gets sapped off,

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:55.770
gets keeping sapped
away from the friction,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.737
which is essentially
converting the kinetic energy

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:00.111
to heat energy, eventually you won't have

00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:01.794
any more kinetic energy.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.269
Now what about this weight lifter here?

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:05.032
He's using the chemical energy in his,

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:08.052
in the ATP in his muscles,
that converts into

00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:10.619
kinetic energy that moves his muscles,

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.581
that moves this weight, but
once he's in this position,

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.541
what happened to all of that energy?

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.700
Well, a lot of that energy is
now being stored in potential.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.724
it's the potential energy,
he's got this big weight,

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:23.103
he's got that big weight above his head,

00:06:23.103 --> 00:06:25.954
and if he were to just let
go, that thing would fall,

00:06:25.954 --> 00:06:27.596
I wouldn't recommend he do that,

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.568
but that thing would fall quite fast.

00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:31.761
And so now it's all,
or a lot of it has been

00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:33.274
stored up in potential energy.

00:06:33.274 --> 00:06:34.722
But he would have also generated heat,

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:36.304
his muscles would have generated heat.

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:38.467
Even the act of moving it
through the air is going to be

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.729
some heat in the air,
some friction with it.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.804
And so I want you to appreciate
that this energy is not

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:46.037
coming out of nowhere,
it is being converted

00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:48.476
from one form or another,
or being transferred

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:50.845
from one part of the system to another.

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.314
Now we can look at these
examples over here.

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.615
Same thing with our
runner, what happens after,

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.371
you can buy the fact that
okay, his chemical energy is

00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.258
allowing his muscles to
move, and that's turning in

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:05.076
his kinetic energy for his
entire body, his body is moving,

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:08.392
but at some point he stops,
where did all that energy go?

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:11.327
Well, some of it will be
heat in his body that's being

00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:13.947
dissipated into the broader
system, into the air.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:18.119
And also, when he was running,
there was this contact

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:20.872
with the ground, that's
going to make the molecules

00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:23.430
of the ground vibrate a
little bit, some of it will be

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.862
transferred as sound, so the air particles

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:29.142
moving through the air, and
a lot of it will be heat.

00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:31.282
And we're going to see that
over and over and over again.

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:34.203
The diver up here, you have
mostly potential energy.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.498
Then it converts to
kinetic energy as he's,

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.190
as he gets almost in the water.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.028
But what happens once
he falls into the water?

00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:41.629
Well, then that energy's
going to be transferred,

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:44.462
as you're going to have these
waves of water move away.

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:47.136
And it will also increase
friction, so, well actually

00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:49.003
he would have had
friction as he fell down,

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:50.780
so that would have generated some heat,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.042
and there would have
been also some heat with

00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:53.835
the friction with the water,
you normally don't think of

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:55.922
friction with the water,
but there is some friction

00:07:55.922 --> 00:07:57.678
with the actual water, and there's also,

00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.193
these waves, you have
higher kinetic energy

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:02.811
of the actual water
being transferred outward

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:05.172
from where he actually dropped in.

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.061
And I could keep going on and on.

00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:10.320
You have the chemical potential
energy of the fuel here

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.085
being, you have combustion occurring,

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:16.264
and then that gets converted
into the thermal energy,

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:20.103
and the radiant energy of
what we associate with fire.

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:21.520
And that doesn't disappear,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.631
it just keeps radiating outwards,

00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.234
the radiant energy just
keeps radiating outward,

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.674
maybe it might heat up something.

00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:29.319
And the thermal energy will
just keep radiating outward,

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:32.428
or I should say, the thermal
energy will just dissipate

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.311
outward, and heat up the things around it.

00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:37.125
Same thing with our lightning example.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:41.049
You start with the
electrostatic potential,

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.159
where the bottom of the
clouds were more negative,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.537
and then the ground is positive as well,

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:49.312
and at some point, that
potential energy turns into

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:53.387
kinetic energy as the electrons
transfer through the air,

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:57.099
and then that gets converted
into, or a good bit is

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:00.109
going to be converted to
heat and radiant energy.

00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:03.276
So the whole point of this
video is, no matter what

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.443
example you look at, if you
think about it carefully enough,

00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:08.240
and I encourage you to do
this in your everyday life,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.204
the energy isn't just coming out of,

00:09:10.204 --> 00:09:11.716
you know, magically appearing,

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:16.339
it's just being converted
from one form to another.
