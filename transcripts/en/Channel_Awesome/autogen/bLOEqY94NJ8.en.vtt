00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
one or two little tidbits but yeah I
 

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
one or two little tidbits but yeah I
mean<00:23:13.390><c> and</c><00:23:13.990><c> the</c><00:23:14.050><c> stuff</c><00:23:14.230><c> I</c><00:23:14.350><c> was</c><00:23:14.410><c> off</c><00:23:14.560><c> I</c><00:23:14.680><c> guess</c>

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:14.830 align:start position:0%
mean and the stuff I was off I guess
 

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
mean and the stuff I was off I guess
like<00:23:14.980><c> the</c><00:23:15.070><c> little</c><00:23:15.250><c> girl</c><00:23:15.400><c> in</c><00:23:15.640><c> that</c><00:23:15.760><c> movie</c><00:23:16.480><c> like</c>

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:16.690 align:start position:0%
like the little girl in that movie like
 

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
like the little girl in that movie like
did<00:23:17.380><c> nothing</c><00:23:17.800><c> and</c><00:23:17.920><c> I</c><00:23:18.010><c> thought</c><00:23:18.130><c> she</c><00:23:18.310><c> would</c><00:23:18.430><c> have</c>

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:18.550 align:start position:0%
did nothing and I thought she would have
 

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.770 align:start position:0%
did nothing and I thought she would have
a<00:23:18.610><c> bigger</c><00:23:18.820><c> role</c><00:23:19.060><c> it's</c><00:23:19.270><c> like</c><00:23:19.390><c> so</c><00:23:19.510><c> the</c><00:23:19.600><c> stuff</c>

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:19.780 align:start position:0%
a bigger role it's like so the stuff
 

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
a bigger role it's like so the stuff
that's<00:23:19.930><c> off</c><00:23:20.080><c> about</c><00:23:20.320><c> just</c><00:23:20.560><c> made</c><00:23:20.710><c> it</c><00:23:20.860><c> worse</c><00:23:22.410><c> so</c>

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:23.410 align:start position:0%
that's off about just made it worse so
 

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.990 align:start position:0%
that's off about just made it worse so
it's<00:23:23.620><c> nice</c><00:23:23.860><c> to</c><00:23:23.890><c> see</c><00:23:24.280><c> something</c><00:23:24.550><c> we're</c><00:23:24.790><c> even</c>

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see something we're even
 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see something we're even
with<00:23:25.120><c> this</c><00:23:25.270><c> one</c><00:23:25.480><c> I</c><00:23:25.690><c> could</c><00:23:26.560><c> predict</c><00:23:27.190><c> it</c><00:23:27.400><c> it</c><00:23:28.110><c> it</c>

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
with this one I could predict it it it
 

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.770 align:start position:0%
with this one I could predict it it it
would<00:23:29.320><c> it</c><00:23:29.560><c> still</c><00:23:29.860><c> was</c><00:23:30.040><c> done</c><00:23:30.340><c> well</c><00:23:30.940><c> enough</c><00:23:31.330><c> it</c>

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:31.780 align:start position:0%

they don't look real where this one
maybe<00:25:05.859><c> because</c><00:25:06.279><c> it</c><00:25:06.459><c> took</c><00:25:06.579><c> its</c><00:25:06.789><c> time</c><00:25:06.999><c> and</c><00:25:07.299><c> then</c>

00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:07.389 align:start position:0%
maybe because it took its time and then
