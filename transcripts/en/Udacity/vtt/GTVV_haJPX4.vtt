00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.950
My name is Bill Durham. I'm Bing Professor in

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.130
Human Biology and Human Biology and Anthropology at Stanford University.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.760
&gt;&gt; Well, we're really happy you're joining us especially to talk about a

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.950
very important concept. Now, we've been

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.840
learning about lactose intolerance and about the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.110
idea that as all infants. We have the ability as mammals to digest

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.460
these lactose containing products. And as

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.320
we get older our lactate expression diminishes.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.400
But in some people, the lactate gene sort of stays

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.900
on, and we continue to make lactates. And so we'll

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.470
start of by asking why in human evolution would something

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.900
like this happen? How could something like this even happen?

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.920
&gt;&gt; Well, from a pan-mammalian background where the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.840
lactase activity peaks around birth and then tails

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410
off quickly into the weaning period and into

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.280
adulthood. We assume, we know that that's pan-mammalian.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880
Even your house cat is lactose malabsorbed. A malabsorber

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.910
or lactose intolerant. at least every house cat that's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.650
been tested is. Eve, even those people will give

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.040
milk to their house cats. And what we don't know

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.040
is whether the people have found the threshold or

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.830
the cat's found the threshold to avoid diarrhea and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.900
other consequences. What's interesting then is from that background

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.690
of a peak, some human populations show persistent lactase activity,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.380
into adulthood. While the majority continue to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.940
decline. So it's that minority of lactose

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.590
tolerant adults that are really fascinating. It's

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.430
a wonderful question because here's a case where

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.160
you have interest specific polymorphism. You have

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.030
existence and if the ongoing persistence of a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450
genetic difference between human populations. With regard

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.970
to some relatively simple trait and a trait

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.030
that has to be relatively recent in human history.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.590
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.185
&gt;&gt; There were no sources of milk prior to dairy

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:50.780
animals. So what we have here is, I mean other

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.160
than mother's milk there were no mammalian sources of milk

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.800
for human population before agriculture and so here we have.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.250
&gt;&gt; Right, there's this, right, I was going

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.360
to wonder too, you know, the idea that. I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.050
mean, are we the only species that actually

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.890
drinks the milk from another species as, as well?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.780
&gt;&gt; I'm not aware of any species that makes

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.520
a habit of drinking the milk of another species. I'm aware of infants of,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.740
a particular, an infant of a particular mother, nursing from

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.430
another mother. That happens in pinnipeds; it happens in several mammals. It's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.970
considered milk stealing. and obviously, there's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.770
great reward to the successful pup, but,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.850
I'm not aware of another case where, especially,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.650
where infants or adults drink milk from another

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.394
mammal. That's a, that's a good question, I

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.460
really don't, just don't know an answer to that.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.090
&gt;&gt; so we have this scenario then as you mention where we have this sort of

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.870
minority of people who, instead of having lactase

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.550
expression diminish over time it's, it's, it's persistent lactase.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.492
&gt;&gt; Persistent lactase activity into adulthood. Uh-huh.

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:58.190
&gt;&gt; Sure. Now, you mention that it seems to be relevant

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.370
specifically because of the recent evolution of this trait.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.830
&gt;&gt; Because the domestication of dairy.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.443
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:05.760
&gt;&gt;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.170
&gt;&gt; So we assume that the pan-mammalian background means that at the dawn

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.030
of history human populations were all

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.600
lactose intolerant. And that there would be

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.560
at best a mutationally low frequency

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.140
of individuals that varied on that characteristic.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.330
And because it was a very low variation, and there was no milk

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.940
available, we would have no way of knowing how

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.580
much there was, or how often it recurred and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.650
so on. But what we have then in the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.570
meantime is this great invention called agriculture. The domestication of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.140
plants and animals at the service of the human

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.400
food supply. We have every reason to believe that the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.640
main animals that are used for milk today, were

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.200
originally domesticated for meat. They were valued first for meat,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.070
and that milk was as the, expression goes,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.730
were part of a secondary products revolution. Where

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.130
they realized that you could use more than

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.540
the meat from these animals, goats, sheep, you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.210
know, cattle and so on. And so, they

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.796
already probably had them in close association with

00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:08.160
human communities, they were probably already harvesting the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.910
meat regularly. They probably had mastered overwintering, water supply,

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.000
herding activities, and that sort of thing. And

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.540
then suddenly there's evidence for using the, the

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.840
milk product of these animals. some of the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.020
earliest evidence comes from Sahara rock paintings that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.410
are dated to 4500 B.P. that show, in

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.950
fact, bringing the calf up, near the female,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.810
the adult female. And human being underneath. Now

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.050
we infer that the human being underneath is doing

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.255
this, what else is a human being doing under a cow?

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.255
&gt;&gt;

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.533
[LAUGH]

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:43.530
&gt;&gt; But that's some of the earliest

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.330
evidence, and what's interesting is that they bring

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.340
the calf up, to trigger the letdown reflex in the, in the cow so that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.830
the humans can take the milk. And to this day, farmers will tell you, there's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.220
lot of ways to induce that reflex. But one of them is bringing the calf up.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.587
&gt;&gt; That makes so much sense.

00:04:58.587 --> 00:04:59.587
&gt;&gt;

00:04:58.587 --> 00:04:58.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.800
&gt;&gt; It's like a woman hearing a baby cry in a department store.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.450
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.440
&gt;&gt; And she starts lactating.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.860
&gt;&gt; huh, yep. Absolutely, same thing. And

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.560
so, It's clear, then. Or we surmise, from

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.660
this history, that, milk was valued. Or that

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.900
cattle were valued first. For beef, or for

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.930
their meat product, and then later for

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.580
milk. Milk was a secondary product. It wasn't

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.110
very effective. And the question then became, well

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.800
what was the advantage of milk on top

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.460
of the meat? If you've already got an addition

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.620
to your food supply, why is it that milk suddenly

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.680
is valuable? That's triggered the most debate and the, and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.230
the most interesting research, I think. now the question really

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.640
was, what was the added value. Of drinking fresh milk?

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.260
It's complicated on the one hand, because you had the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.550
meat value of these animals you domesticated. So, it seems

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.990
unlikely that it would be just protein or food supply,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.620
yet that was an important early argument. And

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.400
the question, and, and, it's also complicated because

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.960
There are ways to get some food value from milk without drinking it fresh. You

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.740
can all societies that I know of have ways of processing fresh milk.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.250
Into low lactose forms. Sour milk is a low lactose form. All the things like

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.440
yogurt and kefir. Drinks that are widely known in some places. And most cheeses.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.940
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.930
&gt;&gt; Break down the lactose

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.500
externally, using lactobacillus bacteria. Using a separation of curds and whey.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.370
Lactose is water soluble. It drains off with the whey, and the

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.030
curds are free of lactose. So most cheeses have very little

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.540
lactose concentration, something like yogurt is

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.190
full of lactobacillus that's already digesting

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.600
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.149
&gt;&gt; The lactose for human consumption. So here's the real challenge.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.000
In a world where most populations. Huh, sorry. In a world where most populations

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.810
have ways to process milk and to get everything that's in the milk.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.633
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:08.470
&gt;&gt; Why would some populations still evolve this persistent lactase activity?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.380
&gt;&gt; Because there are external sources of lactase,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.620
why does it have, why, what was the advantage

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.840
of producing it internally to the human organism? And

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.860
that's the question that I focused on early on

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.960
because I thought that was just so very fascinating.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.180
On top of the food value, on top of

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.390
whatever you can get from yogurt and kefir and

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.800
cheese and sour milk. Wh-, what, what's the advantage

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.910
of drinking fresh milk as an adult? Especially when

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.210
so many societies must have regarded it as repugnant,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.860
because it would cause diarrhea.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.140
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.260
&gt;&gt; To humans, it was. You're intolerant. And

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.030
you know, the debate is still running. But

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.800
the theory, the leading theory that I like,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.640
is the, and that the data seems to support,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.210
you know in science knowledge is always tentative.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.200
So I want to put that out there, and,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.700
you know, I will sound like I'm convinced

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.240
of this but, you know, I think we're all

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.110
maintaining a healthy skepticism. But the leading argument

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.610
of the day is that calcium. That the advantage

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.490
of drinking fresh milk is the advantage of an

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.100
additional calcium supply, especially in areas where there is

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.650
a calcium deficiency caused either by inadequate calcium in the

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.430
diet. Well, that's not too likely if you're being, drinking milk.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.660
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.340
&gt;&gt; but a vitamin D scarcity. Vitamin D is

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.950
in turn photosynthesized in the skin in response to sunlight.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.740
So that immediately suggested to me the possibility that

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.470
as you depart from low latitudes of high ultraviolet light,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:54.190
you would encounter chronic built-in geospatial curves of. ultraviolet

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.310
light deficiency and therefore a vita-, which is what's required for.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.460
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.110
&gt;&gt; Vitamin D synthesis. And therefore Vitamin D scarcity with latitude.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.220
&gt;&gt; Now we learn actually in lesson six of our course. We go

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.880
and learn about mutation and variation, and

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.580
we use skin pigmentation as an example.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, perfect!

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.875
And so this is parallel.

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:13.170
[CROSSTALK]

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.250
So my hypothesis is that this was

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.030
completely parallel. In fact in Co-evolution, the

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.934
book that that I written on this,

00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:24.920
I have an appendix on epidermal demelanization. to

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.760
show the efficacy of the altitudinal gradient.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.670
In ultraviolet light, and vitamin D, and in

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.480
calcium based selection for epidermal demelanization, so

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.280
I like that as a background, and I'm

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.120
just saying, look if it's plausible there, look at the

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.050
argument we can make here. And then people say, what's the

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.870
advantage, milk is obviously rich in calcium, but what's the

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.770
advantage of having, why can't you again just eat the yogurt?

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.264
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:09:51.264 --> 00:09:53.150
&gt;&gt; And why can't you again just eat the milk

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.360
product, the cheese? Which is going to have the calcium in

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.720
it. Except for the water soluble calcium, which you might

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.320
lose some of. What's interesting was some research on what's

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:11.160
called the lactose effect. If you feed human infants from birth in a controlled

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.370
comparison cow's milk, from birth, or mother's

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.070
milk, versus soy milk, you see beginning

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:23.980
in a matter of a few days, You see a big differential in the amount of

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.290
bone absorbed calcium. In other words the calcification of bone is enhanced.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.200
You can, this is controlling for the amount of

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.210
calcium. You take soy milk and you supplement the calcium

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.020
in it so that it matches the cows milk. They

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.130
have the same calcium and the presence of the lactose

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.040
enhances the absorption of the calcium according to this, these

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.580
data. Now, it's a magnificent curve and if what it

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.500
shows is that the ability to drink fresh milk has

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.540
the advantage of making the calcium that's there an equal

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.700
proportion in the two milks That makes it more available, to the infants who can

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.330
absorb who can digest the lactose. there's a

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.630
mechanism suggested for this. It has to do

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.620
with the transphosphorylation of of one of the

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.730
opening up of a calcium channel. In the,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.460
in the jejunal region of the brush border

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.710
membrane cells, the jejunal region of the small

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:26.120
intestine, and that it's the removal of a blocking phosphate that, on to

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.610
the splitting lactose molecule that opens up the channel And that lul-, the

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.830
presence and the, and the breakage of the lactose molecule opens the channel

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.740
for the entrance of the calcium. So that lactose is like vitamin D.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.760
&gt;&gt; And so, and just to be clear, it's

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.710
not even, maybe not per se the lactose itself,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.410
but the lactose, the action of lactose metabolism.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.810
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.600
&gt;&gt; It enhances the calcium uptake.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.040
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.190
&gt;&gt; Now I have to ask you.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.790
&gt;&gt; So that's like wild, because that's

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.230
like saying, okay, they work differently. VItamin

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.070
D works by enhancing calcium binding protein

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.870
which actively absorbs it, but it's in both

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.850
cases, the action of the Vitamin D mechanisms brush border cells of the jejunum

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.650
of the small intestine and so is the lactose effect. Right there in the same.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:17.010
Epithelial lining. So it's pretty exciting actually and it suggests then that

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.390
one reason that infants don't need a lot of sun exposure at least to the best

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.010
of my knowledge, is that they have the

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.970
lactose effect at the same time as they have.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.780
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.730
&gt;&gt; And that those people who have the gene for

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:36.590
persistent lactase activity continued to enjoy the lactose effect in those

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.601
years all the way out for the persistent lactase activity.

00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:44.510
So what's particularly interesting about that is that it's saying that

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.230
lactase persistence compensates for the vitamin D deficiency

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.398
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:53.190
&gt;&gt; That's built into the solar radiation pattern on the surface of

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.060
our Earth. So that milk, like

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.940
epidermal demelanization, they follow similar curves.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.890
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.290
&gt;&gt; And that you get the persistent lactase

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:09.500
activity, and lac, lactose tolerance at high latitudes.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:09.850
&gt;&gt; Right, and

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.600
so just to sort of re-word what you say here

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.810
to make sure, you know, we're clear on this. In the

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.340
case for skin pigmentation, as you sort of alluded to,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.016
the idea is, as human migration moved away from the equator.

00:13:23.016 --> 00:13:23.196
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:26.700
&gt;&gt; To higher and I guess even, I guess we should also say lower latitudes.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.290
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.700
&gt;&gt; They had less sunlight, and so they had to.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.540
&gt;&gt; Well, you can say higher latitudes north and south.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.290
&gt;&gt; Sure. Higher latitudes north and south. they lost pigmentation

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.010
in the skin because they needed to let more sunlight in for Vitamin D.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.160
&gt;&gt; There was selection for the entrance of

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.640
more sunlight. It wasn't that they recognized a need.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.510
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.510
&gt;&gt;

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:45.740
[LAUGH]

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.820
The same with milk. It wasn't that we are sitting

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.230
around here. Wow, hoping and wishing we could have another

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.550
source of calcium. What's happening is that those that happened.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.470
To have this out-reproduced by. You can even test whether

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.440
it's a 3%, a 2%, a 5%. How much does

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.520
the difference have to be in the long run in

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.820
terms of differential survival and reproduction in order for this

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.820
to work out in the time frame that we have

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.410
from 4500 years BP or whatever? And I'm one of those who thinks that it's a

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.730
pretty small advantage. Pretty small advantage, but persistent

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.590
generation after generation, no fail. It's there. If

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.740
you have the lactose mechanism for absorbing calcium

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.260
and making strong bones less likely to have

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.302
Rickets. Less likely to have Harrison Sulcus. Less

00:14:31.302 --> 00:14:36.180
likely to have broken bones in young adulthood.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.210
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.970
&gt;&gt; And all those things you'll have that rigid calcification of bone

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.920
which you can see starting right out in infancy with the lactose effect.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.330
&gt;&gt; I mean that, that's amazing, can you give us

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.020
some idea, maybe about, the time scale that it spread on

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.230
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.660
&gt;&gt; And also, some maybe idea of the, the rate

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.390
of the spread. As well, as the point of origin geographically.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we understand today, I'm drawing mostly on the work

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.790
of Sarah Tishkoff a geneticist who has looked at the

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.250
question of origins, first of all, we think there are

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.080
multiple. I like to call it the big L gene.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.730
So I'm going to just use that. It's almost slang for me.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.340
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.150
&gt;&gt; It's not that technical name, but it makes it easy for persistent. We use.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.600
&gt;&gt; We use L plus and minus

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:18.800
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.487
&gt;&gt; So we do plus and minus.

00:15:19.487 --> 00:15:21.690
&gt;&gt; Alright, I'll. L plus is persistent lactase activity?

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.090
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.450
&gt;&gt; Alright. So L plus. And what she shows is that no all L plus genes

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:26.950
are the same.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.280
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.790
&gt;&gt; Yup. And that there are at least

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.600
four different origins of the big O. Of the

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.120
O plus gene. and they're broken up by

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.280
different language families. So we're pretty clear that they

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.680
had an independent origin. But the selection pressure

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.860
is strong enough. So there's a northern European one,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.670
and then it turns out that there are some

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.650
on the equator in milk dependent pastoral peoples where

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.420
the advantage of drinking milk might not have to do with

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.040
calcium at all. It might have to do with water availability, fluid

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.270
availability, electrolyte availability. If you live in a desert And you've got

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.430
this cow who can concentrate for you from sparse vegetation and dew.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.734
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:14.610
&gt;&gt; Into a drinkable, water-based product.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.690
There's a huge advantage especially during

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.020
drought seasons and so on, so it's quite

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:26.740
possible that those genes had a different selection pressure.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.490
&gt;&gt; That's amazing. So, I mean, so we just learned also about

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.604
the concept of an allele. And I hear you use the word gene.

00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:31.960
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.890
&gt;&gt; And just to clarify for us, we

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.660
would say there are four different lactase persistent alleles.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.445
&gt;&gt; Yes, there is.

00:16:38.445 --> 00:16:39.711
&gt;&gt; We discussed one in particular.

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:40.083
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.870
&gt;&gt; that's actually. Is reported in personal

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.470
genetics reports at places like 23andMe, but, so it's very interesting

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.160
that there are multiple other alleles that could cause lactase persistence.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.890
&gt;&gt; It, it's not clear to me that, that the,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.110
that the instruction in the gene itself is different, but

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.800
the genetic environment is different enough so that there are

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.075
markers to show us that it had a different origin.

00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:00.515
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:00.515 --> 00:17:03.690
&gt;&gt; Which is, which is a, a really compelling,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.569
&gt;&gt; Now you said there are possibly four different alleles that allow for this.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:07.849
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:07.940
&gt;&gt; And

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.710
there's, you mentioned a higher latitude origin, and then

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.630
even an origin in milk dependent populations near the equator,

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.170
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.630
&gt;&gt; Are there two other origins as well? Or are those?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.470
&gt;&gt; There are three near the equator, and then there's

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.780
the one that has evolved to high frequency in northern Europe.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.940
&gt;&gt; And so is the one from northern Europe the most dominant?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.369
&gt;&gt; The most dominant in the sense, they're all dominant genes.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.470
&gt;&gt; Well, prevalent, I should say.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.250
&gt;&gt; They, they reach very parallel, very parallel frequencies.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.855
They reach very high frequencies both in these

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:39.400
milk-dependent pastoral populations in the deserts of the equator.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.520
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.250
&gt;&gt; The Sahara Desert and surrounding environment. And then the peoples who

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.050
live at high latitude in, you

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.010
know, Denmark. What's today Denmark and Scandinavia

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:53.030
in northern Europe. So the frequencies are comparable. Which is interesting, but

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:59.520
not too surprising if a, we've had 4500 years for this to evolve.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.040
And b, if you have re, relentless selection pressures

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.120
because of the advantage of calcium, or the advantage of

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.220
electrolytes and water. those are both pretty compelling problem, pressures.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.385
I don't know, I've spent some time in the desert.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:14.320
[LAUGH]

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.460
And I find it very convincing. If you're out

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.600
of water in the desert, life is tough, yeah.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.670
And a cow is a wonderful device for giving

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.720
you water if the wells are dry. If the fields.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:27.920
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.240
&gt;&gt; The crops failed, amazing to think that a cow might be a water tank

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.950
in the, in the, it might be a calcium device in the north, and a water tank.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.400
&gt;&gt; at the Equator.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.500
&gt;&gt; Even if there are negative side effects and you're not.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:41.910
&gt;&gt; Absolutely

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.990
&gt;&gt; Completely tolerant, I mean it's worth it for the hydration.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.910
&gt;&gt; but they are, you see, that's again,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.370
they've evolved the high frequency of the gene

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.110
of lactase persistence. Now, it's true, not everybody.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.980
Not everyone in the society, the gene is

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.640
not at fixation, as we would say. It's not at 100%. But for the small number

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.100
of people who have diarrhea now there's another,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.460
this is this is where I come back

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.970
to the difference between intolerance and absorption because you

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.035
can take a malabsorber. So in a population of these

00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:13.020
pastoralists, living on the equator with a gene that

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.760
is not a fixation, some people aren't going to produce

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.940
lactase. And, so therefore, you expect them to be

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.770
intolerant but what's a really interesting thing if you look

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.460
in the legal documents in the last few years, someone

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.700
in the US has taken a patent. On a process

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.760
for converting intolerant individuals to tolerance

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.080
without changing their genetics. And the way

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.220
it goes is that you keep giving them the low dosage of milk a

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.490
long enough time. They suffer diarrhea, diarrhea,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:49.710
diarrhea until their intestinal microflora change. And

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.290
the result is they become tolerant malabsorbers.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.910
Now their genes haven't changed. They still

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.100
lack lactase. They can't produce lactase. But now they're tolerant.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.430
So guys have already taken out a patent on this, which

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.270
was in fact in the folklore in a number of

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.552
places, that if you. Could grin and bear it for awhile.

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:07.802
&gt;&gt; You, yeah.

00:20:07.802 --> 00:20:11.470
&gt;&gt; Drinking milk you could induce tolerance in yourself.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.010
You could make yourself. You could go from being

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.990
tolerant and feeling bloated and diarrhea and all that.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.790
You could come out the other end without those symptoms.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.690
So it's possible that in fact, and even

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.870
in those societies where milk is so important

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.270
as an electrolyte source of electrolytes in water,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.070
it's possible that what they've done is introduced, most

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.850
people are lactose absorbers, and that would help

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.110
with, the, for the majority of the population. And

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.020
it's possible that they induce tolerance in the

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.620
malabsorbers. Now, I'm speculating, because I haven't tested that.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.585
&gt;&gt; No. I mean, it even sounds reasonable. Because 23andMe and

00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:49.950
other places will report. They'll give you your genotype.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.980
And they will say, likely tolerant, or likely intolerant.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.722
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:20:53.722 --> 00:20:56.124
&gt;&gt; Because they're also aware of the gut microbiota.

00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:56.695
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:59.211
&gt;&gt; That can essentially metabolize the lactose for you.

00:20:59.211 --> 00:20:59.611
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:20:59.611 --> 00:21:01.213
&gt;&gt; Now, I wanted you to mention.

00:21:01.213 --> 00:21:04.180
&gt;&gt; Or buffer you. From the diarrhea effects

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.800
so that maybe you're not even getting, you

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.470
may not be getting the full food value,

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.840
but you're at least not getting the negative effects.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.520
&gt;&gt;

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.830
&gt;&gt; Negative symptoms.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.060
&gt;&gt; How, what proportion of the world is

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.340
considered to be lactose tolerant or not malabsorbers?

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.620
&gt;&gt; personally, I go with in, the figures vary

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.840
usually people put it between 70 to 80% lactose intolerant.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.230
I would put it as 70, 80% lactose malabsorber,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.910
because I don't really know about the, the, the symptomatics

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:44.320
of it. How many, how many people have the symptoms? and that it would therefore

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.580
be 20 to 30%, adult persistent lactase activity. Uh-huh.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.750
&gt;&gt; And would we assume then that in

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.380
regions of the world particularly South America, maybe East

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.300
Asian Pacific Islands would be the areas where

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.990
we have the least amount of lactase persistent individuals.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.380
&gt;&gt; And tropical

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.060
Africa in the zone where. Tsetse flies

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.710
discouraged cattle domestication. The geographer Fred Simuns

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:18.170
did a wonderful study years ago showing that the tsetse belt of Africa. there is

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.890
there are no lactose absorbers in that zone. That was one of his first clues.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.530
Is that where the tsetse flies discouraged

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.310
cattle by the economic disadvantage of sick cattle.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.520
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.430
&gt;&gt; Which isn't going to work because

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.420
they all have sleeping sickness and you can't make them

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.660
economically productive. There's no milk and there has been no

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.060
milk for as long as there has been tsetse flies

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.370
and the tripanosome, the parasite, that causes African sleeping sickness.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.350
And that is a, a long history, a long time

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.450
ago. So, what Simoons went on to argue is that

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.980
this is an area, the tropical belt of Africa with

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.480
its tsetse fly. It really kind of spans the equator

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.705
in Tanzania and Kenya, and so on. There's a belt there that with the, with the

00:22:58.705 --> 00:23:02.130
high-density of tsetse flies where, that it's never

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.570
paid to cultivate cattle, and they're lactose malabsorbers.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.600
&gt;&gt; Gosh.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.580
&gt;&gt; Fascinating, isn't it? because right nearby, outside

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.050
the tsetse zone, are the milk dependent pastoralists that

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.030
have high levels. So it's a wonderful example of

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.380
geography, culture, human history, and genetics all working together.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.750
&gt;&gt; Perfect

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.760
for a biological anthropologist.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.765
&gt;&gt; Yeah, perfect for

00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:22.760
[LAUGH]

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.250
exactly. There's one more interesting case that's really fun to talk about.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.130
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, I want to hear it.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.340
&gt;&gt; And that's the Inuit.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:28.840
&gt;&gt;

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.040
&gt;&gt; The Inuit are heavily melanized dwellers

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.440
of the arctic. They moved across the Bering Strait, sometime,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.010
say, in the last 20,000 years, and there they are with darker skin than you'd

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:48.950
expect in the Arctic. And very low rates of rickets. Almost no rickets.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:55.860
They also aren't lactose absorbers. So what do they do way up there in

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.950
the land of chronic vitamin D deficiency, very low ultraviolet? How

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:06.030
do they make it work? It turns out that before missionaries, they

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.990
had a practice of eating. Raw pinniped livers. Pinnipeds

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.555
in turn feed on cod and small fish like that that

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:21.070
non-photosynthetically generate vitamin D, and by eating enough of the

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.400
livers of the pinnipeds they concentrate the Vitamin

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.670
D from this non photosynthetic source. And so

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.020
they persisted with little evidence of selection against

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.640
epidermal melanization, and little evidence of selection for anything

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.940
like a milk tolerance and so on. And

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.400
what's so amazing is when missionaries came in and

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.570
said, oh my gosh that's barbaric, cutting up

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.990
a seal and eating raw liver for the delicacy?

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.230
That's disgusting, stop doing that. Rickets broke

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.770
out. So, what's so interesting? I mean,

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.750
an epidemic of rickets that was terrible,

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.460
crippling, for Inuit populations. What's so wonderful about

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.370
this example? It shows there's multiple ways to, to, to beat the rap on calcium.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.850
Epidermal demelanization may work. The ability to

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.233
drink milk in adulthood may work. And harvesting

00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:14.260
pinniped livers may work. And all of

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.350
these are interesting and diverse solutions to

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.750
this chronic problem built into our globe

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.660
of, of, of, calcium absorption, calcium deficiency.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.560
&gt;&gt; that really is amazing. I want to ask you one

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.260
more question. being sort of thinking from the anthropological side

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.560
of things as well. What do you think of the

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.290
biggest consequences of a growing human population, with lets say even

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.810
20 to 30% that are able to metabolize, lactose because of lactase

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.390
persistence, are there any major cultural or other changes that have happened?

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.490
&gt;&gt; one of the most interesting consequences of the

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.160
discovery of adult lactose tolerance and intolerance which came about

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.630
in the 1960s in the US, was that we needed

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.970
to rethink our food aid. Can you imagine? We sent

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.180
thousands of pounds of dried powdered skim milk

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.050
to lactose malabsorbing adults all over the world.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.340
It was food aid. Now if you stop

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.110
to think about it, that's like sending a laxative.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.805
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:18.471
[LAUGH]

00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:21.150
&gt;&gt; Big bags of a laxative brought to you

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.680
by the friendly people of the United States of America.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
&gt;&gt;

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.840
[LAUGH]

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.740
And this came to my attention before I

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.440
even heard of the phenomenon of lactose intolerance. I

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.020
was touring. I, I did some field in rural

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.880
El Salvador. I was working a tiny community called

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.090
[FOREIGN].

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.290
The mayor was taking me around town. Showing me

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.320
this is our grainary. This is our well. He took

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.690
me to the school house. And we walked in

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.810
and met the children. The teacher turned them out so

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.520
they could come out and sing a song for

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.840
me, or whatever. And then walked through the school, looking

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.570
at the very simple infrastructure of the school. And in

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:02.090
the corner were all these bags of donated US dried

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.525
skim milk. And I said

00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:05.590
[FOREIGN]

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.650
why, why are the bags in the school?

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.852
Why aren't people using? Oh, don't worry he said

00:27:09.852 --> 00:27:10.832
[FOREIGN]

00:27:10.832 --> 00:27:15.080
don't worry, we do use the powder in those bags.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.720
At least twice a year we get the comunity together.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.450
People bring buckets. We'd put the bags. the powder in

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.030
the bags and water together when we whitewashed the schoolhouse.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.030
&gt;&gt;

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.649
[LAUGH]

00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:26.733
&gt;&gt; We were very grateful for the ability

00:27:26.733 --> 00:27:27.168
[LAUGH]

00:27:27.168 --> 00:27:30.600
to whitewash the school house. And I said but why, why, why, do you use it

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.660
as whitewash? He said, because the people here get sick if they eat that as a,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.670
the intended food product. And you just imagine,

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.910
then, in the ethnographic literature, there's stories of

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.820
people in Bali, lining up to receive small

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.554
vials to put it in their family apothecary.

00:27:48.554 --> 00:27:49.186
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:52.336
&gt;&gt; Family drug supply. If they ever need

00:27:52.336 --> 00:27:58.180
a laxative, they can take U.S. food aid. But we sent thousands of

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:04.550
pounds a year of dried, powdered skim milk to a population where 80% are

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.350
lactose malabsorbers. As a general human population.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.350
I think that's one of the least

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.020
exposed and, and most obvious gaffes, of

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.610
assuming that what's true in our society.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.060
We have a high frequency of lactose malabsorbers

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.650
because of the Northern European population that was

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.760
important in the founding and, and the relative

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.790
growth rate compared to the Native Americans of

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:28.860
[LAUGH]

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.970
the United States, so we have a high,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.670
relatively high frequency of lactase persistence. In adulthood.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.595
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:28:35.595 --> 00:28:38.070
&gt;&gt; And we assumed, oh just look at

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.030
the billboards and things we had. Everybody needs milk.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.823
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:28:41.823 --> 00:28:43.770
&gt;&gt; You never outgrow your need for milk.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.370
Or remember that curve, you exactly do outgrow

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.250
your need for milk. And most adults do.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.850
But yet, we had this cultural, let us say,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.800
a cultural cocoon that said oh, people,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.080
everybody needs milk. You never outgrow your need

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.400
for milk. Milk does a body good. We had all these messages, and so we started

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.670
shipping milk powder, thinking it was easy

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.430
to concentrate, Right? You can take milk and

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.310
make it dried skim milk. You could ship

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.925
it quickly. It stores well. The schoolhouse in

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:17.150
[FOREIGN]

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.175
I'm sure still has some in the corner

00:29:19.175 --> 00:29:21.070
[LAUGH]

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.050
and people found lots of different ways to use it.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.050
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.780
&gt;&gt; Amazing.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.160
&gt;&gt; That is an amazing story.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.280
&gt;&gt; It is. And so what that helps you to realize is that.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.950
it's important, I think especially important

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.300
for North Americans to open their eyes

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:40.580
and realize that what our genes encourage by way of cultural activities and,

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.860
and cultural environment is not necessarily the same for the rest of the world.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.420
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.340
That's really all the questions I have. Is there anything else you would ask?

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.490
&gt;&gt; It's a classic example, you know. It's such a wonderful example of

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.260
the interplay of, of genes and of culture. we often use it for that.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:01.753
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:04.419
&gt;&gt; And model genes and cultures, two parallel tracks

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:08.658
and semi-independent tracks of inheritance. And what's so great is

00:30:08.658 --> 00:30:10.530
in this particular case you can see how well

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.470
there's an environmental challenge coming through in lysine and calcium.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.880
And you can see how you could change your culture and adopt

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.580
the drinking of pinniped livers and solve the problem. We can see how

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.110
you can evolve a high frequency of the big L gene and

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.130
solve the problem. Or you can live someplace, where that problem is less.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.091
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:31.350
&gt;&gt; And and the problem is

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.340
actually, maybe protecting yourself against sunlight and,

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.470
and ultraviolet, and so therefore the high melanization. What I love is this,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.080
this idea that, to understand the human organism,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.800
you can't just study the genes. Or the culture,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.540
you have to have 'em both on the table. And you have to think about both of

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.360
them. How they interact, how they may compensate

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.990
for one another, how they may influence one another.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.486
Because a totally successful adaptation on the part of

00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:05.240
demelanization would have. If it had been completely successful,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.670
you would be not very likely to see the evolution of lactase persistence.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:09.725
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:31:09.725 --> 00:31:13.490
&gt;&gt; But it solved the problem. And what it shows you is that it helped. But

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.580
that, that there was, there is still a

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.750
recurring calcium deficiency at high latitude. Which we

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:23.060
know from records and, other things. So I just love this idea that the, the, the

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.240
study of the human organism involves thinking about

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.920
different kinds of inheritance and their interaction in time.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.610
&gt;&gt; Thank

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.180
you so much.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.070
&gt;&gt; Of course. Thank you.
