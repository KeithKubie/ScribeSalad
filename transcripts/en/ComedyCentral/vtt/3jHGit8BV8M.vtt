00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.004
This Sunday is Super Bowl LI!

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.540
(cheering, applause)

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.443
And, as your friends with broken
kneecaps will tell you,

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:12.012
you can place bets
on absolutely everything.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.114
Uh, way more than just
whether or not Bill Belichick

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.051
will masturbate through
his hoodie pockets. Uh...

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.221
Some of the real prop bets
you can make... uh,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.423
actually make on Super Bowl
Sunday include:

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.058
"25 to 1 odds
someone catches fire

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.693
during the Lady Gaga
halftime show"

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:30.564
and "45 to 1 odds a fan
throws dildo on the field."

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.165
And if you're
wondering how a fan

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.601
would get access
to a dildo, let me repeat:

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.803
Lady Gaga halftime show.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.438
So, comedians,
the possibilities are endless.

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.208
Please come up with as many more
prop bets for the Super Bowl

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.944
as you can in 60 seconds,
and begin. Koechner.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.746
Uh, 50 to 1 odds
that Chris Hardwick

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.981
spends Super Bowl Sunday
watching reruns

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.083
of <i>Star Trek: Next Generation.</i>

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.352
Yeah, it's v-very likely.
Very likely.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.688
You don't know-- could be, could
be <i>Doctor Who.</i> You don't know.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.156
Or <i>Stranger Things. </i>
Uh, Aisling.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.791
Uh, ten-to-one odds
that the Russians

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.359
already know who won
the Super Bowl.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.661
Yeah, points.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.663
Maz.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.998
One-to-one odds
that Trump will tweet

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.466
that his crowds were bigger.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.603
Yeah, points. Aisling.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.339
50-to-one odds
on record-breaking attendance

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.341
at A.A. meetings
on Super Bowl Monday.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.144
Yes, points. Maz.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.946
One-to-one odds
that a guy wearing

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.149
a Make America Great Again hat
will (bleep) in his pants

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.684
when he sees the word
"Patriots."

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:23.784
All right, points. Yeah.
