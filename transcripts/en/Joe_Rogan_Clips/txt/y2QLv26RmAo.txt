Speaker 1:          00:00          Pappy candy, which was actually a fan. They did the Watergate, like they sat there and went deep like all night, but he definitely a hunter, definitely shit on him. Oh, he shit on him hard. That'd be cute. Shit back on him hard. The first night they met was at the Nixon, um, at the, at the um, holiday inn in um, 1968 in New Hampshire during Nixon's come back campaign. And Thompson walks in and Pat Kenny goes, who's this damn guy with the damn ski jacket walking through our Goddamn lobby and tops. It's like, I have a press pass, like I'm here to do this. And so they like have this big moment. And then later on that night Thompson goes to a party with, um, campaign people and with um, uh, [inaudible] and he brings a big bottle of wild Turkey. And so we can, as a young journalist at the time, he worked at the Saint Louis Post dispatch, I think he'd gone to the Columbia Journalism School is working for Nixon as his being policy guy.

Speaker 1:          00:47          He looks at Toms, he's like, that's the fucking, the ski. Oh, you got a bottle of what? Oh, if you gotta follow the old crow, like no, we'll drink that. And so they stayed up all night and they talked about the Vietnam War. And Thompson talked about how it just figures us to be in a foreign war that's unjust and it destroys our democratic ideals to be doing that. And bitcoin was like containment, nuclear war. We're trying to get out of it. And they listened to each other till dawn, like that first night that they met. Now. What was your idea behind writing this book? Like what, what compelled you? I think we've mistaken Thompson. I think that we see them more as like a Doonesbury character. I think people who know him really well don't. But I think that most people through whatever cultural forces that we've had, well the boys, cause a lot of people don't know the comparison what the Doonesbury.

Speaker 1:          01:30          So I think in the eighties or seventies, eighties, nineties, um, that cartoon Doonesbury by Gary Trudeau, it became, um, there was a character on it called Uncle Duke. And Uncle Duke was based on Hunter Thompson. And he was kind of an exaggerated version of Hunter Thompson. He was a cartoonish version of hunters Thompson. And I think Terry Gilliam did a wonderful and kind of our tourist job on, um, like a brilliant job on fear and loathing in Las Vegas. But that's also an exaggerated version of Hunter Thompson. And we forget today the amount of work on Hunter Thompson did the effort he put out, we forget that he was a straight journalist or he did the freelance assignments. He wrote the straight articles for years to make money for his family. And it wasn't until he had his breakthrough with hell's angels that he could develop the style that we identify with today. And so it kills me that we identify him more as a clown or like a, you know, more as a cartoonish figure as opposed to a very serious political pinker, political activist and serious writer who can give us insight into the fucking shit show we experience every moment today.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Well, I think the perception of him is fairly nuanced. I don't think that everybody thinks of them as a cartoon character, although particularly later on in this life, he was relegated to that because he really didn't speak well, you know, later on in his life when he was just the drugs taken over phone and the owl because his son writes about the alcohol. One writes so beautifully about the toll. Alcoholism took on a hunter s Thompson. We couldn't talk anymore. I mean, when he was deep into his sixties, his heart bars, those are just tired of that. It was so hard to even understand them. There's a awful piece that he did with Conan O'brien where Conan went to a woody creek and shotguns, uh, off the back porch with them and you could barely understand a fucking word hunter saying. That's why I tried to end it with Nixon leaving because it was really sad when Nixon resigned.

Speaker 1:          03:19          A Hunter Thompson was at the Connecticut Hilton, which is a hotel right by the White House. Any Liebowitz, um, the photographer with rolling stone was calling him and saying, we need to get to the White House. Nixon is a leaving. Like he's going to get on the helicopter and Thompson just laid in the grass and he didn't go, you know, and that was heartbreaking. And he didn't end up writing the eight page spread that he needed to. Instead it became any Liebowitz is photography, which was a famous and um, in retrospect, like huge move for her career. But I think that that pain right there of thinking that he'd spent 10 years, I mean, he hated Nixon since the checkers speech, you know, and Nixon was the VP for Eisenhower. He hated Nixon since 1962 when Nixon lost the, um, California, um, uh, uh, governor I'm ship and said, you and the press, you been giving me the shaft for so long, like you won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Like Thompson had seen that Nixon was somebody who said, I'm just the poor son of a butcher. I'm just this like very hardworking, you know, American that represents all of us were be hind that like, he was a politically, um, you know, ravenous monster who was anticommunist, who would go to any extent to win. And Thompson saw that. And Thompson knew that other people saw it. And in 1964, the Barry Goldwater convention in San Francisco, my favorite lead named arena of all time, the cow palace, um, Barry Goldwater was going to speak to accept the nomination. And what happened was, and Nixon was introducing them, it was Nixon's way back from the wilderness. Thompson was a few rows back cause the first time Thompson I think was that close to see him live. And it makes, it's like, you know, poor son of a butcher, don't think about me, just think about Barry Goldwater, Mr Conservative, he'll become Mr president.

Speaker 1:          04:58          And Thompson was like, fuck everybody here knows he's lying. But they think that that act of lying is a skill and the way they used car salesman who lies but can make a lot of money off it, right. Skillful, the way that Trump by selling steaks to people and then they go bankrupt and he gets rich. That's an American skill and Thompson sense that from the start with Nixon. And so I think he battled against Nixon for a decade, for a lot of years. And when Nixon left, I think he felt spent. And so I try not to focus on the later I ended then in [inaudible] 74 because I think it's, he wrote some beautiful things afterwards. He was still a gratefully, you definitely had some moments where he decided to not do the assignment that he was supposed to do. And it was kind of sad. Like I'm the Ali foreman fight, fucking floated in the pool, float in the pool with a Nixon mask on, flew all the way to Africa and ms one of the greatest sports moments. It was like game six of 'em, you know, um, you know, the Boston red sox versus the reds or think Ali was something different to people than I think it's, I

Speaker 2:          05:58          don't think we have someone like that today. So it's very difficult for us to understand if people today look at Ali and they go, oh, he was a heavyweight boxing champion. He was way more than that. He was, uh, a cultural figure that represented the resistance to the Vietnam War and represented it with the biggest loss that any public figure it ever shown. And willingly gave up three years of his career in his prime from age 27 to 30, from 1967 from the Cleveland Big Cat Williams fight. He didn't fight again for three years. He didn't train, he didn't do anything. They kept him from his career. Why? When he was in his prime, when he was the best heavyweight of all time. And he spoke publicly and often and in we was fucking hated all over the country, but he represented something different. Like, uh, my parents were hippies and when I was a little kid, he lost to Leon Spinks and the rematch was on television.

Speaker 2:          06:58          My parents never watched TV and they definitely never watched boxing and they, they, they sat in front of that TV to watch that. I remember thinking, I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match. Like this is crazy. And I was probably like, I don't know, maybe eight or nine years old or something at the time. And I just remember thinking, I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match. And that's what really, when it sunk into me at a really early age that this guy was not just this heavyweight boxer. He was, he was, uh, a cultural icon. He was a historical figure. He meant he meant a lot into hunter. He met a lot. He meant something, something much bigger than just just a boxer. And so hunter thought he was going to a death sentence. George Foreman had crushed Joe Frazier.

Speaker 2:          07:46          He crushed everybody. I mean, he was so powerful. George Foreman to this day is one of the all time, scariest heavyweights of all time with without a doubt. He, he could hit so fucking hard and literally pick guys off their feet. He hit Joe Frazier and lifted him off his feet with a punch. And uh, everybody was convinced that that was going to happen to Ali, that Ali had been past its prime. And look, just look at what George Foreman had done to Joe Frazier. What is he going to do to Muhammad Ali and Ali just rope a dope them until he got tired and then fucked him up in front of the whole world. That's one of the greatest

Speaker 1:          08:22          athletic moments. I mean we forget that athletes, athletes like curt flood, you know, they've, they risked who's that? Curt flood was the American baseball player who challenged the reserve clause cause it makes, while you weren't allowed to, um, get free agency for another team. And curt flood was this great player and he was like, I'm going to sit out and I'm going to wait. Athletes like Colin Kaepernick, they've sacrificed her career. It's not the same with Muhammad Ali who was like Babe Ruth and Barry bonds and like everybody combined at that one moment. Right? But he was risking, it's the opposite of Trump. Trump used his celebrity to become this even more mangled version of himself and get more power while he used his celebrity to speak for his virtue in his value and his beliefs and set like Thomson was really good at understanding what people sacrifice when people have to give up the wager.

Speaker 1:          09:08          You know, between what that act will be, what the results will be. They may be later. But he knew that. And so his respect for Ali for giving up those years of his prime, you know, was, was enduring. He Keep Thompson came back from that fight and he gave his son on one a boxing gloves, um, that, um, or, or, uh, at least boxing gloves. Wow. Yeah. It's a very, very unfortunate that he missed that fi because it would have been fascinating to hear his take on it. To me. I'm sure he would've been so moved when he saw all the win, but it was in, I mean that's a good point. It was indicative of, I think the stress and the pressure that the last decade of covering Nixon had taken out on him. Well, there's a little bit of that, but let's be honest, he was also kind of a fuck up.

Speaker 1:          09:48          I mean, when he was writing for rolling stone and they gave him that, that early facts. Oh yeah. And he would fuck that thing up. He would unplug it and plug it back in. He would do it. Just so he could go to the bar and say, this thing doesn't work. But that was the end. I think of his arc where he was still on point. He was still playing the role of a serious journalist and he would use that persona as a fuckup and there's letters by yawn winter being like, you cannot turn in your articles three hours before we go to press. I know you made it. This doesn't fucking work. And so he was beginning to break down. Then he was also, I think on the tail end of his decade of being a journalist who had met every deadline so that he could fucking feed his family and he could afford how farm like there were.

Speaker 1:          10:27          There's moments where before he got the contract for Hell's angels in 1965 he was ready to be like a longshoreman. He was going and looking for work in the mornings in San Francisco, you know, to try to support his family. He was willing to give up writing and instead that article blew up and he, all these beautiful letters began to arrive at three 19 Parnassus where he lived at, um, at the top of the Haight Ashbury and I'm San Francisco. And that opened up his chance to continue being a writer, but money was the main motivating factor. And so I think once money like unfurled, once alcoholism I think took its toll and once he couldn't walk around anymore addict political camp convention without people just like grabbing his shoulder and saying, you're a hunter Thompson, does that happen? I think things began to change. Yeah. That's one of the things that he talked about that I thought was really interesting that he became a part of the story.

Speaker 1:          11:15          It wasn't just that he was covering stories, he couldn't be anonymous anymore. He was in many cases more famous than the people that he was covering. Yeah. You know, like when he would go to meet Nixon, all Nick Nixon, secret service agents wanted to meet him and they wanted to get an autograph from him and shake his hand and it was just too weird. Everything I got. And then there's the alcoholism, alcoholism. Look it, it's a depressant. It wrecks you. And if you read, you know, we, me and Greg Fitzsimmons on a podcast once read off, uh, that one journalist who had a detailed hunters daily routine. And so we, we read the routine and they put a techno beat to it. It's fucking hilarious. That was a bad, that's a set. Those are so, it's so funny because those seem funny now, but they're, they're kind of a death nail.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Like, I mean that, that daily routine, um, that was, um, the, the biography hunter, it was in that and it's just, it's heartbreaking. I mean, we've got to remember that the dedication to fear and loathing in Las Vegas was he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of pain man. And I think the world was painful for a Hunter Thompson. It was people to see powerful people abused the week, you know, and like take what they wanted brazenly without being held accountable. I think it was hard to deal with shitty editors who cut half your fucking essay on Nixon or half your story. It made it into something that had nothing to do with the effort that you put out. Yeah. I think it was hard to pay your bills and you know, live the way that you wanted to live. And I think a lot of that gets undermined.

Speaker 1:          12:40          I just want people to realize how much effort he put out, especially during those years where he was like, all right, I want to be a great journalist. I want to have a voice in our society. I want to participate in our national conversation. My only path towards that is to work harder than everybody else to be at places when things happen, when they matter. And he's sacrificed a lot for that. But he was there and he's a voice in a light that we can have in this moment. Um, which is another troubling moment in American history.
