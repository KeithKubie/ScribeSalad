okay we're doing the golden ratio and

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589
okay we're doing the golden ratio and
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.679
okay we're doing the golden ratio and
Fibonacci numbers and I'm going to show

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689
Fibonacci numbers and I'm going to show
 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.269
Fibonacci numbers and I'm going to show
you why Lukas numbers are better than

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
you why Lukas numbers are better than
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.660
you why Lukas numbers are better than
Fibonacci numbers so you know it does

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
Fibonacci numbers so you know it does
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.820
Fibonacci numbers so you know it does
sound familiar doesn't it because we did

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
sound familiar doesn't it because we did
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.770
sound familiar doesn't it because we did
a video a couple years ago now about

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
a video a couple years ago now about
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780
a video a couple years ago now about
Lukas numbers which Lukas numbers

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
Lukas numbers which Lukas numbers
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180
Lukas numbers which Lukas numbers
instead of studying 1:1 Fibonacci they

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
instead of studying 1:1 Fibonacci they
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.490
instead of studying 1:1 Fibonacci they
start to 1 and then they carry on from

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
start to 1 and then they carry on from
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.010
start to 1 and then they carry on from
there then you get 3/4 I just put a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
there then you get 3/4 I just put a
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750
there then you get 3/4 I just put a
couple of them down here so we've got a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
couple of them down here so we've got a
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.310
couple of them down here so we've got a
couple Lukas numbers to get us going

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
couple Lukas numbers to get us going
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.810
couple Lukas numbers to get us going
okay that's and then the Fibonacci

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
okay that's and then the Fibonacci
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000
okay that's and then the Fibonacci
numbers which everyone already knows and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
numbers which everyone already knows and
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.410
numbers which everyone already knows and
loves lining up here so they're going 1

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
loves lining up here so they're going 1
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540
loves lining up here so they're going 1
3 you can think of Fibonacci or the 1 1

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
3 you can think of Fibonacci or the 1 1
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.930
3 you can think of Fibonacci or the 1 1
and then you get 2 3 5 8 and so on 30

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
and then you get 2 3 5 8 and so on 30
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270
and then you get 2 3 5 8 and so on 30
people love Fibonacci AMEX there's lots

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
people love Fibonacci AMEX there's lots
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190
people love Fibonacci AMEX there's lots
of cool things and they have the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
of cool things and they have the
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.090
of cool things and they have the
constant ratio that as if you multiply 1

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
constant ratio that as if you multiply 1
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.889
constant ratio that as if you multiply 1
to get to the next one it's the golden

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
to get to the next one it's the golden
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.310
to get to the next one it's the golden
ratio

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
ratio
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840
ratio
there's your multiplier as you go down

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
there's your multiplier as you go down
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.750
there's your multiplier as you go down
well not not exactly but it tends to the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
well not not exactly but it tends to the
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.540
well not not exactly but it tends to the
golden ratio and what I pointed out in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
golden ratio and what I pointed out in
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569
golden ratio and what I pointed out in
our previous video is Lukas numbers do

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
our previous video is Lukas numbers do
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420
our previous video is Lukas numbers do
that as well so again here the ratio

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
that as well so again here the ratio
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.399
that as well so again here the ratio
from one to the next approaches the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
from one to the next approaches the
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.429
from one to the next approaches the
golden ratio in fact any sequence where

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
golden ratio in fact any sequence where
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740
golden ratio in fact any sequence where
you start with two numbers and then add

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
you start with two numbers and then add
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300
you start with two numbers and then add
them to get the next one and we repeat

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
them to get the next one and we repeat
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640
them to get the next one and we repeat
always approach as the ratio of the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
always approach as the ratio of the
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.999
always approach as the ratio of the
golden ratio and so even the Brady

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
golden ratio and so even the Brady
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.320
golden ratio and so even the Brady
numbers so if you want to that was the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
numbers so if you want to that was the
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.730
numbers so if you want to that was the
origin and the Brady numbers to prove

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
origin and the Brady numbers to prove
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280
origin and the Brady numbers to prove
that point there's a video where I prove

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
that point there's a video where I prove
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230
that point there's a video where I prove
it algebraically and we look at these

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
it algebraically and we look at these
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630
it algebraically and we look at these
and they're absolutely great and the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
and they're absolutely great and the
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700
and they're absolutely great and the
kind of the crux of my argument as to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
kind of the crux of my argument as to
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.359
kind of the crux of my argument as to
why Lukas is better than Fibonacci is if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
why Lukas is better than Fibonacci is if
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.620
why Lukas is better than Fibonacci is if
all these Fibonacci esque sequences have

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
all these Fibonacci esque sequences have
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390
all these Fibonacci esque sequences have
that property what happens if we start

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
that property what happens if we start
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550
that property what happens if we start
with the golden ratio is the ratio and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
with the golden ratio is the ratio and
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.410
with the golden ratio is the ratio and
then work out what sequence drops out

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
then work out what sequence drops out
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710
then work out what sequence drops out
and so what I did will show that if you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
and so what I did will show that if you
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.999
and so what I did will show that if you
take the golden ratio and square it you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
take the golden ratio and square it you
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.749
take the golden ratio and square it you
get two point six one eight the dart

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
get two point six one eight the dart
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130
get two point six one eight the dart
which if you round it to the nearest

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
which if you round it to the nearest
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.789
which if you round it to the nearest
whole number is three and I'm not going

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
whole number is three and I'm not going
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.190
whole number is three and I'm not going
to do all of them again this time as you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
to do all of them again this time as you
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959
to do all of them again this time as you
can see what's going on here if you cube

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
can see what's going on here if you cube
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.039
can see what's going on here if you cube
it you get four point two three six that

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049
it you get four point two three six that
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.819
it you get four point two three six that
which you're going to do this whole

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
which you're going to do this whole
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.100
which you're going to do this whole
number is four you go that's that's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
number is four you go that's that's
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.190
number is four you go that's that's
looking familiar

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
looking familiar
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.110
looking familiar
five it equals eleven point zero nine

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
five it equals eleven point zero nine
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.589
five it equals eleven point zero nine
zero dot 11 right and so it turns out

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599
zero dot 11 right and so it turns out
 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.600
zero dot 11 right and so it turns out
that the Lucas numbers are just the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
that the Lucas numbers are just the
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.930
that the Lucas numbers are just the
golden ratio raised to a power and then

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
golden ratio raised to a power and then
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.030
golden ratio raised to a power and then
rounded you square brackets for rounding

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
rounded you square brackets for rounding
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.070
rounded you square brackets for rounding
to the nearest whole value and so the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
to the nearest whole value and so the
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.470
to the nearest whole value and so the
nth lucas number in this sequence is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
nth lucas number in this sequence is
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.839
nth lucas number in this sequence is
just the golden ratio to that power

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849
just the golden ratio to that power
 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.460
just the golden ratio to that power
round to the nearest whole number and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
round to the nearest whole number and
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.509
round to the nearest whole number and
I'm like boom

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519
I'm like boom
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.460
I'm like boom
that's why Lucas numbers are better

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
that's why Lucas numbers are better
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.979
that's why Lucas numbers are better
because if you start with a golden ratio

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
because if you start with a golden ratio
 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.059
because if you start with a golden ratio
and raise it to powers

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069
and raise it to powers
 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.970
and raise it to powers
what drops out the Lucas numbers some on

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
what drops out the Lucas numbers some on
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.729
what drops out the Lucas numbers some on
the internet had a different opinion

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739
the internet had a different opinion
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.039
the internet had a different opinion

if you raise the gun ratio to various

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
if you raise the gun ratio to various
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.360
if you raise the gun ratio to various
powers you don't get the Lucas numbers

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370
powers you don't get the Lucas numbers
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.479
powers you don't get the Lucas numbers
in fact you get a whole lot of Fibonacci

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489
in fact you get a whole lot of Fibonacci
 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.089
in fact you get a whole lot of Fibonacci
numbers and so what they did was use the

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099
numbers and so what they did was use the
 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.770
numbers and so what they did was use the
facts that famously the golden ratio

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
facts that famously the golden ratio
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.190
facts that famously the golden ratio
minus one equals one over the golden

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200
minus one equals one over the golden
 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.800
minus one equals one over the golden
ratio lovely I mean oh I'm a huge fan of

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
ratio lovely I mean oh I'm a huge fan of
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.360
ratio lovely I mean oh I'm a huge fan of
that right this this is the stuff I do

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370
that right this this is the stuff I do
 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.890
that right this this is the stuff I do
get excited about you can actually

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
get excited about you can actually
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.300
get excited about you can actually
multiply everything here by the golden

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310
multiply everything here by the golden
 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.460
multiply everything here by the golden
ratio and shuffle it around a little bit

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470
ratio and shuffle it around a little bit
 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.410
ratio and shuffle it around a little bit
and you'll see the golden ratio squared

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420
and you'll see the golden ratio squared
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.470
and you'll see the golden ratio squared
equals the golden ratio plus 1 which is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480
equals the golden ratio plus 1 which is
 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.539
equals the golden ratio plus 1 which is
also love as I'm stating the same thing

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549
also love as I'm stating the same thing
 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.090
also love as I'm stating the same thing
very nice way in fact if you then solve

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100
very nice way in fact if you then solve
 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.670
very nice way in fact if you then solve
this kind of quadratic equation you can

root of 5 plus 1 on to and that's where

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
root of 5 plus 1 on to and that's where
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.660
root of 5 plus 1 on to and that's where
the value comes from but the interesting

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670
the value comes from but the interesting
 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.580

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989
numerical value when I did God ratio
 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.020
numerical value when I did God ratio
squared why don't I do it in terms of

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
squared why don't I do it in terms of
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.819
squared why don't I do it in terms of
the golden ratio you know why not keep

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829
the golden ratio you know why not keep
 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.580
the golden ratio you know why not keep
it as you know an exact number because

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590

other mathematics I see it seems kind of

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139
other mathematics I see it seems kind of
 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.460

with you I'm gonna do it again and keep
 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.279
with you I'm gonna do it again and keep
it in exact terms so this is where it

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289
it in exact terms so this is where it
 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.319

if n minus one that's quite nice so
 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.780
if n minus one that's quite nice so
there yeah so we do we would generalize

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790
there yeah so we do we would generalize
 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.640
there yeah so we do we would generalize
the pattern whether the oh we can

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650
the pattern whether the oh we can
 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.870
the pattern whether the oh we can
probably simplify that actually because

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880
probably simplify that actually because
 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.850
probably simplify that actually because
we've got a golden ratio here and like

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860
we've got a golden ratio here and like
 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.820
we've got a golden ratio here and like
we said the ratio is always golden ratio

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830
we said the ratio is always golden ratio
 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.000
we said the ratio is always golden ratio
as you go up so if n times the God ratio

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010
as you go up so if n times the God ratio
 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.380
as you go up so if n times the God ratio
is actually just the next Fibonacci

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.390
is actually just the next Fibonacci
 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.450
is actually just the next Fibonacci
number so actually they're equals the

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460
number so actually they're equals the
 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.320
number so actually they're equals the
Fibonacci n plus one plus if n minus 1

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330
Fibonacci n plus one plus if n minus 1
 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.140
Fibonacci n plus one plus if n minus 1
well that's quite nice so what I've been

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150
well that's quite nice so what I've been
 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.210
well that's quite nice so what I've been
correctly schooled on is that the golden

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220
correctly schooled on is that the golden
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.270
correctly schooled on is that the golden
ratio to n is the Fibonacci number after

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280
ratio to n is the Fibonacci number after
 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.490
ratio to n is the Fibonacci number after
N and ribbon actually before and some

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500
N and ribbon actually before and some
 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.050
N and ribbon actually before and some
together that's that is very very

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.060
together that's that is very very
 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.430
together that's that is very very
pleasing but actually we probably add

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
pleasing but actually we probably add
 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.630
pleasing but actually we probably add
them together couldn't wait could we can

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:46.640
them together couldn't wait could we can
 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.770
them together couldn't wait could we can
simplify this right because it's always

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:47.780
simplify this right because it's always
 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.930

the Fibonacci number ahead and the one

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940
the Fibonacci number ahead and the one
 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.940
the Fibonacci number ahead and the one
behind some together so this just very

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:51.950
behind some together so this just very
 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.320
behind some together so this just very
quickly I can list out the Fibonacci

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330
quickly I can list out the Fibonacci
 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:00.700
quickly I can list out the Fibonacci
numbers again 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 and then

we'll add the through every position
 

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.610
we'll add the through every position
before and after so 1 and 3 if we add

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.930
before and after so 1 and 3 if we add
those together we get so 1 2 we get 3 if

up so if you do generalize this and

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.040
up so if you do generalize this and
 

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.920
up so if you do generalize this and
simplify it down and then you add the

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:26.930
simplify it down and then you add the
 

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.930
simplify it down and then you add the
offset Fibonacci numbers you get this

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:28.940
offset Fibonacci numbers you get this
 

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.910
offset Fibonacci numbers you get this

twice you get two of them one in each

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920
twice you get two of them one in each
 

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.940
twice you get two of them one in each

argument for why is Fibonacci because it

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.190
argument for why is Fibonacci because it
 

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.730
argument for why is Fibonacci because it
turns out the two sets of numbers are

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:35.740
turns out the two sets of numbers are
 

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.680
turns out the two sets of numbers are
very closely linked and the fact that

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:37.690
very closely linked and the fact that
 

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.870
very closely linked and the fact that
you can sum pairs of one and you get the

you can sum pairs of one and you get the
other one is that is why I can flip

hang on I've just done what I did before
but now the roundings disappeared all

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519
but now the roundings disappeared all
 

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.610
but now the roundings disappeared all
the rounding was hidden in this step

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.620
the rounding was hidden in this step
 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.530
the rounding was hidden in this step
here that's where the rounding was where

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:55.540
here that's where the rounding was where
 

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.170
here that's where the rounding was where
I went from there to there because it's

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180
I went from there to there because it's
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.180
I went from there to there because it's
not actually the golden ratio between

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.190
not actually the golden ratio between
 

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.309
not actually the golden ratio between
consecutive terms it approaches it and

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:02.319
consecutive terms it approaches it and
 

00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:04.500
consecutive terms it approaches it and
so eventually it's that exactly but

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.510
so eventually it's that exactly but
 

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.120
so eventually it's that exactly but
initially you got around for that to

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.130
initially you got around for that to
 

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.350
initially you got around for that to
happen and that's why you're rounding

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360
happen and that's why you're rounding
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.050
happen and that's why you're rounding
over here to get this so that that's

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.060
over here to get this so that that's
 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.340
over here to get this so that that's
where all the rounding has been swept

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:11.350
where all the rounding has been swept
 

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.079
where all the rounding has been swept
under that one step there and so you

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:13.089
under that one step there and so you
 

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:14.790
under that one step there and so you
still get the numbers out so I'm thank

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800
still get the numbers out so I'm thank
 

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.980
still get the numbers out so I'm thank
