00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,310
joining me today as a trial
lawyer focusing on civil,

3
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:11,510
criminal and constitutional law.
And according to his Twitter bio,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,040
he's America's most successful
political gambler. Robert Barnes,

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,660
welcome to the Rubin report.
Having to be here.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,420
I am glad to have you
here because you sir,

7
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:25,421
are smack Dab in the middle of a million
things that I'm thinking about all the

8
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,600
time. So I'm glad we're doing this.
Before we do anything related to civil,

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:34,490
criminal, constitutional, or any
other kind of law, political gambler,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,800
what or what are we talking about there?
I know what we're talking about,

11
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:37,520
but tell the people.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,740
Sure. I started doing when
I was real young, so the,

13
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,710
I used to bet friends and other people
with elections and then started doing,

14
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:47,711
it became sort of legal loosely in 2004
so I started betting on presidential

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:52,340
elections. I know sort of a side hobby
until the Trump election and Trump,

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,310
I thought this was a very
money making opportunity.

17
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,430
The British betting markets are now
much bigger than they ever used to be.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,750
So I could bet as much money as
I possibly could. And, and, and,

19
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,900
and basically dug in much
deeper than I had before.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,100
So I had sort of been around politics
but hadn't done in deep for maybe,

21
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,410
you know, 20 years or so. I
mean I had been very active,

22
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:13,400
but then it become inactive.

23
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,460
It'd become skeptical of the
political process and decided, well,

24
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,200
I should really dig in.
And as part of this,

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,860
I discovered this whole emerging movement
in a cross section of areas and what

26
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,170
was happening at geologically.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,540
So I became involved for other political
and legal reasons along the way.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,770
It was sort of like a Scott Adams when
big league kind of thing where you get

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,390
the, it's there somewhere
exactly, exactly.

30
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,150
Where you get like six degrees of
separation. You're trying to learn this.

31
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:38,720
He ended up learning four or five other
things in the process. And so I, you know,

32
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,430
I went to the Republican
National Convention,

33
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:43,280
the Democratic National Convention
traveled across the country,

34
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:46,520
talk to tons of people, dug into what
was happening in the social media space,

35
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,610
the reddit space, the Twitter space. I
didn't know what Twitter was until then.

36
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,450
Really. I knew some bird things.
A happier time. Exactly it was,

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,490
and maybe youtube was still youtube,
you know, it wasn't sensor too. So the,

38
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:02,210
I was uh, you know, involved and
invested in it, went over to the UK,

39
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:05,750
placed a lot of big bets. Uh, they
thought I was nuts when I was doing it.

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,970
They were like, you know how
Trump's not going to get elected.

41
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,760
That was the sort of consensus.
So much so that one of the big books,

42
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,210
Patty power actually was
paying out Hillary Clinton.
Beth's before the election.

43
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,610
So if you had been on Hillary
Clinton with Patty power,

44
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,690
they acted like you had already
won and paid you out. Are they,

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,760
are they still in business?
They are still in business. Uh,

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,600
though they took a huge hit on the
election after they'd taken a big hit on

47
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,820
Brexit,
which I'd been on before that.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,310
And then after that had been
on various European elections.

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,770
So it was just understanding
how the electorate works.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm a sports better as well and being
able to predict and forecast elections was

51
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,770
fun and it was a way to
just make extra money.

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,820
And in the process ended up having this
whole life experience that was fun and

53
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,680
entertaining and very profitable.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,540
Can I ask you what kind of profits?
We're talking

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,420
about half a million dollars. Yeah.
It's very nice. If I could admit that.

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,790
If I could a bet more, I
would've bet more. Yeah. He,
uh, there was the only limits.

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,600
As an American you only have access
to the individual betting shops.

58
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:02,350
You can't onto the Betfair and the
bet trade and markets. If I could,

59
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,390
I could have made seven figures,
but they use, it would have been

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,040
nice jeans. All right, well there's
a lot to talk about there, but,

61
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,700
but I really want to focus on some of
the legal stuff because we chatted a

62
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:14,990
little bit in the green room.
I'm starting to think as much as much.

63
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:18,380
I obviously am a free speech guy and
we're going to talk all about the first

64
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:18,711
amendment,

65
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:23,390
all sorts of things that the way the world
is going right now with the platforms

66
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:26,900
and with the trolls and with the
anonymous accounts and with the targeted

67
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,860
harassment and with the way that we
see media members attacking kids,

68
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,650
which you're very intimately involved
with and a whole bunch of other stuff.

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm starting to think we really need
some legal answers to some of these

70
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:39,561
problems,

71
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:43,520
which is really against my default
position as a person in terms of speech.

72
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,550
And that's exactly why I wanted to have
you here. So before we get to all that,

73
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,130
um, just tell me a little
bit about your legal history.

74
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:52,610
When did you even get interested in law
and what sort of made you say, all right,

75
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm going to be a lawyer.
Lawyers are that well liked.

76
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,100
Exactly. Well I, you know,

77
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,160
I've always liked underdog representation
and that sort of what my legal

78
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,960
practice is and that
goes back to I was a kid,

79
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,670
my favorite TV show is the equalizer.

80
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,510
It was always not realize the odds
and end to represent people against,

81
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,150
even if I'm representing someone
that's famous or well known,

82
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,360
they're stacked up against someone that
has more institutional power or wealth

83
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,970
or the u s government behind him.
And so I was a kid,

84
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,330
I like chose like Matlock and Perry
Mason and that was part of it.

85
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,500
And you'd see lawyers as being integral
to the process of making meaningful

86
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:26,440
change and particularly to stand up
for people who couldn't stand up for

87
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,300
themselves and use our legal
system and legal rights to,

88
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,150
to accomplish and
achieve those objectives.

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,310
And so that's why the law
always appealed to me.

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,280
It didn't appeal to me from a moneymaking
perspective though, had been very,

91
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,530
you know, had been lucky
in that regard. Uh,

92
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,920
it appealed to me and didn't appear
to appeal to me on a status basis.

93
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,170
It appealed to me is I can make
a difference for little people.

94
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,770
People like my father who spoke
out his whole life and there's a,

95
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,910
and often was punished
for it. And the, uh,

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,140
there's the old biblical proverb that
says the sins of the father will be

97
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,880
visited on the sun. I always say, well,

98
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,460
the sins against the father
or long remembered by the sun.

99
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,750
And so he was mistreated and maltreated
because he stood up, not for himself,

100
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,880
but for other people in a
wide range of environments.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,460
And I just want it to equalize
the playing field if I could.

102
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,310
And was he a lawyer also now? He
wasn't. He was, he was an accountant,

103
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,040
but it wasn't a certified
public accountant. Uh, so the,

104
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,130
he went through all the craziness that
it was my first experience with the

105
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,090
credentialing society here. My father was
a very skilled and gifted account. It,

106
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,490
but because he wasn't a
certified public accountant,

107
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,940
he'd grown up in an era where
that wasn't necessary. Uh,

108
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,110
he couldn't get the kind of
jobs that other people could do.

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,890
And so he was often both overqualified
or underqualified for employment.

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,670
And then he had a habit of standing up
for people who are being maltreated or

111
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,730
mistreated in his work environment or
other environment, which led to him.

112
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,770
And he ended up being a newspaper.
We got delivery guy.

113
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,170
So when I was a little kid,
we used deliver newspapers,

114
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:45,100
throwing them outside the door. He, we
did a morning around and afternoon route,

115
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,530
uh,
and then he end up doing inventory work.

116
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,660
So he just picked up whatever
blue collar work he could.

117
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,650
So even though his education
and his intellectual
capabilities far exceeded what

118
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,850
he could get economically,

119
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,490
it was the product or a side effect
of their credentialing society and the

120
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,180
ability of more powerful people to take
advantage and misuse and abuse that

121
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,520
power against less powerful
people like himself. Wow.

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,980
So all right. So let's flash
forward a little bit to what,

123
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,320
what were maybe one or two of
the cases that kind of got you,

124
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,770
got you sort of on the map so that
now you've become one of the sort of,

125
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:19,550
I think one of the central legal
figures in the, the free speech battle.

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,030
So I started out doing all kinds of
free speech representation represented

127
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,570
victims of domestic violence was suing
big banks before anybody was doing big

128
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:30,920
banks. And subprime lending was a, I
had clerked for a native American tribe.

129
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,920
I'd clerked for a big corporate law firm.
I'd clerked for a street lawyer.

130
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,290
I always say,
if anybody wants to learn legal education,

131
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,840
just read all of John Grisham's books.
You'll get a good sense of outlet.

132
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,240
Legal practice really works.
Um,

133
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,960
and worked for a big high
profile plaintiff's lawyer
and finally got to a space

134
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,820
where I could do the kind
of cases I wanted to do.

135
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,620
And I liked first amendment cases and
it happened to parallel and two areas of

136
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,740
law. One was civil where I
was representing Ralph Nader.
He went on TV and said,

137
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,620
look, I'm getting bombarded. I
have no lawyers left to help me.

138
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,680
If somebody can please reach out. I
was like, sure, I'll take the case.

139
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,500
So there was, I remember we did the
case in Arizona was me, Ralph Nader,

140
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,690
and like 12 lawyers kept coming in. I
kept wondering when the door was gunshot,

141
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,050
we're not a lawyer came in another,

142
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,100
you had the Democratic Party Republican
Party both aligned to prevent his access

143
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:13,934
to the ballot,

144
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,150
deny people the right to
circulate petitions for the
cause or candidate of their

145
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:21,590
choice. And so I took that case and it
took four years, a lot of litigation,

146
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,424
a lot of fighting.

147
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,310
But ultimately we got one of the most
important precedents in the country out of

148
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,780
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

149
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,200
It's now one of the most cited cases in
the country that protects the right to

150
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,200
circulate petitions, the right to
speak to the context of elections,

151
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,480
the right to choose who
you want on the ballot,

152
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,570
the right of third parties and independent
candidates to access the ballot.

153
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,450
In a weird way though, even though just
by the fact that it took four years,

154
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:44,800
isn't that part of the problem
right there? Cause yes,

155
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,030
four years later it's like he doesn't
necessarily have the energy to run again

156
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:51,150
or the movement kind of moves
on to something else, et cetera.

157
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,420
It was like the beginning of lawfare
of its own time, politically motivated,

158
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,161
ideological law,

159
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,830
fair to exclude independent and dissonant
voices from being able to meaningfully

160
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,390
participate in the political process.

161
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,690
And the main goal and objective
is to silence the audience,

162
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,170
to not allow the audience to hear or
choose or participate in the way they want

163
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,060
to choose.
They don't get to choose their news,

164
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,320
they don't get to choose their views.

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,420
That's what the censorship
campaigns were about.

166
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,290
And that crossed over into representing
people who are accused of being tax

167
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,124
protesters.

168
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
And these were people who had very
distinct political views about the way the

169
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:23,760
tax laws were operating. They were mostly
upfront about it with the IRS. I mean,

170
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,620
how many people you know,
write letters saying,

171
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,230
I'm not going to pay taxes
and here's what some of those,

172
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,480
mostly these were
libertarians, basically. Right.

173
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:33,210
It's never somebody that hates the tax
system because they want to be taxed more.

174
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,430
Right, exactly. That's never
happened. Precisely. Exactly.

175
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,960
And it's people being
open and honest about it.

176
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,070
They're not trying to cheat anybody.

177
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,470
And I tried to defraud anybody
in the US Supreme Court.

178
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:43,170
Has had 20 years ago in a case called
cheek versus the United States.

179
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260
They were not supposed to put people
in prison for having different beliefs

180
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,160
about the tax laws,

181
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,160
especially if given this as a country
that was founded on people who had very

182
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,290
unique beliefs about the tax laws.
Uh,

183
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,660
so I ended up representing
Wesley Snipes in that context.

184
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,210
I'd also represented him previously when
he'd been falsely accused of, of uh,

185
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,000
of uh,
uh,

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,900
parenting a child in New York where they
were abusing the family court system to

187
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,710
invade his privacy, to
lie in liable him. Uh,

188
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,490
and basically t because of his celebrity
uses celebrity to make themselves

189
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,030
notorious. Uh, so we brought
a unique civil rights case
in that context. Had One,

190
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,710
got them to fold and capitulate.

191
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,700
He hired me then to represent him in the
criminal case on a whole bunch of tax

192
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,310
charges. Ended up acquitted
of all the felony fraud,

193
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,650
conspiracy charges and even
half the misdemeanor charge.

194
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,860
Um, on cases like that,
I'm always curious. Um,

195
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,730
when it's a high profiles rich
celebrity and it's tax related,

196
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,680
I always think it's like
these people moved me,

197
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,200
a guy like Wesleys night movie star,
you know,

198
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,840
he's worth millions and millions
of dollars. The idea that he would,

199
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,880
and I don't know the specifics,
so please correct me if I'm wrong,

200
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,270
but the idea that he would know every
specific thing that his accountant was

201
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,700
doing all the time.
It seems crazy to me.

202
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:51,510
Like he's running a business where he's
mostly probably focused on acting and

203
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:55,380
traveling and everything else and it's
like the idea that unless he instructed

204
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,170
the guy to do something illegal
that you'd end up in jail.

205
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,690
Because if something like that
seems pretty bananas to me

206
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,321
completely.

207
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,290
Because what had happened with him is
he'd had one accountant advisor that he

208
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,320
started to distrust.
I think this guy's up to something on,

209
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,230
on real estate deals and other deals.
It turned out he was completely right.

210
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,890
He was trying to tell the
New York authorities for
years before the guy ended up

211
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,710
getting busted and he had,
this guy was involved with Tom Brokaw.

212
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,320
He was representing a whole roster
of high profile celebrities.

213
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,450
Turned out he was embezzling
from them in mass.

214
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,390
He had abandoned his wife or
a stripper long story. So the,

215
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,900
this guy ended up going to jail for a
long time. But, but snipes was like, hey,

216
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,850
there's a problem here.
And nobody would listen.

217
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:33,120
And that led them to turn
to other professionals and
they said, you know what,

218
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,180
if you have any questions, we'll go right
to the government and get your answers.

219
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,040
And he was like,
well that's gotta be no problem.

220
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,290
They're going to talk to the government.
They'll figure out what it is.

221
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,070
That's how this unfolded. That's how this
whole thing unfolded. It was in fact,

222
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:48,060
they even tried to delete and destroy
all of his letters and correspondence and

223
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:51,960
communications. And luckily they
were, he had separately back them up.

224
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,651
If he hadn't,

225
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,890
we wouldn't have been able to prove how
much he had communicated directly to

226
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,720
them. He even asked to
be audited. He said,

227
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:01,290
come in and audit me and then come back
and tell me what is it io and why it is

228
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,790
I owe it.
And how does the legal system work?

229
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,670
And this is somewhat rooted in the
African American and native American

230
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,970
tradition who has a long history of the
law is not being applied the way they're

231
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:09,990
supposed to be on the books.

232
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,650
So the idea that maybe the law is not
being applied the way it's supposed to be

233
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,580
wasn't foreign to him.

234
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,730
You have native American tribes whose
tribal agreements are still not being

235
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,420
enforced.

236
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,380
You have African Americans between 18
and 65 and 1955 in the United States.

237
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,440
Like his parents, like his grandparents
who said the law on the books,

238
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,600
that they had the right to
participate in the political process,

239
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,610
the right to be on the jury,
the right to run for office.

240
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,410
And yet that wasn't happening in reality.

241
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,880
So the idea that there was some mismatch
here made sense to him and he just

242
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,280
wanted, he said, well, let's go right
to the government and I'm Wesley Snipes.

243
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,010
I have a little bit of a tension, they'll
probably answer my questions at least,

244
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,330
and then everything will get resolved.

245
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,500
That's why the jury was shocked by the
case. This was a very conservative jury.

246
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,000
The lead jury foreman was a guy who had
been a long time corrections officer and

247
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,520
upstate New York. They had deliberately
the jury pool they'd picked.

248
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:57,940
It was literally an all white jury pool.
So there was a joke that it was as, as,

249
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:01,450
uh, the only thing more white than the
snow fall from the Green Bay packer in New

250
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,240
York. Jazz came the day before was
the dairy pool in this nice case.

251
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,260
But now nine of the 12 jurors who are
honest and got onto the jury said they

252
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,730
didn't think he should be convicted,
do anything.

253
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,190
There were three jurors
who were holdouts who said,

254
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,470
we want to convict him of things.
And we came in with,

255
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,380
they admitted they came in with a bias
before they became part of the jury.

256
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,320
So on the misdemeanors, they did
a split verdict. They said, well,

257
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,140
will convict them on these
three misdemeanors even
though we don't think he's

258
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,330
guilty of him because
that will be no problem.

259
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,540
They didn't know there'd be a wacky
sentence because there was shock at the

260
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,010
outcome of the case.
Uh,

261
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,270
so how much of law is just that?

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,130
Just the public attention
stuff, manipulating the
media. I don't have to name,

263
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,860
I could probably name a zillion
lawyers that seem like they're far more

264
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,140
interested in fame for themselves.

265
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:48,141
Then doing the right thing
and just managing optics
rather than getting to just

266
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,460
what is right.

267
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,320
Precisely. That's what
it often is. I mean,

268
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:55,680
you're seeing it now in the Roger Stone
case where there's an obsession with

269
00:12:55,681 --> 00:13:00,000
silence again and all the people on the
media on the left that talked about free

270
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:03,240
speech and talk about the ability to
protect yourself and how our criminal

271
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,480
justice system has problems or
suddenly muted when here it is.

272
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,600
You have a judge spending all this time
saying maybe we shouldn't allow him to

273
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:14,400
publish a book. How has that become part
of American criminal justice process?

274
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,710
So the effectively,

275
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:20,310
it often is defending a person in the
court of public opinion because often with

276
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,740
the government is doing is
using people as sin goats,

277
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,790
using people as sacrificial lambs,
using people to coerce public opinion,

278
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,340
often not really rooted
in the facts of the case,

279
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,730
not really rooted in the law of the
case targeting people solely because of

280
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:34,830
their celebrity or their fame.
Uh,

281
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,160
and then you have lawyers who often look
at a case and they don't look at the

282
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,810
case about how do I win the case.

283
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,240
They look at how do I get
the most press coverage,

284
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,830
how do I get the most media coverage?

285
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,620
And they often deserve their
clients in that context.

286
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,240
So it's critically important,

287
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,840
especially in high profile cases to
put the client first and to manage the,

288
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,610
the court of public
opinion at the same time.

289
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,250
Yeah. And that cannot be easy,
especially in a day of social media.

290
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,180
And look the fact you're here talking,
so it's not like you're, you're,

291
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,500
you're not like a totally private person.
No.

292
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,710
And yet you want to do what's
right by your clients and Yep.

293
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,730
Exactly. So like in snipes case, the,

294
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,240
I think the odds going back to high
was an eight to the odds that he was

295
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:14,690
convicted of the top felony fraud
counts was eight to one. So there was a,

296
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,510
they said there was only about a 10,
11% chance of him being acquitted.

297
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,050
You had see, you know, people on CNN
saying that he had no chance to win.

298
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,910
Some are still prominent legal
commentary. And now, uh, and

299
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,980
we always have legal common commentary,
people on CNN often,

300
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,740
but all the cable networks
who get everything wrong
and they keep bringing them

301
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:31,990
back.

302
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,330
It, it's like the political
commentary. What, Oh, for stress.

303
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,480
And there's the people that are mostly
never practice law. Never tried a case,

304
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:41,440
never dealt with a real days. And, and
it's amazing. They'll just, they're there,

305
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,580
they have a law degree,

306
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,520
but they often don't have
any legal experience and
they're really, they're from,

307
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,810
or for political purposes,

308
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:50,440
they know if they say the right thing
that they're media bosses want them to say

309
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,750
they'll get rewarded even if what they're
saying is complete and utter nonsense.

310
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,401
Yeah.

311
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:57,620
So one of the things that I've been
saying over the last couple of years and,

312
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
and you know I'm a free speech guy,

313
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:04,000
is that right now I'm more concerned
that we're silencing ourselves.

314
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:07,060
Then the government is coming for
our speech at this very moment.

315
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:10,750
Now of course I understand the government
can always come for our speech and

316
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:13,480
there are many ways that you're laying
out right there that they can through

317
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,820
going through the IRS or or whatever else.

318
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,840
But I'm more concerned right now
about sort of the mob mentality,

319
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:24,040
the way we're weaponizing the media
and social media and the rest of it.

320
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,350
So let's just start with the big
question right now. Social media,

321
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,150
are these publishers or platforms
right now, Twitter, Facebook, youtube,

322
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,580
and can you explain the
difference between them?

323
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,470
Absolutely.

324
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,790
So all of these big tech
platforms originally were
able to obtain their monopoly

325
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:45,530
status two ways. First, they got
Congress to pass special immunity laws,

326
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,960
uh,
loosely called section two 30.

327
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,620
The particular section of the law is
that applies that says we're going to

328
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:56,390
presume that everything you do is as
a platform and not as a publisher and

329
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:00,320
consequently you'll be immune
from any lawsuit as a publisher,

330
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,390
as long as you are acting as a platform.

331
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,880
So meaning that you're just the,
you're just the space so to speak.

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,130
People can put all kinds
of crap up on there.

333
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,270
You can decide what you take down or
leave up, but you're not endorsing it.

334
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,930
Exactly. You're just the public
venue. You're, you're the, the,

335
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:18,780
the venue where they're coming to organize
the Republican Party on the election

336
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,870
night, right? You're the restaurant,
you're the, you're the convention centers.

337
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,890
That's all you are.

338
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,090
And then that was even additionally
privately promised by people like jacket

339
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,930
Twitter who said, I'll be the free
speech wing of the free speech party.

340
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,480
So he induces people to participate,

341
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,440
induces people to become part of Twitter
and to give them an a competitive

342
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:41,400
economic edge against their
then competitors on the
grounds. And hey look, one,

343
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:45,120
the law only applies if we're a
platform, not a publisher. Secondly,

344
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:48,330
we are promising you we will protect
your free speech rights and your free

345
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,090
speech liberties.
Now it's important in that context.

346
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,680
Free speech means the right to
not be stopped for your speech,

347
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,050
the right not to be
harassed for your speech,

348
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,900
the right not to be censored
for your speech. It's both.

349
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,750
That's why I was telling for free speech
is not just the right of expression.

350
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,800
It means I have a rights that someone
can't target me because of my expression

351
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,060
and use elicit mechanisms.
They can question my ideas,
they can attack my ideas.

352
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,230
If I'm a public figure,

353
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,380
they have limited space in which
they can talk about me as a person,

354
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,480
but what they can't do
is invade my privacy.

355
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,220
What they can't do is
follow me down the street.

356
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,590
What they can't do is put a
billboard outside my home.

357
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
These are things they can't do.

358
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,400
So is that,
I mean,

359
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,930
to me that's a really fascinating change
on the way things have happened because

360
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,870
if I was to look at just generally
what's going on on Twitter these days,

361
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,320
if I was to walk down the street right
now and somebody just everyday was

362
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,050
waiting outside my house and started
screaming at me and all sorts of things,

363
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,770
there is legal recourse I could take,
right? I can file a, what can I do

364
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,620
[inaudible] a civil suit and get an
order of protection against like people.

365
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:49,200
Like I did a lot of work back in the day
when I was a young lawyer for victims

366
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,290
of domestic violence and
we were part of that,

367
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,030
the beginning of the orders of
protection that got instituted for them.

368
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,790
But it's not limited to the
domestic violence context.

369
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,110
It's anybody who stalking anybody who's
harassing anybody who's invading your

370
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:01,860
privacy.

371
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,430
You have an equitable right and a legal
right to bring legal action against them

372
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,630
and have the court say,

373
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:09,570
I'm going to stop you from doing
this and if you violate this,

374
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,220
you're going to be
responsible for legal fees.

375
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,870
You're going to be responsible for costs.

376
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,660
I can even put a statutory amount
on there and they have to do,

377
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,020
they'll say every time you violate this,
it's $1,000 or 5,000,

378
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:23,340
10,000 whatever's necessary to deter
those laws exist already there.

379
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,630
So are those laws,

380
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:28,560
are there any laws related to that that
exists in the digital space? Now, again,

381
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,190
I want to be very clean when we're
doing this because, so for example,

382
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,510
all day long trolls are jumping at
me. Go Fuck Yourself. Or you know,

383
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,470
just the word.
It's far worse than that usually.

384
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,030
But like just the worst kind of things
all day long. Same accounts, I block them,

385
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:44,070
I mute them. They just make new
accounts over and over and over. Okay.

386
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,860
It's not the worst thing in the world.
I'm still here. I'm alive. It's okay. Um,

387
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,520
but doing it in the digital realm,

388
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:54,000
I think people would see that very
differently than stocking someone just

389
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,610
outside of their house or
in the realm of reality.

390
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,470
It is only to a certain degree,
the same laws apply.

391
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,380
So it doesn't matter whether it's the
digital world or the physical world.

392
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,530
The same stalking laws apply.
The same harassing loan was apply.

393
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,300
So somebody who stocks can be sued,

394
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,030
somebody who stocks and they can even
be charged with crimes under particular

395
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,640
cases so they can be referred
for criminal prosecution.

396
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,790
That's happened to people that have done
that too. Mike Cernovich for example.

397
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,550
So the, uh, so you can use civil remedies,

398
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:21,310
you can request criminal
remedies with criminal referrals,

399
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,780
you can bring equitable actions,

400
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,780
you can bring legal actions and of
courts are actually very sensitive to it,

401
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:29,350
particularly like in California where
because of the problem of Stalker Razzi,

402
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,500
they expanded the,

403
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,610
through the kind of protection either in
the digital space or the personal space.

404
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,970
And the u s supreme court has increasingly
recognized that these days those

405
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:38,140
spaces are indistinguishable.

406
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,440
So it's interesting to me because
as part of the, let's say,

407
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,420
the free speech crew online right now,

408
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm very hesitant of a lot of this stuff
because it's like I want everyone to be

409
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,000
able to express themselves.

410
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,210
And yet I understand we need
certain super specific laws,

411
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,190
libel laws, slander laws, harassment laws,

412
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,330
and yet there's a certain irony where
it's like the free speech crew are the

413
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,090
ones that are going to have
to defend those laws is like,

414
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,630
it's like a really weird place
for people like us to be in it.

415
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,500
I agree the way I think of it as
I see it as an unequal equation.

416
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,950
So what's happening is you're seeing
big media, big powerful forces,

417
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,520
people with big platforms be
able to defame little people.

418
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:19,190
It will be able to run smear
campaigns against people.

419
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:23,420
It will be able to attack and,
and encourage stalking and harassment and,

420
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,200
and online mobs at will and
not be held responsible.

421
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,780
And it's the little guy that's still
fighting for their free speech.

422
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,770
And yet they're the ones,

423
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,340
the little guy who's getting sued by big
institutional actors are backed by big

424
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,010
institutional players and they're
being sued for defamation.

425
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,670
They're being sued for liable, they're
being sued for there being the platform.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,210
And so we need to do is equalize that
playing field because the first amendment

427
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:46,130
is also about protecting everybody.
Speech.

428
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:49,090
And that means the little guy can't get
harassed in ways the big guys immune

429
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,690
from and the big guy can't use powers that
the little guy doesn't have access to.

430
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,790
So it needs to be equalized out.

431
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,260
So true free speech means people who are
important in the independent press and

432
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,500
the freedom of press of the independent
press, not be harassed, not be,

433
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,720
not the legal system,
not be used against them,

434
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,010
disproportionately indiscriminately not
have the platforming happening against

435
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:12,370
them disproportionately indiscriminately.
And that's what's taking place.

436
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,480
And that's what needs to equalize.

437
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,200
So a true free speech means we need to
have some equality of treatment between

438
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:17,570
everybody.

439
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,260
Okay, so now backing that to the
platform versus publisher part of this.

440
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:22,940
So they help get these law,

441
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,760
what statute did you say to section
two third section two 30 okay. So they,

442
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:30,920
they help get these laws passed.
Now they're treated as platforms,

443
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,510
but it seems that they're
acting often more as publisher.

444
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,780
Right. They know, admit that. So in other
suits that I brought against Twitter,

445
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,070
they said that they are a publisher and
they want all of the protections as a

446
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:43,850
publisher.

447
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,360
They went all the legal privileges of
a publisher because the publisher has a

448
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:49,040
wide range of special protections,

449
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,740
particularly events has any
institutional former backing.

450
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,070
So there are certain libel laws that
apply to individuals differently than they

451
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:58,190
apply to corporations.
The same is true of big media publishers,

452
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,570
so they're now saying to courts,
so in the Prager suit against youtube,

453
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,780
youtube and Google's defense
is we're acting as a sensor,

454
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,980
we're acting as an editor,

455
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,430
we're acting as a publisher and look at
all these privileges we have as a, as,

456
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,410
as a publisher,
which a lot of people,

457
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:15,470
and it was one of the issues we raised
was if they're acting as a publisher,

458
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:17,450
they shouldn't have the
immunities of a platform.

459
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,830
Unfortunately the courts have interpreted
what congress said to them in a

460
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,410
political way, and this is often
the case with a lot of law,

461
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,560
a lot of laws that interpreted through
a political framework and how they

462
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,880
interpreted it as,
oh,

463
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:32,420
the Co is congress doesn't want
us to allow big tech to be sued.

464
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,350
So we're going to give them all the
protections as a publisher and all the

465
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:40,520
section two 30 immunities as a platform.
So they have a degree of protection.

466
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,020
As senator Holly described it,

467
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,980
a degree of immunity and benefits
that no publisher in the world has,

468
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,400
that Congress is the one that actually
gave it to them as the courts have

469
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,070
construed it though somewhat argue.
That's beyond what Congress intended.

470
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,060
Right, so Prager lost the initial lawsuit.
Correct. Are they, and I know Dennis,

471
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,960
but I actually don't know the answer.
Are they pursuing other illegal measures?

472
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,030
You're still trying to go
through the appellate process,

473
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,420
but they're unlikely to prevail under
the current environment because the

474
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,720
current environment is such that like the,
when I pursued Twitter,

475
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,960
I brought unique novel theories.
I brought breach of contract theories,

476
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,100
a consumer protection act theories cause
my equitable theories because my view

477
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:20,000
was Twitter had lied to people to induce
their participation profited from that

478
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,440
participation sold.

479
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,460
That person's like someone like Charles
Johnson would come in and 30,000 other

480
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,740
people joined Twitter to
follow Charles Johnson.

481
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,750
They now have all of
their private information.

482
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:33,620
They get to aggregate that information
and then marketize it and monetize it and

483
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,160
then they get to censor in band Charles
Johnson forever from Twitter because

484
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:39,110
they don't like one tweety mate.
Well,

485
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:41,270
if my view is that's really
a breach of contract,

486
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:45,080
that's really a breach of equitable
duties and obligations, but the court saw,

487
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
oh congress is saying section two 30
means I'm not supposed to allow Twitter to

488
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,580
ever be sued for anything.

489
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,240
That's what's happened and that's why
Congress needs to fix that side of the

490
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,870
equation because unfortunately the courts
haven't stepped up to do it themselves.

491
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,310
Do you think there is an interesting
piece of this that is just because of

492
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:05,780
anonymous accounts and I don't know
what the legal protections or non

493
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,010
protections would be around that,

494
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,160
but if you generally look at
what's happening online, if you,

495
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,450
if we removed anonymous accounts and
by the way, as a free speech guy,

496
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,790
I'm not for that because I understand
the off many times, many times.

497
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,460
I mean I see this with people
that I meet at live events.

498
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,010
They'll come up to me after and they say,
you know,

499
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,150
I have an anonymous account because
I'm a conservative and I, you know,

500
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,800
so it's not that they're trolls,

501
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:28,280
it's not that their flame flaming
people or whatever else it is.

502
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,980
But there's a piece of me that thinks,
man,

503
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:34,310
if you just removed
anonymous accounts and put,

504
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,940
put aside the decent human
part of it for a second, sure.

505
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,160
That actually 80 to 90% of all of this
nonsense would disappear because you've

506
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,580
got brave keyboard warriors with no skin
in the game that are trying to so havoc.

507
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,070
I don't know if there's a
legal piece of this somewhere.

508
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,070
There is a legal way to do it.

509
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,670
So if you're an operating on an anonymous
account and you're doing something

510
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:57,660
that's not protected by
the first amendment, like
stalking, like harassing, like,

511
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,600
like invading someone's privacy,
which is a broad toward,

512
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,500
that covers a wide range of remedies,
including like in the Covington pay case,

513
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,970
they'll bring the first
case that establishes that
doxing is in fact an invasion

514
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:13,620
of privacy. So, uh, you can sue, you
can require that Twitter or Google,

515
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:17,880
whoever did it, Facebook
identify that individual, uh,

516
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,480
and consequently that individual can be
held legally liable for their course of

517
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,580
conduct.
So people who think they can hide,

518
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,950
they can do bad things behind anonymity.
You're wrong,

519
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,770
they can do good things
behind it and enmity.

520
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:31,470
And the First Amendment encompasses
that anonymity is often critical to all

521
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:32,460
kinds of free speech.

522
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,250
But if what you're doing has always
been outside the scope of the first

523
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:37,470
amendment like stalking,
like harassing,

524
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,070
like intending to censor and chain
people based on lies and libels,

525
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,850
you can be held individually liable and
you're an anonymity of your account will

526
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:46,780
not protect you from legal responsibility.

527
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,340
It's so interesting because I'm hearing
you on all of this and then there is

528
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,174
this other,
this,

529
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,950
there's the absolute is part of me on
speech that even though I know we need

530
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,360
these protections more than ever,

531
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,340
there's just this little
piece of me that's like, ah,

532
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,810
I don't want everything to get
caught up in legal ease. And that,

533
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,610
and I guess that ultimately is the balance
that guys like you have to deal with

534
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,120
every day.
Yeah,

535
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,601
absolutely.

536
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:11,010
It was the pitch that we made to
senator Holly was don't treat these as

537
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,570
utilities and start to regulate them.

538
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,810
I understand why people are calling
for that because what they're seeing is

539
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:19,020
monopoly power. The interesting
thing is in the first amendment,

540
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:21,480
including in California, uh, and to,

541
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,450
it used to be the law and it
still is the law in some places,

542
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,650
which is if you have the effect of a
corporate monopoly on the public square,

543
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,770
you are then considered a state
actor for first amendment purposes.

544
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,700
This was established way back because
you had company towns who are like, well,

545
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:38,460
how do we suppress this union movement?
Well,

546
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:39,810
why don't we just own the whole town?

547
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,990
We only share if we own the copy on
the public square. Now we'll band.

548
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,000
Now we'll ban circulating. Now
we'll band organized. Okay.

549
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,670
By that definition, you would argue
the social media companies are

550
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,650
absolutely okay.

551
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,840
It's called the [inaudible] doctrine
here in the state of California,

552
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,190
which applies to private malls.

553
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,030
Private moles can't ban you
from circulating certain
things in the public spaces

554
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,560
of those private malls.
Well,

555
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,030
is there any more monopolized public
square than big tech media than Twitter?

556
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,540
Then Facebook, then youtube
and Google, they own,

557
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:12,250
they own 85 to 95% of the public square
and all corporations are creations of

558
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,040
the state and they get certain
protections for that because they have a

559
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:15,874
corporate charter.

560
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,240
They're given certain immunities from
individual liability for participating in

561
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,310
that company. Well, in exchange for that,

562
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:24,430
once they get to the place where
they monopolize the public square,

563
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:27,220
those two things exist,
both of monopoly and the public square,

564
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:32,080
which is usually over 75 80% control
of a market space. When they have that,

565
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,340
and when it's the public square,

566
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,130
I think they should be held to the same
first amendment standards as everyone

567
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:39,340
else because otherwise we create this
huge loophole in the first amendment to

568
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,830
privatized control of the public square.

569
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,970
So, uh, Eric Weinstein, who I'm
guessing you're familiar with,

570
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:47,930
I had a couple of discussions with him
about this and one of the ideas that he's

571
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:52,100
put forward, and my libertarian
side doesn't really like this but,

572
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:54,980
but I see some value in it
is that because we don't,

573
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,130
we don't have public spaces
online. Correct. So it makes
everything, so in effect,

574
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,680
everything's private.
There's nothing public.

575
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,120
So the government has
nothing to do with anything.

576
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,620
But maybe this would be an actual good
use of the government if there were

577
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,550
platforms that were government platforms
that the only rule basically was,

578
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:13,640
you can't break the laws of the United
States so that people could get their

579
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,460
information out there, but you, but if
you break the laws of the United States,

580
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,240
you're in trouble.

581
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,080
Then the private companies
could do whatever the hell
they wanted and we'd have

582
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:24,770
no reason to. We'd have no ability
to stop them. But in effect,

583
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,610
because everything is private,
there's nothing public anymore.

584
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,300
Right, exactly. And so my view is
that once you become a monopoly,

585
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,900
and particularly when you become a
monopoly based on federal congressional

586
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:40,400
immunity, then you have different
obligations than any other private actor.

587
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,970
So that's one argument. One argument is
if you become, if you become a month,

588
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,730
if you choose to have a monopoly in the,
in the public square space,

589
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,510
you're going to have the same first
amendment rules as any government actors.

590
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,463
That's one option.

591
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,460
Another option is just to condition their
continued immunity on First Amendment

592
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,950
inclusion. Those are the arguments
that I've made to the Twitter lawyers.

593
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:01,490
In the Johnson case it was like, look,
you guys don't have to reinvent the wheel.

594
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,360
Like well they said they were worried
about stalking and harassing and it was

595
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:07,580
like very simple. Just take all the
first amendment rules that already exist,

596
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,910
incorporate them within your
terms of service and then you'll,

597
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:13,760
you'll eliminate 90% of
your concerns and questions

598
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,250
and you won't have to deal with
a lot of the nonsense, right?

599
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,720
Like right now their rules would be
considered void for vagueness if they were

600
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:23,260
staying here because you have rules
that are subject to individual women

601
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:23,680
discretion

602
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,360
and they're intentionally
written that way. Right.

603
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:29,330
So did you catch any of Tim Pool and uh,
uh,

604
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,580
Joe Rogan with Jack?

605
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,410
Exactly. Yeah. I mean he detailed this
instance after instance after instance.

606
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,310
I mean the way they decided to replatform
Alex Jones was highly subjective,

607
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,880
very interpretive. And I've
seen far worse, I mean for
example, the Covington case,

608
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,100
you had a prominent Hollywood figure show,

609
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,890
an image of saying the saying the
Covington kids should have to go through a

610
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:52,270
shredder and be killed. You had as lawn
calling from the be punched in the face.

611
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,500
Nothing was done about that. And yet, uh,

612
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,630
Alex Jones posts something that's
just a funny video and they're like,

613
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,630
oh my goodness, we have to
get rid of Alex Jones. Okay.

614
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,490
So I want to spend a whole
bunch of time on cuddling him.

615
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,150
Cause I think actually that was the
moment that this shifted and maybe at a

616
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,490
legal sense it crystallized
in my mind a little bit more.

617
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:12,490
That's actually when I reached out to you.
Sure. Cause I saw you just going for a,

618
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,340
going for it. And I thought, okay, this
is a conversation we ever had. But let's,

619
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,770
let's talk about John's for a
minute. So Jones, so you've,

620
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,850
you've done some defense work with Jones
representing Alex Jones and info wars

621
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,210
and now his outside general
counsel on all these legal matters.

622
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,460
So you represent him across the
board on all of these things.

623
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:32,260
So I guess my first question is what's
it like when Alex Jones knocks on your

624
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:35,920
door or calls you up? Yeah, he's a very
animated guy. Very nice guy. Very Open,

625
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,410
very sincere.
What was fascinating is from the get go,

626
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:42,400
he was saying 90% of what they're
saying about me isn't, isn't the case.

627
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:45,820
He's like, I would defend us on for on
free speech and free press grounds anyway.

628
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,740
But what they're actually saying,
I said,

629
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:49,690
I didn't say I never
attack these families.

630
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,720
I never went after these family never
told people to go to the families' homes,

631
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,990
none of that. So this is that stuff
specifically is about the Sandy Hook,

632
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,970
Sandy Hook case. And so that
they're either, they took a,

633
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:02,080
a media matters video and assume that's
what I said and it wasn't really,

634
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,590
they took most of that out of context and
didn't put in that I had corrected the

635
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:09,580
record long time ago. Um, and so part
of it was, you know, very nice guy,

636
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:13,330
actually very friendly guy,
very accessible guy. Uh,
even more so than snipes.

637
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,300
He gets mobbed when he goes out in public
with people hunting selfies and that

638
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:17,610
sort of thing.
Um,

639
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,580
and he doesn't act like the Jaguar did
with a lady very nice and sociable and

640
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:24,070
friendly. Um, so the runs that, you know,

641
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,780
nice small business enterprise access
TV to talk radio to Internet and he's

642
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,340
intended to be the poster boy of
their d platforming campaigns. They,

643
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,770
they at when I told the press is this
case really isn't about Alex Jones.

644
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,890
It's about the ability of the
independent press to operate. Uh,

645
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,100
we'll law fair be discriminately are
desperately used against ordinary

646
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,730
individuals in the same
way that d platforming is
happening already in the big

647
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:49,540
tech space. And so are we going to protect
the little guy or not? And Alex Jones,

648
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,830
they figured would be the convenience.

649
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,690
They would sort of
create a parody of them,

650
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,990
a caricature of them that they could
get the public to believe, make them,

651
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,040
make the audience feel bad if they
watch him the a May feel guilty to be

652
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,390
associated or attached with them.

653
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,690
And as soon as my representation
was announced and another lawyer,

654
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,600
norm Pattis big old school civil
rights lawyer in Connecticut,

655
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,910
I think he still has a pony tail.
I mean he's old school.

656
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,180
He had friends and family members that
are connected to what happened at Sandy

657
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,450
Hook. So he, uh, immediately, you know,
wanting to be involved in the case.

658
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,850
As soon as he was Huffington
post writes a hit piece on,

659
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,030
they don't talk about a civil rights
legacy. They don't talk about any of that.

660
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:22,864
It's tired.

661
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,200
The whole thing is intended to smear him
and to sending a message that if you're

662
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,150
a lawyer and you dare to fend Alex Jones,

663
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,820
we're going to try to destroy your
reputation in the public space.

664
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,940
And that's exactly the problem that
needs to be fixed and remedied.

665
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,970
So related to Jones specifically,

666
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:40,250
I mean one of the things that I thought
was was most incredible, I forget

667
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,940
the exact order of it, but basically
within 48 hours all the platforms,

668
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:46,700
so came down. Yes. And
it's like, okay, is that,

669
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,420
is that that you guys truly your calling
each other and coordinating it or is it

670
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,220
that you're all sort of cowards,

671
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,600
you somebody breaks the ice and now you're
just followers and I don't know that

672
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,910
it matters either way. Right? It
probably doesn't matter either way,

673
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,380
but what I thought was okay,

674
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,340
it doesn't even matter what he has
said short of breaking in American law,

675
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,000
in my opinion,
the real issue here is that

676
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,530
if he can't be on there,
then

677
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,290
why is Farah can on there? I'm not
even, I'm not making a comp comparison.

678
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,310
Direct comparison to them. Why is Hamas
on there? We could do a zillion other

679
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,190
things. You know, parity
is obvious and evident.

680
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,160
There are people who have said far
worse things that just happen to have a

681
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,350
different ideological
intellectual perspective.

682
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,250
Even if you took all the accusations
against him at face value in 90% of them

683
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:33,430
are not true. The what and that's
your typical smear campaign.

684
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,920
The conservative or the person
on the right or the person,

685
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:39,810
some on the independent antiwar left
will often be attacked and smeared.

686
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,060
90% of what's said about them is not true,
but even if it was true,

687
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,780
what the other side has said is usually
far worse and far more egregious and far

688
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:50,140
more excessive. And it's the obvious
disparate treatment they're using their,

689
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,190
they're concentrated power to uh,

690
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,940
any including their law fair power to
effectively wipe out the little guy so

691
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:00,240
that only the big guys
voices heard and don't me.

692
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,800
It's about the audience because
Alex Jones is still going to talk.

693
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,180
It's just candy audience here.

694
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,600
So it's about their right to choose their
right to choose what news they want to

695
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:11,200
look at, what views they want to have,
what, how they filter information.

696
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,010
I always say like,

697
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,010
like I don't represent people that are
accused of racism or the rest people that

698
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,990
are actual races. Not everybody
these days, everybody,

699
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,860
well being accused and being an actuary,

700
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,870
but people who are
really involved in some,

701
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,580
like I generally avoid
representation of them. Um, the uh,

702
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,820
because I just don't want to be affiliated
it because that is an old personal

703
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:30,730
issue. But if you look at what
those people, I've always said,

704
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,150
let those people debate because if you
watch Richard Spencer debate somebody

705
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,580
else, 99% of the time, the Nice, calm,

706
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,700
reasonable person is not going
to say Richard Spencer was right.

707
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,710
So always expose ideas to more ideas,
more sunshine because let the ideas get,

708
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:48,070
let trust the audience.
That's really what they're all saying.

709
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,450
All what big tech is doing,

710
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,350
what these big lawsuits are doing against
the little guys is intended to say we

711
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:55,480
don't trust the audience
to make up their own mind.

712
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,880
We don't trust the audience to
make up their own decisions.

713
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,590
We have to control what you think.

714
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,410
We have to control what you do because
you might choose something that we don't

715
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:05,410
want you to do. If you actually have
freedom of choice, freedom of thought,

716
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:06,244
freedom of expression.

717
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,750
Do you think lawsuits are the
answer to stop some of this stuff?

718
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:15,751
I'm also realizing right now that our
runway to fix this is becoming perilously

719
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:19,450
short. Like we're getting to
the abyss pretty damn quick.

720
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,350
The 2020 election is right around the
corner and that seems to me to be what

721
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:24,600
this is all ramping up to.

722
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,100
Absolutely. The Covington case was
such a glaring example of that.

723
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,790
So I was on vacation in Mexico and so
let's just go all in on Covington right

724
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:32,330
now.
Yeah,

725
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,820
so it was a little town north of port
of are out there was just hanging out,

726
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:35,181
just you know,

727
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:39,650
going through Twitter and I had four son
of a bitch try on Twitter, on vacation.

728
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,470
Exactly does that. Let's see what
happens. And so I see Maggie Habermann,

729
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,480
the premiere reporter for the premiere
news publication in the country covering

730
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,550
American politics. New
York Times. Yeah, exactly.

731
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Basically calling for the expulsion of
a bunch of kids that she's never met,

732
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,160
that she doesn't know based
on an event she didn't see.

733
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,660
And I found that so shocking. I was like,
we're crossing a whole new line now.

734
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,690
If we're going to go, it's one thing to
go after what somebody said 10 years ago.

735
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,140
That's problematic on its own terms.
We'll get to that in a little bit too.

736
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,330
Exactly. That's what we have
statutes of limitations for,

737
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,300
but the a is that you're not going to be
held responsible for what she did when

738
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:19,260
you're Tan, but the, or when you're
20, when you're 40. But the here,

739
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:23,430
these kids were who were just going up
to DC to be part of the pro life march.

740
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,980
Uh, and usually the pro life march at five
at family participate in that. They're,

741
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,060
they're just having fun.
You know, they're not mean.

742
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,470
They're not out there harassing people.

743
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,950
They're just expressing what they
believe. A, these kids are having fun.

744
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,580
Probably the first time ever to Washington
DC there by the Lincoln memorial was

745
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:41,880
beautiful memorial and all of a sudden
they start getting harassed out of the

746
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:45,600
blue and they have likely never met
the black Hebrew Israelites, right?

747
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,760
Some of us that have
no hoods coming every,

748
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,320
I lived in New York City for many years
by these guys. Many times. Every insult,

749
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,570
known demand. It's like really?
They're almost like an insult comic.

750
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,610
If the routine is so extreme,

751
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,340
it's like they find something going next
to the next thing the next day or like

752
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,860
bad don Rickles all. Exactly,
exactly the worst version, right?

753
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,940
It's all you combined Farah
Khan with Don Rowe, right? So,

754
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,720
but these kids have no ideas and they
have an African American friend that's

755
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,710
there with them and the he's being
attacked and so they start defending him.

756
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,720
They started attacking, making various
anti gay slurs there. They question,

757
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,220
they respond back to that in defense
of people who are gay. So I was like,

758
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,560
these are in that mean kids.

759
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,510
These are kids trying to
handle a shocking environment.

760
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,590
They decided to go internal and start,
okay, let's not deal with these guys.

761
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,700
Let's do our school tears. One of their
school cheers as the old Haiku is a,

762
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:36,820
as the Haiku dance, which is the Great
New Zealand rugby team, all black eye,

763
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,300
in fact, two weeks before it's shown
it to my son, because I was like,

764
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,910
look at how awesome. It's awesome.
It's all over youtube by the way.

765
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,670
Anyone can watch it.
And absolutely. It's a,

766
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:46,000
when I first saw it in the
movie with Matt Damon, Yeah.

767
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,590
That's the greatest sports dance I've
ever seen. So the, in fact before,

768
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:51,870
if I want to get inspired by something,
I'll just put it on and go get ready.

769
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah. So the, so they
do that as part of it.

770
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:56,720
That's why when the kid's tearing his
clothes off and it's right after that,

771
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:57,554
it's happening,

772
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
then all of a sudden the native American
comes up with some friends and he's

773
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,910
doing the drums. So two
thirds of the kids think, oh,

774
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,610
he's joining in because we just did
the Iq thing. Oh, this is great.

775
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,070
And what do they know?
The most popular, uh,

776
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:12,600
native American sports thing they know
is the, is the Tomahawk Chop from, uh,

777
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,830
from the Florida state, from Kansas
City chiefs and Glendean Atlanta Braves,

778
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,620
all the places where they're familiar
and there, you know, right on the,

779
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,930
on the border of the Kentucky,
Ohio border.

780
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,050
So the kind of programs they'd be
familiar with, that's what they see.

781
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,080
Not Nobody's mocking him, nobody's
chanting, build the wall out of.

782
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,550
Nobody's blocking him, nobody's
surrounding him. And then
at one point they start,

783
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,390
some of the kids start to figure
out, okay, something's odd.

784
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,520
Because some of the people behind
him are saying, go back to Europe.

785
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,950
And it's like, Whoa, where
did that come from? Uh,

786
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,200
and then they realize something's
weird and then they just leave.

787
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,210
And then as they're on their bus home,

788
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,990
all of a sudden their lives are being
upended and they're not being upended by

789
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,400
just some random body counts.

790
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:51,790
Who started their being offended by
Kathy Griffin who calling for them to be

791
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:55,390
doxed. They're offended by Maggie
Haberman calling for them to be expelled.

792
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,270
They're ended by Matthew Dowd,
who's on ABC,

793
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:02,620
who is a prominent Catholic on ABC saying
that things need to happen to these

794
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,770
kids. And in Navarro saying bad
things need to happen to these kids,

795
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,180
almost the entire media is,

796
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,210
and then you have Hollywood celebrities
calling for them to be put through the

797
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,160
shredder for them to be
attacked for them to be,

798
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,090
you had a writer who claimed to
be part of Saturday night live,

799
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,300
say she's going to extend sexual favors
for anybody who physically assaulted

800
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:21,520
these people. And I was like,
these are probably the kids.

801
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,620
These are, by the way, these are
blue checked verified people.

802
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:25,454
These are all of them.

803
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,350
Give the people the Twitter says
you should pay attention to that.

804
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:32,280
We've verified that. We validated that.
We've authenticated that we've authorized.

805
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,870
And uh, in Twitter, social media does
almost nothing about this. In fact,

806
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:40,800
they run with the fake news story and
these kids lives are almost over in five

807
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:45,720
seconds based on a misleading
video. Um, and so I saw it and I,

808
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,210
when I first saw the video, I was like,
oh, that's going to be fake news story.

809
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Just cause you know, DC politics, you
know, you know lefty protest culture,

810
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:51,661
you know,

811
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:56,310
the chances that a bunch of Catholic
kids came up and found a lefty to harass

812
00:39:56,311 --> 00:40:00,570
isn't that real high and Washington DC
and say that happened in a small town in

813
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:05,100
Alabama. Okay, maybe uh, but then I was
like, this story doesn't make sense.

814
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,590
And so I was like, okay,
that will probably blow over.

815
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,140
And that was well as getting on
a plane to go to boost areas.

816
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,330
Then I get to the and see
these things and I'm like,

817
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,860
they're going to destroy
these kids' lives.

818
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,170
And I realize if they
think if they can do this,

819
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:18,420
they can do anything to anyone at anytime,
anywhere.

820
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,380
And that's exactly.

821
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:22,890
So then you started tweeting about it
alongside a couple of other people and I

822
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:25,860
thought a couple of other people in the
legal world and I thought, all right,

823
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:29,580
I've got to talk to this guy because if,
if this one doesn't get corrected,

824
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,030
which fortunately thanks to you and it's
ongoing, you and several other people,

825
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,360
it is getting corrected. But I thought
if this one doesn't get corrected,

826
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:41,310
if we let them demolish high
school students, we're done.

827
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,340
We are done.
So can you catch us up on sort of where,

828
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,174
where this is all at [inaudible]

829
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,370
now. So what I did initially is I first
just put out a tweet and said if anybody

830
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,830
wants to sue Maggie Haberman
now represent it for free.

831
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,290
And I was just agitated
and it was just ticked off.

832
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,280
And I didn't tune into Twitter until
like two days later when I came back and

833
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:59,980
all of a sudden it blown up and I'm
getting all these inquiries and I'm like,

834
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:02,290
okay. I realized that this was
becoming very high profile.

835
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,760
And so I go on Fox and my goal is to
get everybody to start to retract,

836
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,200
start to back up, start to retell the
different story. And unfortunately,

837
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,960
almost all the institutional
media starts to backtrack fast.

838
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,790
So to be clear, you did not want
to go the legal route. Actually,

839
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:20,150
you are giving everybody, man, I saw you
do this. You gave them the chance guys,

840
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,540
just delete the tweets.
Did you even ask them to issue apologies.

841
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:23,990
I don't even know.

842
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,200
Well that's about all I said was I said
that has got 48 hours to do one of three

843
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,160
things.
Either correct or delete or apologize.

844
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,700
Just do something to correct the
record and let me to her credit,

845
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,780
Congresswoman Omar,
who he,

846
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,170
he has no problem saying anything
under God's green earth. Uh, she did,

847
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,070
she did it within an hour,

848
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,290
but she only did it because
roll call covered my story.

849
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,380
So his role called covered my story.
He's like, oh, maybe I can get sued.

850
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,420
And W you know, took it down. By the way,

851
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,750
right before that she had sent out a tweet
linking them to white supremacist and

852
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,790
a whole bunch of others.
That whole bunch of false information.

853
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,590
She labeled them in a whole new,
unique ways.

854
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,140
They'll leave it to her to figure
out a way to do that. The, uh,

855
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,790
this is a member of Congress,

856
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,300
but thinking of Senator Warren is
running for the presidency of the United

857
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,540
States,

858
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,570
repeating false statements about these
kids because she's native Americans. Yeah.

859
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,810
Yes, yes, exactly. She has to
stand up for her truck. The level,

860
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:10,970
like they portrayed him as a
native American elder. Well,

861
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:13,660
I clerked for native American tribes. I
worked for one of these old school lefty,

862
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,670
one of the best trial lawyers in the
country, and I was like, hey. I was like,

863
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,590
I don't think he's an elder
of that particular tribe.

864
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,830
Then I realized they were just confusing
the terms because he's elderly.

865
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,690
They were going to call him an elder.
I was like,

866
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:27,440
that's an insult to all the most native
American elders are very carefully

867
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,100
selected. They take their job very
seriously. In fact, their court system,

868
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,380
if we had an ideal court
system in the world,

869
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,970
it would be the native
American elder system.

870
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,830
I'd be all for it because there's 12,

871
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,740
12 people sit around and you come and you
tell them your dispute and they try to

872
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:43,370
find a remedy that will satisfy everybody
and they try not to be too punitive.

873
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,600
They try not to be too uh, too
involved. They just try to say, okay,

874
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,980
what's caused this problem? How can
we address the cause of it? And,

875
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,850
and they're focused on reconciliation.

876
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,460
How can we bring people together
so it doesn't happen again?

877
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,730
And people don't feel bad at the end
of it. Not Great for your profession,

878
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:01,040
but exactly that much better system.
I'd be all for it.

879
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,290
I mean I'm happy happily for fifth,

880
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,810
my law degree to see
that system put in place.

881
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,590
Have the 12 members of your community
get to decide these kinds of disputes and

882
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:12,920
find ways to put people back together
and protect all the things that matter to

883
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:15,710
us rather than deepening the division
and the bitterness that exists.

884
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,600
And the legal system often creates that.

885
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:22,410
People often leave it even when they
win unsatisfied. And so the uh, so,

886
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,870
but so they put this guy in that context,
there's like,

887
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:28,160
he wasn't a Vietnam war veteran.
The was really not really being accurate.

888
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,260
They're trying to script a narrative,
trying to tell a story,

889
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,120
but doing it to these kids and include
the message was if we can destroy them,

890
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,050
we can destroy you.

891
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,180
It was an ultimate exemplar mechanism
of media narrative structure and that's

892
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:45,470
why I volunteer to help them out. And so
now represent 14 families in Covington.

893
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,240
Oh, about 90% of the people I went
on Fox and said 48 hours notice,

894
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,450
just clean it up and we'll be done.
And even after that,

895
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:55,910
I've given people additional opportunities
and additional opportunities.

896
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,690
Please take it down. Please correct that
none of the family members want to sue.

897
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:02,180
They don't want to deal with the
nightmares of the legal system.

898
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,850
They don't have to go through
all that hassle hurdle. Um,

899
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,970
but they want the record corrected and
they don't want to happen to anyone else.

900
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,930
That's it. And so I was like, let's
set a record. Let's set a pattern.

901
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,000
Let's set a precedent year that this
can get corrected and remedy that.

902
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,710
You can't do this to these kids.

903
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:18,230
You can't do this to these people
that you do have standards.

904
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:19,670
You have to be bound by those standards.

905
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,250
You have to be governed by those
standards and you have to act according to

906
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:25,610
those standards. For those that
refuse to do anything about it,

907
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,623
they're going to be sued.

908
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,830
So some of them still left the tweets
up or didn't apologize. Kathy Griffin,

909
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,610
Matthew Dowd, oddly enough, Maggie
Haberman, uh, Senator Warren, uh,

910
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,980
congresswoman Holland,
uh,

911
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,710
those are the five highest profile
examples of people who refuse to correct.

912
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,440
When you see a mob descent,
it's a little,

913
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,810
it's a little hard to figure
out how coordinated it is,
whether it's group thing.

914
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,470
Is this coming from the top?

915
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:53,710
Is this organic as much as you've
had to deal with these things,

916
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:56,860
and especially since you dealt with the
most recent one that's still unfolding

917
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:00,400
right now, what's your take? Is it,
is it a little bit of everything?

918
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,230
It's two different things.
One is there,

919
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:04,960
they've started to greenlight mob culture.

920
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,560
That's what it was scary here because
this started out with a bot account who

921
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,920
was spreading it through sort of liberal
ideological culture who is trying to

922
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:12,910
create an online model.

923
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,450
But the reality is that online mob
would have never reached critical mass,

924
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,900
at least as it related to these kids
without the blue check mark crowd saying,

925
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,500
Yay, Yay, Yay. And
that's the problem there.

926
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,160
The green light for online mob behavior
and that's why they have to be stopped

927
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,820
and they have to correct their actions
or they have to be remedied in court

928
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,530
because they are the ones
that are permitting it and
expanding it. And for them,

929
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,770
I don't know how often it's deliberate
and how often to cultural mindset,

930
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,470
I used to call it cotton ball culture.
So in the south,

931
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,950
people used to go to the cotton ball.

932
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,750
They're part of the privileged classes
when they're 16 and 17 and they're sort

933
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:50,440
of in co incorporated and
acculturated to a certain mindset.

934
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,050
So it's not that they all
get together and conspire,

935
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,830
but that they have a certain
point of view that's,

936
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,030
that's been created by
the sh culture they share.

937
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,860
And I think there's some of them online
mob culture that's been festering over

938
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:05,410
the past half decade,
decade.

939
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:09,970
And the worst part of it is that continued
to be green light by institutional

940
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,580
people or people with big
platforms and big power.

941
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,530
Are you shocked also how the racial
element has become so blatant?

942
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:22,531
So it was like these kids are white so
they have punchable faces or excusing the

943
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:27,580
black Israelites to quizzes
because they're black.

944
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:29,980
So they can call these kids
faggots and that's okay.

945
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,110
Even though you're supposed
to defend gay people.

946
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,160
But I guess if it's black people,

947
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:35,250
you know they create this oppression
Olympics intersectional too. Yeah.

948
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,680
This intersection alluded. See,
so are you just shocked how,

949
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,980
how solidified that is in
so many people's brains

950
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,270
for like two different reasons. One,
whenever I see people do it or raise it,

951
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,070
my instinctual view is I was like,

952
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,930
well what does that person
actually done for civil rights?

953
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,910
So like when I've been attacked him like,
well,

954
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:52,530
I've done civil rights for 20 years,

955
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,760
I've done very difficult cases in very
difficult places advocating for civil

956
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:57,630
rights.
So I was like,

957
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:02,130
is this person really out there trying
to help protect people or is it somebody

958
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:02,910
who wants to,
uh,

959
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,230
social brownie point and social prestige
point for being on the right political

960
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:09,940
side? Um, and that's 95% of it.

961
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,380
These are people that aren't actually
doing anything to improve the wellbeing of

962
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:15,120
African Americans and
Latinos in this country.

963
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,160
The second part of it is it's
become social prestige to,

964
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,870
uh, out people that are up that ever
particular disfavored political class.

965
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,990
And it happens to be there right now or
disfavored favorite political classes

966
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,800
are white or men are people of
certain sort of parts of the country,

967
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,700
certain political orientation kids
in mega hats. Exactly. I was like,

968
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,410
that's the same sort of bigotry.

969
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,170
The bigotry doesn't know
color bigotry as bigotry.

970
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:46,330
And this has just racial bigotry disguised
as a, as tried to protect people.

971
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,360
They're not out to protect
people throughout the hurt
and harm people and they

972
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,880
just want to feel morally
justified when they do it.

973
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,410
So when you now have to have to move
forward on this lawsuit that you're,

974
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,990
you're saying you're going into
not really cause you want to,

975
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:00,400
you're giving these
people a chance to go out.

976
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,360
How does this even work logistically
when you're going after people that have

977
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,180
nothing to do with each other other than
they all did it on the same platform.

978
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,270
So we're going to bring in as a class
claim so all the plaintiffs will be

979
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:10,811
combined.

980
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:15,811
So all 14 kids will be one group of
plaintiffs and all the defendants will be

981
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,560
combined.
So the uh,

982
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,010
so you can combine the defendants
together when there's a common nucleus of

983
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,620
facts and they're are
behaving in a coordinated way,

984
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,330
even if it doesn't rise to the level of,
say,

985
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:27,820
illegal conspiracy or aiding and abetting,

986
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,470
which it may in some of these instances,

987
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,700
the effect of it is you can add them
together because for judicial economy

988
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:34,390
purposes,

989
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,750
they're all part of the same event and
it's easier for one judge to preside over

990
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:41,950
all the cases combined. Then the case is
differently. Uh, and so it's interesting.

991
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:46,630
Some of the left media client use use
of these kinds of defamation claims has

992
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,170
done used this exact procedure and it's
time to use the exact procedure back the

993
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:50,870
other way.

994
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,090
You gotta be careful what you wish for.
Exactly.

995
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,690
So let's talk a little bit about what's
going on with Tucker Carlson right now.

996
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,840
Now Tucker has been on this show.
I go on his show every couple of weeks.

997
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,430
I find them to be a decent guy.

998
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:05,570
We have political disagreements that we
have expressed to each other publicly

999
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,880
before,
but I think he's on the right side,

1000
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:11,480
especially when it comes to the free
speech stuff. Now media matters,

1001
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,520
which you mentioned already there,
they're going after him.

1002
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:18,260
They're finding an old audio clips on
a shock jock, a Bubba, what's his name?

1003
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:21,080
Bubba. Bubba Gump. Bubba Bubba.

1004
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,970
Is there any, I know it's got bubble
and the bubble. That's something. Yeah,

1005
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,440
yeah, yeah. Whatever it is.
In effect. Howard Stern,

1006
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,990
like figure exactly where I was thinking.

1007
00:49:29,991 --> 00:49:33,200
I tweeted something the other day that
I wish Howard stern was maybe a little

1008
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:35,630
more engaged these days. Ndas.
I don't begrudge him. He's,

1009
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,050
he's lived through a lot and he's had to,

1010
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,770
he's been a great fighter on our
side of the free speech thing,

1011
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,840
but it's like if he was to take the 30
years of stuff that politicians, actors,

1012
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:47,030
Comedians, authors, musicians,

1013
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,380
everybody has said the crazy sexual
acts that had been done in that.

1014
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:55,820
So you all those things and said, you
know what, this is all part of life,

1015
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,350
right? All say things we
get in atmospheres where you
joke differently this way,

1016
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:03,020
then you would that way,
all of these things,

1017
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:07,250
I would love to help have him
aiding us right now in this fight.

1018
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,860
So that's just one piece of this.
But putting that aside,

1019
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,230
media matters is now digging into old
things of, of Tucker's. And you know,

1020
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:16,820
apparently he said Faggot.

1021
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,100
There were a couple of other things and
they're trying to make it sound like

1022
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:22,790
he's racist and he's for abusing
kids and all of these things.

1023
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:27,950
And I wonder what his legal
recourses now he's not apologizing.

1024
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,650
That's one thing which I think
that's pretty good for the,

1025
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,640
if you're going to stand against the
mob, don't apologize, but also if there,

1026
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,710
because their goal is
just to destroy this man.

1027
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:39,230
Their goal is in some sort
of legal justice, right?

1028
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,390
Their goal is their goal
isn't to help anyone, right.

1029
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,900
Unless there's doing something
that I can't figure out.

1030
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,780
Their goal is to destroy a man
and if you could destroy a man,

1031
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:51,560
you can destroy an idea and you can get
all sorts of other people to shut up so

1032
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,810
nicely.
What the hell do we do?

1033
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:59,000
It's very much a censorship shaming
campaign designed to marginalize his

1034
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,450
audience and marginalize him from having
access to his audience and to be an

1035
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,760
example to future people
so that they won't, Hey,

1036
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,410
you better not come after big tech,

1037
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,950
which is really what distinguishes Tucker
from anyone else on Fox or anyone else

1038
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,690
in the political conservative space.

1039
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,370
He's probably the lead high profile
person taking on big tech in this country.

1040
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,810
One of the leading guys saying,

1041
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,720
I think you're telling me I should have
you on retainer. Is that where exactly?

1042
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,960
Well, I mean that's what's happening.
It's a systematic, it's institutional.

1043
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:25,760
It's in,
it's deliberate and it's obvious,

1044
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,390
so like I first got it familiar with
this aspect of it in the context of

1045
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:33,260
representing Alex Jones because I was
trying to figure out why do people think

1046
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:36,440
he said a bunch of stuff that he
actually didn't say or did things that he

1047
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:40,340
actually didn't do or think 90% of what
he said was this as opposed to that and

1048
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:43,310
then found out watching Joe Rogan that
it was actually a media matters thing

1049
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,940
that Joe Rogan himself
walked. He's like, oh no.

1050
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:47,900
I saw this media matters thing was like,
who would trust media matters?

1051
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,410
It's like they, they're politically
motivated, they're partisan oriented.

1052
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,070
They take various forms of like people
complain about secret corporate cash and

1053
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,250
dark money. Immediate matters has tons
of secret corporate cash and dark.

1054
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,840
Is that, is that a big problem right here
that the nonprofits now are probably,

1055
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:04,760
I don't know all the laws
related to nonprofits,

1056
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,290
but they're probably in almost every
political case stepping beyond their

1057
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:09,950
boundaries?

1058
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,000
Did they?
Definitely are,

1059
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:13,910
and then what's happening is they're
becoming clearly their partisan

1060
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:17,570
organizations. So here you have, nobody
would think media matters is nonpartisan.

1061
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm pretty sure they didn't go after

1062
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,670
joy reed on cable news with her whole
thing went down about the anti gay blog

1063
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:22,940
posts.

1064
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,320
Exactly.

1065
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,990
They've defended all kinds of people on
the left who said all far worse things

1066
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,440
and at least our politically ideologically
aligned with the left are supposed to

1067
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:33,410
be in the first instance and this
is the left set of standards.

1068
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:36,860
That's something you say 20 years ago
somehow means you can never have a public

1069
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,230
platform ever again for the
rest of your human existence.

1070
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,380
This is not an American standard.
This is not a conservative standard.

1071
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,120
This has very much a left standard.
The,

1072
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,970
but they don't apply it to their
own people ever at all. I mean,

1073
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:48,990
some of the things Joe Biden
has said over the years, yeah,

1074
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:51,080
he's the leading Democratic
candidate for the presidency.

1075
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:52,930
And then that guy opened
his mouth and crazy stuff.

1076
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,820
Okay,
well half the things that Trump says now,

1077
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:58,360
although he says them sloppily are the
exact same things that Obama said about

1078
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:01,810
immigration and Clinton
said about immigration and
Dianne Feinstein in the rest

1079
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,644
of them.

1080
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,130
So the, it's extraordinary for the, for
this sort of one side of application,

1081
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,640
but clearly Tucker is a target because
Tucker is willing to take on big tech and

1082
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:13,280
the goal is they're testing. When can
we use something in the person's past?

1083
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,970
What's extraordinary about all of this?
What unites all of it,

1084
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,360
whether it's the Covington case or the
Alex Jones case is that you have people

1085
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:20,860
who are unwilling to debate ideas.

1086
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,460
It's all about if you disagree with them
then they're going to target you as an

1087
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:27,180
individual. They're going to make
your life difficult as an individual.

1088
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,450
They're going to harass you as an
individual stock. You as an individual.

1089
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,980
You've already been to
Tucker's house by the way.

1090
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,730
Precisely when his wife was there and
had no clue what was going on and they're

1091
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:36,780
banging on the door.

1092
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,420
And that was a reason why Fox went off
Twitter for an extended time period.

1093
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,470
Cause Twitter would do
nothing about it. I mean, the,

1094
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,770
the extraordinary
discrepancy in disparity,

1095
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:47,730
everybody can witness and everybody and
people like Tim pools on the left can

1096
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,170
say this is problematic.

1097
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:53,670
This is kind of obvious what you guys are
doing and recognize how problematic it

1098
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,160
is because they're not going to
stop there. It's like Alex Jones,

1099
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,600
they're not going to stop with Alex Jones.

1100
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,840
They're going to use it as an example to
try to go after everyone else to scare

1101
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,990
and intimidate everyone else. You
better not be in the independent press.

1102
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,340
You'd better not be in
the independent speech.

1103
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,850
You better not be sharing a dissonant
narrative or we're going to be able to

1104
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:13,180
demonetize you d platform
you debate you, uh, or,

1105
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:15,390
or defame you routinely and
regularly and get away with.

1106
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,470
And that's why we need equalize the
playing field. And, but for Tucker's case,

1107
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,300
what he could do,
uh,

1108
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,550
is he could potentially go after
media matters for misrepresenting.

1109
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:26,430
You're mischaracterizing
the set of events.

1110
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,180
They have a habit of putting out a video
that decontextualizes what happened.

1111
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:31,110
They did it to Alex Jones.

1112
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,860
They would take them where he's talking
about this subject put into a minute, uh,

1113
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:36,900
where it looks like he's talking
about Sandy Hook. Exactly not,

1114
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,430
he's talking about something else.
And they would say,

1115
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:42,030
these are all the statements. So my,
they've likely done the same thing to him,

1116
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,290
but there's limited remedies.

1117
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,360
I also saw one of, I think it was one
of the directors of media matters.

1118
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:48,520
I actually retweeted it saying,
if you think this is bad,

1119
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:51,790
we've got a lot more or something
to that effect. And I thought this,

1120
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:56,830
they're telling you how evil they are
because they're saying we are releasing

1121
00:54:56,951 --> 00:55:01,000
this information in a calculated way
to destroy a man. We're not just,

1122
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,460
we're not just doing it for public good.

1123
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:05,470
Like we found all this stuff and we're
just going to put it all out there on day

1124
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,240
one because people should
know about his path.

1125
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:12,010
It's like we're going to keep the monster
being fed so that it can keep feeding

1126
00:55:12,011 --> 00:55:12,710
on

1127
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,350
correct and it's why are they so scared
of ideas? If they think Tucker's wrong,

1128
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,460
an ideas debate his ideas,
why attack him?

1129
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,060
Why especially why the tech him on
something he said 20 years ago on a shock

1130
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:23,730
jock show.

1131
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,880
There's also something crazy you could do.
You could actually pick up the remote.

1132
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,960
You're not going to believe this.

1133
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,870
There's a button on that thing that
allows you to scroll up or down.

1134
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:31,680
Have you seen this thing?

1135
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,930
Exactly. I mean if you don't
like what you're hearing,

1136
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,260
you don't have to listen to it. If you
think it's wrong, you should engage in.

1137
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,040
Years ago, Professor Lash, great historian
passed away some years ago. He said,

1138
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:45,000
the reason why we expose our ideas and
debate other people isn't necessarily to

1139
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:45,834
persuade them.

1140
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,380
It's because they're going to expose
ideas that there are weaknesses in our own

1141
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:52,920
argument. And we often research a
topic when somebody says like, oh,

1142
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:53,780
that must be wrong.

1143
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,540
We go and find out about it would become
more informed by engaging in the public

1144
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:00,570
debate process. And that's,
that's good, that's healthy.

1145
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,420
But these are people who fundamentally
don't believe in free thought,

1146
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,850
free expression and free speech.
Fundamentally,

1147
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:07,650
they believe that you should
have the right thought,

1148
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,830
not that you should have free thought,
you should have the right expression,

1149
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,390
not that you should have free expression.

1150
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:16,800
They have combined sort of
the inquisitional Catholic
church with like 1920s

1151
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:19,980
communists and they've integrated
the two in their approach.

1152
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,800
And they're using our legal system and
using our political system and their

1153
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:27,760
superior power in the cultural,
uh, areas of influence,

1154
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:30,010
whether it's Hollywood,
whether it's big media,

1155
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,580
whether it's big tech to suppress and
oppress those people who have different or

1156
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:36,880
dissonant views than them, including
people on parts of the left. So,

1157
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,350
I mean people like temple is being called
a Nazi because he appears on Joe Rogan

1158
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:44,260
and ask a few questions at Twitter.
I mean this is insanity.

1159
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,140
So, uh, that's actually, I was
going to go somewhere else,

1160
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:48,030
but let's jump there for a second.
So like for example,

1161
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:50,160
when I had Tim pool on last week,

1162
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:55,161
there were verified people on Twitter
calling Tim a Nazi and Mia Fascist or me

1163
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:58,980
and Nazi and Tim, a fascist. I, I've
mentioned this before. I've had ah,

1164
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,990
how I grew up around Holocaust survivors.

1165
00:57:00,991 --> 00:57:05,520
I lost family on both my mom
and my dad's side. Now again,

1166
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,210
I'm the free speech guy,
so I don't want to sue these people.

1167
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,200
But is there some legal remedy for this
if I was someone different than I am?

1168
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,430
Correct. Yeah, there
is. Because for example,

1169
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,190
I took a couple of years ago
the Cassandra Fairbank's case,

1170
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:23,880
he gets him a role and one of the I,

1171
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,040
one of the reasons I
took it is I want Sandra

1172
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,840
former lefty, by the way, she's
now all Trump, but former lefty.

1173
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:33,830
I had drinks with her one night. She gave
me her full on lefty, lefty, lefty, lefty.

1174
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,780
Yeah, exactly. Part Puerto Rican. Yeah.
And she was accused by Emma Roller,

1175
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,070
a flashing, a white power gesture.
And this was the universal,

1176
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,930
some others became a white
power. And I was like, what?

1177
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,800
So and so she was on Twitter and
he's like, I've got to stop this.

1178
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,400
Can somebody help me? And I said, I'll,

1179
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:52,780
I'll help for free because I liked the
area of the case and thought needed to

1180
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:57,070
stop this because they're used to being
able to say, I'll call someone a Nazi,

1181
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:00,100
I'll call someone a racist.
And that's not actionable at law.

1182
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,450
And I wanted to change that.

1183
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:05,230
I wanted to say when you make very
specific statements about someone's belief

1184
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:09,250
structure that someone can interpret in
a jury can objectively verify as either

1185
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:13,120
true or false that I think that
should be something you can sue over.

1186
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,170
So I brought the case in DC and we
couldn't meet the actual malice standard,

1187
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,340
but the court said yes, saying someone
is a racist and a particular way,

1188
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,050
like saying it's a white power gesture,

1189
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,040
you can be sued for the United States
for liable in lies and under the

1190
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,800
defamation laws of DC, which are more
restrictive than a lot of other laws.

1191
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,080
So that's established the standards.
It always,

1192
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:34,750
people think I can just say
anything and never get sued.

1193
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:38,140
That's what we're going to make the point
in the Covington case, no you can't.

1194
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,980
If you say things that you know not to
be true that a jury can look at and say,

1195
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,720
I can objectively verify this.

1196
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,080
We the juries make determinations about
whether someone is involved in a hate

1197
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:47,914
crime every day.

1198
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,550
They made determinations whether someone
has racially discriminatory animus or

1199
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,820
motivation every day.
So if they're good,

1200
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,540
if someone's accusing
you of being a racist,

1201
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:59,290
that should be actionable in law because
a jury can make that determination as a

1202
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,370
matter of objective fact,

1203
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,510
and the Fairbank's case establishes
precedent that you can under certain

1204
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:06,640
circumstances get legal remedy for that.

1205
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,090
It will never cease to amaze me that
the free speech crew or the people that

1206
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:15,860
have to do certain things through law
exact such just to maintain free speech,

1207
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:17,660
which aside,
it sounds so counter intuitive,

1208
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:20,960
but it's so fascinating to be so a
couple of times you've mentioned Fox,

1209
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,270
I think there's something
interesting happening here. Now,

1210
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,740
has CNN or Msnbc ever put you on? No.
Have they ever asked you to come on?

1211
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,340
CNN did way back about two years
ago. Okay. So CNN did two years ago.

1212
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:34,580
MSNBC has not,
Fox puts you on right now.

1213
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:38,780
Fox only puts me on and they put me
on with, no, I'd go on live shows.

1214
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:41,360
They don't tell me to say anything.
I can say whatever the hell I want.

1215
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,290
I often bring up liberal Craig while
I'm, while I'm on there. Yep. Uh,

1216
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,380
but it seems also clear to me that partly
what's going on with the Tucker thing

1217
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:51,440
is that they are really going for
Fox there. The plan is, all right,

1218
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:52,310
we'll take out Tucker.

1219
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:55,370
He's sort of the bravest or the
most outspoken or whatever it is.

1220
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,750
But really then we'll make this about
going for foxes licensing and broadcast

1221
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:03,560
abilities and, and everything else. You're
nodding. So I suspect you agree with me,

1222
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,170
but I,

1223
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:08,960
I'm amazed because it's like there's so
much left he media and you never saw the

1224
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:11,090
right trying to destroy
all the left immediate.

1225
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,600
There's basically one fox and it doesn't
mean I love everything they're doing.

1226
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:19,010
I don't, but you need some
counterbalance Dell. Yeah, absolutely.

1227
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,060
If you have the approach of
the inquisitional Catholic
Church or institutional

1228
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,610
communism of a status variety,
then what?

1229
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,410
What drives you crazy as the heresy?
So you don't look at it and say, Geez,

1230
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:35,030
how many fair balanced expressions do we
have on both sides to the acquisitional

1231
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:35,150
Catholic Church?

1232
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,240
There's only the Catholic church
perspective and everybody else needs to be

1233
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:41,870
burned at the stake for the
status Communist. Same dynamic.

1234
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,930
There's one state channel,
there's no alternative state channel,

1235
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:48,140
there's no anti-state channel. So when
you come at it from that perspective,

1236
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,520
what unite, say Alex Jones,
the Covington case and Fox is,

1237
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:56,510
these are three institutions and they
represent different institutions that are

1238
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,870
giving an independent narrative.
So when I was at Yale,

1239
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:03,470
we did a history project that was actually
about why African Americans and poor

1240
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:06,340
whites in the south,
we're often treated or,

1241
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,820
or portrayed and very discriminatory
ways and cultural medium between 1900 to

1242
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:15,590
1970 and what you find is historically
those communities have alternative

1243
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:16,200
narratives.

1244
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,430
There are grandparents and parents tell
stories different than say the civics

1245
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:21,350
book version they learn in
third grade in public school.

1246
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:25,190
And so consequently those groups are often
changed and censored and portrayed in

1247
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:29,480
a negative light so that the broader
public audience wouldn't trust them to

1248
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,360
listen to them or react to them.
So the same thing as here.

1249
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:35,270
Like you look at the Covington kids,
they represent private Catholic education.

1250
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,550
What is private?
Catholic?

1251
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,130
Catholic education is one of the last
institutions of independent thought

1252
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,490
compared to say all the public state
schools and public institutions.

1253
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,970
So it drives him crazy that they
represent this institution that they can't

1254
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:49,920
control their thoughts in mind of right,
because they don't have access to that.

1255
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:50,190
Right.

1256
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,860
And then you even saw in the midst
of all this, I'm sure you saw this,

1257
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:56,880
there was that guy from the New York Times
who said, I want to know your stories.

1258
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,380
Remember, I forget what the Hashtag you
used was, but he wanted to know your,

1259
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,150
you're Catholic.

1260
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,870
It was like Hashtag Catholic schools
stories precisely because let's now New

1261
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,940
York Times, let's go after them
once we're done with this thing.

1262
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:06,774
So let's go around.

1263
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,000
Do the whole Catholic church,

1264
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,110
let's go after the Catholic
schools because we need
people to be afraid to be a

1265
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:15,020
part of those schools, to be ashamed.
If they're connected to those schools,

1266
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,080
parents worry that if their
skills are listed on their kid CV,

1267
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,540
their kids' futures will be impaired
and not have these schools being

1268
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:26,060
independent sources of thought outside
of the sort of cultural liberal, uh, uh,

1269
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,440
hegemonic view.
And the same thing is true.

1270
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:32,190
Like Alex Jones represents sort of an
independent part of the press of Fox News

1271
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,520
represents an institutional part
of the press that's independent,

1272
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,510
that expresses its own perspective. That's
not part of the left majority. I mean,

1273
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:42,990
CNN and Msnbc and ABC and NBC and CBS,

1274
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,740
even when they're using public airwaves
are overwhelmingly on one side.

1275
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,540
Same with PBS,
same with NPR,

1276
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,650
and there's a lot of good value and I
watch all of them at different times or

1277
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:53,610
listened to them at different times,

1278
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,790
but I want the other side
expressed and so why?

1279
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,860
It's this fear of free expression,

1280
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:02,400
this fear of free speech that's
leading to the censorship campaigns,

1281
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:06,390
a shame campaigns, these
targeting campaigns, these
privacy invasion campaigns.

1282
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,360
When I've told people is if you're ever
to the point where you're attacking a

1283
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:13,440
person or trying to shame a person trying
to censor a person trying to invade

1284
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:15,930
their privacy,
then what you're really looking,

1285
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
you're doing as you're looking in
the mirror and telling yourself,

1286
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,940
I've failed on the argument.
I can't persuade on ideas.

1287
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,070
No audience would
actually believe my ideas.

1288
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,540
So it's an admission of failure and
they're really resorting to these extreme

1289
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:31,350
tactics because they're recognizing
they're losing in the public debate.

1290
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,680
Do you think part of it also is
that it's intentional? Not now,

1291
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:37,170
perhaps they're losing in the public
debate. I think that's probably,

1292
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,190
you could debate that either way.

1293
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:41,310
On one hand I'm very enthused about
sort of where we're at in this.

1294
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:45,000
On the other hand it's very scary
too because you see this socialist,

1295
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,000
whatever the hell that is the
horizon. So, but putting that aside,

1296
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,880
do you think part of it is that they're
in doing it intentionally because they

1297
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:54,090
just want to basically uh,

1298
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,890
so chaos all over the place.

1299
01:03:55,891 --> 01:03:59,700
That partly what they need for
whatever their political goals are,

1300
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:04,560
they need this system that has been
pretty freaking spectacular for 200 plus

1301
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:08,790
years to appear chaotic. So they, so
they, what do they do? They soak chaos.

1302
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,481
It's very,

1303
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:12,630
what's amazing is how paralleled is
the 19 20th street violence in Europe.

1304
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,900
So you see like a lot of the communist
tactics that were used back then and the

1305
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:19,800
fascist tactics that were used back
then was in WWE were designed to sow

1306
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:23,410
distrust in the system. So distrusted
the institutions. That's it protected.

1307
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,510
That's it every day.

1308
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,940
Now Aoc doing another thing about how
evil we are in Reagan's evenly capitalism

1309
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,220
capitalism to hate that.

1310
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,690
I think with like the combination you're
talking about where there's these bad

1311
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:36,510
ideas that are spreading and yet
winning in the public debate,

1312
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,720
what unites them is if
both sides get presented,

1313
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,390
most people will take a
humanitarian decision,

1314
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:46,050
will make a good choice based on their
common experience and their comments sets.

1315
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,041
Whereas,

1316
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:50,730
and so that's why this side that wants
to spread their ideas knows they can't

1317
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:54,000
allow that open fair debate to happen
or those institutions to be trusted in

1318
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:56,800
protected and it goes back to it.
If they can d uh,

1319
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,580
if they can get people to
no longer to not listen,

1320
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:00,900
to not hear independent voices,

1321
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:03,480
to be afraid to be a part
of independent institutions,

1322
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:07,050
to feel ashamed if they're connected
to it, to say, Hey, if I'm a lawyer,

1323
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:10,000
I represent this person, I'm going to
be attacked. If I'm, if I'm in the,

1324
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:12,480
in the public arena and I
voiced an independent view,

1325
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:15,300
I'm going to be targeted and harassed
and stalked and then the rest,

1326
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,790
they want people to be
scared and intimidated to
express their ideas because I

1327
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:22,270
think they know that in an in a
non chaotic open debate structure,

1328
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,610
they don't win.
And I think that's what the wrecking,

1329
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:27,130
because otherwise you don't have to
resort to these ridiculous tactics and

1330
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,920
techniques.
If your ideas are great and popular.

1331
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,590
You don't have to use chaotic
techniques. You don't have to, uh,

1332
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:35,080
you don't have to try to censor people.
You don't have to attack people.

1333
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:39,040
You don't have to say when it Tucker say
20 years ago on a, on a shock jock show,

1334
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,821
you can say,
Hey,

1335
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:42,550
I disagree with what he said yesterday
on Fox and I'm willing to debate them.

1336
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,710
And Tucker is one of the
few people who says, Hey,

1337
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:45,840
you can come on the show and we'll debate

1338
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,400
quite literally what his statement said.
Exactly. If you don't like my ideas, let,

1339
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:51,030
let's talk about exactly.
All right.

1340
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,790
So I want to ask you something that
I think will sort of thread, oh,

1341
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,121
you know what,

1342
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,340
I want to ask you one other little tech
thing and then something that I think

1343
01:05:56,341 --> 01:05:59,280
that will kind of bring us full circle
here. So one of the things is, you know,

1344
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:02,490
you see me do this all the time
where I have to publicly shame, uh,

1345
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:03,570
youtube in Thai,

1346
01:06:03,571 --> 01:06:07,080
they're monetizing my video or making
sure people aren't being unsubscribed to

1347
01:06:07,081 --> 01:06:09,920
the rest of it. And then in a certain
amount of people will say, but Dave,

1348
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:12,060
you're a libertarian or whatever,

1349
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,460
you're not allowed to complain because
you don't want the government involved,

1350
01:06:14,461 --> 01:06:16,980
which is so idiotic because of course
I'm using my voice as a citizen.

1351
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:20,400
That's what you're supposed to
do. Okay. Putting that aside, um,

1352
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:26,060
do you think there is some interesting
legal mechanism if it was to be found out

1353
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,340
that they were treating
traffic differently?

1354
01:06:29,341 --> 01:06:31,920
So that's a little bit different
than what we talked about earlier,

1355
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:35,280
was talking about content specifically.
So you're saying this or that,

1356
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,220
but what if they're actually
turning the screws just based on a,

1357
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,190
not something you said,

1358
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:44,820
but they have a general sort of a broad
sense that they don't want certain ideas

1359
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:45,530
getting out there.

1360
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,240
I think there are contractual principals,

1361
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,810
equitable principles and consumer
protection principles that are in play.

1362
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,910
So once you induce someone to participate
in your platform and then you monetize

1363
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,660
their participation, to me, you
have contractual obligations,

1364
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,860
equitable obligations you can't have
on just enrichment. So you say, Hey,

1365
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:05,240
if you participate we,

1366
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:08,240
these are the rules and if as
long as you abide by those rules,

1367
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,490
we will make sure you share
in the profits for example,

1368
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,150
of monetizing your individual video.
And if they don't do that,

1369
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:17,300
if they manipulate the algorithm,
they misrepresent facts,

1370
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:22,010
they induce conduct and then only keep
the profit for themselves or use it for a

1371
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:24,290
politicized purpose.
That's different than what they said.

1372
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,330
Those are all consumer
protection violations,

1373
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,920
equitable law violations and legal
violations sometimes recommend a remedy by

1374
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,750
statutes,
sometimes remedy by common law,

1375
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,210
or there's no reason for
big tech to be above the law

1376
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,660
right there. There might also be some
legal thing related to their own board,

1377
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:40,600
right? I mean, if they're doing
things that are not related,

1378
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:43,100
if they're not doing the most
profitable thing, they're bored me.

1379
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,080
I don't know exactly what it was.
Yeah.

1380
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,580
All of the shareholders can take action.

1381
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:49,510
So there could be a derivative suits by
shareholders. They could go to the board,

1382
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:53,380
but they could also bring derivative legal
claims against the institution saying

1383
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:55,090
they're not promoting the best profit.

1384
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,580
They're creating undue
legal risk and liability.

1385
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,090
They're not behaving in a
matter consistent with their
professional obligations

1386
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,030
and their contractual obligations
to their, their own investors.

1387
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,690
And so they can also bring action.
And in fact, the left I went,

1388
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,840
I told a lot of people is look at what
the left has done between the seventies

1389
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:15,260
in 2000 you'll see a lot of legal roadmaps
for how to go at what they're doing

1390
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:17,590
now. So they were with some
of the, you know, the, uh,

1391
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:20,030
on the apartheid
campaigns in South Africa,

1392
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,470
they targeted different
people using shareholder suits
using shareholder claims,

1393
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:28,340
using shareholder complaints to remedy
that of people who are profiting from the

1394
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,780
apartheid system in South Africa.

1395
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,320
Why can't we do the same thing now
based on the same legal theories,

1396
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,530
same factual predicates as the,
as what's taking place here,

1397
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,680
which is inconsistent with their
obligations and promises to people.

1398
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,580
I guess partly in, this brings
me to the, to the last question,

1399
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:45,400
it's partly about bravery.
You need citizens who were brave enough.

1400
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:49,270
You need lawyers who are brave enough
and they've created a system where

1401
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,070
everyone is afraid.
Because the,

1402
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,370
when I go out speaking to college
campuses or even I do Q and, a,

1403
01:08:54,371 --> 01:08:56,680
when I'm doing standup or wherever I go,

1404
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,060
the question I get more than anything
else is I'm afraid to say what I think and

1405
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:01,721
what should I do.

1406
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,210
And it's usually students that are saying
I want to get a grade cause I want to

1407
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:07,570
get out, I want to get to Grad school or
whatever. And I always think it's like,

1408
01:09:07,571 --> 01:09:10,990
man, if everyone's thinking
this, if we all just stopped,

1409
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,050
if we all just stopped acquiescing to it,

1410
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:18,370
we could actually change this thing
like that. So my question to you is you,

1411
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:22,450
and you mentioned your father before,
but why, why are you willing to do this?

1412
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:23,980
Why are you willing to
put your ass on the line?

1413
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:25,060
Where does this come from in you?

1414
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,840
So it's two things. One, it's, it's
growing up. So grew up poor in the south,

1415
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:32,770
got a scholarship to private school,
scholarship to Yale. When I was at Yale,

1416
01:09:32,771 --> 01:09:35,140
they tried to get rid of
poor students who were there,

1417
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:39,010
let it protest by leaving Yale in order
to get them to reinstate their policies.

1418
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:42,340
And I saw there, I was like,
I'm one kid, I'm 19 years old.

1419
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:46,540
I'm challenging all of Yale University,
which wasn't exactly a small institution.

1420
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,680
And just by leaving the school and
getting public attention for it,

1421
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,830
I got them to reverse their
policies and protect poor students.

1422
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:56,010
Same access that I had to,
uh,

1423
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,740
rights to full financial aid rights to
be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner

1424
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,260
in the application process.
So as a, at a young age,

1425
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:05,650
I learned one person can change the world.
When I was a real little kid,

1426
01:10:05,651 --> 01:10:09,610
I loved Medgar Evers and Medgar Evers
had this great quote where they asked him

1427
01:10:09,611 --> 01:10:11,560
why it wasn't afraid to die.
And he said,

1428
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:15,100
most men die a thousand deaths every day.
I'm only going to die once.

1429
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,710
And I was little kid. I was like, I
want to be at Medgar Evers. It's like,

1430
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:20,470
that is so powerful. That is so
important. That's so influential.

1431
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,630
And you realize one person
can make a difference.

1432
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,460
And when you realize one
person can make a difference,

1433
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:28,390
if they know it here and act on it here,
then you realize that,

1434
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,190
that that's the power.
That's the passion.

1435
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,010
That's what leads you to want to
change the world, not be afraid of.

1436
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,190
I've had rogue agents threatened me,
a IRS,

1437
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:38,800
people put me under audit every
other year whenever I want a case.

1438
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,690
I've had a rogue judges threatened me.

1439
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,240
I've had people say that they're going
to try and put me on a bogus criminal

1440
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:44,074
investigation.

1441
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:47,680
I've had every smear campaign known to
man had bomb threats coming because of my

1442
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:49,330
Covington case representation.

1443
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,960
And none of it concerns me because if
you understand that you really have the

1444
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,720
power one person to make a
real difference in the world,

1445
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:58,960
then other people will start to recognize
that and they'll act on their power.

1446
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,000
They'll voice their,
their abilities,

1447
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:04,090
they'll use their capabilities
to make a meaningful difference.

1448
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,500
And that's how the world changes.

1449
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:10,360
And that's how the world becomes a better
place. That is how you ended interview.

1450
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,190
Can we smoke one of those cigars
he brought here, right. We're done

1451
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,000
here. Follow Robert. I have a
feeling you'll be back here. Yeah.

1452
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,510
I have a feeling it's going to happen,
uh, on Twitter at Barnes underscore law.
