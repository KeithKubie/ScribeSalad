I like what I see I think it's an

I like what I see I think it's an
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.480
I like what I see I think it's an
interesting place I'm not there was a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
interesting place I'm not there was a
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.310
interesting place I'm not there was a
time when I would know about new art

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
time when I would know about new art
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650
time when I would know about new art
before it hit the galleries these days

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
before it hit the galleries these days
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.660
before it hit the galleries these days
I'm afraid I I find out about it maybe

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670
I'm afraid I I find out about it maybe
 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.910
I'm afraid I I find out about it maybe
when it hits the museum so I'm a little

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
when it hits the museum so I'm a little
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.910
when it hits the museum so I'm a little
behind on what's really front line work

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
behind on what's really front line work
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.180
behind on what's really front line work
right now what I see I like I think it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
right now what I see I like I think it's
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:49.639
right now what I see I like I think it's
some interesting time it's a new world

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
some interesting time it's a new world
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.350
some interesting time it's a new world
and people are grappling with the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
and people are grappling with the
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.119
and people are grappling with the
content of that world I think and it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
content of that world I think and it
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.859
content of that world I think and it
helps me to see what other artists to do
