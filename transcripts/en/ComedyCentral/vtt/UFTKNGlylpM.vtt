00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:05.338
Or you know, the black widow,
she mates with her male mate

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.672
and then she snuffs them.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:09.108
So I'm working on
this estrogen thing heavy,

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.144
it's going to be part
of that Geiger counter thing.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:15.815
I, okay, embarrassment, I'm
56 years old and I'm a virgin.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:17.717
I'm sorry-

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.752
Technically, but has
the bell gone off yet?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.953
The bell has not gone off

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:23.756
but testimony should be relevant
to the item before.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.225
Officer Carr,
you remember when you voted?

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.161
And you can answer this
after I sit down.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.362
Three minutes.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.630
Your time is up.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.266
There are some folks
in little Austin town,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.169
don't have a lot of dough.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.471
They're not using
all your gasoline,

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:40.874
they like to go real slow.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.145
My legal name is Greg Gay.
I was bullied.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.881
I had my head
shoved in the urinal.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.351
Lance, you were the one that
shoved my head in the urinal.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.420
Thank you.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.722
Bitches ain't shit
but hoes and tricks.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.658
Look on these nuts
and suck the dick.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:00:59.959
That's Snoop Dogg.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:04.597
I am not a sexually
active person. I do no sex.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.634
There's a movie called
A-R-R-O-Y-O 2014.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.203
Get up and watch it.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.306
And guess what,
I'm not the rancher.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.708
Not the rancher's wife,
not the rancher's kid,

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.176
not that I couldn't have been.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.445
That's not the path
I chose, was it?

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:23.282
My ex-husband's the killer.
And news flash, he's not dead.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.419
I have two boobs, not six.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:29.455
I have six butts because when
you guys are talking about me,

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.324
you have no idea
who knows me.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.293
Sane people know that showing up

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.028
at their local
city council meetings

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.731
will accomplish nothing.
That's why I asked you

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.701
to send me any complaints
about your community

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.636
and I will give them
the national platform

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:47.807
they don't deserve in a segment
I'm calling, local twissues.

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.277
First, in my town of Glen Cove,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.779
my neighbors believe
that they own the street

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.516
so they put out cones
to reserve parking spots.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.619
One neighbor in particular
doesn't like his cones touched

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.588
so he goes off
whenever someone moves his cone

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.592
or his recyling bin
he uses as a third cone.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.362
Oh ho, I recommend
settling this with violence.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.032
The Steak N Shake in
Cape Girardeau, Missouri,

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.300
closes at 10PM.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.435
That's too early.
Please help us.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.971
Tucker, I hear you,
but you really shouldn't

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.941
be eating steaks
or shakes after 10PM.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.443
Now, if you have to,
buy a heat lamp.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.179
Then pick up your food at 10

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.081
and keep it warm
until you're hungry.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.049
My city, Clayton, Missouri,

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:31.517
banned golf carts
on the streets.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.353
I've been driving my golf cart
on the streets for years.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.988
The surrounding cities allow it,

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.757
but I have to drive illegally
to get out of Clayton.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.958
Help me.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.826
Okay, now here's what you do,
buddy.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.361
Carry a golf ball
with you at all times,

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.130
then when you get pulled over,

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.866
you tell those do-nothing sons
of bitches running Clayton,

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.102
that you're playing
your ball where it lies.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.738
There's no Wifi
in my high school

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.307
and they make us use our phones

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.809
for a bunch of things,
wasting data I can't afford.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.111
Also, they opened up
a second cafeteria

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:01.647
in recent renovations called,
the internet cafÃ©,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.350
but they don't allow students
to connect to the wifi.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.986
Better be careful
writing with all caps,

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.055
they're gonna
put you on a list.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.058
I'm tired of these spandex
wearing cycle freaks

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.926
parading around
in their bicycle gangs,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.996
slowing down traffic
in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.899
We need to introduce lions
to the local population

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:22.735
to cull this
Lance Armstrong herd.

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:24.070
I like where your head's at.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:27.740
I fully endorse releasing lions
in the streets of Georgia.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.577
I'm just surrounded by idiots.
Kalkaska, Michigan.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.080
Well, sure you are,
you live in Kalkaska.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.882
The principal at our high school
in Wisconsin

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.585
has slept with
multiple faculty members

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.587
and even had a pregnancy
scare with one of them.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.689
And no, I'm not talking
about his wife,

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.192
who is also a faculty member
at the same high school.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:51.264
All right you little snitch,
you mind your own

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.999
God damn business.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.702
And let adults
do what adults do.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.005
Tell Travel Magazine to stop
naming

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.540
Charleston the number one city
in the country.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:03.943
It's driving
all the Ohioans here.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:07.313
You'd have to live in Ohio
your entire life to believe

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:10.049
Charleston is the number
one city anywhere.

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:13.986
What is this, Beverly Hills?

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.756
No, this is Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:22.528
This looks just like Malibu.
No, Charleston.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:27.133
Is this South Beach Miami?
No, no, it's Charleston.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.604
Is this New York City?
Oh, look at all this energy.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:34.807
No, it's Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.177
Hey, is this the windy city,
it was such great food.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.315
No, no, you're in Charleston.
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.251
How many other ...
Austin, is this Austin?

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.421
So much culture,
so much good music.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.724
No, no, this is Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.727
You can tell because
we still have

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.330
one of our old slave
auction blocks.

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.268
I don't think I'm far off.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.538
Vandalia, Ohio.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:08.507
There are no sidewalks connected
to the middle school for kids.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.875
Well, it's probably
for the best,

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:12.345
we can stand to have
a few less middle schoolers.

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.781
Same sex couples can't go
to prom together.

00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:17.350
Commerce, Oklahoma.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:20.553
You guys got one of those
boring ass cis proms?

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:24.057
You should at least
be allowed to use the back door.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.293
You get it?

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:32.031
Sherwin Williams has dumped
toxic waste

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:34.500
from their paint
in Gibbsboro, New Jersey,

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:37.169
and now it's causing a lot of
health issues for the residents.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.138
It's classified
as a cancer cluster

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:40.873
and the residents
have mental health issues.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:43.676
The land, water,
and air are toxic.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.645
This sounds like it might be
more of a Netflix docu-series

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:48.147
kind of problem.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.084
We need a damn Popeyes Chicken
in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:53.219
Do the Lord's work, Daniel,

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.755
bring me some of that finger
licking goodness.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.691
Okay, first of all, finger
licking goodness is KFC,

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.426
you confused Okie.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.461
I live in Maplewood, Minnesota,

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:04.830
and it's shaped like a bunch
of cities were glued together.

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:09.602
It sure is, I am all
for re-drawing all city lines

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.470
until everything looks
like a perfect square.

00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:13.206
Hashtag squarey-mandering.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.475
Our neighborhood has a
sewer problem in Orange, Texas.

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:19.578
It's the Nottingham neighborhood
off of highway 87.

00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.947
The slightest rain
and nobody can flush.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.983
Help us fix this please.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.118
You sure it's not all those
husky brisket

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.120
dumps you guys
are famous for?

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:30.156
Warwick, Pennsylvania.
Our school district

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.690
still doesn't offer
full-day kindergarten

00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:32.892
but somehow expects children

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.693
to walk into first grade
being able to read.

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:37.730
It forces working parents to
have to pay for private daycare.

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:39.598
Most of other
surrounding districts

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:41.333
already offer
full day kindergarten.

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.701
Okay, let me tell you something.

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:45.171
How dare they make you
spend more time

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.106
with your shitty,
illiterate children.

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:51.010
Who needs kindergarten
in Pennsylvania, anyway.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:53.446
You're just gonna end up
working in a coal mine.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:55.848
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.117
Pair of shitty panties,
water bottle,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.452
and a pack o Newports

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.722
on the corner of our busiest
road, been there for weeks.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.793
You sure it's not a roadside
memorial for some light lizard.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.897
Pay your respects just to be
safe, then pick it up.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:14.500
Sometimes, my fish tacos
aren't hot enough.

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:15.935
Honolulu, Hawaii.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.571
Well, mahalo for
your patience, Hawaii.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.707
Go outside, hold it
over your lava for 30 seconds.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.976
You'll have all the heat
you can handle.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.311
Twitter has ruined America.
