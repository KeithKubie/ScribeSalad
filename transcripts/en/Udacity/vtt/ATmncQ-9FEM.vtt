00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.000
Meet 99
A Partner Company of Udacity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.740
99 was born as an app
designed to link people to taxi drivers.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.800
Along the years, our goal is to have
an increasing portfolio of products

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040
and offer all kinds of transport
people use within cities.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.340
What are the professional profiles
that we look for?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.780
Passionate people who believe
they can make a difference in the world.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.000
So they have a working purpose,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600
brightness in the eyes,
willingness to do things,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.200
ownership, which we
fondly call 99rship.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.500
We truly believe we got where we did
and achieved the success we have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
thanks to the people
we managed to bring to 99,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600
the team we built.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
With almost all our candidates
we do some kind of test,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.600
something to get to know them better.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
We do a cultural assessment,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.000
since we have a strong culture
at the company.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.500
My journey here at 99
was real fast in fact,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.700
in terms of responsibility and learning.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.700
I believe this is a very usual attribute
among these startups that begin

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.100
with a project that has value,
that has a purpose.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.260
And attracts very good people at first,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.860
people that are interested.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.900
And things change
very quickly, overnight.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.600
The greatest challenge
is having a lot to do.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.760
The amount of things is huge!

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.720
You usually work at a very lean team,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.940
so you have to be careful
on choosing what to do.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.500
And you also need to do
a lot of different things.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.800
You do not specialize in a single system,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.300
you deal with a whole ecosystem
of different technologies.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.500
At least here at 99
we have little red tape.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.400
You don't go through lots of layers
for approval, things you need to do

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.840
for launching a new code.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.700
And something I enjoy doing
is following the result of things.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.200
We are arranged it in a way that
is famous for being brought by Spotify,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000
which is called squads.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.300
Squads are multidisciplinary teams,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.700
which is, inside the same team
there is one person who delevops iOS,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400
one who develops Android,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.760
one responsible for the server part,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.800
someone from product,
someone from Marketing.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.800
We see Udacity
as a great potential partner.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.620
Professionals really prove
to have lots of qualities.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.100
Among them, there is one
we find very valuable,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100
which is the continuous
and endless search for knowledge.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.220
The capabilities we look for in a person

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.800
are Java, Scala is a plus,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.700
or native Android, native iOS,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.200
experience with Amazon AWS,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.580
knowledge of agile methodologies,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.100
and experience working
at a large-scale app.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.720
Get ready for the market
