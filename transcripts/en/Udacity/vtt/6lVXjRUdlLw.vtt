00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.340
So, what's a good representation for
everyday life?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.460
David, can you think of an example?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; So a good example that comes to mind
pretty quickly for me is the example of

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.590
the nutritional information on the side
of a food or beverage container.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.450
It lists slots for
each different kind of nutrient, and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.910
also lists the quantity
that's present in that food.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.480
So it seems like it's a pretty good
representation of what's actually going

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.540
on inside the food container.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.310
&gt;&gt; What do you think?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.860
Do you think David is right?
