Hello, and welcome to This Week
in Android Development

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
for July 22, 2013, live from
our brand new Android

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.270
Broadcast Studio.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.190
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.380
Last week, the Google Play Games
team put on a show to

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.850
help your web games take
advantage of Google Play Games

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.510
services and the Android Design
in Action team cast a

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.530
critical eye over one of our
GDG App Clinic Oslo apps as

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.740
well as providing some insight
into how to create a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.450
consistent design
for your apps.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.310
Our Australian colleagues held
their first Fireside Chat on

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.880
making apps beautiful on Android
Developers Backstage,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.090
and Ankur followed up with
the next of his DevBytes

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.220
explaining how to make your
apps beautiful on tablets.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.745
Not to be outdone, Chet was back
for an exciting episode

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:50.620
of his Animation DevBytes.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.080
More on that later.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.860
The Android Developer Survey
is still open,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.670
but closes this week.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.950
This is your chance to tell us
what works and what doesn't,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.150
or just that we ask far
too many questions.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.739
Next week, Ankur is back for
more beautiful App DevBytes,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.110
and Chet, well, you'll just
have to wait and see what

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.670
Chet's got in store.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.040
Last Friday's cricketing
humiliation delayed our

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.440
scheduled episode of the App
Clinic when a drinking game

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.170
involving the fall of Australian
wickets went

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.390
horribly wrong.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.090
It's been resceduled for this
week, but Australian viewers

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.780
beware, it contains screenshots
taken during the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390
second test.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.265
This episode is a little
different from our usual App

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.570
Clinic format with a deep dive
into the architectural

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.290
decisions and design that go
into creating an efficient

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.330
low-latency sports score
tracking app.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.070
So tune in and find out how to
make your app's architecture

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.590
as beautiful as its
visual design.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.885
As always, you can go
to developers.googl

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:43.360
e.com/live/android to see what
we've got planned for ADL this

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.150
coming week.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.040
That's all for this week
in Android Development

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.070
for July 22, 2013.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.970
And remember that the dust from
a distant sun will shower

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.220
over everyone.
