00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:02.637
The local grocery store opens at nine.

00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:04.809
Its parking lot has six rows.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:06.588
Each row can fit seven cars.

00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:08.285
Each car has four wheels.

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:11.182
How many cars can the parking lot fit?

00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:13.960
And I encourage you to pause the video 
and think about this yourself.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.641
Try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.630
So, let's re-read this.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.890
The local grocery store opens up at nine.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.520
Well, that doesn't really matter. If we're thinking about 
how many cars can the parking lot fit.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.495
So we don't really have to care about that.

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:27.745
We also dont have to care about 
how many wheels each car has.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.145
They're not asking us how many 
wheels can fit in the parking lot.

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:31.725
So we can ignore that.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.405
What we really care about is 
how many rows we have.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:36.795
And how many cars can fit in each row.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:43.855
What we have is -- We have six rows
and each row can fit seven cars.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:47.255
We're going to six groups of seven.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.365
Or, another way of thinking about it.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:53.215
We're going to have six times seven 
cars can fit in the parking lot.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:55.425
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.911
This is literally six sevens added up.

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:05.451
This is the same thing as 
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.951
That last seven looks strange.

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:13.221
Now we're going to add these up.

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:15.641
Seven plus seven is fourteen.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:20.401
Twenty-one, twenty-eight,
thirty-five, forty-two.

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:25.141
Six times seven is equal to forty-two.

00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:31.021
So forty-two cars can fit in the parking lot.
Don't believe me? I made a little diagram here.

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.731
We have six rows.

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.071
This is the first row.

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:34.901
Second..

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:35.891
Third..

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:36.751
Fourth..

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:37.441
Fifth..

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.861
Sixth.

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:41.671
Each row can fit seven cars.
You see it here.

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:44.071
One; Let me make that a little brighter.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.001
One..

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:45.771
Two..

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:46.741
Three..

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.881
Four, five, six, seven.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.510
How many cars are there?

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.053
You have seven.

00:01:53.053 --> 00:01:54.253
Fourteen..

00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:55.553
Twenty-one..

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:56.793
Twenty-eight..

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:57.934
Thirty-five..

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.334
Forty-two total cars.

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:04.334
Six rows of seven.
