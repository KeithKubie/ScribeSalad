00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.199
Material Design Lite, or MDL,
gives designers and developers

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.490
a way to add a material look
and feel to their websites

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.340
based on Google's
design guidelines.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.730
But what is MDL, and
what makes it lite?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.977
I'm Mustafa Kurtuldu,
Design Advocate at Google.

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:15.310
And in this video, I'll give
an overview of the material

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.050
design guidelines, the
intentions behind MDL,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.260
and the resources we have
to help build and develop

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.100
your own MDL website.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.960
Material design
guidelines were born out

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.630
of a need to create a
consistent user experience

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.680
across multiple platforms.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.116
Consistency is really
important, as people

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:32.740
tend to jump from
one device to another

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.440
throughout their working day.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.810
For example, while
traveling in the morning,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.610
they may use a mobile device.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.220
At school or work, they'll be
on their desktop or laptop.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.490
And in the evening, they
may switch to a tablet.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.940
This continuous device switching
means applications and websites

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.210
need to transfer
these experiences

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.120
across different boundaries.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.280
For this, we must create a
continuous, a ubiquitous user

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.310
experience.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.056
And this is where
material design can help.

00:00:58.056 --> 00:00:59.930
To understand this
further, let's take a look

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.052
at the building blocks of
Google's design language.

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.510
Material design is broken down
into three core principles--

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.270
material as a metaphor;
meaningful motion; and bold,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.940
graphic, and intentional.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.020
These principles help
define the relationship

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.620
between the user
and the UI, which

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.549
is also called affordance.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.090
Good affordance can
be the difference

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.620
between a user
naturally knowing how

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.410
to perform an action
in your application

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.100
or getting frustrated
and confused.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.480
The first principle,
material as a metaphor,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.530
introduces the idea that every
element in an application

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.610
is made of a flexible and
tangible piece of material,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.260
similar to paper.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.320
Each piece of material
can be any shape, size,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.630
has a thickness,
occupies its own depth,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.030
and can be elevated above
other pieces of material

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.860
to demonstrate its
importance simply

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.780
by casting a realistic shadow.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.000
By using shadows and
other familiar things

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.140
from our everyday experiences
in the real world,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.100
we can naturally
relate to material.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.620
And this helps us quickly
understand the affordances

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.242
in our application.

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:57.300
The second principle
of material design

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.270
is meaningful motion, which
describes how bits of material

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.370
move and relate to a
person's click or touch.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.290
Every transition must appear
natural and help guide a person

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.550
to perform a specific
task and not simply

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.320
be decorative distractions.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.320
Material can shrink,
grow, rotate,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.430
or move across any axis
so long as it does so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.370
in a meaningful context.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.130
The third principle
of material design

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.370
is bold, graphic,
and intentional.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.820
This principle references
the classic standards

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.910
from print design
and will determine

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.890
how material looks by using
typography, grids, space,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.990
scale, color, and imagery.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.230
Together, all of these
principles and design

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.720
considerations is what
we call material design.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.310
The material design principles
can be applied to any platform,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.018
though the guidelines
are extremely rich,

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:44.060
and this can be a
bit overwhelming.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.829
This is where Material
Design Lite can help.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.370
The reason why we
add the word "lite"

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.740
is because we avoid
implementing the full animation

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.590
support for some of
the motion transitions.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.020
This means you can ship a
[? fast ?] [? static ?] site

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.580
with a material
design look and feel.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.530
To make MDL available
to all developers,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.070
the project is open-source.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.960
So whether you have a
content-heavy website

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.010
or a simple, static
website, you can use MDL.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.790
To use MDL, simply link
to the CSS file on our CDN

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.510
and add the relevant
CSS classes and HTML

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.680
markup depending on the MDL
components you may wish to use.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.670
For example, we have
a layout component

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.660
that is fully responsive and
allows you to design and build

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.180
custom page layouts.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420
We also have simple,
small UI components,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.180
like the progress bar, for
indicating loading and progress

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.130
states.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.790
Each component has a basic usage
with a number of CSS classes

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.580
you can add to the HTML in
order to change the default

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.530
behavior or styles.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.640
You can find out more
about MDL components

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.417
and how they are implemented
on our website, getmdl.io.

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.250
For those of you who
want to create a custom

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.820
theme for your website,
we have a color wheel

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.470
that lets you change the
default, primary, and accent

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.850
colors of our UI elements.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.170
We also have pre-built
templates at our website

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.750
that you can use as a
source of inspiration,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.050
as well as a showcase
section on our website that

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.750
displays existing sites
currently using MDL,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.340
such as Google Wallet,
Contributor, and Web Starter

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.390
Kit.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.330
Again, all of these can be
seen on our website, getmdl.io.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.040
So that's material design
and Material Design Lite.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.860
And now that you have an
understanding of how MDL works,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.364
you can craft the
perfect website

00:04:21.364 --> 00:04:24.810
to suit yours and
your users' needs.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.490

MDL or material design,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.040
you can check out these links.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.400
Thank you for watching.
