00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:04.295
I'm smiley, what can I say!

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:06.025
I'm a happy and smiley guy!

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:10.645
But wait, the fact that I'm smiley is helping
me to stay happy?

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:21.655
Science is ON THE FACE, er, Case!

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:26.364
Emotions are private affairs, they exist almost
completely inside our bodies, but our face

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:29.674
is highly connected to the expressing of these
emotions.

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:34.574
Even back in the 1870s, Darwin believed emotions
expressed outwardly were more intense than

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:35.574
those held in.

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:40.625
The thing is, it's not a one way street; emotional
expression on the face, feeds BACK into the

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:41.625
brain too!

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.035
The face is connected to the brain by the
seventh cranial nerve.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:50.044
The nerve runs exits the skull just in front
of your ears and splits into five branches

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:52.665
which activate different parts of the face.

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:57.395
Let's all agree to stop telling people it
only takes four muscles to smile… or whatever

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.014
number of muscles.

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:03.344
There are 43 muscles in the face on average,
some people have MORE facial muscles, and

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:04.344
some less.

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:09.675
According to HowStuffWorks, it takes 10 muscles
to smile and six to frown… but even though

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:12.855
it's tougher to smile, that work isn't going
to waste!!

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:18.005
Smiling is a generally universal expression
of happiness; one of the only universal expressions

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.005
actually.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.505
Multiple studies have shown even FAKE SMILING
will help you find things funnier and feel

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.505
happier.

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:28.995
In the 1970s and 80s, psychologists determined
faking a smile will help people feel less

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:31.475
stressed and happier overall.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:35.955
Research from the University of Kansas showed
people being forced to smile could endure

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:38.944
mild icewater pain and recover more quickly!

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:43.855
To force a smile, volunteers were told to
hold a pen or chopstick in their teeth, like

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:46.215
a dog bone, or with their lips.

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:50.575
One makes a smile, the other a pout…

00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:55.175
A new study from Germany mimicked these by
forcing people to smile, and then measuring

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:56.175
how they felt.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:00.585
They were shown Gary Larson's Far Side comics
-- Sidebar: Stuff like this is why I love

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:01.594
the Germans.

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:02.594
-- And you know what?

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:07.995
People with the pen in their teeth rated the
comics as FUNNIER!

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.685
It's not just a feedback loop through your
nerves.

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:14.485
Smiling constricts the internal carotid artery
which brings blood to your brain.

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:18.785
The constricted vessel lowers the temperature
of the blood and thus the brain overall.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:22.735
A hot brain happens when people are stressed
or afraid, cooler brains occur when people

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.005
are calm or happy.

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:29.285
Essentially, by fake smiling you may be tricking
your brain into making you feel happy.

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:33.935
And finally, as we've said a number of times,
humans are social creatures, so when you smile,

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:37.295
others will SEE that and reflect it back to
you.

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:42.875
A botox surgeon in Maryland froze the frown
lines on a number of patients, making it impossible

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.215
for them to LOOK sad.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:49.135
A published study followed patients who had
this done, and believe this resulted in a

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.955
facial feedback-loop!

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:55.105
They were unable to express sadness, and they
all self-reported lower levels of depression,

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:56.365
anxiety and irritability.

00:02:56.365 --> 00:03:00.845
Though, we're not saying go get botox, that's
pretty extreme, but It's like Louis Armstrong

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:05.515
said, "when you're smiling, the whole world
smiles at you!"

00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:08.635
And on top of that, you'll feel happier too!

00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:09.695
So go try it!

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.065
GET OUT THERE AND SMILE!

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:17.635
People can tell when you're faking your smile,
though… so make sure you watch this video

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:18.635
about that.

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:24.695
Do you ever force yourself to put on a happy
face?
