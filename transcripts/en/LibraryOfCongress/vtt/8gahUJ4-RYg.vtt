00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington,DC.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.670
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herera: Hello,
I am Juan Felipe Ferraro,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.120
the US Poet Laureate of the
United States and I am here

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.780
with Nathan Dorn, Curator of
the Law Library of Congress.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.680 position:56%
And this is a special segment for El
Jardin, part of the Casa de Colores,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.550
and Nathan has laid out a number
of very interesting books.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.850
What do we have Nathan?

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.570
&gt;&gt; Nathan Dorn: Well, what I
tried to do is I tried to bring

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.390
out some samples from the Law
Library's Hispanic law collection

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.980
and I wanted to bring them
out because they begin to hint

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.720
at the richness and depth of
our collection on this subject.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.300
Before I show you the items, I want
to tell you about the beginning

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.910
of our Hispanic law collection.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.330
The Law Library has been collecting
books from foreign jurisdictions

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.010 position:56%
from its very origins in the
beginning of the nineteenth century.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
But the main collecting
activities of legal literature

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090 position:56%
from foreign jurisdictions didn't
really get underway until the middle

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.490
of the nineteenth century.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.240
And the most important event

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.480
for that beginning was
the Mexican American War.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.110
The Mexican American War was a war

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.060
that took place between
1846 and 1848.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.820
It was a contest especially
over land and at the close

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.210
of the war the United States found
itself in possession of New Mexico,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.530
Arizona, California and basically
an entire new continent to the west

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.970
of its previous holdings
in North America.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.860
So Congress realizing that that
land until recently had been

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.360
under jurisdictions whose
historical roots lie

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.610
in the Spanish Empire
realized they would need

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.150
to understand how property
was regulated,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.120
how contracts were regulated,
how the cities were regulated,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.420
and how the people
understood themselves.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.020
So they required the Law Library
of Congress to acquire law books

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.970
from those jurisdictions especially
Spain, the Spanish Empire,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.790
and Mexico until that date.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.820
So that was in 1848.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.600
They didn't actually allocate
funds until 1854 but at

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.820
that point the Library went out on
a spending...on a shopping spree

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.310 position:56%
and eventually after several decades
of collecting, we have many, many,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.930
many volumes that represent
the entire history of,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.130
the entire early print
history of Hispanic law

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.610
about 1200 volumes until 1801.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.350
And these here represent some

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.640
of the really priceless
treasures in that collection.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.050
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Beautiful and
what do we have up here?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.470
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Okay...the beginning

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.720
of Hispanic law is shrouded
somewhat in antiquity.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.910
We had at the fall of the Roman
Empire, a small code of Roman law.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.890
That was the only code of
Roman law that survived

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.130
in unbroken tradition
throughout the middle ages.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.610 position:56%
And that was the Breviary of Alaric,
which was a bit of Roman law,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.380
really roman not barbarian
but it was in the hands

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
of a Germanic tribe,
eventually the Visigothic Tribe

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.570
and over centuries it
was adapted and changed

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.440
and it becomes the basic,
one of the primary documents

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.530
of Hispanic Law, the
Visigothic Code.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.820
It's published, is printed, for
the first time very late 1550.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.100
We have it here in a 1579 edition.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.230
Already in this edition in
Paris of Sebastian Nevellis,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.180 position:56%
the Visigothic Code was very much an
active law code throughout medieval

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.020
Spain and it was eventually folded
into a subsequent publication known

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.690
as the Fuero juzgo which remained
living Spanish law throughout

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.320
history of the Spanish
Empire in North America.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.320
&gt;&gt; Herrera: You know, now that
you mention the Visigothic Code,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.610
what items or ideas come
from, were adapted or adopted

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.860
from the Visigothic Code into
this particular book right here?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.490
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So this here is an
imprint of the Visigothic Code.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.790
You can have a look inside.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.090
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's a total imprint...

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.010
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It is a total imprint
of the Visigothic Code itself.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.970
And it contains all the
provisions of that code

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.310
and it's a fully functioning code
with family law and inheritance law

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.960
and other things that
will help a kingdom run.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.730
Now, in Medieval Spain
in the 13th century,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.350
King Alfonso the 10th required
that a new publication of law come

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.910
out that would incorporate not
just the Roman law inheritance

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.360
but also the customary law of the
kingdom of Spain that was coming

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.740
up through the Middle Ages.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.860
Now all the jurisdictions of Europe
would eventually codify their

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.150
customary law codes and this volume
represents that codification,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.460
the 13th century codification
of Spanish law

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.360
into what's called
the Siete Partidas.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.660
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Las Siete Partidas.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.960
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Siete Partidas.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.470
Now it's very important,
crucially important publication

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.560
in early Spanish law because while
it's a 13th century document,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.250
it really became the basis of
Spanish law for quite a long time

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.910
with some competition from the
Fuero juzgo which is the descendent

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.600
of this, the Visigothic code.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.790
The Siete Partidas was
imported to the Americas

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.700
when the Spanish arrived and
remained an integral part

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.650
of the legal material, the
basic legal references,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.210
of anybody who is working in the
law throughout the Spanish speaking

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.750
Americas for hundreds of years.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.180
Now to get the point across,
so widespread was the use

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.240
of the Siete Partidas, I will talk
about this edition in a moment,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.550
that even after parts of
America that were once

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.250
under Spanish influence
came to be states,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.020
here you have an 1820
volume from Louisiana.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.140
It's called Las Siete Partidas,
those laws of Las Siete Partidas

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.440
which are still in force
in the State of Louisiana.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.850
&gt;&gt; Herrera: So that's what we
were talking about a while ago

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.580
and I was talking with Nathan and
Nathan explained Las Siete Partidas

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.460
and the Visigothic Code
and then Louisiana.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.300
Why is it, how is it, that we get

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.140
such laws can continue all
the way to the present?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.860 position:56%
What's going on, what's the power of
these words, or what are the codes

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.330
that are so important, so what
makes them so long lasting?

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.500
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Generally speaking
law is very conservative

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.270
and the reason it's very
conservative is because people's,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.410
people's property and all their
assets and all the arrangements

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.680 position:56%
by which they live their lives are
tied up in the particular provisions

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.040
that exist already on the books.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.760
And so nobody wants you to come in

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.460
and totally revolutionize the
legal system that you are sitting

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.160
in because then what happens to all
your rights, what happens to all

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.130
of your holdings and in no
case, even in the beginning

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.390
of Spanish speaking settlement
in North America and then

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.850 position:56%
in Anglo settlement in those same
regions throughout the southwest was

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.870
there such a revolution
that everybody simply wanted

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.180
to level whatever had been before.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.480
It just didn't happen.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.810
What happened instead
was people wanted

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.630
to receive what was already
there to such a degree,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.530
whatever degree necessary,
to preserve property rights

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.650
and make sure that
everyone who had something

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.970 position:56%
to lose could protect what they had.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.270
Okay, so...

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.570
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's very good.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.090
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So what we have
here is Las Siete Partidas...

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.940
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Las Siete Partidas.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.310
&gt;&gt; Dorn: ...in a 1491
edition from Seville.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.860
&gt;&gt; Herrera: ...from Seville,1491

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.290
&gt;&gt; Dorn: ...And so I promised
you a little while ago

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.800
that we would have a five
hundred year old book.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.100
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes, you did.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.420
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So here's our
five hundred year old book

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.420
and it's a very beautiful pristine
copy of that Las Siete Partidas

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.300
which is such an important part
of Spanish law in North America.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.830
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Five hundred years old.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.130
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Five hundred plus.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.010
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Five hundred
plus and we go to...

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.410
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Number 4.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.710
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Number 4.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.010
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Okay.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.310
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Let's go to number 4.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.610
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Okay, here we are.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.910
So let's skip ahead
in time to Mexico.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.250
This is a really interesting book.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.240
It's widely understood to be
the second law book printed

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.690
in the New World.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.590
It's printed at the printing
press of Pedro Ocharte

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.870
who is the second printer
operating in Mexico City.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:19.760
It's printed in 1565 and it's
called the Cedulario de Puga

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.450
and it's compiled by a man called
Vasco de Puga who was a judge

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.430
in the Audiencia which is
the court of Mexico City.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.210
And what it contains is all those
laws that govern Mexico City

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.230
from 1528 to 1565 which is
really the first stretch

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.530
of Mexican history.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.830
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes it is.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.130
That's a lot of laws right there.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.430
&gt;&gt; Dorn: That's a lot of laws.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.730
Well it's not that many laws.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.750
It's just a little bit more,
really it's just a l ittle bit more

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.610 position:56%
than the ordinances that control the
city, because we're only beginning

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.480
to control vast stretches
of America under these laws.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.910
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right
and do these laws also apply

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.360
to indigenous peoples
of Mesoamerica,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.730
Mexico City at that time?

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.030
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Oh yes.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:07.050
Oh yes. This is the code
that runs the nation state.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.830 position:56%
So you have an idea that it has
some beautiful illuminated initials.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.130
&gt;&gt; Herrera: They do.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.330
And this is one of the early,
or the first, printing you said?

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.770
&gt;&gt; Dorn: This is the first
printing of the Cedulario de Puga,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.250
the official printing 1565.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.560
Okay. But before we leave
Mexico City, let's not forget.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.860
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Oh, we almost forgot!

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.160
We almost forgot!

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.810
We had this prepared
but we almost forgot.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.510
This is what's very interesting.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.760
You told me that this is a
manual, a marriage manual

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.090
and this is what, the
custom, the laws?

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:48.450
These are the laws that
regulate what marriage is

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.200
and how marriage can be
maintained and how to define it.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.500
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Correct.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.800
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And more...

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.100
&gt;&gt; Dorn: On all points, correct.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.400
Okay, so we haven't
left Mexico City,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.700
in fact we are going
backward in time.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.330
Here we have a book
probably published in 1556,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.150
a few years earlier than the
1565 over here and it's published

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.960
by the very first printer
operating in the Americas.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.050
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That was the first
printer that I was thinking about.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.420
&gt;&gt; Dorn: That's Juan Pablos.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.720
That's right.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.020
&gt;&gt; Herrera: What is the
name of the printer?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.320
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Juan Pablos.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.740
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Just plain
ol' Juan Pablos?

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.040
&gt;&gt; Dorn: In fact he's Italian

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.400
and he adopted a Spanish
version of his name.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.990
&gt;&gt; Herrera: You didn't
tell me that last time.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.290
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Oh no?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.390
Okay so here he is, he is living
in Mexico City all the same.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:40.700
He's operating his printing press
there from about 1539 until 1561,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.650 position:56%
which is the time of his death which
is only a few years after this.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.480
This is a very, this is perhaps
the first book length printing

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.780
in America.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.340
And so we have this beautiful book.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.860 position:56%
It's the Speculum Coniugiorum like
you were saying, that's the handbook

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.430
of marriage relations
and it's written

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.720
by an Augustinian friar
called Alonso de la Vera Cruz.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.660
And Vera Cruz lived from the
beginning of the sixteenth century

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.870
until sometime in the 1570s and
I think, and he was remarkable

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.370
because he was quite a
philosophical genius.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.920
He studied at the University
of Salamanca

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.000
and was already appointed
a lectureship

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.250
which is a highly coveted position
before he met some missionaries

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:31.330 position:56%
returning to Spain from the Americas
who described to him the life there

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.170
and what one could do in
service of the church.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.670
And he just fell in love with
the idea and the romance of it

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:43.320
and he went off to America and very
soon he was working among the Aztec

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.210
Indians and the Tarascan
Indians as a missionary.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.600
Now this work represents
the culmination of many,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.900
many years of practical,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.590
on the ground experience
converting native peoples

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.890
and bringing them into the church.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.650
One of the big issues for converts
is a different kinship structure,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.800
the kinship structure that you have

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.500
under the canon law of
the catholic church.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.800
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.480
We were talking about that too,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.920
how converting the indigenous
peoples through, by converting,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.640 position:56%
one person in the family perhaps the
father we can easily then convert

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.830
the entire family and here
is the handbook that is going

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:25.110
to guide this new form of marriage
and kinship system, inheritance,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.750
and all those things
that go along with it.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.050
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Correct.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.670
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And so that's
a very powerful book.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.210
&gt;&gt; Dorn: I think so, and
it's not just a law book.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.030
It doesn't just tell you
about the laws of marriage.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:43.360
It's also a book about...you know
what I'm looking for...I'm looking

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.980
for that beautiful diagram.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.780
It's also a book about the
meaning of marriage as a sacrament

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.230
and the theological
significance to...

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.250
that the marriage has.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.280 position:56%
And so it's quite a remarkable book.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.050
It even includes a little bit
of the, a little bit of detail

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:06.160
about the life and marriage
customs of the Tarascan Indians.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.460
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.470
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So, here you have
an interesting chart...

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.800
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Show it
to them, go ahead.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.660
So here we have a chart.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.660
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So this chart shows the
degrees of family relationship,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.660
the ones, the degrees that
measure how far one must be

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.900
in the family tree from another
before the two can marry.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.200
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's right here.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.660
&gt;&gt; Dorn: According to Canon
Law, you can't be too close,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.740
you must have a certain
number of degrees between you

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.760
and this helps you count and any
two family members how many degrees

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.060
apart they are.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.940
So this is an interesting chart.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.460
You will find it in a lot of books.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.890
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It kind of
resembles some of those paintings

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.390
that I have seen in the colonial
period in Mexico that have kind

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.450
of relationships to
the notion of God.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.520
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It sounds mystical.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.640
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yeah, it does
and so this is kind of a lot

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.160
of things going on in here.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.460
But it's good.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.760
I have never seen that,
a diagram like that.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.060
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Oh, okay.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.360
&gt;&gt; Herrera: How about that.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.660
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So we have,
some of the books

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.480
in the Law Library were there is
a little bit more of elaboration,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.690
the diagrams are like this but they
branch out in seven directions,

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:19.050 position:56%
seven degrees in this way, seven
degrees in this way, and the artists

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.650
who create those diagrams
take the opportunity

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.950
to make them really special.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.250
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.550
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And so that's
something to see sometime.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.850
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Then you have more
colors in there and everything.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.150
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.450
&gt;&gt; Herrera: ...the paint.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.750
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It's quite pretty.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.050
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's beautiful.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.350
You have to look at
that, it's amazing!

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.390
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And so here we are
in colonial Spain and...

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.480
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Tell us
about this man here.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.910
&gt;&gt; Dorn: This is a
manuscript created

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.500
by a man who's suffered
some kind of insult.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.920
His rights weren't respected,
and the rights that he presumed

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.960
that he had as a member
of the aristocracy.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.950
And so what one does if that
happens is one goes to court

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.630
to claim your right
according to your privilege.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.800
And so happy was he that
he vindicated his claim...

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.420
&gt;&gt; Herrera: So he won the case.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.940
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Won the case...that
he sat down and had somebody,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.930
probably not him, probably
an expert,

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.310
produce this beautiful manuscript,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:15.600
a just beautifully written
manuscript documenting his claims.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.900
&gt;&gt; Herrera: His claims...

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.090
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So here's this
beautiful illumination.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.030
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It is and
how old is this book?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.410
&gt;&gt; Dorn: From 1598.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.510
&gt;&gt; Herrera: 1598 and the
case of a noble that wanted

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.360
to make sure everybody knew
that he indeed was a noble man

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.330
or a member of the aristocracy.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Juan Gutierrez de Peralta.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.950
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yeah...Juan
Gutierrez de Peralta.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.260
&gt;&gt; Dorn: We don't want
to forget this.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:48.540
In our conversation earlier,
our conversation ranged all

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.480
over the place, but one of
the things that we spoke

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:58.460
about was the destiny of some
of the Spanish empire's holdings

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.160
that would eventually become parts
of the United States of America.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.970
And so I mentioned this item
which is a really special item

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.270
in the Law Library's collection.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.320
It's one of a kind, that is to say,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.370
we don't know of another
copy of this item.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.250
It's a printed item so there should
be other copies but we don't know

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.710
of another existing copy.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:22.840
This one is, this is
a batch of ordinances

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.450
for Florida created in 1821.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.400
I think some people remember
that Florida became part

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.090
of the United States
in part by filibuster.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:36.910
That is to say Andrew Jackson was
permitted or ordered or permitted

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.430
to go across the border from
Georgia into Spanish Florida

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:46.070
to rout the threat of some kind of
incursion by Indians into Georgia.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:51.070 position:56%
And what the entire factual
background of that story is a matter

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:56.270
for historians, but certainly
Jackson entered Florida,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.970
put to rout the local Indians
and took control of Florida.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.790 position:56%
And these ordnances were promulgated
just after that conquest.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.840
Now what you really liked, you
remind me, is Ordnance Number 3.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.140
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Ordinance Number 3.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.630
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Ordinance Number
3 of these ordinances.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:13.930
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Here it is.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.230
Get ready everybody.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.530
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Alright.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.940
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I was pretty
surprised when you told me

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.670
about this and we looked at it.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:27.160
In effect, Andrew Jackson declared
citizenship rights to all those

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.650
at that moment in this
land called Florida.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.130
&gt;&gt; Dorn: That's what happened.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And in a quick statement
and a written declaration also,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.310
or a verbal statement only?

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.300
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Well, he published
some kind of ordinance

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:49.570
as the territorial governor of
the federal territory of Florida,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:55.190
and the ordinance that he published
says this, Ordinance Number 3,

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.290
an ordinance providing for the
naturalization of inhabitants

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.370
of the ceded territory by
Major General Andrew Jackson,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.260
Governor of the Provinces of the
Floridas exercising the powers

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.120
of the Captain-General and the
Intendant of the Island of Cuba

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.070
over said Provinces
and the Governors

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.550
of said Provinces respectively.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.770
Okay, so the idea here
is that simply by fiat,

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.650
Andrew Jackson made the
inhabitants of Florida citizens.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:28.920
Now I spoke with, off the record
right, I spoke with a lawyer,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.680
an immigration lawyer who said well
of course this is unconstitutional.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.950
And so the question
immediately came up, right?

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.330
What about the citizenship
of all those Florida people,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.630
which of course was taken care

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.260
of by the fourteenth
amendment, no problem.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.580 position:56%
They are all citizens, but certainly
for a few years after this,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.690
it does raise a big question like
what was the meaning of this,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.570
how much validity could it have
had, what was the legal background

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.540
that he was able to make
this proclamation, or not.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.840
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.530
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Anyway, it's
a great little story.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.210
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And we have it here.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.510
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, we do.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.720
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And of course
this brings up so many things.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:12.090
It kind of brings up the power of
laws, the role that laws played

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.770
and how they're made and how they
unfold through time as we notice

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.300
with Las Siete Partidas and
Spain and Mexico and New Orleans,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.160
the unfolding of those laws
and adaptation and assimilation

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.140
of those laws and how words
and letters and writing,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.100
how important they are,
how powerful they are,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.750 position:56%
and with illumination manuscripts
proving the honor of a noble person,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.580
nobleman, and the aristocracy
and how these are available,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.250
and in many ways in how we don't
really know they're available

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.870
in many cases and we have them
here at the Library of Congress...

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.170
&gt;&gt; Dorn: We sure do...

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.470
&gt;&gt; Herrera: ...in the
Law Library of Congress.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.130 position:56%
And what do you think would be good?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.130
Let me see, I'm thinking out
loud with Nathan right now.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:02.410 position:56%
I want everybody, we want all of you
to think about these beautiful books

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.340
and you know they're ancient in
some ways, five hundred years.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.680
That's a long time.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.290
And they go back in time, the
Visigoths, Spain, and Mesoamerica,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:17.360
and Mexico, and conquests,
and the rules of marriage,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.410
the laws that govern our lives,
and citizenship, and books.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.670
So, I want you to think about
all these things, about writing,

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.330
and indeed it is powerful.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.710
And indeed, we create our
societies and follow our lives,

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.730
and in many ways, shape our
lives with these materials

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.880
and these voices, and these
studies, and these laws

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.570
and rules and marriage and family.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.690
What are those things...how
to guide ourselves.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.030
How to guide ourselves.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.330
&gt;&gt; Dorn: That's what we do here.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.700
&gt;&gt; Herrera: We were talking about
that, how to guide our lives.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.560
And we do have rules
and yet there's room

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.540
for creativity and interpretation.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.840
That's what it is.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.140
&gt;&gt; Dorn: That's true.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.350
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes, so let's
interpret and let's create.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.680
Thanks so much, Nathan.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.980
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It's a pleasure.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.280
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Thank you so much.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.580
I learned a lot.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.880
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Me, too!

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.180
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I am going to
have to read these books.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.480
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Good luck.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.390
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Thanks a
lot, that was great.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.250
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
