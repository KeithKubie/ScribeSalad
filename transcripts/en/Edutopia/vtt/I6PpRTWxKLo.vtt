Daniel Goleman: The central premise
of my book is that today more

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:10.766
than ever in human history our
ability to focus is challenged

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:14.116
by new technologies, by
things that are distracting.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.526
You see couples at dinner,

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:20.136
both looking at their phones
and not at each other.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:24.156
You see moms taking care of a
kid, holding the kid in one arm

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:27.906
and staring at a phone in the
other, and the fact is that students

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.736
and teachers are more
distracted than ever.

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.896
It's a new normal and yet the basis

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:36.776
of learning is being
able to pay attention.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.946
It takes sustained attention

00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:41.336
to comprehend what the
teacher is telling you.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:44.806
It takes a continuous,
unbroken attention

00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:46.716
to read a passage in a book.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.826
And in a time when we're
raising children in an atmosphere

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.966
where the normal thing to do is
to be distracted all the time,

00:00:54.436 --> 00:01:00.766
we have to be explicit and make an
effort more than any time in history

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:05.226
to help children learn something
very simple, it's the basis

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:06.926
of learning-- to pay attention.
