00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.440
[inaudible]

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.610
<v 1>like a boss.</v>

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.880
I came across this group called the shadows and they got a song called FBI and

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.430
you just have to see the synchronized dancing,

5
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:20.640
the choreography that they're doing.
Um,

6
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.960
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.290
<v 1>you know,
you guys can keep sending me the bad covers,</v>

8
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:39.291
but a whole nother level of funny is some of the bad choreography because

9
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.340
nowadays when you look at the choreography that people do,
it's like a,

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.300
I mean,
th the,
the dancers nowadays are so good,

11
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:52.301
they'll have 20 people on stage and you're watching them and they're all moving.

12
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.060
They're doing the exact same move at the exact same time.

13
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.113
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible] hum.</v>

14
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.510
<v 1>And back then in the 60s,
it was basically,</v>

15
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:28.511
as long as you were doing the same movement within three seconds of the person

16
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:33.500
to either side of you,
it was considered,
uh,
if it's considered,

17
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:37.940
I guess decent.
So check out a search shadows,

18
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.610
FBI.
This is some of the worst choreography I've seen.
And uh,

19
00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:46.140
if you want some bad heavy metal,
this is a whole nother genre.

20
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.670
And I haven't even tip even even like tapped the surface of this.
Uh,

21
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.750
look up Britny Fox and Brittany's B R I t e n y Fox girls' school live.

22
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.420
And just watch the first 10 seconds of their stupid swishing back and forth that

23
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.290
I thought was fucking cool as hell are here is Brittany Pot.

24
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.120
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

25
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.870
<v 1>I literally saw it and I was like,
oh my God,
this is,
this is,
uh,
I was like,</v>

26
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.420
oh my God.
No.
I was like,
I literally said,
Oh my God.

27
00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:35.530
I know a fucking ditzy girls have ruined saying,
oh my God.
But it used to exist,

28
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.280
you know,

29
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.280
like when you saw Zeplin fucking burning back to the goddamn earth with people

30
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:43.850
on fire jumping out of it.
Yeah.

31
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.240
<v 0>And you're about to see the pictures he got when the ship exploded.</v>

32
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.210
Those aboard leaping polite from a flaming inferno.

33
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.250
The actual pressure of the Hindenburg,

34
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.010
an airship destroyed in less than half a minute.

35
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
[inaudible]

36
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.620
<v 1>oh,
that was all the humanity.
Um,</v>

37
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.320
and then the last one isn't even synchronized dancing,

38
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.030
but this is the main reason why it took me so long.

39
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.340
And I never really got into Dave Matthews was that stupid dance,

40
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.860
that White Guy,
James Brown fucking dance that Dave Matthews used to do.

41
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.500
Just search Dave Matthews dance and it's,

42
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.640
it's,
you know,

43
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.650
you really just want John Belushi to come back from the dead and do that animal

44
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.990
house scene where he smashes the guy's guitar.

45
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.500
Except you really want them just hit Dave right over his fucking head.

46
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.240
No.
[inaudible]

47
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.260
<v 0>[inaudible] sorry.</v>

48
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.070
<v 1>And the only reason why I ever got in to listening to Dave Matthews was,</v>

49
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.980
uh,
their drummer.

50
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.990
And then I really liked it was a saxophone solo that I just thought was the shit

51
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.850
on one of their earlier,
uh,
earlier ones.
Other than that,
I just,
I,

52
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.660
I don't know,
I just haven't been into them.
So you know,
if you,
you know,
now,

53
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:40.430
right there,
that's a lot of work.
That's a lot of shit to go look up.
What,

54
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:44.060
you know,
what,
why don't you take the express checkout line?
Okay.

55
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:47.660
The automated checkout line and just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we'll

56
00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:50.480
have all those fucking videos right up there.
You can watch them.

57
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.190
We'll have them in order the highway to hell,
right?
The Dave Matthews,

58
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.700
I mean,
very little times in life,

59
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:03.290
do what would I ever be on the side of a bully?
But I swear to God,

60
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.760
if right in the middle of his dance,

61
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.590
if the stereotypical high school football player walked up to him with his

62
00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:13.040
jersey,
still on with two of his other meathead friends,

63
00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:17.240
and they just stuffed him into some locker that they brought on stage and

64
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:18.320
smashed his guitar,

65
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.860
you could hear me laughing from the back of the fucking stadium that they were

66
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:26.570
playing.
I would completely enjoy it.
And I don't know what that says about me.

67
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
