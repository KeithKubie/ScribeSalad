00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.070
For many of us, having the right sort of social
life has never been too easy.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.000
It’s been hard to find a group of people
who are sensitive, thoughtful, intelligent,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.270
open to introspection and discussion. There’s
a sense that they must be out there somewhere.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.860
But how to find them?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.080
Being the more introverted types, going to
a bar or a club or parties has never felt

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080
too comfortable.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.130
So for too long, we’ve been on our own,
communing with the right sort of person only

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.770
in our imaginations, often via books.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.340
And all over the world, compatible sorts of
people have failed to meet one another.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.989
Until now, when the School of Life is ready
to launch a new kind of app expressly designed

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.030
to connect introspective, thoughtful types
of people, that is, people interested in intelligent,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.600
and sincere conversation about emotions above
anything else.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.300
We previously built an app, it taught us so
much, but it had limited functionality and

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.889
it existed only on Ios. Our new one is in
a whole different league: it’s capable of

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:15.929
live 1-on-1 chat, direct messaging, geolocation
grouping and a whole lot more. Crucially,

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.649
it exists on Ios, on Android, and to those
who don’t like apps and just work on desktops

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.049
and laptops, on an ordinary web browser too.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.109
We’ve been isolated for too long - needlessly
lonely with our thoughts when potential friends

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.509
were so close at hand. We urge you to download
our new app right now - and find the sort

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.189
of interesting friends we all long for.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.719
See you online.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.889

Life app, please click on the link on your
