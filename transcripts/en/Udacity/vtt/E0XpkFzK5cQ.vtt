00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
We're going to start off this unit with a small technical detail.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.130
When we considered our three problems, vertex cover, independent set, and clique,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.220
we always said that we were looking for the best possible solution.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.460
So, for example, for the largest independent set or the smallest vertex cover.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.460
This type of problem is known as an optimization problem

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300
because we're trying to maximize or minimize some value.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.950
In this unit, we're mostly going to work with a slightly different

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.420
version of these problems called decision problems.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.300
So we're not going to ask, for example, what is the smallest possible vertex cover?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.370
But rather we're going to ask, does a graph have a vertex cover that is smaller than some number of k?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.240
And k is given to us in advance.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.040
So the main difference between an optimization problem and a decision problem

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.650
is that for an optimization problem, we ask, find us the best possible solution?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.080
Or what's the best possible value that we can achieve?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.560
And in a decision problem, we have to ask, is it possible to achieve a value of k?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.200
And so up here the answer will be some number. And down here, the answer can only be yes or no.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.040
And there are two main reasons why we do this.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.190
First of all, it makes our lives much easier in some of the proofs that we're going to dive into.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.860
And secondly, it's also a little bit more accurate because when you talk about

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.020
the P versus NP problem, although it's often stated for optimization problems

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.790
such as those we have so far discussed, the whole theory

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.240
has actually been developed for decision problems.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.860
Now, you're probably thinking what difference does it make to talk

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.610
about an optimization problem versus a decision problem?

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.700
Or is this going to make any significant difference, for example, with the question of tractability

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.450
versus intractability and actually it doesn't really make that much of a difference,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.430
but I'll actually have you figure out the details here in our next quiz.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.910
And I would like you to think about four things and then give me your answer.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.890
So the first question is, if the optimization version of a problem turns out to be tractable,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.980
then what about the decision version of that problem?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.290
Do we know that decision versions for sure to be tractable, intractable, or can we really say?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.880
The second question I have for you is the same thing, only with intractability,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.380
so if we know the optimization version of a problem to be intractable,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.090
then what about the decision version, is that for sure, going to be tractable, intractable,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.430
or is this a case where we can't really make a clear statement having only this information here

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.550
that the optimization version is intractable, and finally questions number 3 and 4

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.200
are exactly the other way around than questions 1 and 2, so here we have information

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.960
about the decision version of a problem, so question number 3,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.120
if the decision version of a problem is tractable, then what about the optimization version?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.550
And question number 4, if the decision version of a problem is intractable,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.330
then what about the optimization version?

00:02:48.330 --> 99:59:59.000
So please give your answers here with one of each of the three possible choices here.
