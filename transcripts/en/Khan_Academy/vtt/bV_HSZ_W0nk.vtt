00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.760
Let omega be a complex cube
root of unity with omega

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.730
not being equal to 1.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.510
A fair die is
thrown three times.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.680
If r1, r2, r3 are the
numbers obtained on the die,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.480
then the probability
that omega to the r1 plus

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.940
omega to the r2 plus
omega to the r3 equals 0

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.496
is-- it's a fascinating problem.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:22.120
So let's just start
with the first part

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.286
and then see if some patterns
fall into place for us

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.810
to be able to tackle
the second part.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.460
So omega is a complex
cube root of unity,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.890
which is just a fancy way of
saying it's a complex cube

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.940
root of 1, with omega
not being equal to 1.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.840
So let's just set
up an equation here.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.240
Let's just think about all
of the cube roots of 1.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.800
So if we say-- that's analogous
to figuring out all of the x's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.780
that satisfy x to the
third is equal to 1.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.480
Or we can subtract 1 from
both sides of this equation

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.920
and write this as x to the
third minus 1 is equal to zero.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.180
All of the roots of
this equation right

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.269
here will be cube roots of 1.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.067
They will satisfy
this over here.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.400
This is the same thing as--
I could write it over here--

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.030
x is equal to the
cube root of 1.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.000
These are all
equivalent statements.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.490
So how do we do that?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.120
Well, we know what
one of the roots are.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.206
We know that x
equals 1 is a root.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:28.830
Or another way we
could think about it,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.010
we know that x minus
1 is a factor here.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.420
We know that this
can be factored

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.380
as x minus 1 times something,
something something squared

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.680
plus something x.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.780
Some quadratic,
some-- let me write

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.460
here-- some quadratic right
here is equal to zero.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.704
We can factor this.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.370
And to figure out
what the quadratic is,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.380
we just have to do a
little bit of polynomial,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.680
or I guess we could call
it algebraic long division.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.200
We just have to divide
x minus 1 into this,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.190
and then we'll get
what this quadratic is.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.750
So let's do that.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.380
Let us divide x minus 1
into x to the third minus 1.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.480
And I'll do it in place.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.980
So this is the third degree
place. x to the third,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.410
I'll leave space for
the x squared place,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.970
leave space for the
x to the first place,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.430
and then we have x to the
zero, which is the ones place.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.450
So that's negative 1.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.075
So I just wrote x to
the third minus 1,

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.460
but I wrote it
out this so I have

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.520
space to keep our
counting pretty clean.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.230
So we just do algebraic
long division here.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.411
So x minus 1 goes into
x to the third minus 1,

00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.160
you just look at the
highest degree terms.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.670
x goes into x to the
third x squared times.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.350
It goes x squared times.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.570
x squared times x
is x to the third.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.770
x squared times negative
1 is minus x squared.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.520
Now, we want to subtract
the magenta stuff

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.110
from the orange stuff, or we
could add the negative of it.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.150
So let's just multiply
this times negative 1.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.240
So positive-- sorry, we're
multiplying times negative 1.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.740
So this is a negative, and then
this will become a positive.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.230
We're subtracting
what I originally

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.355
had written from that, but
I just made it negative.

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:08.140
And now we'll add.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.000
And so this will become--
these cancel out.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.590
We get x squared minus 1.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470
Just algebraic long division.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.850
Once again, how many
times does x minus 1

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.300
go into x squared minus 1?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.100
Look at the highest
degree terms.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.510
x goes into x squared--
I'll just arbitrarily switch

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.310
colors-- x goes into
x squared x times.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.482
So this is plus x.

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:35.550
x times x is x squared.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.710
x times negative
1 is negative x.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.830
Same drill.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.500
Subtract this from up there,
or we could add the negative.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.820
So this becomes negative,
this becomes positive.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.400
These guys cancel out.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.760
You get x-- bring
this down-- x minus 1.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.240
x minus 1 goes into x
minus 1 exactly one time.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.040
It goes exactly one time.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.920
1 times x minus 1 is x minus 1.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.670
And you get a remainder of zero.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.760
So it divided evenly,
which makes sense.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.820
Because this is one of
the factors of that.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.800
We know that this is a root.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.120
So if we wanted to
completely factor this,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.529
we could write this as x
minus 1 times this thing

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.120
over here, times the
quadratic, times x

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.340
squared plus x plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.600
So if we wanted to find
the non-one roots of this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.150
over here, we just have to find
the roots of this thing right

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.670
over here.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.700
Whatever the roots
are of this are

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.460
going to make this expression
equal to 0, which would make

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.280
this entire
expression equal to 0,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.000
make this entire
expression equal zero.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.276
So we just have to
find this guy's roots.

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.650
And I can already guess that
they're going to be complex.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.460
So don't even
attempt to factor it.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.575
You could attempt to
factor it if you like just

00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:50.950
by looking at it,
but we're going

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.570
to use the quadratic formula.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.620
So the roots here
for this part--

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.410
we say x is equal to negative b.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.510
b is 1, so negative 1 plus
or minus the square root of b

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.889
squared, b is 1, so 1
minus 4 times a times c.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:11.930
Well, a and c are both 1.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.160
So it's just minus 4.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.870
All of that over 2
times a. a is just 1.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.290
So all of that over 2.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.940
So x is equal to
negative 1 plus or minus

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.930
the square root of
negative 3-- we were right,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.460
this is going to be a
complex root-- over 2.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.874
Now, what's the square
root of negative 3?

00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:37.040
We could write this-- the
square root of negative 3,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.950
this is the same thing as
the square root of negative 1

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.160
times the square root of 3.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.530
And this we know from
studying imaginary numbers

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.420
and complex numbers.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.080
This is i.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.550
That right there is i.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.330
So the other roots--
and there are two here,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.334
because we're plus
square root of negative 3

00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.250
and subtracting the
square root of negative 3.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.150
So the other roots are x
could be equal to negative 1

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.060
plus or minus the square
root of 3 times i.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.860
And I'll put i here, just
so it's nice and clear.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.840
That's not a vector.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.070
Just like that.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.790
i.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.200
All of that over 2.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.930
So what we just did
so far is we were

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.762
able-- we now know
all three roots of 1.

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.970
Especially if we're thinking
about the complex roots.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.610
1 is one of the roots.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.100
The other roots are negative
1 plus the square root

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.850
of 3i over 2, and negative 1
minus the square root of 3i

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.020
over 2.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.127
And so they're saying that
omega is one of these two roots.

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:44.960
We either take the
positive or the negative.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.459
And it looks like
it doesn't matter.

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:50.620
It says let omega be a
complex cube root of unity.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.440
So it could either one of these.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.950
So let's just pick one of them.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:01.190
So let's just say omega
is equal to negative 1

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.100
minus the square root
of 3i-- and I'll just

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.691
distribute the divided by 2.

00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.190
So we could say we
could call this--

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.960
let me write it this way.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.640
It's negative 1/2 minus
the square root of 3/2i.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.570
I'm just picking-- once
again, not a vector.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.710
My brain keeps wanting me to
put a little hat on top of it.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.370
It's not a vector.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.620
It's just an imaginary number.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.180
It's i.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.596
This is actually
a complex number,

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.150
because we have a real
part and an imaginary part.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.590
So I'm just going to
pick that to be my omega.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.830
It's one of the non-one
complex roots, third roots,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.460
or I guess we could say-- what
was the actual wording they

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.440
said-- one of the
complex cube roots of 1,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.540
of unity, that is not 1.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.370
So let's just let
omega be equal to that.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.970
So this first statement
can translate into this.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.720
And then a fair die
is thrown three times.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.500
If r1, r2, and r3 are the
numbers obtained on the die,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.926
then the probability
that omega to the r--

00:07:57.926 --> 00:07:59.550
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.946
Because we're going to be taking
omega to different powers.

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:04.320
So let's think
about what happens

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.060
when we take this omega
to different powers.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.950
So this right here is clearly
omega to the first power,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.470
the way we've defined it.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.000
Let's think about
what omega squared is.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.500
So omega squared is
equal to negative 1/2

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.120
minus square root of 3 over
2i-- and this will give us

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.600
good practice multiplying
complex numbers-- times

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.960
negative 1/2 minus times--
well, it's the same thing.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.409
We're squaring it.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.700
And so this is going to be
equal to negative 1/2 times

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.750
negative 1/2 is positive 1/4.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.640
And then you have negative
1/2 times negative 3/2i.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.820
The negatives cancel out.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.540
The square root of
3/2 I should say.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.520
So negative 1/2
times this is going

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.410
to be positive
square root of 3/4i.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.535
Then we could multiply
this times this.

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:02.410
It's going to give us
the same thing as that.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.440
So the negatives cancel out.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.040
And so we have plus the
square root of 3/4i.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.900
And then we're going to
want to multiply the two

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.390
imaginary terms.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.187
So the negatives cancel out.

00:09:17.187 --> 00:09:19.520
And so you have square root
of 3 times square root of 3,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.550
which is just 3.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.870
And then you have 2
times 2, which is 4.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.370
And then you have i times
i, which is negative 1.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.710
So let me just put a negative 1.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.670
So times negative 1 over here.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.560
So let's simplify this.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:42.410
This gives us 1/4 plus
square root of 3/4i

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.130
plus square root of 3/4i.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.570
That's 2 square roots
of 3/4i or square root

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.120
of-- so that's the same
thing as square root of 3/2i.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.743
And then minus 3/4.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.500
And we can simplify
this even more.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.700
The real parts, we can add
1/4 minus 3/4 is negative 2/4,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.770
or negative 1/2.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:10.754
So this is negative 1/2 plus
the square root of 3/2i.

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:11.670
So that's interesting.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.220
When I squared omega,
I got another one

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.780
of the complex cube roots of 1.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.440
I actually got its conjugate.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.650
And if any of y'all who've
studied complex analysis

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.150
and think about
the complex plane,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.983
it should be pretty
clear why this happened.

00:10:25.983 --> 00:10:27.990
But if you don't, don't
worry too much about it.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.200
Now what I want to do
is I want to take omega

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.500
to the third power, just
to really understand

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.640
what's happening with omega.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.490
And if you've studied
complex analysis,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.220
this part would be
quicker for you.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.150
You would know it.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.736
So what's omega to
the third power?

00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:43.110
Omega to the third
power is going

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.990
to be omega squared times omega.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.970
Omega squared is just
that right over there.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.120
We just calculated it.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:56.992
It's negative 1/2 plus
square root of 3/2i.

00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:59.200
And we're going to have to
multiply that times omega.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.920
Omega was the conjugate
of this thing.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.590
So it's negative 1/2
minus-- conjugate just

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.170
means opposite side
on the complex part.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.065
So minus square root of 3/2i.

00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:12.190
That's what we defined
omega to be right over here.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.970
This right over here is omega.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.160
That's omega.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.420
This right here
is omega squared.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.270
So let's multiply these.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.160
So first, negative
1/2 times negative 1/2

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.410
gives us negative-- sorry,
gives us positive 1/4.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.250
Have to be careful.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.430
This gives us 1/4.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.326
And then if we
take negative 1/2--

00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:36.450
I shouldn't do it that way.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.930
Let's do negative 1/2 times
negative square root of 3/2i.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.320
Negatives cancel out, so we
get plus the square root of 3--

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.310
let me make sure I have--
square root of 3/4i.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.675
And then we can multiply
this times this.

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:55.800
It gives us the same thing.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.259
So it gives us plus-- let me
make sure I'm doing this right.

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:02.300
Oh, no, it's not going to
give us the same thing.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.610
Now one is negative,
one is positive.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.690
So it's going to give
us-- be very careful.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.870
So negative 1/2 times
positive square root of 3/2i

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.955
is negative square root of 3/4i.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.500
And then finally, multiply
the two imaginary parts.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.600
Multiply that-- I want to use
a different color-- multiply

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.426
that times that.

00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:29.720
That gives us positive times a
negative gives us a negative.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.350
Square root of 3 times
square root of 3 is 3.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.400
2 times 2 is 4.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.220
i times i is negative 1.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.080
Or we can multiply
the negative 1 times

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.090
this negative over here,
becomes a positive.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.150
So what do we get?

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.940
These guys cancel out.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.385
We have 1/4 fourth plus 3/4.

00:12:45.385 --> 00:12:50.060
It is equal to 1.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.670
So this is interesting.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.490
This is interesting over here.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.580
So omega is equal to this
thing right over here.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.440
Omega squared is equal
to its conjugate.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.680
Omega squared is equal to its
conjugate right over here.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.450
We just swapped the
sign over there.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.040
And then omega to
the third is going

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.200
to be equal to this thing.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.600
It's going to be equal to unity.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.200
Actually, we knew that.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.950
I shouldn't even have
to worry about this.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.270
I don't know why I even
went through that process.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.520
Well, it was good multiplying.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.207
We knew it was the
cube root of unity.

00:13:17.207 --> 00:13:19.040
So we knew if we took
it to the third power.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.880
So this was to some degree
just a waste of time.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.160
But what does this tell us?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.821
So we now kind of
understand what

00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:26.070
the different powers of omega.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.480
What will omega to
the fourth power be?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.279
What's going to be
this times omega?

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:31.820
So it's just going
to be omega again.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.030
What's omega to the fifth power?

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.050
It's going to be this.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.090
What's omega to the sixth power?

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.465
It's going to be this again.

00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:38.840
So let's just use
that, and we're

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.006
going to tackle that in the
next part of the problem

00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:42.850
in the next video.
