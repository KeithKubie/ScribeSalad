00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
censorship and therefore ending up in a
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.570
censorship and therefore ending up in a
very bad place and I think it's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580
very bad place and I think it's
 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.580
very bad place and I think it's
perfectly legitimate to be highly
