00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.700
Can you tell us a little bit about
what one of these forecaster's is?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; Sure, so at a very high level,
forecasting is a pretty simple problem.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.690
What it basically is about.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.350
We do some analysis to calculate demand,
to forecast demand of products in

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.280
the absence of any kind of promotional
activity or any other kinds of events,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.480
special events that might cause
spikes or troughs in demand.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.310
And that generates something
called a baseline forecast.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.820
So we have some algorithms
that are responsible for

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.400
generating baseline forecasts by doing
an historical analysis of sales data.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.010
We then have a separate
set of algorithms that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.450
calculate what we call
incremental sales.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.830
This is an additional uplift or
it could also be negative uplift

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.910
from the base line when certain
special events are in play,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660
like a promotion, a mother's day
promotion that's going to cause

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.100
an uptake in the sale of flowers and
gift cards, right?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.890
Christmas is going to, yeah, or

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.270
any other kind of holiday is
going to have and uptake in sales.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
So, we tend to think of a forecaster.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.990
The thing that actually calculates
forecasts as being decomposed into

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.890
a baseline forecaster and
an incremental forecaster.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.650
And each of those things
can be parameterized.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.200
And then put together to form the actual
forecaster that you want to use to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.320
generate to calculate demand for
products in stores.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.110
So that's a forecaster
kind of in the abstract.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.570
It gives you some idea of what
some of the features in it are and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510
how they might compose.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.510
&gt;&gt; And can you give us a,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.250
a picture of what this forecaster is
like in terms of its assembly spec.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.540
&gt;&gt; So, if you look at this slide,
you'll see a very simple example.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.840
Probably the simplest example.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.950
I call it the Hello World!

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.950
Of forecasters.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.840
And you'll see it just has four lines.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.200
Right.
So, those four lines explain how to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.800
generate four different components
that are used with one another.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.710
In this case, we've got a really
simple one called bForecast, for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.950
baseline Forecast.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.180
One called mults for multipliers.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.510
These are the multipliers that are used
to calculate the incremental uplift

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.380
when there are different promotions and
such in place.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.300
We use this two components, bForecast
and mults to generate an incremental

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.390
forecast, where they calculate
the actual incremental forecast.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.170
And then, we put the incremental
forecaster and the baseline forecaster

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.700
together into a component called batch,
which is a batch forecaster.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.400
And so what that does, and we can go
into in a moment exactly how it does it.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.940
But as you can see, we start with
some kind of elementary components,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.240
the baseline forecaster and
the multipliers.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.350
And then, we compose those with
some reusable features incre for

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.970
incremental, and fcst for forecaster.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.190
We compose those together to make
an actual component called batch.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.840
And batch is the component that's
kind of the output of this thing.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.080
That you would then install in your
database to calculate your forecast.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.530
&gt;&gt; So
is this the description of one variant?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.240
&gt;&gt; This is the description
of one variant.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.740
That's correct.
