00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
We don't always feel comfortable admitting it to our friends; it's embarrassing, but

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.720
secretly the idea of being famous has great appeal.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.840
Fame seems to be the solution to so many problems.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.520
When you're famous people will make way for you in crowds. You'll get warm smiles from admiring strangers.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.580
You'll be safe from rejection.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.700
You won't have to explain who you are at each new occasion.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.900
People will be convinced by you before you even meet them.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.860
If ever you're unhappy about something, your complaints will be taken very seriously.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.340
Your happiness become the focus of everyone's effort.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.420
You'll be boss.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.520
The intense desire for fame probably has its roots in the experience of neglect-- in injury.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.380
No one would want to be famous who hadn't also somewhere in the past been made to feel extremely insignificant:

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.340
perhaps one's parents were hard to impress, that's why one dreams that one day the world would pay attention.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.320
Or, maybe our parents were great, but it was the wider world,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.300
starting with the schoolyard, that was intolerable after early years of adulation at home.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.780
In the end there's a problem: fame cannot really accomplish what is asked of it.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.620
Every new famous person who disintegrates, breaks down in public, or loses their mind,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:21.440
is judged in isolation, rather than being interpreted as a victim of an inevitable pattern within the pathology of fame.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.700
You want to be famous because you want people to like you,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.680
but the world isn't generally kind to the famous for very long, and the reason is basic:

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.880
the success of any one person involves humiliation for lots of others.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.680
The celebrity of a few people will always contrast painfully with the obscurity of the many.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740
Being famous upsets people.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.200
When we imagine fame,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.420
we forget that it's inextricably connected to being "too visible" in the eyes of some people.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.120
To bugging them on duty, to coming to be seen as the plausible cause of their humiliation

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.540
is symbol of how the world is treating them unfairly.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.680
Fame makes people more, not less vulnerable,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.740
because it throws them open to unlimited judgement.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.760
Everyone is rooted by a cruel assessment of their character or merit,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.480
but fame has had an added challenge in store--

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.460
the assessments will come in from legions of people

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.440
who would never dare to say to their faces

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.200
what they could not express for the safety of the newspaper office or the screen.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.340
We know from our own lives that a nasty remark can take a day or two to process.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.680
Social media hasn't helped; it's made it far easier than before to be famous,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.320
and therefore by necessity, far easier to be hated.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.880
The minor celebrity can now regularly face all of vitriol previously accorded only to Hollywood stars.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.200
Psychologically, the famous are of course, the very last people on earth

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.900
to be well-equipped to deal with what they're going through.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.980
After all, they only became famous because they were wounded,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.800
because they had thin skin,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.440
because they were, in some respect, a bit ill.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.480
And now, far from compensating them adequately for their disease, fame aggravates it exponentionally.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.260
Strangers voice their negative opinions in detail,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.220
unable or simply unwilling to imagine that famous people bleed far more quickly than anyone else.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.660
They might even think the famous aren't listening;

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.740
that one wouldn't become famous if one didn't suffer from a compulsion to listen too much.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.140
Every worst fear about oneself-- that one's stupid, ugly, not worthy of existence--

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.500
would daily be confirmed by strangers.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.480
One will be exposed to the fact that people one's never met about whom one will only have in good will,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.080
actively loath one; one will learn the devastation of one's personality is, in some quarters, a badge of honor.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.080
Sometimes the attacks will be horribly insightful;

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.360
at other times, they'll make no sense to anyone who really knows one.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.760
But the criticisms will lodge in people's minds nevertheless,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.360
and no lawyer, court case, or magician will ever be able to delete them.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.780
Needless to say, as a hurt celebrity, one won't be eligible for sympathy.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.120
The very concept of a hurt celebrity is a joke--

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.320
about as moving for the average person as the sadness of a tyrant.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.560
To sum up, fame really just means you get noticed a great deal--

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.440
not that you get understood, appreciated, or loved.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.180
At an individual level, the only mature strategy is to give up on fame.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.480
The aim that lay behind the desire for remains important; one does still want to be appreciated and understood.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.180
But the wise person accepts that celebrity does not actually provide these things.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.900
Appreciation and understanding are only available through individuals one knows or cares about--

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.260
not via groups of a thousand or a million strangers.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.140
There is no shortcut to friendship-- which is what the famous person is, in effect, seeking.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.300
For those who are already famous,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.460
the only way to stay sane is to stop listening to what the wider world is saying.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.880
This applies to the good things as much as to the bad. It's best not to know.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.760
The wise person knows that their products need attention,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.560
but they make a clear distinction between the purely practical needs of marketing and advocacy,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.120
and the intimate desire to be liked and treated with justice and kindness by people one doesn't know.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.180
At a collective political level,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.900
we should pay great attention to the fact that today, so many people, particularly young ones,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.920
want to be famous, and even see fame as a necessary condition for a successful life.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.980
Rather than dismiss this wish, we should grasp its underlying, worrying meaning:

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.080
they want to be famous because they're not being respected--

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.960
because citizens have forgotten how to accord one another

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.900
the degree of civility, appreciation, and decency that everyone craves and deserves.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.940
The desire for fame is a sign that an ordinary life has ceased to be good enough.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.180
The solution is not to encourage ever more people to become famous,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.380
but to put massive efforts into encouraging greater level of politeness and consideration for everyone--

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.340
in families, in communities, in work places, in politics, in the media,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.180
and all income levels, especially modest ones.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.260
Only then will a society give up on the understandable, but erroneous belief

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.100
that fame could guarantee the kindness of strangers.
