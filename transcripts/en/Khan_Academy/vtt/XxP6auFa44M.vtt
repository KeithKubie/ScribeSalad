00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.212
- [Voiceover] In this video
we're gonna talk a bunch

00:00:02.212 --> 00:00:05.720
about this fantastic
number e to the j omega t.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.807
And one of the coolest things
that's gonna happen here,

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.060
we're gonna bring together what we know

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.677
about complex numbers
and this exponential form

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:14.837
of complex numbers

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:17.870
and sines and cosines
as a function of time.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.218
And what we're gonna
end up with is the idea

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.135
of a number that spins.

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:25.784
I think this is really
one of the coolest things

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:28.746
in electronics and it's
really at the essence

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.413
of all signal processing theory.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.668
So this number here, e to the j omega t,

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.466
this is based on Euler's formula.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.460
Just as a reminder, Euler's formula is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.770
e to the j, we'll use
theta as our variable,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.353
equals cosine theta

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:50.946
plus j times sine of theta.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:55.253
That's one form of Euler's formula.

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:57.596
And the other form is with a
negative up in the exponent.

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.013
We say e to the minus j theta

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:03.306
equals cosine theta

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.041
minus j sine theta.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:16.149
Now if I go and plot this,
what it looks like is this.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.009
So if I plot this on a complex plane,

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.925
and that's a plane that has a real axis

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.758
and an imaginary axis.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:32.767
Now we remember that j is
the variable that we use

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.544
for the imaginary unit.

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.978
A j squared is equal to minus one.

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:41.145
And we use that in electrical
engineering instead of i.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.553
One way to express this number is

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.888
by plotting it on this complex plane.

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:50.564
And so if I pick out a location
for some complex number

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:54.949
and I say, oh, okay,
this is the x-coordinate

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:56.532
is cosine of theta.

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.875
And what's this coordinate here?

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:05.598
On the j-axis, that's sine theta.

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:12.494
And if I draw a line
right through our number,

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:14.494
this is the angle theta.

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.682
So this is one of the
representations of complex numbers

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.874
is this Euler's formula
or the exponential form.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:25.304
And we can represent it this way here.

00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:26.530
This notation is challenging.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.203
I can't help but every time I look at this

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:31.894
I start to do e to the
complex to something

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:35.665
and everything I know
about taking exponents

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:38.838
and things like that, it kind
of confuses me in my head.

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:41.260
But what I've done over
time is basically say,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.460
e to the j anything, that
whole thing is a complex number

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.059
and this is what that complex
number looks like right there.

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.564
So let's take a look at
some of the properties

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.003
of this complex number.

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.380
One of the things we can ask is

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.880
what is the magnitude of e to the j theta?

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.256
If I put magnitude absolute value

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.125
or magnitude bars around that.

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.359
And what that says is what
is this value here for r?

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.526
And we can figure that out
using the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.072
What we know is this squared

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.423
equals x value squared which is cosine

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.850
plus the y value squared
which is sine theta.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.850
So it equals cosine squared of theta

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.589
plus sine squared of theta.

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.476
Okay, that's just, we just
applied the Pythagorean Theorem

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.939
to this right triangle right here,

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.606
this right triangle.

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:45.801
Now from trigonometry, from
trigonometry we know what?

00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:47.277
What's the value of this?

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:51.444
Cosine squared plus sine squared
for any angle equals one.

00:03:53.748 --> 00:03:58.478
So that tells us that e to
the j theta magnitude squared

00:03:58.478 --> 00:03:59.867
is equal to one

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:04.046
or that e to the j theta
magnitude is also one.

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:08.845
All right, so we can write
down e to the j theta,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:12.659
the magnitude of that is equal to one.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.696
Let's go back to our friend up here.

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:16.112
That says that the length of this vector,

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.504
this is a complex number,

00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:20.602
that is distance one away from the origin.

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:21.535
So we'll tuck that away.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:24.918
We know that the magnitude
of e to the j theta is one

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.461
and I can actually go over here

00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:29.711
and draw now a circle on here like this

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.917
and if I put the circle
right through there,

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:37.236
there's the unit circle
and it has a radius of one.

00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:39.771
So I know that for any value of theta

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:43.104
that my complex number e to the j theta,

00:04:46.222 --> 00:04:49.546
it's gonna be somewhere
on this yellow circle.

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:52.110
So e to the j theta is
somewhere on this circle

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.431
and the angle is what?

00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:55.065
The angle is right here.

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:58.635
It's whatever is multiplied
by j up in that exponent.

00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:02.406
Anything that multiplies
by j, that's an angle.

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:03.519
So what if I wanted something

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.965
that wasn't on the unit circle?

00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:06.767
What if I wanted something
that was farther away

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:08.840
from the origin than that?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.048
Well what I would do is I would say,

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:15.131
I would take A, some
amplitude, e to the j theta,

00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:20.777
and this amplitude would expand
the length of that vector.

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:24.652
So, I would say, if I wanted
to know how far away it is,

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:26.907
well, the magnitude of
e to the j theta is one,

00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:28.968
and the magnitude of A is A.

00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.385
So this equals A.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.192
And if I was to sketch
in a circle for that,

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:39.942
let's say A was a little
bit bigger than one,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.774
it would be a little bit bigger out,

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:45.524
and this would have a value here.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:50.942
That would be a value of
A, the radius would be A.

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:53.047
Pretty flexible notation.

00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:55.504
So with this notation we
can represent any number

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:59.855
in the complex plane with
this kind of format here.

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:01.126
We'll take a little break here

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.419
and in the next video
we'll put in for theta,

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.733
we'll put in an argument
that has to do with time

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:09.077
and we'll see what happens
to this complex exponential.
