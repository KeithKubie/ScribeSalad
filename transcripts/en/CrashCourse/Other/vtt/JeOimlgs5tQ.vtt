Hi, I'm hank green

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.049
And I'm John Green. Here at crash course our mission is to create quality

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.250
educational content that we can release for free for everyone forever

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.950
Thanks to our patrons on patreon as well as support from PBS Digital Studios. We've been able to keep this channel growing

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.250
We're currently uploading five videos a week Monday through Friday

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.219
And we've been able to work with so many wonderful people to bring you series like Mythology, computer science, sociology,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.900
film, world history, astronomy, chemistry,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.949
Economics, psychology, physics, and more. with the support we get we can focus on creating series

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.860
We think will be the most valuable not just the ones that will get the most views and we're so thankful for that. Like in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.460
like in 2018 we will be doing series on engineering, theater in drama, the history of science, media literacy, and statistics

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.880
We recently made some changes to our patreon so we wanted to give you an update on what's going on over there. Our animation team

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.489
Thought Cafe has already been designing sweet digital rewards for our patrons

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.520
And now they're designing

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.149

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.779
physical rewards as well for various pledge amounts you can get a laptop sticker sent to you every month, a new lapel pin on a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.640
Quarterly basis and/or an annual mystery reward. This will be a cool piece of merchandise

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.830
We will create once and then never again

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.809

Those live streams have only been available at higher monthly donation amounts

conversations of course if you can't afford to be a patron that is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.239
Absolutely hundred-percent totally cool the whole thing is that these videos are free

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.019
And we want them to exist for people to watch without having to pay. Regardless
