00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 *Music* 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
 [British soundtracks] In a few moments, he will have written the most laughable jokes in the world ... 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 As a consequence he will die laughing 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.060
 *Laughter* 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.860
 * Loud laughter * 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 First, I think it is wrong to say that any of them is better than the other. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.740
 I find it somewhat disturbing when some people say British comedy is always smarter, or more subtle. 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.760
 Have you seen episodes of 'Arrested Development', '21 jump street 'or even' spongebob '. 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.700
 "Be careful, Patrick (simple), to be a heavy responsibility artist" 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.100
 "Every work of art is as a child, and must be treated as well." 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.920
 "Come on, I'd just draw a cartoon!" 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.780
 "Well, why did not you say that ?!" 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.800
 [Narrator] There are inevitably intelligent texts on both ends of the Atlantic (meaning America and Europe). 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.480
 But this does not answer the question. 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.580
 What makes them different? 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.260
 After weeks of searching, my answer is still "I do not know", but to try. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.760
 [British voice commentary] "No one will read it and stay alive." 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.940
 * Spirits * 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
 * I started laughing * 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.980
 * Loud laughter * 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.560
 *you die* 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.540
 [Ricky Gervais] No, I do not change it, I mean .. 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.520
 .. I mean the difference, if we talked about the great Britain and America - 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.940
 Sorry, the rest of the world. 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 [Narrator] I think it is better to take a British comedy and see how it changed depending on the American adaptation. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.140
 "What's the difference between David Brent and Michael Scott?" 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.260
 By the second season the American show "the office" began its journey away from the UK origin. 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.880
 So we see a subtle cinematic change in the brightness of the lights in the office, 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.940
 While the original offer is only to distinguish it from the British version ... 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.580
 ... The brightness of the added lights seems to serve a metaphor for adaptation in general. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.980
 [Ricky Gervais] But the big difference is that the Americans are more optimistic. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 This is due to the fact that the Americans are told that they can be future presidents of America, and they can. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.260
 The British were told, "This will not happen to you." They carry it, they carry it with them. 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 There is no doubt that America has fueled the show Michael Scott had his mistakes but there is hope. 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.000
 In one episode he was not invited to Jim's party, but he appeared anyway, really hurt and bitter. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 "Wow, open the morgue for this thing!" 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.200
 [Narrator] He chose a song for the duo and no one would sing with him. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.380
 Jim forcibly joins them, smiling at Michael with a big artificial smile and generally a happy ending to the ring. 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.880
 But when lead David Brent is still funny, but funny differently. 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.940
 No one will pity him. They just watch awkward. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 * Dance and snore sounds * 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.860
 [Ruway] There is no happy ending and not optimistic. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.860
 Or see how both characters end up in the show. 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.140
 - Warning (burning) - 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.180
 Michael Scott resigns to move with fiancÃ©e to Colorado 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940
 David Brent begs to regain his job. 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.940
 PRINT will strive doubly. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.720
 I really will. I know I was complicit. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.400
 .. and I will overturn this place 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.140
 If we say only that it is not final now. 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.520
 [Narrator] Of course this does not include your Christmas, which was happier. 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.340
 Frey put it this way: American comic here like John Bellushi or someone like him 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 You know this scene in the "Animal House" where a musician- 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.940
 Fellow plays folk music on guitar. 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.500
 John Bellushi picks up the guitar and destroys it. 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.140
 She loved the cinema. He just smashes it and then shakes ... 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.980
 The eyebrows rise and the camera rises: "Oh my God, it's so wonderful." 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 Well, the British comedian wants to play the role of popular singer. 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.540
 * Laugh * 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.420
 We want to play failure. 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.280
 *singing* 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.660
 [Narrator] So perhaps the difference is the American dream optimistic against the dark British reality. 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.660
 At least that's what many people think. 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.060
 Frey Europe is basically just a group of genes from people who said their ancestors: 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.840
 I do not think I can take risks - hak, I can not risk. 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.300
 America is a gene pool - people say: Let's risk! 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.840
 Let's try! 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.680
 [Narrator] But I think the answer is very easy, because you have to ignore the fact that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.880
 Americans love failure, like Shawn from Shawn dead 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.740
 - Many modern American sit-ins are characterized by losers who never get salvation. 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.120
 * BGM * 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 Frankly, I think it is an old theory. 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.400
 Last TV era "Married and has children", "Seinfeld" and "Friends" 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.180
 Always showing a wise classic guy who has always been a funny line one for each position. 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.100
 Seinfeld Permit You know how to book- 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 You do not know how to book (hold it)? 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.620
 * Laugh * 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.040
 [Narrator] But I think in the past ten years 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.180
 We began to see self-realization of this optimism "American Dream" - the style of comedy. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.580
 In "Always Bright [in Philadelphia]" there is certainly this feeling of that feeling of hope in the characters. 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.400
 They think they can do anything. 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.240
 But they always take it very far by turning to violence, cruelty and joy. 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.880
 Criticism is almost on "American optimism." In America you assume to succeed, but at what cost? 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.720
 [Male actor] See, if we use a weapon, we will certainly need a muffler. 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.840
 [The other actor] Abdul? 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.240
 [Male actor] fine, no weapons, no weapons. Error ... Piano Wires, OK, maybe we can use piano wires. 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.400
 Look, whatever, I must be the man who pulls the trigger on this thing. 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.920
 [Narrator] not to mention their failure always and face the consequences. 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480
 There seems to be no one thing that ever works for Larry in "curb your enthusiasm". 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.840
 Larry I Need Them !! [Officer] Get out of the car, please. (Larry), come on! are you serious?! 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.360
 [Narrator] The episode ends with "Loi" with his beloved god running to a helicopter to escape from him. Can not be more compassionate than that. 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.320
 So maybe some American comedy is laughing at the hope and nature of the past sit-ins. 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.000
 Or American comedy may turn into that British irony. 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.280
 Or maybe we will always keep this American optimism in our hearts. 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.520
 Even in the millennium, where the American dream seems to do nothing but spoil us, 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.680
 But will always be rooted in our culture and our beliefs to "ignore" them and keep trying. 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.360
 [Male actor] I will not take "no" to answer because I just refuse to do so because I am a winner, 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.760
 Winners - do not listen to words like "no", "do not do" or "stop!" 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.440
 These words are not just in our dictionaries. 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.200
 [Narrator] I know this topic so many people are passionate about it, but I hope in the comments 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.260
 Do not get too hot. At least, I do not expect a sort of Spanish Inquisition. 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.200
 [In the scene] * play dramatic music * 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.720
 [Main actor] Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.380
 [Narrator] Thanks for watching! 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.840
