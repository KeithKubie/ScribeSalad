00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:02.989
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can calculate what 5/6

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.392
plus 1/4 is, and to help us,

00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:08.713
I have a visual representation of 5/6,

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.360
and a visual representation of 1/4.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.425
Notice I have this whole whole,

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:15.156
I guess you could say,

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.686
broken up into one, two,
three, four, five, six

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.124
sections, and we've
shaded in five of them,

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:22.889
so this is 5/6,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.955
and then down here, we have another whole,

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:28.252
and we have one out of the
four equal sections shaded in

00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:30.992
so this is 1/4, and I want to add them,

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:32.688
and I encourage you at any
point, pause the video,

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.218
and see if you could
figure it out on your own.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.552
Well, whenever we're adding
fractions, we like to think

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:40.060
in terms of fractions that
have the same denominator,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.521
and these clearly don't
have the same denominator,

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.052
but in order to rewrite them,
with a common denominator,

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:48.059
we just have to think of a
common multiple of six and four,

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.322
and ideally, the smallest
common multiple of six and four,

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.993
and the way that I like to do that is

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:55.826
I like to take the larger
of the two, which is six,

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.858
and then think about its multiples.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.925
So I could first think about six itself.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.188
Six is clearly divisible
by six, but it's not

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:06.461
perfectly divisible by
four, so now, let's multiply

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:09.634
by two, so then we get to 12.

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.960
12 is divisible by both six and four.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.420
So 12 is a good common denominator here.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.195
It's the least common
multiple of six and four.

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.260
So we can rewrite both of
these fractions as something

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.723
over 12.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:26.184
So, something over 12

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:28.589
plus something,

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:32.653
plus something over 12

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:34.789
is equal to.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.519
Now, there's a bunch of ways to tackle it,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:39.015
but what I want to do is I
just want to visualize it here

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.581
on this drawing.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.288
So, if I go,

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.482
if I were to go from,

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.792
if I were to go from six equal sections

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.486
to 12 equal sections,
which is what I'm doing

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.552
if I'm going from six
in the denominator to 12

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:53.957
in the denominator.

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.127
I'm essentially multiplying
each of these sections by,

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:59.553
or, I'm essentially multiplying
the number of sections

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:00.923
I have by two,

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:03.826
or I'm taking each of
these existing sections

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.788
and I'm turning them into two sections,

00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:07.251
so let's do that.

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.551
Let's do that.

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.684
Let me see if I can do it pretty neatly,

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:16.422
so, I can do it a little
bit neater than that.

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:18.419
So, it'll look like that.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.091
And,

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.415
whoops.

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.656
Let me do this one.

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:26.790
I want to divide them
fairly close to evenly.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.320
I'm doing it by eye so it's
not going to be perfect.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.723
So, and you have that one.

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.917
And then last not,

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:36.250
last but not least,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.354
you have that one there, and then notice,

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.790
I had six sections, but
now I've doubled the number

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.417
of sections.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:45.088
I've turned the six sections
into 12 sections by turning

00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:48.420
each of the original six
into two, so now I have

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.392
one, two, three, four,

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:54.492
five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.892
nine, 10, 11, 12 sections.

00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:01.585
So if I have 12 sections
now, how many of those 12

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.955
are now shaded in?

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:04.975
Instead of having five
of the six, I now have

00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:08.493
10 of the 12 that are shaded in.

00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:10.722
So I now have 10/12.

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:13.787
5/6 is the same thing as 10/12.

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:15.390
Another way you could
have thought about that,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.547
to go from six to 12, I
had to multiply by two,

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:20.556
so then I have to do the
same thing in the numerator.

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:22.959
Five times two is 10.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.991
But hopefully you see
that those two fractions

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.291
are equivalent,

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.124
that I didn't change
how much is shaded in,

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:31.423
I just took each of the
original six and I turned it

00:03:31.423 --> 00:03:34.720
into two, or I multiplied
the total number of sections

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.589
by two to get 12,

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.261
and then instead of having 5/6,

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.152
I now have 10/12 shaded in.

00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:43.521
Now let's do the same thing with the four,

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.786
with the 1/4.

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.654
Right here, I've depicted 1/4,
but I want to turn this into

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:49.860
something over 12.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.018
So to turn it into something over 12,

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:56.187
each section has to be
turned into three sections.

00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:57.093
So let's do that.

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.123
Let's turn each section
into three sections.

00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:04.918
So, that's one, two, and three.

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:09.887
So then I have one, two,

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.384
and three.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.091
I have,

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.124
I think you can see where this is going.

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:15.645
One,

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.120
two and three.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.125
I have one, two, and three.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.225
And so notice, all I did is I multiplied,

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:26.059
before I had four equal sections.

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.486
Now I turned each of those
four sections into three

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:32.155
sections, so now I have 12 equal sections.

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:34.419
And I did that, essentially,
by multiplying the number

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.054
of sections I had by three.

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:39.655
So now what fraction is shaded in?

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.721
Well, now, this original

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:44.300
that was one out of the
four, we can now see is three

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.888
out of the 12 equal sections.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:52.161
It's now three out of
the 12 equal sections,

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:53.891
and so what is this going to be?

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:58.651
Well, if I have 10/12,
and I'm adding it to 3/12,

00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:00.427
well how many twelfths do I have?

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:04.583
I'm going to have 13/12.

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:07.381
And you could see it
visually over here as well.

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.528
Up here in green, I have 10/12 shaded in.

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.059
Each of these boxes are a twelfth.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.394
Let me write that down.

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:17.517
Each of these boxes are 1/12.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.827
That's 1/12.

00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:22.451
This is 1/12.

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.274
So how many twelfths do I have shaded in?

00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:27.490
I have the 10 that are shaded in in green,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.718
and then I have an 11/12,

00:05:30.718 --> 00:05:32.424
a 12/12 and then finally,

00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:37.424
the 13/12 is one way to think about it.
