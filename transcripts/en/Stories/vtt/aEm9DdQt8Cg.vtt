00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.220
NARRATOR: This has to
be the most epic tree

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.470
house I have ever seen.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.570
Four stories high,
surreal real architecture,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.530
and this amazing tree swing.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.670
There's even a tree growing
out of the third floor,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.400
and what looks like a
penthouse suite on top.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.079
I have to know where this is.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.917
It was curiosity that drew
this guy to the tree house.

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.000
CHUCK SUTHERLAND: Hi, my
name is Chuck Sutherland.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.300
I'm a geographer
and a photographer.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.690
The minister's tree house
is in Crossville, Tennessee

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.400
and is arguably the
world's largest tree house.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.820
It's 97 feet tall
and is supported

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.580
by six different trees.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.080
The tree house is well known
to those who lived in the area,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.400
and I'd been hearing
about it for some time,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.344
so I decided to
see it first hand.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:45.510
NARRATOR: The tree that's
poking out the third floor

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.940
is actually the main
support for the structure--

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.089
an 80 foot tall white oak tree
with a 12 foot diameter base.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.630
CHUCK SUTHERLAND:
My first impression

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.270
upon looking at the massive
facade of this tree house

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.020
was simply awe.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.220
It was obvious this took a
lot of labor and a lot of time

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.194
to make.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.610
NARRATOR: The tree
house was named

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.580
after the man who decided to
build it-- minister Horace

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.570
Burgess.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.570
According to Horace, the
idea for the tree house

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.720
came team in a vision while
he was deep in prayer-- a bit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.490
like Noah and his ark.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.230
It set him on a 14 year path
to build the largest tree

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.660
house in the world.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.874
But unfortunately the
minister was no architect.

00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:23.540
CHUCK SUTHERLAND: It
was also haphazard.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.620
There was no real plan
to the construction.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.290
Admittedly though, that's
what made it more fun.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.570
Doors wouldn't lead where
you thought they would.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.220
Ladders and stairs were
in unexpected places.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.140
There's a basketball goal in
the central room, which also

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.220
doubled as a church on Sundays.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.190
NARRATOR: All in all, the
tree house has over 80 rooms,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.110
and that structure on
the top is actually

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.650
a bell tower equipped with
repurposed oxygen tanks, which

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.560
serve as bells that chime daily.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.970
It's quirky touches like this
and its random architecture

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.380
that made Minister's tree house
such a popular destination.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.289
Sadly, it's also what led
to its demise in 2012.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.330
CHUCK SUTHERLAND: It was
absolutely a fire hazard

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.460
and it was absolutely dangerous
those are the things that made

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.039
it fun and attracted people.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.560
It was the tree house's
haphazard construction

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.390
that ultimately led
to it being close

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.630
by the state of
Tennessee's fire marshal.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.330
NARRATOR: To this day, the
tree house remains closed.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.550
But over 2000 people
have signed a petition

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.520
to have Minister Burgess's
labor of love reopened.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.590
But without the
funds to fix it, it's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.470
possible no one
will ever be allowed

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.980
to set foot inside this
forest mansion again.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.080
