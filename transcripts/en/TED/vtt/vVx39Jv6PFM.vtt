00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:15.127
So the other morning
I went to the grocery store

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:16.469
and an employee greeted me

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:19.190
with a "Good morning, sir,
can I help you with anything?"

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:21.150
I said, "No, thanks, I'm good."

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:23.815
The person smiled
and we went our separate ways.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.151
I grabbed Cheerios
and I left the grocery store.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.910
And I went through the drive-through
of a local coffee shop.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.609
After I placed my order,
the voice on the other end said,

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.498
"Thank you, ma'am. Drive right around."

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.332
Now, in the span of less than an hour,

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:38.318
I was understood
both as a "sir" and as a "ma'am."

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.969
But for me, neither
of these people are wrong,

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:43.143
but they're also not completely right.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.734
This cute little human
is my almost-two-year-old Elliot.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.512
Yeah, alright.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:51.900
And over the past two years,

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.931
this kid has forced me
to rethink the world

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:55.431
and how I participate in it.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.644
I identify as transgender and as a parent,
that makes me a transparent.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.911
(Laughter)

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:04.361
(Applause)

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:06.234
(Cheering)

00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:11.744
(Applause)

00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:15.348
As you can see, I took
this year's theme super literal.

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:16.433
(Laughter)

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:18.552
Like any good dad joke should.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.926
More specifically, I identify
as genderqueer.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.729
And there are lots of ways
to experience being genderqueer,

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.943
but for me that means I don't
really identify as a man or a woman.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:31.124
I feel in between and sometimes
outside of this gender binary.

00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:33.395
And being outside of this gender binary

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.760
means that sometimes I get
"sired" and "ma'amed"

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:38.943
in the span of less than an hour
when I'm out doing everyday things

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.125
like getting Cheerios.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.721
But this in between lane
is where I'm most comfortable.

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:44.999
This space where I can be
both a sir and a ma'am

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.315
feels the most right
and the most authentic.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:50.395
But it doesn't mean that these
interactions aren't uncomfortable.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.998
Trust me, the discomfort can range
from minor annoyance

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.434
to feeling physically unsafe.

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:56.061
Like the time at a bar in college

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.926
when a bouncer physically
removed me by the back of the neck

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.825
and threw me out of a woman's restroom.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.602
But for me, authenticity
doesn't mean "comfortable."

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:06.730
It means managing and negotiating
the discomfort of everyday life,

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:08.236
even at times when it's unsafe.

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:11.491
And it wasn't until
my experience as a trans person

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:13.506
collided with my new identity as a parent

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.846
that I understood
the depth of my vulnerabilities

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.959
and how they are preventing me
from being my most authentic self.

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:22.680
Now, for most people,
what their child will call them

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:24.903
is not something
that they give much thought to

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:26.672
outside of culturally specific words

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:30.242
or variations on a gendered theme
like "mama," "mommy," or "daddy," "papa."

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.670
But for me, the possibility
is what this child,

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.608
who will grow to be a teenager
and then a real-life adult,

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:37.490
will call me for the rest of our lives,

00:02:37.514 --> 00:02:40.251
was both extremely scary and exciting.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:44.718
And I spent nine months wrestling
with the reality that being called "mama"

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:47.029
or something like it
didn't feel like me at all.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:49.781
And no matter how many times
or versions of "mom" I tried,

00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:52.185
it always felt forced
and deeply uncomfortable.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:56.617
I knew being called "mom" or "mommy"
would be easier to digest for most people.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:58.982
The idea of having two moms
is not super novel,

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.517
especially where we live.

00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:03.339
So I tried other words.

00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.267
And when I played around
with "daddy," it felt better.

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:08.266
Better, but not perfect.

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:11.458
It felt like a pair of shoes
that you really liked

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:13.283
but you needed to wear and break in.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.014
And I knew the idea of being
a female-born person being called "daddy"

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:20.364
was going to be a harder road
with a lot more uncomfortable moments.

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:22.578
But, before I knew it, the time had come

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.546
and Elliot came screaming
into the world, like most babies do,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.172
and my new identity as a parent began.

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:31.339
I decided on becoming a daddy,
and our new family faced the world.

00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:35.641
Now one of the most common things
that happens when people meet us

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:36.974
is for people to "mom" me.

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:40.291
And when I get "momed", there are
several ways the interaction can go,

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:43.728
and I've drawn this map
to help illustrate my options.

00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:45.363
(Laughter)

00:03:45.387 --> 00:03:48.283
So, option one is to ignore the assumption

00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:51.247
and allow folks to continue
to refer to me as "mom,"

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:53.224
which is not awkward for the other party,

00:03:53.248 --> 00:03:55.585
but is typically really awkward for us.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.901
And it usually causes me to restrict
my interaction with those people.

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:00.680
Option one.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:03.974
Option two is to stop and correct them

00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:05.171
and say something like,

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:08.315
"Actually, I'm Elliot's dad"
or "Elliot calls me 'daddy.'"

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.256
And when I do this, one or two
of the following things happen.

00:04:11.624 --> 00:04:14.917
Folks take it in stride
and say something like, "Oh, OK."

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.218
And move on.

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:18.815
Or they respond by apologizing profusely

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.645
because they feel bad or awkward
or guilty or weird.

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:25.585
But more often, what happens
is folks get really confused

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:29.108
and look up with an intense look
and say something like,

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:31.110
"Does this mean you want to transition?

00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:32.649
Do you want to be a man?"

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.395
Or say things like,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.903
"How can she be a father?

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:37.393
Only men can be dads."

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:40.546
Well, option one is oftentimes
the easier route.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.371
Option two is always
the more authentic one.

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:46.077
And all of these scenarios
involve a level of discomfort,

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:47.258
even in the best case.

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:50.663
And I'll say that over time, my ability
to navigate this complicated map

00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:51.906
has gotten easier.

00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.574
But the discomfort is still there.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.553
Now, I won't stand here and pretend

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.966
like I've mastered this,
it's pretty far from it.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.907
And there are days when I still allow
option one to take place

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:03.304
because option two
is just too hard or too risky.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:07.427
There's no way to be sure
of anyone's reaction,

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.172
and I want to be sure
that folks have good intentions,

00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:11.514
that people are good.

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:14.672
But we live in a world
where someone's opinion of my existence

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:16.561
can be met with serious threats to me

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.053
or even my family's emotional
or physical safety.

00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:23.743
So I weigh the costs against the risks

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.595
and sometimes the safety of my family
comes before my own authenticity.

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:30.117
But despite this risk,

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:34.347
I know as Elliot gets older and grows into
her consciousness and language skills,

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:36.771
if I don't correct people, she will.

00:05:37.727 --> 00:05:40.513
I don't want my fears and insecurities
to be placed on her,

00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:43.424
to dampen her spirit
or make her question her own voice.

00:05:43.783 --> 00:05:46.569
I need to model agency,
authenticity and vulnerability,

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:50.501
and that means leaning into those
uncomfortable moments of being "momed"

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:53.382
and standing up and saying,
"No, I'm a dad.

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:55.454
And I even have
the dad jokes to prove it."

00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:57.342
(Laughter)

00:05:58.188 --> 00:06:01.006
Now, there have already been
plenty of uncomfortable moments

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.371
and even some painful ones.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.601
But there's also been,
in just two short years,

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:07.864
validating and at times transformative
moments on my journey as a dad

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.586
and my path towards authenticity.

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:11.974
When we got our first sonogram,

00:06:11.998 --> 00:06:14.553
we decided we wanted to know
the sex of the baby.

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:17.966
The technician saw a vulva
and slapped the words "It's a girl"

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.898
on the screen and gave us a copy
and sent us on our way.

00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:24.061
We shared the photo
with our families like everyone does

00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:27.188
and soon after, my mom showed up
at our house with a bag filled --

00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:28.514
I'm not exaggerating,

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:33.714
it was like this high and it was filled,
overflowing with pink clothes and toys.

00:06:35.014 --> 00:06:38.318
Now I was a little annoyed to be
confronted with a lot of pink things,

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:39.657
and having studied gender

00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:43.308
and spent countless hours teaching
about it in workshops and classrooms,

00:06:43.332 --> 00:06:46.680
I thought I was pretty well versed
on the social construction of gender

00:06:46.704 --> 00:06:49.220
and how sexism is a devaluing
of the feminine

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:52.255
and how it manifests
both explicitly and implicitly.

00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:57.304
But this situation, this aversion
to a bag full of pink stuff,

00:06:57.328 --> 00:07:00.621
forced me to explore my rejection
of highly feminized things

00:07:00.645 --> 00:07:01.979
in my child's world.

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:05.664
I realized that I was reinforcing sexism

00:07:05.688 --> 00:07:08.259
and the cultural norms
I teach as problematic.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.875
No matter how much I believed
in gender neutrality in theory,

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:17.307
in practice, the absence of femininity
is not neutrality, it's masculinity.

00:07:18.296 --> 00:07:21.117
If I only dress my baby
in greens and blues and grays,

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.879
the outside world doesn't think,
"Oh, that's a cute gender-neutral baby."

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.646
They think, "Oh, what a cute boy."

00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:32.252
So my theoretical understanding of gender
and my parenting world collided hard.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.315
Yes, I want a diversity of colors and toys
for my child to experience.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.578
I want a balanced
environment for her to explore

00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:40.180
and make sense of in her own way.

00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:43.244
We even picked a gender-neutral name
for our female-born child.

00:07:43.268 --> 00:07:46.688
But gender neutrality is much easier
as a theoretical endeavor

00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:48.210
than it is as a practice.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:51.343
And in my attempts
to create gender neutrality,

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:54.863
I was inadvertently privileging
masculinity over femininity.

00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:58.827
So, rather than toning down
or eliminating femininity in our lives,

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:01.056
we make a concerted effort
to celebrate it.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.755
We have pinks among the variety of colors,

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.637
we balance out the cutes with handsomes

00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:07.537
and the prettys with strongs and smarts

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.553
and work really hard
not to associate any words with gender.

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:13.117
We value femininity and masculinity

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.124
while also being highly critical of it.

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:18.486
And do our best to not make her feel
limited by gender roles.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.304
And we do all this in hopes

00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:23.922
that we model a healthy and empowered
relationship with gender for our kid.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.847
Now this work to develop a healthy
relationship with gender for Elliot

00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:31.736
made me rethink and evaluate
how I allowed sexism to manifest

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.263
in my own gender identity.

00:08:33.768 --> 00:08:36.403
I began to reevaluate
how I was rejecting femininity

00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:39.125
in order to live up to a masculinity
that was not healthy

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:40.950
or something I wanted to pass on.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.791
Doing this self-work
meant I had to reject option one.

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.625
I couldn't ignore and move on.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:48.355
I had to choose option two.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:51.561
I had to engage with some
of my most uncomfortable parts

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.467
to move towards my most authentic self.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.282
And that meant I had to get real
about the discomfort I have with my body.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.087
It's pretty common for trans people
to feel uncomfortable in their body,

00:09:02.111 --> 00:09:04.873
and this discomfort can range
from debilitating to annoying

00:09:04.897 --> 00:09:06.222
and everywhere in between.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:09.545
And learning my body and how
to be comfortable in it as a trans person

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.236
has been a lifelong journey.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.458
I've always struggled
with the parts of my body

00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:15.371
that can be defined as more feminine --

00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:17.647
my chest, my hips, my voice.

00:09:17.997 --> 00:09:20.664
And I've made the sometimes hard,
sometimes easy decision

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:23.625
to not take hormones
or have any surgeries to change it

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:26.370
to make myself more masculine
by society's standards.

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:30.823
And while I certainly haven't overcome
all the feelings of dissatisfaction,

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:33.299
I realized that by not engaging
with that discomfort

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.046
and coming to a positive
and affirming place with my body,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.887
I was reinforcing sexism, transphobia
and modeling body shaming.

00:09:40.823 --> 00:09:42.220
If I hate my body,

00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:45.458
in particular, the parts
society deems feminine or female,

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:49.101
I potentially damage how my kid
can see the possibilities of her body

00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:51.236
and her feminine and female parts.

00:09:51.653 --> 00:09:54.097
If I hate or am uncomfortable
with my body,

00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.153
how can I expect my kid to love hers?

00:09:57.517 --> 00:10:00.366
Now it would be easier for me
to choose option one:

00:10:01.077 --> 00:10:04.585
to ignore my kid when she asks me
about my body or to hide it from her.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:07.409
But I have to choose option two every day.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.863
I have to confront my own assumptions
about what a dad's body can and should be.

00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:14.998
So I work every day to try
and be more comfortable in this body

00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:16.927
and in the ways I express femininity.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.776
So I talk about it more,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.692
I explore the depths of this discomfort

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:22.958
and find language
that I feel comfortable with.

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:26.236
And this daily discomfort helps me build
both agency and authenticity

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.402
in how I show up in my body
and in my gender.

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:31.125
I'm working against limiting myself.

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:33.252
I want to show her
that a dad can have hips,

00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:35.641
a dad doesn't have to have
a perfectly flat chest

00:10:35.665 --> 00:10:37.593
or even be able to grow facial hair.

00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:40.149
And when she's developmentally able to,

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.625
I want to talk to her
about my journey with my body.

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:44.983
I want her to see my journey
towards authenticity

00:10:45.007 --> 00:10:47.847
even when it means showing her
the messier parts.

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:50.973
We have a wonderful pediatrician

00:10:50.997 --> 00:10:53.958
and have established a good relationship
with our kid's doctor.

00:10:53.982 --> 00:10:56.521
And as you all know,
while your doctor stays the same,

00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.260
your nurses and nurse practitioners
change in and out.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.276
And when Elliot was first born,
we took her to the pediatrician

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.681
and we met our first nurse --
we'll call her Sarah.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:06.705
Very early in in our time with Sarah,

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:08.872
we told her how I was
going to be called "dad"

00:11:08.896 --> 00:11:10.323
and my partner is "mama."

00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:12.782
Sarah was one of those folks
that took it in stride,

00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:15.006
and our subsequent visits
went pretty smoothly.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.133
And about a year later,
Sarah switched shifts

00:11:17.157 --> 00:11:20.185
and we started working
with a new nurse -- we'll call her Becky.

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:22.423
We didn't get in front
of the dad conversations

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:25.440
and it didn't actually come up
until Sarah, our original nurse,

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:26.688
walked in to say hi.

00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:29.713
Sarah's warm and bubbly and said hi
to Elliot and me and my wife

00:11:29.737 --> 00:11:31.943
and when talking to Elliot
said something like,

00:11:31.967 --> 00:11:33.720
"Is your daddy holding your toy?"

00:11:33.744 --> 00:11:35.379
Now out of the corner of my eye,

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.459
I could see Becky
swing around in her chair

00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:39.216
and make daggers at Sarah.

00:11:40.244 --> 00:11:42.688
And as the conversation shifted
to our pediatrician,

00:11:42.712 --> 00:11:46.410
I saw Sarah and Becky's interaction
continue, and it went something like this.

00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:50.412
Becky, shaking her head "no"
and mouthing the word "mom."

00:11:50.902 --> 00:11:55.299
Sarah, shaking her head "no"
and mouthing the word "no, dad."

00:11:55.323 --> 00:11:56.863
(Laughter)

00:11:57.657 --> 00:11:58.807
Awkward, right?

00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:01.712
So this went back and forth
in total silence a few more times

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:03.136
until we walked away.

00:12:03.617 --> 00:12:05.641
Now, this interaction has stuck with me.

00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:07.815
Sarah could have chosen option one,

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.906
ignored Becky, and let her
refer to me as mom.

00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:13.252
It would have been easier for Sarah.

00:12:13.276 --> 00:12:16.910
She could have put the responsibility
back on me or not said anything at all.

00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:19.513
But in that moment, she chose option two.

00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:22.987
She chose to confront the assumptions
and affirm my existence.

00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:25.983
She insisted that a person
who looks and sounds like me

00:12:26.007 --> 00:12:27.261
can in fact be a dad.

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:29.078
And in a small but meaningful way,

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.459
advocated for me,
my authenticity and my family.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:38.431
Unfortunately, we live in a world
that refuses to acknowledge trans people

00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:41.295
and the diversity
of trans people in general.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.426
And my hope is that when confronted
with an opportunity

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.260
to stand up for someone else,

00:12:46.284 --> 00:12:49.410
we all take action like Sarah,
even when there's risk involved.

00:12:50.608 --> 00:12:54.811
So some days, the risk of being
a genderqueer dad feels too much.

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:57.513
And deciding to be a dad
has been really hard.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:00.125
And I'm sure it will continue
to be the hardest,

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:02.299
yet the most rewarding
experience of my life.

00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:06.304
But despite this challenge,
every day has felt 100 percent worth it.

00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:09.553
So each day I affirm my promise to Elliot

00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:11.711
and that same promise to myself.

00:13:12.045 --> 00:13:14.458
To love her and myself hard

00:13:14.482 --> 00:13:16.514
with forgiveness and compassion,

00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:18.938
with tough love and with generosity.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.553
To give room for growth,
to push beyond comfort

00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:25.323
in hopes of attaining and living
a more meaningful life.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.958
I know in my head and in my heart

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:31.267
that there are hard and painful
and uncomfortable days ahead.

00:13:31.291 --> 00:13:32.731
My head and my heart also know

00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:35.666
that all of it will lead
to a more rich, authentic life

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.246
that I can look back on without regrets.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.420
Thank you.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.619
(Applause)
