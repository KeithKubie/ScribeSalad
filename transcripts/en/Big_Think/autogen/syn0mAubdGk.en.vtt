you've got a massive invasive species

now with most invasive species the

now with most invasive species the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
solution is to get rid of them because
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.890 align:start position:0%
solution is to get rid of them because
basically<00:04:48.040><c> they</c><00:04:48.460><c> upset</c><00:04:49.030><c> ecosystems</c><00:04:49.930><c> and</c><00:04:50.580><c> and</c>

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
basically they upset ecosystems and and
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.230 align:start position:0%
basically they upset ecosystems and and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
so they need to be removed but the
 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
so they need to be removed but the
