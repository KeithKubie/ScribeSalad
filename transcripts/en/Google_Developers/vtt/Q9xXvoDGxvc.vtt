NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Thanks for tuning

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.630
in to this special edition
of "Google Developers Live."

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.760
Today we're featuring Limor
Fried from Adafruit Industries

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.460
in celebration of Computer
Science Education Week.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.129
Hello, everyone.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.820
My name is Natalie
Villalobos, and I

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.350
will be your host for this
special edition of "Google

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.900
Developers Live."

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.480
Today, our guest is Limor Fried.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.749
Limor is a graduate of MIT,
receiving her bachelor's

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.790
of science in electrical
engineering and computer

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.210
science and a master's
in engineering.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.995
In 2005, she created her own
company, Adafruit Industries,

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.120
which is based in New York.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.320
And they sell hackable
electronic kits.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.080
In 2011, she was featured on
the cover of "Wired" magazine,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.390
the first female
engineer-- ever, actually.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.000
And in 2013,
"Entrepreneur" magazine

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920
named her Entrepreneur
of the Year.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.129
Thanks for joining us, Limor.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.336
LIMOR FRIED: Thanks, Natalie.

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:56.475
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:58.220
Look at me, live engineer.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.364
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:00.530
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.166
So most people--

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.564
LIMOR FRIED: [INAUDIBLE] live.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:07.010
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Most people
might not know you as Limor.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.905
Some know you as ladyada.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.280
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.870
about how you
received that name?

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.620
LIMOR FRIED: Yeah.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.411
So when I used to break
into computers when

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.340
I was in high school,
you had a hacker handle.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.410
And my handle was ladyada.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.020
And I never got caught,
so that's kind of good.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.640
And after I graduated
from school, and I'm like,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.710
well, you know, I should
probably get a job

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.250
or start a company or something,
I decided to keep my handle.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.426
So I still go by ladyada.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.050
And the good news is
I've registered it

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.880
on all these websites for
so long that ladyada's it.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.594
I can't really change now.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:43.760
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.452
So you've created the
Adafruit Learning System,

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:48.160
and you've also started
your own company.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.520
So I want to hear
about that, too.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.936
Can you tell us a
little bit more,

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.860
though, first about the
Adafruit Learning System?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.050
LIMOR FRIED: Sure.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.940
One of the things that
I do here at Adafruit

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.220
is I do a lot of engineering,
a lot of developing.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.352
But when people buy stuff
from the Adafruit store,

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:04.560
they often tend to [? not
be ?] electrical engineers.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.220
They don't have a lot of
experience with engineering.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.419
They're just makers
or hackers or people

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.949
who maybe do
software, and they're

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.473
dabbling in doing some hardware.

00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:12.931
And so they might
need a little bit

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.705
of help getting
started in how to use

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:18.500
these electronic parts
in their projects.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.350
And so what we did is we
had this huge, vast amount

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.440
of documentation.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.470
And we wanted to do
a really good job

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.235
in having that documentation
be easy to use, easy to find.

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:32.500
We wanted to integrate
photos and videos

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.490
and side by side and photo
notes and all the things that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.610
make documentation
for electronics

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.570
really, really good.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.820
I mean, a lot of times for
documentation for software,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.210
it's just screenshots and text.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.043
And that's OK, but with
hardware, you really

00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:46.980
want to show videos
and wiring diagrams.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.270
And so we developed
our own web application

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.670
that runs on the
Adafruit servers

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.330
called the Learning System.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.290
And it's kind of
like bootstrap.py.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.750
And what it does is it
allows us to do back

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.430
end design integration
with our store

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.570
so that, for example,
if a tutorial uses

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.304
a microscope or an
Arduino or a Raspberry Pi,

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.095
those will get
automatically tied together.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:14.180
And so people can find the
tutorials really easily.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.840
They can just go
through our shop

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.410
and say, well, I've got this
component or this component.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.170
What projects could
I build with it?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.920
And the Learning System
will automatically

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.930
guide them through what
cool project they can make.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.610
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: That's super
awesome and sounds really easy.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.290
So you have some wearable
technology projects as well.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.720
And being at Google, we love
some wearable technology

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.974
projects, like Google Glass.

00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:37.390
Can you tell us a little bit
about your favorite wearables

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.222
project and how we might
get started with one?

00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:40.972
LIMOR FRIED: Sure.

00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:42.590
I really like wearables.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.970
I've been doing wearables
for a really long time.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.250
I was at the wearables group
in the Media Lab many, many,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.460
many years ago.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.230
And we were working on
like strapping computers

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.430
to our bodies and stuff.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.515
And that was kind of
fun, although really big

00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:56.990
and kind of clunky.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.390
The cool thing is that 10
years later, microcontrollers

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.210
and electronics and batteries
are so much better and smaller

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.110
that instead of having
to spend like $2,000

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.150
to build your own
strap-on computer,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.250
you can actually do a lot of
electronics for less than $50.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.090
We have the Adafruit
GEMMA, which

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.420
is our little microcontroller
platform specifically

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.120
for low-cost wearables,
and it's like $8.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.350
So for $8 and a
couple of LEDs, you

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.960
can actually start making
integrated sensors, LEDs,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.460
projects.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.000
People like modifying
their shoes and their bags

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.960
because shoes and bags
have really stiff sides,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.450
so it's really easy to
attach electronics to them.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.890
And also, we wear
them every day.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.590
And it's kind of cool to have
funky shoes or a funky handbag.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.890
So one of my favorite
projects right now

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.630
is we have the Firewalker
sneakers, which

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.716
is reactive shoes that light
up when you walk or dance.

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:50.882
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:52.965
So it's not like they're
spouting fire or anything

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:53.510
like that.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.176
LIMOR FRIED: No, they
just look like you

00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:57.420
are because when you walk,
the red LEDs flicker,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.200
and they look like
little flames,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.006
like they're coming
out of your feet.

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:03.380
So I wear them on Halloween,
and they're totally awesome.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.963
We're seeing lots
of people build them

00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:08.190
because they're dancers
or artists or actors,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.392
and they want to have
something kind of cool and fun

00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:11.725
on stage or during performances.

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:12.726
So that's really common.

00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:14.433
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's awesome, yeah.

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:16.890
I like the idea of how every
item that you own or wear

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.600
could potentially be a platform.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.757
And so literally, your platform
could be your platform, ha ha.

00:05:21.757 --> 00:05:22.840
LIMOR FRIED: That's right.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.590
Platform shoes have
lots of space on them.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.500
You can stuff tons of
electronics in there

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.730
because you have to
put the batteries.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah,
like some energy scavenging

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.970
to even maybe make
some local power

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.970
supplies to actually
make that work.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.240
LIMOR FRIED: Yeah, sure.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.900
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So one other question

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.430
that I'm really interested in.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.690
So a lot of times, we're
carrying these devices,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.130
and we're maybe not thinking
how we can build on them

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.740
or how we can create
them ourselves.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.948
So there seems to be this
disconnect between building

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.360
and consuming.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.910
Can you tell us how we might get
more connected with our devices

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.590
by building on them or
your general thoughts

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.080
on that kind of era,
this era of our lives?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.870
LIMOR FRIED: Sure.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.460
I think that,
especially now, it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.040
hard to buy electronics
that are hackable,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.760
unless you're actually
looking for that.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.694
You used to be able to buy
a Commodore 64 or an Apple

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:12.985
IIGS that came with schematics.

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.960
And it's like, you want
to add a 40 column board?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.800
Here's how you do it.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.887
And there'd be parallel
ports and COM ports.

00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:22.220
And even that stuff doesn't
appear on computers anymore.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.500
There's really not
a lot of easy ways

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.150
to integrate electronics
into stuff like a tablet.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.290
It's just a slab of
glass, basically.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.330
Which is why I think stuff
like the Raspberry Pi

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.150
and Arduino is really great.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.910
You can take the
kind of technologies

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.880
that have become low cost
because of tablets and cell

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.930
phones and laptops, but
then build your own computer

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.810
or build your own cell
phone, build your own camera.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.682
And by doing that, you
actually learn a lot,

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:48.140
and you get to
customize it in ways

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.450
that maybe the companies
that are selling

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.000
you a $500 digital camera
or laptop or tablet

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.150
didn't think of.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.600
So a lot of people take
these technologies,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.840
like Arduino and Raspberry
Pi, and these sensors

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.085
and combine them together to
make something custom or cool

00:07:04.085 --> 00:07:07.814
or something that is their
own, not just something

00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:08.980
that they bought in a store.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.563
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah, even
better than what you could buy.

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:15.790
So different people have
different interests-- cycling,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.480
painting, rowing-- I
don't know, a whole bunch

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.640
of different things.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.470
So if I were a kid, and
I had these interests,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.420
how might coding or picking up
an electronic hackable kit--

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.950
how can I implement
those interests

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.470
into these particular types
of practices or methodologies?

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.250
LIMOR FRIED: I think
everyone's got hobbies

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.060
that are really fun
and interesting.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.920
One of the cool new
hobbies that I'm

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.110
seeing that's picking up a
lot of stuff with electronics

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.730
is cosplay and costuming.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.140
So there's all these people
who love to make costumes.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.530
Costuming is the most fun thing.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.571
Everyone loves Halloween.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.970
Everyone loves to dress up.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.905
And we've got all these cool
LEDs and wearable electronics

00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:58.540
that we can now
add to our costumes

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.280
to make them light up or
make sounds or effects

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.305
or make you move
more like a robot.

00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:08.480
So I'm seeing a lot of
people add electronics

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.640
and making to whatever
hobby they already have.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.644
Like I know people who
really like to cycle,

00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:15.060
and so they make
their own cycling

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.900
computers or their
own light painting

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.090
rigs that attach to a bicycle.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.040
People who like to rock climb
will make their own timers

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.670
or digital cameras that they
can attach to themselves

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.280
and take time lapses
while they're doing stuff.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.870
All of this stuff is taking
off the shelf electronics,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.520
combining it with
coding and engineering

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.010
to make what you do more fun.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.732
I know kids who
skateboard, and then

00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:43.190
they put LEDs on
their skateboards,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.200
so when they do tricks, they
get these really cool light

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.520
effects.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.103
This is stuff that
you can't even buy.

00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:48.926
You have to make it.

00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:51.050
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
there's a lot of different--

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.877
so when you think
of a programmer,

00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:54.710
or maybe not when you
think of a programmer,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.790
but when some people
think of a programmer,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.850
it's someone who's
sitting behind a computer

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.260
and maybe is just typing and
not really having a lot of fun.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.700
Maybe they're like hunched
back and-- I don't know.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.600
It doesn't seem to be
a very glamorous image.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.220
If you were to fill in a "Mad
Lib," a programmer is what?

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:17.595
LIMOR FRIED: For people who
do electronics engineering,

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:20.410
a programmer is really creative.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.940
I also used to do
computer science,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.340
and I used to sit
behind a screen and type

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.280
and write code in
Java, and I hated it.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.450
It was so boring.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.120
And I was just
compiling and deploying

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.306
and linking libraries.

00:09:31.306 --> 00:09:32.430
And I was like, this sucks.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.712
I actually was bored of
doing computer science

00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:37.170
because it was just like, you're
sitting in a room all day.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.600
And so that's why I got
into electrical engineering.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.170
Electrical engineering,
you take all the skills

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.020
that you may learn in
computer science class,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.480
but then you can
build stuff with it.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.540
You get to show it
off to your friends.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.140
You get to be really creative.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.490
I mean, you can always make
really cool apps and games

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.800
and stuff with
software, but I really

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.850
think that-- I love just having
physical stuff that moves,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.820
like robotics or light
painting, or making

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.380
your own computers or your
own sensors or wearables.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.140
All that stuff is a way to
take programming and just

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.334
make it more fun.

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:08.500
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.890
So we have a huge developer
audience that's watching.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.630
What would you like
to share with them?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.560
Right now, we have Computer
Science Education Week.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.430
We're empowering
everyone to learn

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.590
how to code through the Hour
of Code campaign with code.org.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.230
How might you activate, or how
can developers get involved,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.890
or where should they start
first with their kids,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.000
in getting them involved
in electrical engineering

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.720
or computer science?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.470
LIMOR FRIED: Sure.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.050
I think that it's
always great to start

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.880
with some basic
tutorials and stuff.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.420
But after you get a little bit
of the hang of programming,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:47.445
either with Basic or Scratch
or JavaScript or whatever,

00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:50.020
pick up something like
an Arduino starter kit

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.200
or a Raspberry Pi and then
try integrating all that stuff

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.810
that you learn in
software with sensors.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.465
Like try to make LEDs blink.

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:00.020
Or when you press
a button, something

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.640
happens, or make some music.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.170
A lot of people like to
booby-trap their rooms.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.381
That's a common project that
we see a lot of kids do.

00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:09.797
Because they have
their own space,

00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:11.250
and you want to modify it.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.880
So they'll put PIR sensors
that can detect people

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.230
and magnetic sensors
that can detect movement,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.650
and then they'll set up
a camera to take photos

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.600
to make sure their
parents aren't sneaking

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.410
into their rooms when
they're in class.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.150
So that's a really
fun project that

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.072
uses code and sensors and
electrical engineering

00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:28.780
all together, and a
lot of these projects

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.879
aren't even that difficult.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:32.670
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That sounds incredible.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.194
I am really jealous of
the kids these days.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.485
LIMOR FRIED: How do you know
that somebody at your home

00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.302
isn't in your room right now,
going through your stuff?

00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:39.909
You don't.

00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:41.950
That's why you have to
build something like this.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.340
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.990
I love it.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.490
I love it.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.440
Yeah, I just started picking up
some Nests, the Nest Protects.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.100
And I love the way that
it interacts with me

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.900
in my home environment.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.670
And so I would love
for our students

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.120
out there to be able to
create these types of things

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.064
for their own home,
like home automation.

00:11:57.064 --> 00:11:58.480
Why don't you just
go and do that?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.460
So thank you so
much for joining us.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.780
We've learned so much today.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.186
LIMOR FRIED: Awesome.

00:12:02.186 --> 00:12:03.740
Thanks for having me, Natalie.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.010
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.620
And I guess before
we sign off, do you

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.417
want to tell us a little bit
about where you are right now?

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:09.166
What's behind you?

00:12:09.166 --> 00:12:09.920
LIMOR FRIED: Sure.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.700
Right now, I'm at
the Adafruit factory,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.870
which is why it's kind of
loud and crazy over here.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.410
And we're in the middle of
the busiest season, Christmas,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.585
which is when a lot of parents
get stuff for their kids,

00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:23.960
a lot of sisters
and brothers get

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.180
stuff for their
siblings, et cetera,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.030
and people get stuff for their
parents or significant others.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.730
So people are giving the
gift of learning electronics

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.010
this season, and so we're
really, really busy.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.370
And that's why there's so
much stuff going on here.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.070
But it's also really
exciting to have a factory

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.290
here in Manhattan.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.690
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, and you

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.232
make a lot of your
own components

00:12:43.232 --> 00:12:44.190
that go into your kits.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.530
You make them in house, right?

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.280
LIMOR FRIED: Yeah.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.020
A lot of these
technologies, it's

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.250
not stuff that's necessarily
available to people

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.490
who just want to
play with sensors

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.650
or LEDs or other
electronic components.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.650
So what we do is we make
breakout boards or design kits,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.010
and we contact factories.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.670
And we can purchase
large quantities

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.892
and get custom-made stuff,
like displays, made for us

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:10.350
and then provide
them to customers.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.642
So we kind of get to
go to all the factories

00:13:12.642 --> 00:13:14.100
that make cell
phones and say, hey,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.740
we're not making a cell phone,
but give us all the stuff

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.470
that you can make
your own cell phone.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.390
And that's what we have
in the Adafruit shop.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.640
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Beautiful.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.098
Well, thank you so
much for sharing

00:13:22.098 --> 00:13:24.810
your factory and
your time today.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.240
I really appreciate it.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.070
If you would like to learn
more about Limor and Adafruit

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.021
Industries, go to Adafruit
Industries-- or adafruit.com.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:33.521
Right?

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:33.930
LIMOR FRIED: That's right.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.100
Adafruit.com.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.920
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Cool.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.420
Awesome.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.550
Thank you so much, Limor.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.889
LIMOR FRIED: OK, thanks.

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:40.430
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Make sure to join

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.000
in on the fun at
csedweek.org, where

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.180
you can participate
in an Hour of Code

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.160
during Computer
Science Education Week.
