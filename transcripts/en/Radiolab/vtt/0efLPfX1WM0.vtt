WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.353
All right.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.590
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers that works two one Jad,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.620
Robert, Radiolab. And now we're going to do part two of our border patrol elegy.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.020
A okay with reporter, a lot of Nasr. Uh,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.410
in our last podcast we had part one of the series,

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.280
which we called hole in the fence. But let's the, I'm,

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.900
I'm excited to tell you now the rest of the story.

8
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.520
I feel like I'm holding out on you. Okay. And now part two, hold the line. Um,

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.520
so, so let's do first the,

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.960
the previously on I think instead of previously on is that, uh,

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
we had, so it was, uh, December 1st, 1992,

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.150
<v 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.740
<v 0>you have these Mexican American high school kids from this poor neighborhood,</v>

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.980
this high school buoy high school in El Paso, right on the border.

15
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.140
They sue the border patrol. Who is, they say is harassing them,

16
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.320
who's hassling them because of really the color of their skin and they win.

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.670
They win. Is that amazing?

18
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:05.480
And probable a victory to get the border patrol to stop.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.830
So that's where we are now. Right.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.660
And things are about to take some unexpected turns. Okay. Uh,

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.000
uh, we're looking at the early 1990s.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.040
The lawsuit was filed in 1992 and right after that lawsuit, you know,

23
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.340
pass according to Tim Dunn,

24
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.060
the sociologists who actually turned us onto this whole UE story right after the

25
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.300
buoy victory, the border patrol chief in El Paso, Dale,

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.030
Musa guedes obviously kind of old school

27
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.260
<v 2>throwback. We're not accomplishing 100% of our mission. He's out.</v>

28
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.070
Music AIDS is replaced and they bring in a new chief. Yes.

29
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:43.890
My name is Sylvester days and Sylvester a ray. Yes.

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920
I've been a veteran of the US border patrol for 26 and a half years and he has a

31
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:52.350
very different style. Great spot here. Yeah.

32
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.560
This is one of my wife and i's favorite place. Where do you want me

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.400
<v 0>here?</v>

34
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.110
I met Sylvester Rayez in this Mexican restaurant on the outskirts of El Paso.

35
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:04.590
He's big guy, broad shoulders kind of look like a, um,

36
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.370
like a retired football player. But who is now a gram?

37
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.590
<v 2>How are you? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.</v>

38
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.700
Awesome coffee with green. Perfect.

39
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.510
You don't mind very kind face for a guy who revolutionized how we deal with the

40
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:20.190
border. You and you grew up here?

41
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.660
We're sitting here about a mile from where I was born. Yeah.

42
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.280
Our farm was northwest of here. We uh, we grew cotton.

43
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.670
Okay. Alfalfa, some watermelon, some onions.

44
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.790
I'm the oldest of 10 oh six brothers and four sisters. Yeah.

45
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.500
He says that his brothers and sisters,

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.880
they all work on the farm along with a bunch of undocumented workers who came in

47
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.720
from Juarez back then we had party line foams. So somebody would say a,

48
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.400
the burritos coming today, but they didn't know what time or where.

49
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.340
So whenever that happened, uh,

50
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.950
I was tasked to sit in a two and a half ton truck and he would watch the road

51
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.040
and I would blow the

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v 3>horn</v>

53
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.860
<v 4>at the first sign of what we would refer to as La Miga.</v>

54
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.160
[inaudible] to alert the workers. Yeah.

55
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.470
He actually calls it the greatest irony of his life because fast forward to

56
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.170
college, I got drafted into the army.

57
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.170
He gets drafted to go to Vietnam and spent 13 months in Vietnam.

58
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.230
I was a helicopter crew chief. When I came back from Vietnam,

59
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.910
I was scheduled to go back.

60
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.040
But what happened in 1968 was my second brother,

61
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.890
he had an automobile accident and got killed.

62
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.610
So I was the oldest in the family.

63
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.410
So they led me out to take care of the family.

64
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.430
And so ray as needed, a job being a veteran,

65
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.040
any federal exam they opened up for you.

66
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.720
So he starts taking these federal job exams, the post office, Bureau of Prisons,

67
00:03:50.721 --> 00:03:52.610
customs, border patrol.

68
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.420
I mean just any tests that I could cause I had to make a living and the very

69
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:58.280
first place to call him back. Border Patrol?

70
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.830
<v 2>No. Oh yeah. That was what was available. Again, Tim Dunn, you.</v>

71
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.760
So he becomes a kind of pioneer a in the border patrol is one of the early

72
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.920
Hispanic agents. When there were very few,

73
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.510
the job was tough cause they didn't welcome you with open arms because your name

74
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:19.800
is Reyes and not Smith or Jones. But I kind of enjoyed the challenge.

75
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.130
You thought he was dead set and do everything twice as good and half the time.

76
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.970
And eventually he moves from being an agent into management and he works his way

77
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.440
up through management. I was a first line supervisor through the rank,

78
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.450
second line supervisor taught at the academy and he eventually becomes the first

79
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.510
Hispanic sector chief, which means he's in charge of it. Huge

80
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.730
<v 4>swath of the border in Texas. Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.850
So then come 1993 you are a sector chief and you're assigned back here,

82
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.610
right. I was moved here in late June and uh, uh,

83
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.640
in early July I decided to assess the situation and the situation in El Paso did

84
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:01.770
not look good.

85
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.260
<v 3>No, the sector was a mess.</v>

86
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.490
<v 2>So one of the first things ray has discovered is that</v>

87
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.120
<v 4>the border between the u s and Mexico, a Paseo is in a state of chaos.</v>

88
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.590
Chaos. We were averaging about 10,000 illegal, increased a day,

89
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.960
a day, a day, unprecedented numbers,

90
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.660
and we're troll didn't have enough people to get them off.

91
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.520
So people were telling me that agents are pretty much regularly stopping El Paso

92
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.800
Pasoans running ramshackle through the city,

93
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:31.470
driving around the neighborhoods and questioning everybody, stopping people,

94
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.690
asking for their immigration status,

95
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.540
and they're doing this despite the fact that they just got sued by these high

96
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.760
school kids for doing essentially the same thing.

97
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.840
And this lawsuit is still hanging over the patrol. How big a deal was that?

98
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.100
There was a huge deal. It was making a chaotic situation worse.

99
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.200
And Rhea says, on top of all of this, there was a movement when I got here

100
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.340
to push the border patrol out,

101
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.370
that the border should be moved 25 miles out of the city to kind of create a

102
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:06.530
borderless zone around the city to unite El Paso and Juarez.

103
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.340
It was kind of in the spirit of NAFTA opening up NAFTA is good for us because it

104
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:13.490
will cut the tariffs on trade between the United States and Mexico,

105
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.500
the North American free trade agreement.

106
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.300
NAFTA is going to open the border for the flows of goods and capital, uh,

107
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.000
but not people. And they're saying, well, how about right here?

108
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.110
A little bit for people too.

109
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.280
So they felt that the border patrol is an invading army.

110
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.800
They're the problem instead of the solution. Yeah.

111
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:36.140
So what do you find is that they're really unpopular and that's just half the

112
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.160
reason they're unpopular.

113
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:39.800
There's a whole bunch of other people that hate them for a whole different

114
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:44.660
reason. Really. Yeah. He, he, when he got there, he went on this listening,

115
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.870
walking tour of the neighborhoods along the border. There's,

116
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.770
there's whole neighborhoods there like Chewa Weeta and El Segundo Barrio.

117
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.530
I walked those neighborhoods and I talked to them and uh,

118
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.780
they thought the border patrol was a disaster.

119
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.900
But instead of saying that the border patrol was overreaching,

120
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:04.160
that they were doing too much, they felt that the border patrol had failed him.

121
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.520
They were upset. The border patrol was not doing enough, had let them down.

122
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.250
And the people that lived on those neighborhoods,

123
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.020
they felt like they were under siege.

124
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.150
<v 5>We have been broken away three times by illegal immigrants,</v>

125
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.070
although grown scared

126
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.000
<v 4>people complained about burglaries, about loitering,</v>

127
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.350
people selling their fruits and knocking on doors, asking for money.

128
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.460
They didn't like have to deal with vendors all the time or people begging and

129
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.520
they didn't like having stuff stolen off their backyard, a garden hose,

130
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.180
a lawn chair, stuff stolen off their clothes online gone overnight.

131
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.600
And so with these people living right on the border one and was more border

132
00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:44.560
patrol to stop what they perceive to be, you know, migrant petty crime. Huh?

133
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.830
Susie? He's really getting it from both sides here. Yeah.

134
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.480
It's like the whole city's coming at them.

135
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.310
We were with one foot on a banana peel of getting driven out of town.

136
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.760
Yeah. And so I had to change that and I didn't have a lot of time to do that.

137
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.110
Okay. So, so what does he do? Well, he had an idea,

138
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.120
a pretty radical idea. I knew there would be political pressure,

139
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.430
there would be public outcry.

140
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.480
And so he takes this idea around to a bunch of high level people.

141
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.610
The mirror flood is the mayor of El Paso,

142
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.450
people at the Mexican console in El Paso. Our console in quarters,

143
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.380
the sheriff and El Paso, chief of police of what is in El Paso.

144
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.650
And he's going each one of them and basically saying, look,

145
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.360
if we're able to correct this thing, if I can quell the chaos,

146
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.920
would they support the border patrol?

147
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.903
<v 5>You said? Yes.</v>

148
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.980
<v 4>Okay. So here's what I find so fascinating.</v>

149
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.340
It's September of 93 and while Reyes is hatching his plan at the same time at

150
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.580
the El Paso Civic Center on this one particular weekend,

151
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.160
the United El Paso people are having this big convention talking about how we

152
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:54.270
can try and create this,

153
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:58.500
borderless all sorts of local officials and civic leaders there in hammering out

154
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.110
their proposals and everything and presenting it to the audience.

155
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.180
And that same weekend,

156
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.010
Sylvester Rayez rolls out his plan. He wanted this to be a surprise.

157
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.600
So we launched the operation at midnight. So it's September 18th,

158
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.530
1993 Saturday night, Rayez gathers all of his border patrol agents,

159
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.440
400 border patrol agents from all over his sector.

160
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.500
And I briefed every single shift of agents myself and I told him what was at

161
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.960
stake. I told him that if this thing didn't work,

162
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.520
they were going to run us out of town.

163
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.300
<v 6>My initial reaction was, well, this is going to be interesting.</v>

164
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.320
Retired border patrol agent David Ham was there with his anti-drug smuggling

165
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.660
unit and he says, after the briefing,

166
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.820
we drove up the border highway on the Mexican side and we got to a downtown

167
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.730
waters and the Levy area about sunrise.

168
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.060
And so he and his agents are waiting right at the Rio Grande.

169
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.630
The Sun came up and he said there at the border,

170
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.360
he just saw wall-to-wall border patrol,

171
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.820
<v 4>a wall of agents along the river, a hundred yards apart,</v>

172
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.970
each one in their trucks, light green trucks.

173
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.150
There were helicopters buzzing low along the river.

174
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:11.150
There were flood lights everywhere so the agents could be out there around the

175
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:12.470
clock 24 hours a day.

176
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.710
Basically what ray has had done is he had created a human wall on the border at

177
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.970
the river that stretched for like 20 miles. Wow.

178
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.390
And I had told my guys, we're in this for the long haul.

179
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.490
What Reyes was doing, this was,

180
00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:32.680
this plan was to essentially change our strategy on the border,

181
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.690
how we police the border from a strategy of apprehension of letting migrants

182
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:40.460
come in and running around, chasing them,

183
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:44.600
sending them back to one of deterrence and he called it

184
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.343
Operation Blockade Operation Blockade.

185
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:49.960
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

186
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.550
<v 4>day one on Sunday morning like they always did, hundreds of Mexican migrants,</v>

187
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.390
<v 6>vendors, construction workers,</v>

188
00:10:56.391 --> 00:11:01.310
housekeepers came down to the Rio Grande River waiting to cross into El Paso for

189
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.000
work,

190
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.350
but now they were confronted with the Berlin Wall on the border,

191
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.880
border patrol agents lining the entire river bank on the line where they would

192
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:14.330
have to wait them out waiting to see when the border patrol agents will pack up

193
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:16.970
and leave. By the time night falls, the migrants,

194
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.920
they just turn and go home and figure, okay,

195
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:20.960
I guess so we'll just come back in the morning.

196
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.080
They came back Monday and we were still there and that's when this starts to get

197
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.250
<v 8>chaotic. Day Two sevenths.</v>

198
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:35.070
Amy Jacobson is standing by live under the Paso del Norte in bridge where the

199
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:35.940
incident occurred.

200
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.560
Hundreds of Mexicans took to the main bridge that connects El Paso and Juarez

201
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.590
and estimated 800 Mexican protestors

202
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.950
close the [inaudible] bridge and confronted water patrol. They burnt tires.

203
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.590
They blockaded traffic again, throwing rocks and bottles. Agents.

204
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.680
There were skirmishes. One agent was struck in the face with a rock,

205
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.370
blood and bandages. Still literally the area, no,

206
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.980
by that time there was screaming going on is a racist,

207
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.030
tormenting racism. There are all these headlines in the newspaper.

208
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:11.830
There are better ways to do this. Basically saying this, this new strategy,

209
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.670
this is wrong.

210
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.430
Operation Blockade is nothing more than an attempt to divide the community race

211
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.250
as the mayor of El Paso who he briefed about the operation is denying ever

212
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.850
knowing about it. So I called him and I said, mayor, he says, chief,

213
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.290
I just didn't know what to do.

214
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.310
How many children are going hungry because their parents cannot come to El Paso

215
00:12:31.311 --> 00:12:34.370
to work. The local bishop came out and criticized rates.

216
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.910
You said it was inhumane to do what I was doing.

217
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.970
How many will suffer close this winter if the blockade continues and this is the

218
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:47.371
only date to have the blockade by by day three long have around 200 occupied the

219
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.020
of Deloitte things continue to get worse day. Four more protests. Day Five, six,

220
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:56.650
seven. At the end of the week, people were starting to get really desperate,

221
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.460
but a remarkable thing happened that I didn't plan for

222
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.490
the banners on private property or out to show support for Operation Blockade.

223
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.790
<v 4>The support for the [inaudible]</v>

224
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.890
<v 8>skyrocketed. They're out there support enforcing the laws. People that live in</v>

225
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.900
<v 4>done those neighborhoods that felt like they were under siege and the Bordeaux</v>

226
00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:24.260
had failed them. They came out with these huge banners of,

227
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.980
we support our border patrol. They tied ribbons on their cars.

228
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:31.760
They came out with donuts and coffee for the border patrol agents who are on the

229
00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:35.210
line. It was like all of a sudden there was this sort of flip.

230
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:38.990
People locally all loved it across racial and ethnic lines.

231
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.060
<v 8>Mov Stowe, [inaudible]</v>

232
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.860
<v 4>over time. What happened during this blockade with two things. One.</v>

233
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.730
We've seen it reduce crime is one of the most popular reasons these El Paso

234
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.090
winds are in favor of operation blockade. Crime goes down.

235
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.180
Now it's hard to tell whether this is actually because of the blockade,

236
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.100
but there's a reduction in petty crime,

237
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.690
a something like 15% for the local residents. That's the bottom line.

238
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.090
And the second thing, and this is way more surprising,

239
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.660
was that for Mexican Americans who had been harassed by the border patrol

240
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:11.890
presence in their neighborhoods,

241
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.000
they start to notice that you just don't see the agents anymore.

242
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.310
The agents were gone, right? Right.

243
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:22.420
It completely cleared them out because now they were all down on the border.

244
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.320
So there's this, you know, this tidal wave of support,

245
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:28.990
like virtually everybody locally and El Paso,

246
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.230
both sides are really happy with what he's doing.

247
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.780
He seemed to solve the problem in one fell swoop.

248
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.130
What was the reaction at buoy high school? The principal called me. Yeah,

249
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.710
Paul Strelzin was his name. He's passed away now. Uh, he called me and he said,

250
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.400
uh, chief, I hope you, I hope you thought this out because you are,

251
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.730
you have us our campus back

252
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.090
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

253
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.790
<v 6>but right in the midst of all of this,</v>

254
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.270
so visceral Rayez gets a phone call,

255
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.430
a phone call from Washington d c saying, you've got to stop this.

256
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:13.790
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

257
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.440
<v 0>we'll tell you all about that phone call</v>

258
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.010
<v 6>and what falls out of that call after the break.</v>

259
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.353
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

260
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.040
<v 9>hi, this is Adam McBride from the pork Colorado.</v>

264
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.630
<v 0>this next part of the episode contains some moments that are very graphic that</v>

265
00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:11.130
depict death in a pretty brutal way.

266
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.970
If you're squeamish or you're listening with kids, maybe Trump,

267
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.230
maybe you think about skipping this bar.

268
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.960
Jad Robert Radiolab. This is part two of our border patrol, LG, a firm report.

269
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:25.030
A lot of Nasr. When we left the story,

270
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:27.820
so Vista Reyes had put into place operation blockade,

271
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.280
which was then renamed operation hold the line.

272
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.060
And everyone in El Paso seemed happy. Very happy.

273
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.220
<v 4>Yeah. But people in Washington,</v>

274
00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:40.180
D C we're not because the Clinton administration,

275
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.110
they're about to have this vote on NAFTA. They're talking about free trade.

276
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.710
And then this guy, this little guy in El Paso,

277
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.690
he's created a blockade and a,

278
00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:51.760
it's looking like it's gonna be a little closer than they thought.

279
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.560
And the last thing the Clinton administration needs is any controversy over

280
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:59.650
this. And so right in the middle of operation blockade,

281
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.990
Rayez gets a phone call from his boss's boss's boss. So your Magenta, Reno,

282
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:10.010
no, Janet Reno, who is the attorney general, was a big lady. Very imposed.

283
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.590
I like her. I mean even back then when she was hammering away at me,

284
00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:19.591
I liked her and she wanted to talk to me and she started using talking points.

285
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.270
Why it was a wrong thing. Yeah. Political consequences,

286
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:29.410
international ramification, blah, blah, blah. He has this sense, okay, I'm,

287
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.670
I'm uh, I'm about to be fired. Oh yeah. But he says to her, I said,

288
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.190
Madam Attorney General, with all due respect, do me one favor. I said,

289
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.570
come and visit El Paso. Just come and visit El Pestle. Yeah. He said,

290
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:47.440
because you are making these statements with all due respect,

291
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:49.770
without knowing the, that it's made

292
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.740
<v 2>in El Paso. I said, please come to El Paso.</v>

293
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.100
She silence. And I said, Oh crap.

294
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.010
But she says I will be there Tuesday.

295
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:01.490
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

296
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.330
<v 0>so Janet Reno flies to El Paso. Rayez sets up a bunch of meetings for her.</v>

297
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.440
And I told her, I said, look,

298
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.310
I'm not going to be there cause I want you to hear it unfiltered and without me

299
00:18:10.311 --> 00:18:12.050
being there as he tells it,

300
00:18:12.051 --> 00:18:15.200
Janet Reno sat down for all these meetings with all these local business people

301
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:18.470
and she was so blown away by what she heard,

302
00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:21.080
how happy everyone was with the situation.

303
00:18:21.081 --> 00:18:24.950
Then she put aside the fact that Mexico was best put aside NAFTA. Yeah.

304
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.410
<v 2>And uh, she came back and she, she shook my hand.</v>

305
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.533
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

306
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.180
<v 2>very impressive. What you've done here is amazing.</v>

307
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.770
What people are telling me is incredible. I mean, she went on and on. She says,

308
00:18:39.771 --> 00:18:44.771
I'm going back and I'm going to tell the president that he needs to hear you

309
00:18:45.021 --> 00:18:49.520
talk about this operation. Wow. I said the prison of the United States, yes.

310
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.110
<v 0>Cheat your entire view after after one visit. That's what he says.</v>

311
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.530
And apparently she was barely there for a day. Let,

312
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.030
I wish we could get Janet Reno's take on this,

313
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:05.031
but unfortunately she died in 2016 but her change of heart actually makes a

314
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:09.690
certain kind of sense. I mean there was a real, a very important um,

315
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.290
political element to all of this. That's Doris Meissner.

316
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:17.250
She was at the time the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

317
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.791
Basically.

318
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:22.620
Janet Reno is number two when it came to the border and she says that at that

319
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:25.740
moment the Janet Reno was in Texas touring El Paso.

320
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.800
The Clinton administration had a big problem on his hands because about a

321
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.450
thousand miles west, Californians are

322
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.810
<v 8>up in arms about the illegal immigration.</v>

323
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.520
But as coming into California,

324
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.670
we're 40% of the babies born on Medicaid in California today are born of illegal

325
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.940
immigrants going according to the centers, the blender finish. I agree.

326
00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:52.300
We are going to take back California. You had this wave.

327
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.470
Do you like American of anti immigrant sentiment and initiatives like

328
00:19:56.471 --> 00:20:00.760
proposition one 87 proposition one 87 attempts to solve the state illegal

329
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:04.420
immigration problem by denying services to illegal immigrants.

330
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.080
Super hard line measure measure past five 59% of the state's votes by a wide

331
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:15.040
margin. And the Clinton administration was definitely paying attention because

332
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.200
California is California.

333
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.890
The largest electoral college prize in November is presidential election.

334
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.581
And keep in mind,

335
00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:26.581
California had been a red state from 1968 all the way to 1992 Clinton was the

336
00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:30.700
guy who broke the cycle and if he was going to get reelected,

337
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:35.790
California had to continue to vote for the Clinton administration

338
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

339
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.910
<v 0>so one of the things that might have changed, Janet Reno's mind,</v>

340
00:20:42.911 --> 00:20:45.820
or more importantly her boss, Bill Clinton's mind,

341
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.480
was that saw in El Paso a potential solution to the California problem.

342
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.500
If they could make illegal immigration way less visible as ray as had done in El

343
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.333
Paso,

344
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.910
<v 6>maybe they could hold to stay.</v>

345
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.860
I'm pleased to be here today with the INS commissioner, Doris Meissner,

346
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.670
February 7th, 1995 and special heroes mine.

347
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.970
Chief Sylvester Reyes of the El Paso Border Patrol.

348
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.830
We have just come from a meeting with President Clinton,

349
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.940
which time he signed a presidential memorandum directing our agencies to move

350
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:28.011
forward with new initiatives to gain control of our border and better enforce

351
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.710
our immigration laws. This is the first

352
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.580
<v 10>national border patrol strategy. That's right.</v>

353
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.680
I spend a great deal of time on it.

354
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.430
Things had not been done that way before and it was a,

355
00:21:40.431 --> 00:21:42.620
it was a fundamental change in strategy

356
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.400
<v 0>according to Doris Meissner and she really was the architect of this strategy.</v>

357
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.760
The idea was to take what ray is, was doing,

358
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.150
<v 10>which was very clarifying and scale it up.</v>

359
00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:59.151
There were basically four major crossing corridors along the southwest border.

360
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.710
<v 0>Each of those four spots that we're going to amass border patrol agents on the</v>

361
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:10.150
border, not behind the border, not in the city where they piss off the locals,

362
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.300
but directly on the border concentrate resources starting of course in

363
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:17.044
California,

364
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.360
<v 10>our strategy was to start in San Diego because that was the highest crossing</v>

365
00:22:23.541 --> 00:22:24.020
corridor,

366
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.580
maybe 45 to 50% of the crossings across the entire southwest border were

367
00:22:28.581 --> 00:22:30.290
happening in the San Diego sector.

368
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.740
We start in San Diego with operation gatekeeper.

369
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:34.880
That's what that one was called.

370
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.770
We then moved to I believe Arizona and I'm just trying to think of what we named

371
00:22:39.771 --> 00:22:43.910
that operation safeguard. Safeguard. That was right. Exactly.

372
00:22:43.911 --> 00:22:45.890
And then the fourth was south Texas.

373
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.820
<v 0>All of a sudden now in 1994, the Border Patrol, uh, publishes this,</v>

374
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.860
what's called the, um, the strategic plan,

375
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.100
also known as prevention through deterrence. This is Jason De Leon again,

376
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.030
the anthropologist who started us off on this whole series that they write in

377
00:23:02.031 --> 00:23:03.050
this policy document.

378
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.860
We know the border cuts across a whole bunch of very difficult environments.

379
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.000
If we disrupt a traditional crossing places, urban ports of entry.

380
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.550
And we push people towards these extreme environments.

381
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.180
They will have to cross rushing rivers, mountainous terrain,

382
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.510
places that where you can freeze to death, where you can die of dehydration.

383
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.720
But the extreme environment, we'll slow people's movement,

384
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.400
will make them easier to catch and will also perhaps stop them from coming.

385
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.320
In other words, after Rayez,

386
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.650
it became our national strategy to push people away from urban areas and use,

387
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.380
say the desert as a kind of natural deterrent. The

388
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.130
<v 10>thinking was that that would be a natural geographic, you know,</v>

389
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.573
uh,

390
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.820
ally that would take care of the rest.

391
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.110
<v 1>No.</v>

392
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:58.840
And

393
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.250
<v 10>now one of the things of course, that we learn is that,</v>

394
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.070
um, that that didn't hold

395
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.600
<v 4>because in the 90s, the Mexican economy was struggling,</v>

396
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:14.360
so people still needed jobs and that on the American side,

397
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:18.860
farms and businesses were still happy to hire them. So people still crossed,

398
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.760
except now they weren't crossing through the cities.

399
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.380
They were crossing through the desert where no one was watching.

400
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.040
Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass. So sun struck.

401
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.280
They didn't know their own names. Just like in new Rayez book,

402
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:36.650
the Devil's highway, couldn't remember where they'd come from.

403
00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.290
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

404
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.050
<v 4>had forgotten and how long they'd been lost.</v>

405
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.560
And so that's why in the late nineties you see the number of people dying in the

406
00:24:47.561 --> 00:24:50.650
Sonoran desert overnight start to skyrocket.

407
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.950
You go from five to 10 bodies to to hundreds

408
00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.430
by 2002 or so the numbers in Arizona, our upper end, 150 deaths per year,

409
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.340
a couple of years after that, it goes over 200.

410
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.840
Those are the official border patrol numbers that they report based on the

411
00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:09.760
number of bodies found.

412
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.680
But after Jason had that experience finding an arm in the desert and not being

413
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.470
able to locate the rest of the body, he,

414
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:20.140
he started to wonder whether those numbers were accurate or not.

415
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.630
How many more people might be dying out there who are never found,

416
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.640
never counted. Yeah.

417
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.320
Which for Jason at least became a scientific question about what happens to

418
00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:36.760
bodies in the desert. How fast do they decompose? And what ends up happening is,

419
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.510
um, I just kind of hit the library, scour the literature. You know,

420
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.270
there's body farms where we do this with Tennessee, Texas.

421
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.900
Jason found this one paper that suggested that when bodies are decomposing in

422
00:25:46.901 --> 00:25:50.620
the desert, the heat and the dryness can drastically slow that process down.

423
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.430
This idea that the desert is going to conserve a body that's gonna mummify and

424
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.370
that people will be out there forever according to that paper,

425
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.520
could take up to six months for a body to decompose to the point where you'd be

426
00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:01.790
able to see the bones. Wow.

427
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.080
But the remains in that study were collected in a bunch of different areas under

428
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.940
different conditions, sometimes even indoors.

429
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.540
No one had done it kind of in C2 in the desert. We had literally no,

430
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.340
no scientific data on that at all.

431
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.890
And so I started getting really interested in,

432
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.000
is there a way to do some, some science around this?

433
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.290
He eventually wrote in and an assistant named Kate Hall Hall.

434
00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:29.250
And I'm a physical. Yes.

435
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.900
<v 10>Just what's a physical anthropologist?</v>

436
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.430
I'm a physical anthropologist is someone who studies,

437
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.680
they re they study human bones and they try and infer what someone's life and

438
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.070
death was like from skeletal remains.

439
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.310
<v 0>And Jason Pretty much came up to me and told me that he'd been thinking about</v>

440
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.710
getting some pigs, pigs, pigs,

441
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.130
pigs have long been the common proxy for human bodies, you know,

442
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:58.740
for crime scene stuff like, um, they would, they shoot him,

443
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.710
they bury them and they, you know, they,

444
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.200
and they use them for these different are sort of, um,

445
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.280
decomposition experiments. So,

446
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.150
<v 6>uh, Jason and Kate and the research team had down to Arizona,</v>

447
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.510
University of Arizona has a meat laboratory that's,

448
00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.530
that deals with live animals. So we called up, uh, uh, Jerome, the,

449
00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.550
uh, pig euthanize her and he came out in this big truck.

450
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.080
He comes out with these animals to pigs 150 pounds each alive.

451
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.550
Jerome shoots the pigs in the head right in front of them.

452
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.800
And then Kate and Jason, we got shoes and socks dressed their pigs, bra,

453
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.950
panties, jeans,

454
00:27:35.951 --> 00:27:39.220
tee shirts and clothes that migrants would wear because they wanted to recreate

455
00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:40.300
the conditions. Exactly.

456
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.140
And then they took these dress dead pigs out into the desert.

457
00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.360
Arivaca Arizona.

458
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.130
It's like another planet. It's like nowhere else I have ever been on earth.

459
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.300
Um, it's hot and saying it's hot.

460
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.260
It doesn't really do it justice. It was like hundred,

461
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:03.850
1,015 degrees Fahrenheit. Whoa.

462
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.300
So Jason and the research team get together in this big field and we had one one

463
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:13.080
pig under a tree in light shade.

464
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.920
We were trying to replicate like if someone was tired and needed to take a rest

465
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:20.820
somewhere and for the second pig, Jason had heard from anecdotes, from migrants,

466
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.400
stories about people dying in their groups and they would say,

467
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.410
well we didn't want to leave this person behind,

468
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.640
but we had to because they were dead.

469
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.730
They would cover their body with rocks and hopes of protecting them from

470
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:32.580
animals. So they placed these two pigs, one in the shade,

471
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.830
one under rocks in the sun, and they set up a series of motion sensing cameras.

472
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.910
Yeah,

473
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.660
<v 0>all around the perimeter of the area to watch both pigs.</v>

474
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.420
These are the kinds of cameras that turn on if something moves. Right.

475
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.530
We set up the cameras under a very, very hot sun. And then they waited.

476
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.890
And remember, based on what Jason had read,

477
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:56.120
the prevailing idea was that bodies in the desert don't decompose until,

478
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.300
you know, six months in to around nine months in.

479
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.750
And that would make the likelihood that they'd be found higher,

480
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.230
which might suggest that the official numbers are accurate. Regardless.

481
00:29:06.231 --> 00:29:10.610
The assumption was that these bodies would be laying around for a while,

482
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.140
but pretty quick.

483
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

484
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.410
<v 6>Something moves and triggers the camera.</v>

485
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.370
So this is footage of the pig that was in the shade.

486
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.640
And on the cameras you see this pig just under a tree lying on its side.

487
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:34.020
It's wearing his little white shoes. It has jeans on. It's bloated,

488
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.700
but it's intact.

489
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.500
And then later that night camera comes on again. It's night vision. Um,

490
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.070
you can see

491
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.650
<v 0>the pig again and then,</v>

492
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.840
<v 1>yeah,</v>

493
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.600
<v 0>you see this vulture</v>

494
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.483
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

495
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.270
<v 0>a few feet away from the pig kind of looking at it, kind of checking it out,</v>

496
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.220
just standing there.

497
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.200
<v 11>And then after a couple of hours,</v>

498
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.240
<v 0>camera comes back on and the other eight vultures on top of this pig packing and</v>

499
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.570
tearing. A few hours later

500
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.180
<v 12>they, they go in, they make a hole in the back of the neck, um,</v>

501
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:22.190
kind of like kind of right behind the ear and they're trying to get at the brain

502
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.180
and then

503
00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.770
they pull off the shirt.

504
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.470
They eventually ripped the jeans off.

505
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.370
<v 13>By noon is the fifth day.</v>

506
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.200
<v 12>There are hordes of vultures.</v>

507
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.800
You see them attack the abdomen,

508
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.620
ripped open the stomach and then you see intestines being pulled out and then

509
00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:49.130
you have two vultures come in front of the camera and they're playing tug of war

510
00:30:49.131 --> 00:30:54.131
with these intestines and they start to take apart the limbs.

511
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.140
They'll actually like carry them away.

512
00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.030
They'll carry limbs as like convenient packages of meat that they can eat later

513
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.340
on day seven,

514
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:09.370
they dragged what was left to the body about 20 meters up a hill and within nine

515
00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:14.900
days they had picnic, picked it clean.

516
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.990
<v 11>Everything has been pulled apart and just scattered all over the place.</v>

517
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.390
<v 13>After nine days, this, there was hardly anything left. Nine days. Yeah.</v>

518
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.830
<v 0>So they thought it might take nine months and now it's down to nine days.</v>

519
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.430
<v 13>[inaudible] and that was the pig in the shade. The pig in the little rock hut.</v>

520
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.060
The, that pig went way faster. Yeah. That was within 24 hours.

521
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.540
Vultures had started feeding and just got in underneath the rocks and rip that

522
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:45.770
up because we've, we had really forgotten that that rocks, um, conduct heat.

523
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.710
So it literally cooks the body and speeds up this process.

524
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.410
<v 11>It w w completely defied expectations.</v>

525
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.810
This wasn't all you're expecting at all.

526
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.930
<v 0>And were, were vultures, the only scavengers that you are known as saying,</v>

527
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.880
not the only scavengers. So we saw some ravens,

528
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.740
<v 13>domestic dogs. Oh. So this town of Arivaca where we work in,</v>

529
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:08.260
a lot of people die nearby and they have these, you know,

530
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.260
kind of ranch dogs that are pretty wide ranging and people have,

531
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.630
I've heard stories of people saying, you know, my doc at home with a,

532
00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:18.670
with a piece of, uh, human bone. Um, uh, but these animals were, you know,

533
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.380
were on our property eating these pigs.

534
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.980
<v 0>I'm just now thinking of it from the point of view of the dog owner.</v>

535
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:26.220
I like this dog comes in and gets on the couch and like lifts your face.

536
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.150
That's the same tongue that might've been gnawing on a human arm. Exactly.

537
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.410
And after the vultures and crows and dogs that have their way with these pigs,

538
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.180
Jason k told us that the desert started working in smaller almost invisible

539
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.490
ways. I

540
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.640
<v 11>had never seen this before. Like we're used to flies and some beetles,</v>

541
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.660
but we have footage of aunts and consuming parts of long bones.

542
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:54.840
They're chipping off pieces of bone and carrying them off to this ant hole a

543
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.470
meter away.

544
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.900
<v 13>That was really shocking and it kind of hinted to the fact that you leave</v>

545
00:32:57.901 --> 00:33:01.680
someone out there for long enough and they will completely disappear.

546
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.730
<v 11>This is an environment in which people can become really easily just erased.</v>

547
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.700
<v 0>Well there is something about when you,</v>

548
00:33:09.701 --> 00:33:14.701
when you were describing the first moment when the vultures really sort of tear

549
00:33:15.181 --> 00:33:20.070
into the body. I, I found myself kind of recoiling trying to protect my abdomen.

550
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.170
I still have that reaction.

551
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:27.290
There's something just so overwhelmingly human about this.

552
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.660
You can't not take this personally. Well,

553
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:34.850
can we talk about the, uh, the numbers for a second?

554
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.260
Because if bodies are decomposing and disappearing this fast,

555
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.180
those border patrol numbers start to look suspiciously low.

556
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.590
Do you have any sense based on the speed of the decomposition,

557
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.570
how many people we might have

558
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.110
<v 13>the missing? Well, you know, it just, it just depends. I mean, on the,</v>

559
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.110
on when people die at what time of year, I mean, if you live,

560
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.600
I guess a better way to do it is if you compare the number of missing persons

561
00:34:03.601 --> 00:34:07.010
reports with the numbers of recovered bodies, there's a discrepancy of,

562
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.380
of thousands. These are missing persons reports from,

563
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.100
these are people leaving from Latin America and missing persons reports are

564
00:34:14.101 --> 00:34:17.310
either filed in the u s by families already here or,

565
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:21.890
or from these sending countries, but thousands of missing persons reports, um,

566
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:25.710
more than the actual recovered bodies. Thousands a year.

567
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.930
Thousands of people go missing a year during this process.

568
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.620
<v 0>Starting obviously missing persons reports don't equate to deaths in the desert.</v>

569
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.240
But pretty much everyone I talk to, including some retired border patrol agents,

570
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.300
agree that the official number is an under count. Now,

571
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:44.010
when it comes to the actual number of deaths, nobody knows for sure.

572
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.180
Depending on who you ask,

573
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:50.181
the real number could be anywhere from twice to 10 times the official count,

574
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:56.240
and if you think about the fact that that has been happening for 20 years,

575
00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:01.050
then what that high school history teacher one cyber corn auto told us at the

576
00:35:01.051 --> 00:35:04.380
end of our last episode doesn't sound so crazy

577
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.500
<v 13>because of us fences were built because the fences were built.</v>

578
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.440
Maybe 10,000 people have died in the desert.

579
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.010
<v 0>Yeah, and there's no way to verify that number or any number,</v>

580
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:23.340
but the potential scale of it kind of forces you to ask who is responsible.

581
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:28.090
Some of these people I've talked to said that the Mexican government needs to do

582
00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:31.810
more to stop people going into these areas, which seems like a bit of a cop out.

583
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.080
A others blame the smugglers who bring people over.

584
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.760
Some people have said that the migrants, it's their responsibility.

585
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:41.670
They knew they were making this decision to come. If they die, it's on them,

586
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.060
but the other obvious question is what about us?

587
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.840
Yeah, and what's clear, you know,

588
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:55.910
according to Jason is that US policy makers weren't exactly clueless about this

589
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.370
and there were points where people were saying things like, if we do this,

590
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:01.830
if we funnel them towards the Sonora desert of Arizona,

591
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.230
we funnel them towards the sort of backwoods of Texas.

592
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.280
People are going to get hurt, people are going to die. But if enough people die,

593
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.160
perhaps that will be the determinant then that they'll stop coming and there are

594
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.390
the charts. Is that written down that if, oh my God, yeah,

595
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.840
the death equals deterrence.

596
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.560
There's a chart that I cite in the book and this was one of the,

597
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.970
one of the moments where I was,

598
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.750
when I was doing the kind of archival research that just just shocked me where

599
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:27.210
there was a point where someone had written this policy document.

600
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.260
And then in one of the followup reports by the government accountability office,

601
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.350
some number cruncher or some policy maker is sitting at a computer and DC making

602
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:40.740
an excel chart where they're putting out different metrics to measure the

603
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.590
effectiveness of this policy. And one of the metrics is an increase in, in um,

604
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.560
in migraine death.

605
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.790
So there was a recognition that if death goes up it means that this policy is

606
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:54.750
working. I ended up finding the document Jason was referring to. It's a,

607
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:58.560
it's a report from the Government Accountability Office from 1997.

608
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.430
And I talked to Doris Meissner about it. She's remember the, uh,

609
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.170
former INS commissioner that helped take Sylvester Rayez is hold the line

610
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:12.150
strategy national. I actually read part of the report to her. Yes.

611
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.090
And then there was this kind of one appendix in it.

612
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.830
So it's called appendix five.

613
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.060
And it's a indicators for measuring the effectiveness of the strategy to deter

614
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:25.920
illegal entry along the southwest borders. And one of the indicators was deaths,

615
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.870
deaths of aliens attempting entry. Um, and basically what it says is that,

616
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.880
um, I'm sort of quoting it that if the attorney general strategy is successful,

617
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.800
deaths may increase as enforcement in urban areas forces aliens to attempt

618
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:45.090
mountain or desert crossings. In effect saying that if this strategy,

619
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.290
if if deaths increase in these treacherous areas,

620
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.810
that's a sign that the strategy is working.

621
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.163
<v 10>I do. I</v>

622
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.960
think I recall reading that because it's so, you know,

623
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.130
it makes you gasp when you have to really think about what the,

624
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.440
all of the implications of all of these things are. I mean, you know,

625
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:12.441
this is one of the paradoxes of how is it that you go about doing work like

626
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:13.260
this.

627
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:18.260
It's absolutely clear for so many reasons that there needs to be border

628
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:21.474
security.

629
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:27.050
But I think it is fair to say that the idea that we had at the time and thinking

630
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:35.160
that we put into place at the time was two simple,

631
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.010
what

632
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.620
<v 0>was much more difficult to take into account.</v>

633
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.910
It has been the tenacity of people coming to the United States wanting to come

634
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.791
to the United States and the length to which people will go in order to do that.

635
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:57.310
What, but there's another way to read this. I mean the uh, the appendix five,

636
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.100
that's sort of the, the thing that, that as you, in your words you said,

637
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.580
you know,

638
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:05.580
could make you gasp with that sort of says in one way to read that is that we

639
00:39:06.551 --> 00:39:07.690
took, um,

640
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.370
a problem that was very visible and we pushed it to places where we can't see it

641
00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:12.204
anymore.

642
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.780
And we did that with full knowledge that, that,

643
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.240
that people dying means we're doing the right thing to, to me,

644
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.950
appendix five begs the question, I mean, what responsibility do we,

645
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.910
<v 10>I have for this?</v>

646
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.340
<v 0>It doesn't quite feel like this is something that we can just shrug and say,</v>

647
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:31.660
we didn't know this is going to happen.

648
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.270
It feels like we knew damn well this is going to happen.

649
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.590
<v 10>Um, you know, when you asked the question, what is our responsibility?</v>

650
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:40.600
And when you say our, I think,

651
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.810
and I take that to mean what is our responsibility as a nation?

652
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.150
The answer at the time,

653
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:51.151
and the answer still is that the enforcement will do everything that it can to

654
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.800
prevent people from crossing in dangerous areas,

655
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.980
but that cannot include no longer doing enforcement across the border.

656
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.140
<v 0>Now Doris says that, you know,</v>

657
00:40:04.141 --> 00:40:06.960
once they started to realize these numbers had spiked in that people were going

658
00:40:06.961 --> 00:40:11.130
through these areas, they started doing a lot of public awareness campaigns,

659
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.720
campaigns,

660
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.340
warning people about the dangers of the desert efforts devoted to safety on the

661
00:40:17.341 --> 00:40:20.490
Mexican side. And they created a whole new search and rescue unit.

662
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.500
<v 10>So there were all kinds of efforts to address it.</v>

663
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.070
But I will be absolutely frank with you.

664
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.460
The idea of abandoning any kind of strengthened border enforcement because of

665
00:40:36.811 --> 00:40:41.670
that consequence was not a serious, I have not a point of serious discussion

666
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.920
<v 0>and the policy never really changed in any substantive way. There was a,</v>

667
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:48.560
there was a later report that came out from the government accountability office

668
00:40:48.561 --> 00:40:53.390
in 2006 that basically said, you look, you've done all these safety measures,

669
00:40:53.391 --> 00:40:56.660
but the deaths in the desert are still going up.

670
00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.920
Doris Meisner was no longer head of the ins at that point,

671
00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:04.340
but after reaching out to a whole bunch of people who wrote that report and the

672
00:41:04.341 --> 00:41:07.940
people who received it and hearing nothing back, frankly,

673
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.090
I finally got in touch with the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection

674
00:41:11.091 --> 00:41:12.950
under President Bush at the time.

675
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.480
Ralph Basham now retired and he told me he remembered reading that report.

676
00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.540
He said that he thought about those deaths all the time every day,

677
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.260
but in the end he said it was just politically infeasible to back off the

678
00:41:24.261 --> 00:41:28.070
enforcement at the major crossing points or to get enough border patrol to

679
00:41:28.071 --> 00:41:31.970
really control dangerous areas like the desert. And in the end,

680
00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:35.930
the u s government didn't make any substantive changes in response to the rise

681
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:36.764
in deaths.

682
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:41.870
And I guess you could read that as a lack of political will or indifference.

683
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.380
But Jason actually argues that we were giving a sort of tacit blessing to this

684
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:53.111
system that was killing all these people because it kept this problem just swept

685
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:55.570
under the rug. Yeah. Um,

686
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:01.270
<v 13>are you saying that the u s government or whatever portion of it is responsible</v>

687
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:05.660
for this policy is knowingly, um,

688
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.443
killing people?

689
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.120
I would say it's knowingly putting people in harms way and they know that there

690
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:19.121
is a high likelihood that a certain percentage of people are going to die and

691
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:22.510
have been dying. So it's like, so it's like they're having nature do the,

692
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.820
do their dirty work. That's kind of what you feel like is absolutely, I mean,

693
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:30.740
I would say 100% that nature is an agent of the border patrol. Um, it's a,

694
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:33.740
this kind of unsung hero of the border patrol. You know,

695
00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:36.080
they're not on the payroll, but they do all this work.

696
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.150
The environment beats up on migrants. And then those who don't make it, it just,

697
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.860
it cleans up the mess as well.

698
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.430
And nobody has to be accountable for this because it just disappears.

699
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.950
We asked customs and border protection,

700
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.240
which overseas border patrol to comment whether they had tried to change their

701
00:42:57.241 --> 00:43:00.630
strategy to avoid migrant deaths and they declined to answer.

702
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.940
<v 0>I wonder if, I wonder if you feel somehow ambivalent about it.</v>

703
00:43:05.941 --> 00:43:10.200
Like obviously there are trade offs for everything. Every,

704
00:43:10.201 --> 00:43:14.460
every plan has unintended consequences, but, but this,

705
00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:19.160
now this has happened and, and these deaths are, are also happening. Um,

706
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.710
I wonder how you feel about it if you feel somehow ambivalent about it.

707
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.110
<v 10>I feel deeply ambivalent about it. I feel deeply sorry about it.</v>

708
00:43:28.111 --> 00:43:29.970
I am very conflicted about it.

709
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:35.570
I also know that migration is by its very nature,

710
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.250
an incredibly dangerous enterprise. You know, when it's illegal immigration,

711
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.840
people coming up well before they ever get to the u s border.

712
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.850
People coming up through Mexico through very dangerous areas where they are

713
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:54.660
robbed and kidnapped and extorted. I mean, there are awful,

714
00:43:54.661 --> 00:43:58.860
terrible things that go on in this quest for a better life.

715
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.460
What I wish is that we would be able as a country to put immigration policies

716
00:44:05.731 --> 00:44:06.480
into effect,

717
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.480
that it actually allow for people to come here legally whom our economy is

718
00:44:11.731 --> 00:44:15.660
asking for in terms of the jobs that exist in the country.

719
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.960
This system that we've been involved with for now decades of

720
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.650
allowing illegal immigration to occur in sizable numbers,

721
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:33.830
having worked for people in this is indefensible and the enforcement agencies

722
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:37.620
are caught in between that.

723
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:42.710
They're required to create border security and yet there are these terrible

724
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:44.934
costs.

725
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.540
Those terrible costs would not be there if we as a country and as a political

726
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:56.181
system would come to grips with the issue that is right in front of our eyes and

727
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.540
that we simply won't come together politically to answer that we are a nation of

728
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:07.470
immigrants. We are a country that believes in the rule of law.

729
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.780
We can't.

730
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:15.020
It is indefensible in light of that history and those values to have allowed

731
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.520
this kind of an illegal immigration picture to go on in the way that it has for

732
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:25.950
all these many years.

733
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.740
<v 0>Wouldn't a wall, I mean it's,</v>

734
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.690
this is going to sound [inaudible] misses an intentionally naive question,

735
00:45:34.691 --> 00:45:39.130
but if what you're saying is that, uh, that, that uh,

736
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.740
we need to save lives, whether,

737
00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:46.741
however you feel about the issue of immigration w isn't a wall more humane given

738
00:45:47.471 --> 00:45:48.340
what you've just told us?

739
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.750
<v 13>Well, the wall is not going to do anything. I mean we know that, you know,</v>

740
00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:53.860
I spend a lot of time now,

741
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.610
most of my time is not spent with smugglers who love the idea of a wall cause

742
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:59.860
they're like, man, I can charge twice as much for this,

743
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:03.640
for my services even though it's really not going to be that much harder.

744
00:46:03.641 --> 00:46:07.210
I mean, cause people dig underneath it, they crawl over it, they fly over it,

745
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.320
they take a boat around it. I mean the wall itself is Never gonna.

746
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.400
It's never going to be a deterrent.

747
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:17.020
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

748
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.700
<v 6>and on top of that, I actually, I didn't even know this when we talked to Jason,</v>

749
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:26.440
but if you listen to the things that president Trump has said about the wall

750
00:46:26.441 --> 00:46:27.820
since coming into office,

751
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.860
<v 14>maybe 2000 miles of wall, that you just don't need that because of nature,</v>

752
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.140
because of mountains and rivers and lots of other things,

753
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:39.190
<v 6>it would end up just being a sort of even stronger version of this policy.</v>

754
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.270
<v 14>Large areas where you don't need a wall because you have a bat and you have a</v>

755
00:46:43.271 --> 00:46:45.930
river, you have a pilot river, and you don't need it,

756
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.940
<v 6>an even stronger funnel into these very places that are killing people and</v>

757
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.550
you're racing any evidence of their death.

758
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.780
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>
