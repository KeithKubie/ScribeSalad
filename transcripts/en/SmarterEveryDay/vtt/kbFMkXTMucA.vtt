[music]

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.290
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.460
I'm in Caleb's room. Caleb is a science fair winner, so he is

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.640
legit, and you dropped the cat in the cat drop video right?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.640
- Yes.
- And we had a deal right? I paid you with something. What did I pay you with?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.710
- These Lego motors.
- That's pretty cool.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.860
But I called you and I said I want you to build something for me for a video. What is it?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.010
- This Lego inchworm. This battery pack allows

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.190
the motor to turn, which powers the axle,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.230
the worm wheel, the cam which drives the whole thing, and this

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.270
ratchet, it allows the worm to move in one spot

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.320
so it doesn't do this.
- That's awesome. Oh when you take the ratchet off it doesn't

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.380
work so you have to put the ratchet back on? So it pushes against itself.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.550
That's awesome. So I have been fascinated as long as I can

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.730
remember with locomotion. That's why Caleb got these motors. So today

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.910
on Smarter Every Day we're gonna look at caterpillar locomotion. But we have to go back to the Amazon rainforest

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.080
to see it. It's a group of caterpillars doing something really strange.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.260
Let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.300
So check this out. Gordon found a big caterpillar that's basically

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.390
a macro organism of a bunch of little caterpillars.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.450
And they're all moving as one.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.500
That's weird.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.670
- They all stop and think at the same time too. See that?

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.850
(Destin) Gerson, do you know a word for this?
- No.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.030
- See they all stop at the same time.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.190
- Oh that's weird.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.200
If you look, like for a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.390
school of fish or birds it's usually the bird or the fish in front that dictates where the whole

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.560
group goes. But if you look at the caterpillars when they're stopping they're doing this little

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.750
stop and think technique, you'll notice that it propogates from the back to the front sometimes.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.830
That's really strange. I wonder what kind of clock or rhythm is dictating this.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.010
I don't know. Look at it. Really weird.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.460
Alright note to self.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.640
Go back and look at the video of the caterpillars and see if the ones on top

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.830
are moving twice as fast as the ones on bottom, or depending on how many layers up they are

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.940
if they're moving like three times as fast. So it wasn't until I got here and started playing with Legos that I

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.070
realised it's not only the second and third level of caterpillars that's moving faster,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.190
it's the entire group as a whole. OK to demonstrate this we're gonna have a Lego drag race. You can

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.380
see I've got a single caterpillar on this side and I have a whole group of caterpillars on this side.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.570
At each frame I'm gonna move the single caterpillar one click and I'm gonna move the ones on

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.740
bottom one click as well as the ones rolling across the top one click. Keep your eyes

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840
on the blue caterpillars. Ready, set, wiggle.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.930
[slurping sounds]

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.080
So you can see from our little race here that the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.250
caterpillar that was by himself is a lot slower than the caterpillar that was in the group.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.300
Now we had two levels. So does that mean that this moved twice as fast?

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.330
No it doesn't. Do the math for me by looking at these grids and let me know in the comments how much

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.350
faster. But think about this. What if we had three levels or even more?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.440
How much efficiency do the real caterpillars add every time they add a level?

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.610
I think the coolest part is that they all stop at the same time.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.790
Look at that.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.960
Then they start back up. Tactile communication right?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.140
So thank you for learning about caterpillars with us, and thank you

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.320
to you Caleb for playing Legos with me, and now I will earn your subscription

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.380
by walking across Legos barefoot.
- Hope that goes well.
- I don't owe you anything do I?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.570
We're good? We're square?
- We're good, we're square.
- OK. Have a good one.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.650
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.720
So I vote we call this a brood of caterpillars.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.800
- A brood?
- What are you gonna call it Gordon?
- A slather.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.900
- Ah ooh. [laughs]

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.090
Oww, oww.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.260
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Yeah, sure does.
- Then you see more crazy stuff

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.440
in like ten minutes out here than you do in a whole year back home.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.550
That's it. That's cool. Let's go another twenty feet and find something else in the rainforest.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.023
[laugh]
