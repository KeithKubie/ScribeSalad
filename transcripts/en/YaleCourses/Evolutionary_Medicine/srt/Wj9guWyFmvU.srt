1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Some mental disorders can be viewed as
extreme expressions of behaviors that are

2
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:10,010
otherwise normal.
The seems to be true for anxiety

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,430
here.
There is an important principle,

4
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:17,510
the smoke detector principal that gives
us some insight into our vulnerability

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,540
seems to be true of depression and
obsessive compulsive disorders.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,530
Yeah,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,890
there are two general
kinds of explanation.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,430
One is that the disorder is simply the
tail of the distribution who said her is

9
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,170
normal,
selected and adaptive.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,560
That generates a
population level trade off.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,430
I'll remind you of of that
image which expresses that idea.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,980
The other is that disorder results
from the dysregulation of an adjustable

13
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:47,814
system.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,320
Anxiety needs to be adjusted to the
environment when dysregulated by

15
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:56,400
environmental mismatch in
genetic predisposition than
a maladaptive behavior can

16
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,234
result.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,430
So let's have a look at anxiety.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,550
Fear and panic are clearly adaptive
in appropriate circumstances.

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,440
Fear of snakes and spiders seems
to be innate in some people.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,400
Some fear of strangers
is probably appropriate.

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,820
Fear of predators is
certainly appropriate.

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,250
Separation anxiety can help infants
to maintain parental support.

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,310
People who lack the capacity for fear
and anxiety would probably not survive

24
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:32,144
very long

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,250
with exaggerations of fear and
anxiety can become pathological.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,230
Hear the smoke detector principle,
uh, can give some insight.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,390
When a response is cheap and it
protects from serious injury,

28
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,220
it pays to set the threshold
for triggering that response
at a very low level.

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,370
Many false alarms result,

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,710
but they do not cost very much and
virtually all real threats do then trigger

31
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:02,820
helpful responses.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,370
The biological systems that react to
the threats are built of many components

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,690
resulting in output distributions that
have frequent centers and rare tails.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,620
So we can combine that idea with
the smoke detector principle.

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,220
The tails contain the
math pathological extreme,

36
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:23,400
such as clinical phobias
and anxiety disorders.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,930
This insight helps us to understand
more than it helps us to treat.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,340
I fear,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,890
but I think the idea is useful and it's
one of Randy nussies real contributions

40
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:41,600
to understanding the evolutionary
origins of mental disorders.

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,250
If the response is cheap,
many false alarms may result,

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,990
but they don't cost much and virtually
all real threats do trigger healthful

43
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,240
responses when the threshold is set low.

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,540
Yeah.

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,440
What about depression?

46
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,970
One evolutionary is that depression is
a part of normal functional variation in

47
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:09,820
mood. That evolved as a mechanism to
allocate effort in proportion to reward.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,020
In other words,

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,940
if you are doing something and you're
getting the feedback that it's not

50
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,774
working,

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,930
then depression is one way to mediate
withdrawal from that unrewarding

52
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,374
situation.

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,510
This idea fits quite well with the
notion of a complex system that produces

54
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,660
tales of output,
the represent pathological extremes,

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,080
so the center of the distribution is
actually functional and it's a way of

56
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:42,520
keeping people from engaging in activities
where they get punished rather than

57
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,360
rewarded, but the tails of the
distribution are not functional.

58
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,970
Yeah,

59
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,970
both positive manic and
negative depressive extremes
of mood are then seen as

60
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:58,080
population level tradeoffs with the
central region of the distribution of mood

61
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:02,430
variation where variation is normally
adaptive and in fact homeostatic,

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,160
it regulates behavior
towards functional ends.

63
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,400
We can also take a look at obsessive
compulsive disorder from this same general

64
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,234
framework.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,530
OCD is characterized by ritualistic,

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
repetitive behaviors and fear that a
small oversight might lead to disaster.

67
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,550
It has substantial heritability and an
incidence of about 1% in the population.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,460
It may very well represent the tail
of a distribution of responses.

69
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:38,870
Who Center is normally adaptive,
and that center would be habits.

70
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,830
Habits are useful because experience shows
they function well and we do not have

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,170
to think about them.
We put ourselves on autopilot

72
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,540
and that releases us to think
about other things, so we can see.

73
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,320
OCD is the exaggeration of a habit
that becomes a destructive fixation.

74
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,800
To summarize, many mental disorders
have easily recognizable counterparts,

75
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,360
emotional states and personality features
that are part of normal behavior,

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,310
anxiety, depression, mania, and
obsessive compulsive disorder.

77
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:22,311
Or a few of the pathological states that
it represent extreme versions of normal

78
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:27,030
behaviors.
Milder versions include histrionic,

79
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,540
narcissistic,
and dependence disorders.
