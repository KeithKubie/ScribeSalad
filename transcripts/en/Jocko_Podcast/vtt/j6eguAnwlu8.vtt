WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.970
To be clear in your mind.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.940
In what you intend to achieve.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.403
No.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.790
What you are going to do that doesn't seem like too much to ask.

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.920
Certainly in war

6
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.920
and you wouldn't think it would be too much for people to ask in their lives

7
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:33.514
either.

8
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.980
They're precious lives as precious as these 58,000

9
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
that died in Vietnam.
Yeah.
Heroes.

10
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.030
But how often do we see people going through their lives without knowing what

11
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.090
they are trying to do without having any intent,

12
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.850
without having a clear mission.

13
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.620
I'm talking to on an individual level as a person,

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520
people go through their lives without knowing what it is they want to do,

15
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.710
what they want to accomplish.

16
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.350
So know what your mission is,

17
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.350
know what your intent as the commander of your life,

18
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.380
know what your intent is and then fight with everything you've got

19
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.260
to win.
Okay.

20
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.150
Yeah,
and I think that's,
Oh,
I've got for tonight,

21
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.400
so,
okay.
Deco,
maybe if you want to

22
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.150
shed some light on how people can

23
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.980
maybe help themselves when that war.
Sure.

24
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.210
And maybe support the podcast if they want to.

25
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.350
They want to.
Yeah.
That point though,

26
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.520
in my opinion is a good on a,
it's a good one.

27
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.190
It's a good way to think about you.
People go through their lives,

28
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:25.480
I don't even know what they're trying to do.
Yeah.

29
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.320
And it sounds the same thing as going to war without knowing what the outcome is

30
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:30.040
supposed to be.

31
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.200
<v 1>Yeah.
Your goal.</v>

32
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.830
But it sounds kind of like a bs when you say it,

33
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:42.130
you know like hey go through.
You know when you go through life,

34
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.180
should you have a goal,
a real obvious yes.
I can say no,

35
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.830
you shouldn't have a goal kind of thing.

36
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.420
So it seems obvious but you know how you live day to day.
You,
you know,

37
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:54.610
you might have a goal for the day,
maybe two,
maybe three,

38
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.611
but Brett life is for life to the full spectrum of we'll,

39
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.590
<v 0>we'll get it so shocking.
Cause what you're saying is absolutely true.</v>

40
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.220
You wouldn't think that people would be going through life without knowing where

41
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.500
they're trying to get to.
Yeah.

42
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.960
But you wouldn't think that a nation would go to war without clear intention of

43
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.460
where they want to end up.
And how they're going to get there.

44
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.930
At least an idea of how you're gonna get there.

45
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.850
Now I have a little bit of luck when Klaus Fitz says how you're going to conduct

46
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.400
the war.
That's not necessarily true because you don't know.

47
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.430
You can't know how you're going to conduct a war before the war starts.

48
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.060
You can have an idea but you can't know fully.
Just like if you were to say,
Hey,

49
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:33.280
my goal is to x in my life.

50
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.010
You don't know how you're going to be able to do that.
Yeah.

51
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.740
Cause you talking about cause you gotta adjust [inaudible] going to make it an

52
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.960
adaptation is things are going to come up.
Things are gonna Change.

53
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.410
The battlefield changes,
your life changes,
things pop up.
I mean things happen.

54
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:49.030
So I think that that idea that you're going to know how you're going to execute

55
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.170
something is,
is farfetched.

56
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.700
I think actually I should use the word idea.

57
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.470
You should have an idea of how you're going to do it.
Yeah.

58
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.290
You just have an idea like okay,
well this is what I need to get done.

59
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.970
This is what I want to achieve in my life.
I want to make,
I want to do this.

60
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.790
What's a simple one?
I want to own a house.
That's a simple one.

61
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.580
That's a good place to start.
I want to own a house.
Okay,

62
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.330
well let's think about how we're going to get there.
You know,
that's let's,

63
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.910
let's think about how we're going to get there.
You have to build your credit.

64
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.460
You have to,
how do you build your credit?
You have to,
you have to borrow money.

65
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.960
Some people,
somebody would go to buy a house.

66
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:23.980
They've never borrowed money before.

67
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:25.690
You can't borrow money if you've never borrowed money.

68
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.180
You can't borrow money for a house if you've never borrowed money for a car or a

69
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.440
or a or some smaller object before.
So you've got to establish your credit.

70
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.030
Then you've got to have two years worth of income.

71
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.130
Then you've got to have a big fat down,
sitting ready.

72
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.140
So there's things you've got to do this thinking now.

73
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.940
Now that might change along the way.

74
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.040
The idea is that you've got to move towards that goal.

75
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.000
But that's what was so nice about hearing the Vietnamese commander's intent.

76
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.220
Get close,
split them up,
boom.
You go make that happen.
Hey,
guess what?

77
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.630
Do you want to buy a house one day?
Save money.
Have good credit.
Yeah.
Okay,

78
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:56.950
well you gotta make money.
How you gonna make money?

79
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:00.910
You might make it drive an Uber.
You might make it delivering pizza.

80
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.700
You might make,
cause you got your real job,
but that's supporting your family.

81
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.430
But then you need a little extra to throw in there.
Well,

82
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.570
that's why you end up driving Uber or you end up with whatever it is you're

83
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.171
going to do.
Are you ready?

84
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.260
We're gonna make some money on the side that you can start stashing away.
Yeah.

85
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.390
And at the end of the day,
you do have that goal,
you know?

86
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.480
So it is,
yeah.
How you conduct yourself.
It's not gonna be cut and dry for sure.

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.380
But you know,
in these examples,
like,
uh,
you know,
you want to buy a house,

88
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.820
that's a goal.
That's a specific goal.

89
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:30.520
But that's just one teeny tiny goal in life.
If you're only,

90
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.450
of course you're not going to run into somebody who their only goal in life is

91
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.050
to buy a house.
No,
no,
no.
I said a civil one except some people like,
Hey,

92
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.720
don't buy a house.
It's stupid.
You should rent them themselves.
That's fine.

93
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.880
I'm not telling everyone what their goal should be.

94
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.970
And if you want to keep renting,
keep renting.
Maybe that's for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

95
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.180
Fully.
Not for me yet.
But maybe it's for you.

96
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.950
There's other things you want to put your money.
That's cool.

97
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.120
You're doing some other something else smart with your money.
That's fine.
Yeah.

98
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.690
Like public buying rims or something like either way though.
If you,
uh,

99
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.340
consider like just what went classic cause of it's how you see the name.

100
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.120
What did he saying and compare it to life,
right?
Where buying house.
Sure.

101
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:11.930
That's one of many goals you're going to have in life because life is full.

102
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.550
Like I said,
but so it kind of,
when you really think about it by it's hard.

103
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.420
It's hard to like designate some specific goals.

104
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.550
And then that's all you're going to do.
Okay.
Let's say you're to,

105
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:26.770
you're going to say you're going to be financially secure and independent.
Okay.

106
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.530
That would be a much bigger goss.
Yeah.
That's an awesome goal to have.

107
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.360
And the younger you make that goal,
the better chance you have of achieving it.

108
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.890
Yeah.
Cause now you're not wasting your money.

109
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:35.790
You're actually saving for house so you can get that house paid off.

110
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.710
So now you don't have a mortgage anymore.
You know,
he's like,
yeah,

111
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.890
that's a bigger goal.
That's a broader goal.
Just like when you,

112
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.400
when you go to a war,
you need to know what it is you're going to war for.

113
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.340
What are you going to do and when are you going to stop and what's your intended

114
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.490
result?
Yeah.
So you get to,
in a way,

115
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.050
you got to fill your life with a bunch of goals.

116
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.430
You don't get gym.
Cause like if you have small goals that lead to the big goal,

117
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.870
right?
So for instance,
you want to be financially secure and stable,

118
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.540
what are you going to do?
You're going to save some of your money.
Okay.

119
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.090
That's one thing.
You're going to buy a house.
That's another thing.

120
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.090
You're going to pay off your car and you're not going to buy expensive dumb
cars.

121
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:15.110
You're going to buy cheap cars until you have the money to buy them with cash.

122
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.400
You know you're going to make all these little things.

123
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.650
You're going to work extra,
you're gonna,

124
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.060
you know you're going to do these things.
So you're right.
You have,

125
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.480
you have your broad goal.
Yes.
You have your longterm goal.
Yes.

126
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:26.180
And then you've got your short term goals that lead and are strategically

127
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:28.670
aligned with that longterm goal.
It's the same thing in war.

128
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:30.410
You have to have those,
both those things going on.
