00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.460
NARRATOR: Going into the 1920s
many people

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.290
believed banning alcohol would
make America more peaceful.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.290
They were wrong.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.380
Violent murders,
widespread corruption,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.380
and the dawn of organized crime
defined the decade and beyond.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.500
In the years leading
up to the 1920s,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.040
antialcohol activists,
such as Carrie Nation,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.540
had been hard at work building
a case against the demon drink,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.420
and they had some
legitimate arguments.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.920
Prohibitionist women
advocated for temperance

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.000
as a means of combating their
abusive alcoholic husbands.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.750
Industrialists got
behind the movement

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500
because they thought alcohol was
limiting the potential output

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.040
of their average worker.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580
But temperance was also
used by racist organizations

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.380
as an outlet for
their xenophobic views

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.420
against the millions
of European immigrants

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.000
coming to the United States.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.920
The Germans and
Irish in particular

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.170
were scorned for their
alleged drunkenness.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.670
Whatever their reasons,
46 states ultimately

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.080
ratified the 18th Amendment
with only Connecticut

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.580
and Rhode Island dissenting.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.170
Prohibition
officially took effect

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830
at the very start of the
decade, enforced by the language

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.210
of the Volstead Act,
named for House Judiciary

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000
chairman Andrew Volstead.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.420
Within a year, Americans'
alcohol consumption

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.380
had already dropped
to historic lows,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.960
but the drop was temporary.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.920
Americans didn't stop drinking.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.210
The 18th Amendment allowed
for some loopholes--

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.540
fermenting grapes at home,
prescriptions from doctors,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.620
and religious exemptions.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.120
A lot of people found God.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.920
But the eradication of a
corporate structure for alcohol

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880
production and distribution
left a huge opportunity

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.460
for a large-scale,
organized, and insanely

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.040
profitable black market.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.960
Existing small-time
street gangs took

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.750
advantage, quickly evolving
into vast bootlegging

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.420
criminal enterprises.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.290
They employed everyone from
warehouse workers to truck

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.380
drivers to accountants.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.330
Gang leaders would
bribe politicians, cops,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.580
even the Prohibition agents
themselves, nicknamed Prohis,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.000
to ensure their
businesses ran smoothly.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Some relied on rum running,
illegally importing liquor

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.500
from other countries and storing
it in warehouses across the US.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Sometimes they
would simply distill

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.420
liquor in private homes.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.250
Other gangsters bought
abandoned breweries

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.920
and operated them in secret.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.580
They worked in the shadows,
but one part of the business

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.170
was very public, the violence.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.420
Gangs fought for territory in
the streets of major US cities.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.330
Chicago was especially violent.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.960
729 people were killed
by gangs in Cook County

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.920
alone during Prohibition.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.580
The most famous
of these incidents

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.330
was the St. Valentine's
Day massacre in 1929.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.290
Men working for Al Capone,
dressed as policemen,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.290
gunned down seven rival members
of Bugs Moran's gang against

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.170
the wall of a parking garage.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.540
No one was ever
charged for the crime.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380
Realizing cooperation could
lead to greater profits,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.040
many gangs agreed
to treaties that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.540
allowed them to
operate peacefully

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.210
in their respective territories.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.210
Johnny Torrio attempted to
organize the gangs in Chicago

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.330
with Al Capone as
his right-hand man.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.710
When Torrio retired to
Italy and handed the reins

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.170
to his protege, Capone
inherited a business

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.040
pulling in more than $1 billion
a year in today's terms.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.040
Charles "Lucky"
Luciano organized

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.210
the Italian and Jewish
gangs in New York

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.620
under Joe "The Boss" Masseria
before Luciano had Masseria

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.750
killed in 1931 and had his
successor, Salvatore Maranzano,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.420
killed the same year.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.250
Luciano went on to found The
Commission, a national crime

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.040
syndicate composed of New
York's five mafia families

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.210
and the controlling families
in Chicago and Buffalo.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.170
Prohibition ended
with the ratification

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.750
of the 21st Amendment
in 1933, but the mafia

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.420
kept rolling along.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.880
These crime families had
already entered the worlds

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.750
of loan sharking, prostitution,
and illegal gambling,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750
just to name a
few, and continued

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.880
to grow throughout the country
on the backs of their profits

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.380
from Prohibition.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.750
INTERVIEWER: You must have
in your mind something

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.170
you've done that you can
speak of to your credit

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.250
as an American citizen.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.670
If so, what are they?

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.250
Paid my tax.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.540
[laughter]
