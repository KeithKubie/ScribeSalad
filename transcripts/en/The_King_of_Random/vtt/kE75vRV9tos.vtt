00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.890
If you're in need of a last minute gift idea,
check this out. Grab an empty bag of chips,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.540
and search around the house for something
you think could work as a gift. Clean the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.980
chip bag and turn it inside out, then carefully
place your gift inside and twist the bag at

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.660
the top. All you need to do now is grab a
ribbon, tie a bow, and your instant gift is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.470
ready to go. Now, if you don't have a ribbon
handy, it's no problem. Just cut the top inch

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.850
off chip bag and tie that on instead.
It should be just enough, to get you by in

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.230
your time of need.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.710
If you've got rolls of wrapping paper that
you want preserved, head to the kitchen and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.420
finish up some left overs, so you can salvage
the aluminum foil. Now cut the foil into a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.449
square, that's a couple inches longer than
a toilet paper tube. Next you'll need to make

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.600
a cut down the side of the toilet tube, so
you can wrap the foil around the outside,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.960
and fold the edges inward to hold it in place.
Push the foil in at the ends, and now you've

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.180
got a decorative clasp that will clamp around
your tube, and hold your wrapping paper in

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.800
place. Your decorative wrap is preserved,
for another year.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.820
With internet and email becoming so common,
you may not have any envelopes to send out

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.299
Christmas letters. Rather than going out and
buying some, just take your letter, and crease

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.170
it in the center, then fold opposite corners
into the center line. Fold the 2 edges next,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.140
then with a slight turn, the tips are folded
in to complete a rectangle. When you tuck

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.240
these two corners into the flaps underneath
them, your letter has just transformed, into

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.850
its own envelope. All you need to do now is
address it, add a stamp, and your letter is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.250
ready for posting.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.719
To make a fun and festive breakfast, start
by pouring your pancake mix into a cleaned

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.380
out condiment bottle. Now dip some large metal
cookie cutters, into a small tray of cooking

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.299
oil, and set it on a pre-greased and pre-heated
cooking pan. Now just pour in some pancake

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.280
batter and give it a minute to cook. When
the batter is firm, go ahead and remove the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.729
cookie cutter with a clean pair of pliers,
and your pancake will hold its shape. Now

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.340
just finish them up in the usual way, then
make a whole bunch more. Add some butter and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.500
a drizzle of maple syrup, and you've got a
festive and impressive, holiday breakfast.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.030
When you're wrapping packages, you know the
frustration that comes when you can't find

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.930
the edge of the tape. Then when you do find
it, it's surprisingly difficult to get it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.310
up. The solution, is a simple bread clip.
There's a good chance you have one of these

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.200
lying around, and all you need to do is just
tuck it under the edge of the tape. This custom

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
"Grab Tab" will save your spot without damaging
the tape at all, and makes a nice little handle

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.530
for pulling the tape up when you need it.
If you don't have a bread clip, try using

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110
a penny instead.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.080
Your Christmas tree may be fake, but you can
still enjoy the scent of a fresh cut tree.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.140
Just take the air filter from your furnace,
and pick up a bottle, of pine essential oil.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.000
And remember that a little goes a long way.
Now add 10-20 drops on the backside of the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.989
filter, then place it back into position.
Open up your air register, then sit back,

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.489
and enjoy the fresh piney aroma.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.989
When the cookies are baked and ready for frosting,
it can be a pretty messy job. And no matter

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.470
how hard you try, they still look like they
were frosted by a 4 year old. You can win

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.099
this challenge by pouring your frosting into
a few different condiment containers. Screw

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.189
the caps on tight, and now you've got a much
nicer cookie icer. This will give you so much

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.189
decorating precision, that your imagination
is the only limitation. There's no sugary

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.230
mess to clean up, and if you press the cap
back on, your frosting will stay good for

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.070
days.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.640
When the season's over and it's time to take
the Christmas lights down, you know that throwing

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.239
them in a bin just means you'll have a major
rats nest to deal with next year. Try using

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.650
a simple extension cord holder instead. You
can find these at hardware stores for about

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.159
a dollar and a half. When your lights are
wrapped, plug the two ends of the cord together,

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.329
and now your guaranteed, to be tangle free.
By the way, if you can't find one of these

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.090
cord wrappers, try making one out of a piece
of cardboard. It will work just as well, and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.870
nothing beats the price of free.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.079
When you're entertaining friends with a nice
warm chocolaty drink, go one step further

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.810
by grabbing a potato peeler and their favorite
chocolate bar. Carefully shave down the side

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.100
of the candy bar and you'll see it creates
a decorative chocolate garnishing. You can

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.579
use these tasty shavings to deliciously garnish
their drink, or decorate anything else you

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.520
can think of. Your friends will be super impressed,
and wondering why they never thought of this.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.440
Rather than letting all that wrapping paper
go to waste, try removing little decorations

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.750
like ribbons and bows, then use something
like glue or spray adhesive to attach the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.160
wrapping paper back to the box your present
came in. Now cut a rectangle about the size

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.320
of a postcard, and reattach the bows and ribbons.
Just like that, you've got an impressive "thank

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.880
you" card to return your appreciation. Your
family and friends will be blown away, and

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.200
hey, it's better for the environment anyway.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.340
Well there are a few ideas that will hopefully
make your Christmas a little merrier. If you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.280
liked these projects, perhaps you'll like
