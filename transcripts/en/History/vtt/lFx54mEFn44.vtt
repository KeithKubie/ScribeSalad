00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:07.215
NARRATOR: Central Coast,
New South Wales, Australia.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:10.301
Deep in the Brisbane
Water National Park

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:15.014
is a mysterious site known
as the Gosford glyphs.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:20.270
The site consists of two massive
eight foot high walls engraved

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.356
with over 300 ancient carvings.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:28.194
Carvings that experts say do
not resemble indigenous artwork,

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.988
but Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:41.416
After deciphering the texts,
21st century Egyptologist

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.837
Raymond Johnson believed them to
reveal the burial site of Lord

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.674
Nefer-Ti-Ru, a member of
the Egyptian royal family

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.469
who died while visiting
the area with his brother

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:04.481
sometime between
2637 to 2614 BC.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.149
Absolutely beautiful out here.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.650
I know.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.196
NARRATOR: While visiting
the area in 2016,

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:15.241
Giorgio Tsoukalos met with
local ancient astronaut theorist

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.036
Evan Strong to get
a firsthand look

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.330
at these enigmatic carvings.
- Wow!

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.375
That's incredible.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:29.005
I had no idea.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.507
I mean, this looks totally
different than on pictures.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.095
So what do these
hieroglyphs say?

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.516
At least one panel
talks about two brothers,

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.810
two princes coming
here from Egypt.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.269
They were shipwrecked.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.230
One of them ended up
getting bitten by a snake.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.564
He then died.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.399
The theory is then
he was interred here,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.443
and that's why you've
got hieroglyphs her,

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.363
because he died here.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.699
But there's these other walls
with a mixture of symbols.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:01.913
This one over here is more of
a philosophical astrophysics

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:06.668
style thing with symbols meaning
all sorts of esoteric stuff.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.795
Now, have these
symbols at all been

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.589
interpreted by Egyptologists?

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.467
There have been
a few, actually.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.469
A few different
people have done that.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.012
What was their reaction?

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.556
Well, Raymond Johnson
was one of the first people

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.642
to come here and translate.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.061
He actually sent some
of these translations

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.064
off to the Cairo
Library, and Dr.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:32.944
Abou Dia Ghazi ended up saying,
yup, you're on the right track.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.571
Something called proto-Egyptian.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.990
And how old do you
reckon these are?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.200
EVAN STRONG: We're thinking,
because of their prevalence,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.954
at least in one panel
of proto-Egyptian,

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.164
that it's about 4,600 years old.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.666
Wow.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.001
Are there any hieroglyphs
that stand out to you?

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.544
Yeah.
Definitely.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.504
Follow me down here and I'll
show you this other one.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.969
So this one here we
call the UFO glyph.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.596
People have called
it that since they've

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.223
been coming here because it
kind of looks like a UFO.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.642
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: It definitely
has the classic UFO shape.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:10.148
It's got the-- the rays, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.692
What would you suggest if anyone
says, well, this is not a UFO.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.112
It's-- it's some other symbol
that-- but certainly not that.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.031
EVAN STRONG: I think someone
suggested it's jewelry,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.867
but it's a completely different
symbol that's upside down,

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.702
and it really
doesn't quite fit in.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.412
It's one of those
symbols here that

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.040
doesn't fit into the canon.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.207
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
In your opinion,

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.918
why do you think
the Egyptians made

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.586
it all the way to Australia?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:35.089
I think they looking for
esoteric wisdom definitely.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.507
- From the Aboriginals?
- Yes.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.349
KEVIN GAVI DUNCAN: The
ancient Egyptians, we

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.186
have stories, Aboriginal
stories about their arrival

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.688
and about their visits,
long before Europeans

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.858
had arrived here.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.362
Naturally, we would have shared
ceremony with these people

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:02.492
because they have the same
similar beliefs as our people.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.745
Egyptians have that same
spiritual connection

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.663
to the sky world.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.126
Many stories from all
over this continent,

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:16.130
not just from here, but
all over this continent,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.050
talk about those
who came by the sea

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.928
and came to these continents,
and some of our knowledge,

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.597
and wisdom, and technology
went back with them.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.392
And if you do some of the
research in the last pyramids

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:30.144
that they found,
they found boomerangs

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:34.190
made from ironbark from here.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.442
And they have hieroglyphs
of blackfellas

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:41.322
around the boomerangs to take
out the ducks and the geese.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.408
Now, the question
would be, why would

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.868
they paint us and
carve us on their walls

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.912
if they didn't come here?

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.164
And if that meeting
and relationship

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:53.668
was not significant, they
wouldn't have carved it.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:54.669
It must have been significant
in order to carve.
