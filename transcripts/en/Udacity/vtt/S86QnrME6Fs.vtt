Hi, my name is Lorenzo, and
I'll be your instructor as we

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.780
explore the foundations of
full stack web development.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.010
In this course you will learn to build
your own data-driven web application,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.630
but what does that actually mean?

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.260
Well, when I say web application
I'm referring to a web page or

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.890
collection of pages that allows your
browser to respond to user input,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.608
similar to an offline
software application.

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:23.160
And by data-driven,
I mean an application that can store and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.890
retrieve information from a database to
deliver customized content to the user.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.140
Almost all of the popular websites
you interact with on a daily basis

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080
are data-driven web applications.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.660
Soon you will create a similar
website of your own.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.700
In addition to creating web pages, you
will also learn to send data from your

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150
server in other forms,
like JSON requests.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.010
So that the data from your application
can be shared with other machines that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.660
process JSON, like a data aggregator or
a mobile device.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.463
Your mission in this course is
to help me create a menu app.

00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:53.805
You'll be building an interactive
web application that presents a user

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:57.920
a variety of menu items they can view,
create, modify, and delete.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.770
In the first lesson of this course
you will extract data from a database

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.295
using Python.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.209
We'll also be using a tool called
an object-relational mapping, or

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.720
ORM to manipulate queries
as objects in Python.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.860
If you've never heard of an ORM,
don't worry.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.730
You'll be very familiar with
it in just a few minutes.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
In the second lesson you will build
your first data-driven web application

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330
using only the libraries that
come installed with Python.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.790
In the third lesson we will
talk about frameworks and

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.220
create an application using
the lightweight web framework, Flask.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.020
You will understand how frameworks help
developers write code more efficiently.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.945
Once you complete this course you
will easily be able to compare and

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.140
contrast frameworks, and choose one
of your own for future projects.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.918
Finally, you'll use what you
learned from lessons one, two, and

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:42.420
three to iteratively write code until
you have a polished menu application,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.300
complete with API endpoints for
JSON requests.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.910
Let's get started.
