00:00:00.832 --> 00:00:02.856
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
you have some vials here,

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:04.115
and you know that in the solution

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:07.371
you have fragments of
DNA in each of these,

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:08.843
and what you're curious about, well,

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:10.887
what about the DNA fragments in our,

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:12.735
in this first vial?

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:13.799
In vial number one.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.395
How long are those fragments?

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.515
How many base pairs?

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.223
How long are they?

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:20.239
Well, you might say, well why don't I just

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:21.639
take them out and count them?

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:24.384
Except for the fact that
they're incredibly small

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.596
and incredibly hard to handle.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:29.199
Even a fairly large fragment of DNA,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.655
let's say we're talking about something

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.905
that's on the order of 5000 base pairs,

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.095
well that's going to be approximately

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:40.007
one to two micrometers long

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.911
if you were to completely stretch it out.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.404
And we can't even start
to think about how thin

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.756
the actual diameter is, if we just,

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:49.893
but length-wise, the long
way, it's only going to be

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:52.635
one to two micrometers
which is super duper small.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.631
This is one to two
thousandths of a millimeter.

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:57.367
So that's not going to help us to somehow

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:00.783
try to manipulate it
physically with our hands

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.863
or with, you know, kind of rough tools.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.095
So how do we do that?

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.467
And we could have other vials there.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.016
How do we see how long the DNA strands

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.367
that are sitting in
those vials actually are?

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:12.599
And the technique we're going to use,

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.512
gel electrophoresis, it
actually could be used for

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.277
DNA strands, it could be used for RNA,

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.395
if could also be used for proteins,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:19.991
any of these macromolecules,

00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.771
to see how long are those fragments?

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.955
And so let me write this down.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.622
Gel electrophoresis.

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:36.959
And it's called gel electrophoresis

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.696
because it involves a gel,

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:41.029
it involves electric charge,

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.967
and phoresis is just
referring to the fact that

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:47.571
we are going to cause the DNA fragments

00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.435
to migrate through a gel
because of the charge.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:53.759
So phoresis is referring to the migration,

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.035
or the movement of the actual DNA.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:58.772
So how do we do this?

00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:01.264
Well here is our set up, right over here.

00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:04.264
We have our gel, that's inside of a,

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:08.770
that's embedded in a buffer solution.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.959
So this gel, the most typical one is

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.675
agarose gel, that's a polysaccharide

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:16.607
that we get from seaweed,

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:18.623
and it's literally a gel.

00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:20.500
It's a gelatinous material.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.019
And what we're going to do is,

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.492
is we're going to put,
we're gonna take samples,

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:28.648
so we might take a little sample from

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.823
this one right over here,

00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:32.287
and we'll put it in this well,

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:33.269
right over here.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.095
And you can view these wells
as little divets in the gel.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.973
You could take a little sample from here

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.140
and put it into this well.

00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.955
And then you could put a sample from here,

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:46.063
and you could put it in that well.

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:48.779
And it's going to be bathed
inside of this buffer,

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.852
so you can see the buffer
I drew, this fluid,

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:53.429
and that's really just
water with some salt in it.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.109
And the buffer is going to keep the pH

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.599
from going too far out of bounds

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.527
as we place a charge
across this entire thing,

00:03:00.527 --> 00:03:02.599
because if the pH gets too far in the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.651
basic or acidic side, it
might actually affect the DNA,

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.256
or affect the charge on the DNA.

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:09.600
Now what we're going to do is,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.099
we're gonna put a charge
across this whole setup.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.675
Where the side where the wells are,

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.327
where we're gonna place the DNA,

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:19.119
that's going to be where we're

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.869
gonna put the negative electrode,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.340
so that's our negative electrode there.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.507
And the other end is going
to be our positive electrode.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.572
And we're going to use the fact

00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:38.192
that DNA has a negative
charge at the typical pHs,

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:41.048
or the pHs that we are
going to be dealing with.

00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:44.380
Now we can go back into previous videos,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.060
and we can see it right over here,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.432
you see these negative charges

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:49.599
on our phosphate backbone.

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.312
And so what is going to happen?

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:56.056
What is going to happen once we connect

00:03:56.056 --> 00:03:57.932
both of these to a power source,

00:03:57.932 --> 00:04:00.984
and then this side is negative
and this side is positive?

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.924
Well the DNA is going to want to migrate.

00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:06.500
Now, let's think about what will happen.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.000
Will shorter things migrate further,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.044
or will longer things migrate further?

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:14.228
Well you might say, well
longer things are going to

00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:15.684
have more negative charge,

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:17.588
so maybe they go farther away,

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:18.904
but then you also have to remember

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:21.004
that they're also moving more mass.

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:22.712
So their charge per mass
is gonna be the same

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:24.700
regardless of length.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.136
And so what determines
how far something gets,

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:30.132
how much it migrates over
a certain amount of time,

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:31.924
is how small it is.

00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:34.136
Remember, we have this agarose gel,

00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:36.824
and people are still
studying the exact mechanism

00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:39.120
of how this DNA, or these macromolecules,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.612
actually migrate through
the polysaccharide,

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:43.740
but if you imagine this polysaccharide

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.456
is kind of this mesh,
this net, this sieve,

00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:48.276
well smaller things are gonna be able

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:51.048
to go through the gaps easier
than the larger things.

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:53.008
And so if you let some time pass,

00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.220
if you let some time pass,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.628
some of the DNA, let's say this DNA,

00:04:57.628 --> 00:04:59.128
gets around there.

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:02.696
Let's say, and I'm just color,

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.236
you actually wouldn't see these colors,

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.176
let's say this DNA gets around that far,

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:08.296
so it doesn't get as far.

00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:09.864
Let's say that this DNA doesn't migrate,

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:11.852
let's say it has some
that migrates that far

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:15.592
and let's say it has some
that migrates that far.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.804
And so if you just saw this,
you wait some amount of time,

00:05:17.804 --> 00:05:21.052
and you were come back and you
were to see this migration,

00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:24.135
you were to see this migration occur,

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.100
and the longer you wait,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.424
the further these things are gonna get.

00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:30.320
In fact, if you wait too long

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.896
they're gonna fall off all
the way over the other edge.

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:35.164
Is, if you just saw this you'd say

00:05:35.164 --> 00:05:38.468
okay, well this strand right over here

00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:41.468
these must be smaller DNA molecules.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.124
They must be shorter.

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:45.776
These must be a little bit longer,

00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:47.456
and these must be even longer than that.

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:49.024
And this grouping right over here

00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:50.620
is going to be the longest of all.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.440
So this was a mixture
of some longer strands

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.100
and still longer ones,
but not quite as long.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.096
And, for example, maybe there
are some really short strands,

00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:00.616
maybe there were some really short strands

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:04.533
in that, what I'm drawing
as, that orange group

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.980
right over here.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.080
So, what I just did right over here

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.140
this could tell you the
relative length of these strands

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.044
but how would you actually measure them?

00:06:16.044 --> 00:06:19.152
Well that's where you can go
find standardized solutions,

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:21.402
which we call a DNA ladder.

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:24.192
And so let's say you
go get the DNA ladder,

00:06:24.192 --> 00:06:25.564
I'm gonna draw it in pink,

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:27.104
so you literally could buy this.

00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:29.036
You can buy it online.

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.492
And the standard solution let's say

00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:31.892
it separates like this.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.936
So it separates, that goes there,

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.148
let's say some of it goes like, there,

00:06:36.148 --> 00:06:39.228
and some of it goes like, there.

00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:41.328
Well you would be able to
know from the labeling,

00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:42.840
or whichever one you choose to buy,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.920
that this grouping here,
this all of the DNA

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.753
that is 5000 base pairs let's say.

00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:54.824
Let's say this right over
here is 1500 base pairs.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:56.952
And let's say this over here is,

00:06:56.952 --> 00:07:01.516
let's say this over here
is 500 base pairs long.

00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:03.672
And so now you can use this DNA ladder,

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:04.988
these standardized ones,

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:08.460
to gauge how long, how
many base pairs these are.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.420
So you say okay, this blue one here,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.400
this is a bunch of DNA

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.480
that's a little bit
longer than 500 base pairs

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.748
but it's shorter than 1500 base pairs.

00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:18.176
You can see this green one here,

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:21.116
well it's a little bit
longer than 1500 base pairs,

00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:22.908
it didn't migrate quite as fair as this

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:25.820
big bundle of 1500 base pairs guy did.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.592
And so then you can get
a better approximation.

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:30.244
And you can choose your ladder based on

00:07:30.244 --> 00:07:32.512
what you think you are
going to find there,

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:36.320
what you're actually going to look for.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.336
Now the other thing to appreciate is,

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:42.228
when you see, when you see
the DNA having migrated

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.404
this far, you might say okay,

00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:45.672
is this one DNA strand,

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:48.808
is that one DNA strand
that I'm looking at?

00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:51.244
And just going back to
the measurements, no.

00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:53.484
That is many, many, many, many DNAs

00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:54.576
that you're looking at.

00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:56.704
And this is, they're not
all stretched out like that.

00:07:56.704 --> 00:08:00.296
Remember, even something
that is 5000 base pairs long

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:04.244
is only going to be one to two micrometers

00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:05.224
if you stretch it out.

00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:06.624
So, you wouldn't even be able to see it,

00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:07.996
it's a thousandth of a millimeter.

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:09.228
You wouldn't you even be able to see it.

00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:11.189
So this is many, many, many molecules

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.932
of DNA, is migrating that far.

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:14.968
And they wouldn't even
have to be that small

00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:18.356
to be able to migrate through
that polysaccharide gel.

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.093
Now the last thing you're
probably saying is okay,

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:22.332
wait, but how am I even
seeing it over here?

00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:24.600
How do I actually see this DNA?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.868
Especially if they're these
super, super small molecules?

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:29.248
And the answer is you
put some time of marker

00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:32.020
on the DNA, that will make them visible.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.504
Some type of dye, or something that

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:34.960
might become phlorescent.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.500
And one of the typical things

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.945
that people often use it ethidium bromide.

00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:43.808
And ethidium bromide is
called an intercalating agent,

00:08:43.808 --> 00:08:45.880
and it's a molecule,
you can see the ethidium

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.047
right over here, these are
two DNA, two backbones of DNA,

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:53.608
you can see the base pairs bonding here,

00:08:53.608 --> 00:08:55.540
and then this right over here

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.623
that is ethidium that has fit itself,

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:01.813
that's why we call it intercalating,

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:04.752
it has fit itself in between
the rungs of the ladder.

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:07.189
And when it does so, inside of DNA,

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:09.706
it actually becomes
phlorescent when you apply

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:10.956
UV light to it.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.369
So if you put this ethidium bromide

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:17.452
into all of your DNA right over here,

00:09:18.317 --> 00:09:20.137
and then as it migrates,
and then if you were to

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:22.461
turn on a UV light, it
would become phlorescent,

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:25.570
and you would actually see these things.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.997
And so if you wanted to see what it

00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:28.341
actually would look like in real life,

00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:29.434
well this is what it would look like

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.122
when you were to, if you were
to look at it straight on.

00:09:32.122 --> 00:09:33.549
Where this would have been a well,

00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:36.713
let me make it a little
bit easier to read.

00:09:36.713 --> 00:09:38.925
So right over here would
have been the well,

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:40.885
where you would put the DNA ladder,

00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:43.097
and it would come up with
standardized measurements.

00:09:43.097 --> 00:09:45.847
Maybe that's our 5000 base pairs,

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:50.797
this right over here
is our 1500 base pairs,

00:09:50.797 --> 00:09:54.857
and this right over here
is our 500 base pairs.

00:09:54.857 --> 00:09:56.453
And then let's say you had some solution

00:09:56.453 --> 00:09:58.973
of some other DNA, and
you wait a little while,

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.241
and you see look, it
migrated not quite as far

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:03.706
as a 500 base pair, so
it must be little bit,

00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:05.581
this must be a bundle
of things a little bit

00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.485
longer than 500 base pairs,

00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:11.125
but for sure a lot shorter
than 1500 base pairs.

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:12.161
Now once again, doesn't have to have

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:13.729
just one fragment length,
you could have had

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:17.957
another group that was, maybe
right at 1500 base pairs.

00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:19.189
And you've probably seen this,

00:10:19.189 --> 00:10:21.401
whenever you see people
talking about genetic analysis,

00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:23.613
and things like this,
you're often seeing people

00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:25.952
look at one of these read-outs from

00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:27.875
gel electrophoresis.

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:30.395
So now you know what's
actually going on here.

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:32.411
This isn't a strand of DNA, this is a big,

00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:34.736
this is a bunch of DNA
that has been tagged

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:35.912
with some type of a dye,

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:40.671
or the ethidium bromide,
or something like that.

00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:42.323
And it's a bunch of those molecules

00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:44.787
and they've migrated based on the charge.

00:10:44.787 --> 00:10:46.411
They're trying to get away
from that negative charge

00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:47.923
to the positive charge.

00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:49.491
And the smaller molecules,
this is a bunch of

00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:53.159
small molecules, right over
here, are able to get further

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:55.371
because they're able
to get through the mesh

00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:57.038
of the agarose gel.
