00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.850
The United States had big plans for the Moon,
and the Apollo Program was just the start.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.150
As the public dreamt of a new home in the
stars, NASA developed plans to make cosmic

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.960
colonization a reality.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.769
The Apollo missions were laying the foundation
for life on the lunar landscape.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.619
But, just three years after the first landing,
the United States ventured to the Moon for

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.160
the final time.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.760
In the 1960’s, NASA was developing ambitious
offshoots for the Apollo Program - primarily

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.219
establishment of a Moon base intended to extend
humanity’s time on the Moon.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.329
The Lunar Shelter-Laboratory or SHELAB was
one of the concepts under consideration.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.600
SHELAB consisted of a cabin with an airlock
chamber and a lunar excursion truck equipped

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.489
with a flying belt for the astronauts.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.289
Powered by fuel cells and batteries, the shelter
would support two astronauts for 14 days.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.190
It was believed that the lunar bases could
be the start of a large permanent colony on

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.510
the Moon.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.540
At the time, expanding on Apollo wasn’t
so far fetched.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.330
The country’s Cold War competition and desire
to be first rapidly expanded the potential

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.790
of space exploration.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.180
Two years after NASA began operations, the
U.S. government allocated 500 million dollars

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820
of the federal budget to the agency.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.100
In just five years, the budget grew to 5.2
billion dollars which represented 5.3 percent

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.350
of all government spending.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.850
NASA expanded facilities across the country:
the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.970
Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral
in Florida and the Mississippi Test Facility.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.280
With the massive expansion came hundreds of
thousands of jobs.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.030
NASA’s labor force peaked in the mid 60’s
with a reported 400,000 staffers and contractors.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.350
The majority of NASA’s resources went to
the Apollo Program.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.640
Between 1959 and 1973, the agency spent just
over 23 billion dollars on human spaceflight

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.390
of which nearly 20 billion dollars was for
Apollo.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.920
That amount of money today would equate to
over 130 billion dollars spent on one program

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
alone.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.390
But by the 1970’s, public attention was
no longer above the clouds.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.420
With the lunar landing achieved, attention
shifted to the seemingly endless Vietnam War.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.820
And that’s where government funds went as
well, putting a huge strain on the U.S. economy.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.090
NASA’s glory years were starting to lose
their grandiose glow.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.750
Budget cuts forced the agency to rethink the
feasibility of its exploration plans.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.170
And since the Apollo Program was expensive
and risky, the agency’s priorities started

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.080
to move towards other projects.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.640
Ultimately, NASA decided to cut the Apollo
Program and its deep space dreams, short.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.620
In 1970, the flights planned for Apollo 15,
19 and 20 were cancelled, and the remaining

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.600
missions were renumbered.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.209
The cancelled missions freed up resources
for NASA’s Skylab and Space Shuttle - programs

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.240
that were slated to launch over the next two
decades.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.990
Some of the astronauts who spent years training
for Apollo, were reassigned to these programs

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.640
while others retired without ever making it
to space.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.950
The Apollo 17 astronauts would be the last
men to land on the Moon.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.670
Veteran Gene Cernan would embark on his second
lunar trek.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.840
During Apollo 10, he hovered above the surface
but this time he’d touch down.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.620
The other final moonwalker was Jack Schmitt.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.780
He was the first scientist to be selected
for an Apollo crew.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.250
And rookie Ronald Evans would man the Command
Module while his crewmates journeyed to the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.770
Moon.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.440
Apollo 17 launched on December 7th, 1972.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.510
NASA selected the Taurus-Littrow region as
the mission’s landing location.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.730
The nearby Shorty Crater was believed to hold
evidence of past volcanic vents and geologist

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.830
turned astronaut Jack Schmitt would help provide
vital insight of the area.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.270
En route to the Moon, the astronauts got a
view of home that had never been seen before.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.550
One of the astronauts grabbed a camera and
snapped a picture.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.410
It’s known as the Blue Marble Shot and it
is the first photograph to capture the entire

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.410
Earth.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.699
The picture became the center of a decades
long debate between the Apollo 17 crew members,

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.879
each claiming they were the photographer.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.680
After the snapshot, the crew made it to lunar
orbit and eventually landed on the Moon without

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.930
major issue.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.309
The astronauts deployed scientific instruments
and collected lunar samples.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:44.099
At the end of their first trip in the Lunar
Rover, they hit a problem.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.290
But just like Apollo 13, this snag would be
solved with duct tape.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.639
With the LVR running again, the team ventured
to the rim of the Shorty Crater where they

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.569
observed orange soil, which was later found
to be tiny spheres of colored glass likely

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.750
from a volcanic vent.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.500
After about three days and a record 22 hours
spent outside the lunar module, the astronauts

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.819
prepared to head back to Earth for the last
time.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:19.919
And with that, NASA’s missions to the Moon
came to a close.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.339
The ambitious goals of the early Apollo Program
had fallen like dominos synchronized with

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.159
NASA’s depleting budget.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.820
The space agency moved on to other projects
that would remain in Low Earth Orbit.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.120
Apollo 17 marked the world’s last manned
trip to another celestial body.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.719
But while the Apollo Program came to an end,
it’s contributions to science did not.

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:49.240
And now, decades later, NASA is tracing a
new path to the Moon.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.979
The Apollo Program revolutionized all aspects
of spaceflight.
