00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 We asked 4 business people in India to talk about their motivation to develop applications and here is their story 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.840
 India is a country of 1.3 billion people 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480
 With many segments of the population 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.560
 Where income levels vary 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.640
 Culture and spoken languages 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.600
 Technology can create a common layer 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.760
 And effectively improve people's quality of life 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.640
 I think the smartphone is the best tool of our time 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 And we can do many things 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320
 As well as global problems 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.200
 Mobile phone and Internet connection 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.720
 They make everyone in one level 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
 HealthifyM is the most famous health and fitness application in India 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
 Using the application once daily achieves confirmed but slow results 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.300
 To promote health care and lifestyle change in the country 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.040
 There were no calorie measurement tools in India 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.880
 Our people are the most affected by diabetes and heart disease globally 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.560
 I felt it was a problem facing millions of Indians 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.480
 A person must have a food database 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.160
 UrbanClap is an application that helps you buy 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 High quality and reliable home services 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.800
 Such as a beauty specialist and an interior designer 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 And other services 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.350
 I have checked the craft system in India 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010
 The vast majority of owners of these occupations and trades 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.560
 Despite their skill 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.100
 Earn a monthly income ranging from 10 to 50 thousand ruby 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490
 There are multiple reasons not to make them 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.110
 Able to professionally manage small business 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.500
 To achieve a possible income of up to 60 thousand ruby ​​per month 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.280
 And to promote engagement in the middle class in India 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200
 RailYatri is an application that helps travelers in India 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 Who rely on railways 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.080
 To enable them to make smart decisions 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.120
 We used to follow the circumstance 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.760
 From a place in the country to another place in the world 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.920
 Why can not we track a train going a half mile? 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 We know very well that people are using it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.240
 Language to handle content 

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.400
 If you see the readers of the newspapers 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.277
 And news readers about Bollywood movies 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.910
 They watch content in local languages 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.880
 So we got the idea on its own 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.344
 Without any market research 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.720
 This was a key idea for us 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.759
 And a major reason people use our application 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.077
 DailyHunt is one of the most popular apps in the country 

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:03.520
 And 95% of the application's users speak non-English local languages 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.992
 Currently 3 million user applications are used everywhere 

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.632
 About 200 trainers and nutritionists are deployed 

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:09.592
 Around the world 

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:11.712
 Application is one of the top rated applications in India 

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:16.158
 According to the monthly average, the number of users is about to reach 9 million users. 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.076
 Over a period of time, we added 

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.396
 All tracks, hospitals, information and others 

00:02:20.918 --> 00:02:23.358
 We have about 70 thousand service partners 

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:25.278
 They use our app daily 

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.407
 We continue to serve more than 10,000 customers a day 

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.375
 We aim to provide 1 million jobs in the service sector in India 

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:38.105
 I advise those who think to invent something to overcome their fear 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.380
 As far as I know, there is no risk of becoming an entrepreneur 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.711
 If you came up with a great idea, stick to it 

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:46.312
 You have to get out of your office 

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.072
 And explore India's real problems 

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:50.518
 To actually create an app 

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:51.998
 Achieves success in India.
