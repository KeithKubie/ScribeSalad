00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:04.239
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.720
- Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Robin Young
from NPR and WBUR.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Hello.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.280
Welcome to what I promise you is
going to be a fabulous evening.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.780
I am so thrown back.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.120
And even thinking
about Title IX,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.580
I am just awash in
memories of starting

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.510
to run in 1965 when I was 15--

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.540
don't do the math, I'm 66--

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.680
15 years old, 1965.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.260
I don't know where this
harebrained notion came from.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.360
There were not even any
girls running shoes.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.370
I had were boys' Tigers.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.290
And you had to run at
night because people

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.160
would think you--

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.930
what were you running from,
you that you were crazy.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.870
This was not that
long after people

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.660
thought that women's
lady parts would fall out

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.425
if we got too active.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:53.300
So that's in the 60s.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.580
You fast forward 10 years.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.690
And I live right
around the corner.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750
And I get up and go
running every day.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.617
And there's my new
friend, Susan Ware,

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:04.700
who's running on the same
street that I'm running.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.770
We're going out to
the river in the '70s.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.410
And Susan, of course,
is the Radcliffe scholar

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.290
who wrote the definitive
book on Title IX

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.870
and also curated the
exhibit at the Schlesinger.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.200
And, Susan, how many Bonne
Bells in a row did you run?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.700
You have a record.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.570
25 Bonne Bells in
a row did she run.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.310
So I encourage you--

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.380
there's so much here
for you, including

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.960
the Schlesinger Library
just two buildings down,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.100
which is the leading library
on the history of women

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.480
in America.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.590
And please visit Susan's exhibit
on Title IX that's over there.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.760
It's titled Playing Fair--

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.470
Title IX at 45.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.450
It's over from now
until September 15.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.090
It's completely open
to the public and free.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.460
And know that when you
are looking at that,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.250
it's the work of
a 25-year-old who

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.760
was running up and down the
Charles so many years ago.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.930
And then two years ago, Susan
came, always steeping herself,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.810
trying to get as close as
possible to these women

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.940
in history that
she writes about.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.889
She came over here on a summer
day and ran around that track

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.120
up there.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.380
There is a track--

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.970
a women's running
track-- up there.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.030
This building that we are in now
is the former Radcliffe College

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.530
gym.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220
It was built in 1898.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.070
And Susan, you were saying
that being up there,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.350
you had this spiritual
feeling of being

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.430
connected to women that were
running up there 100 years ago.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.290
I was thinking--
when I come in here,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.170
I always think of my dear
friends Alice Furlaud--

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.110
who was an NPR commentator
who passed away this year--

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.530
and her roommate,
Linda Cabot Black.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.350
You may have seen Linda
around Cambridge--

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.790
she's a Cabot.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.850
And every morning, she gets
up, puts on her sensible shoes,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.937
takes her very
sensible stray dog,

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:54.020
and walks five miles up
and down the Charles River

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.860
picking up garbage.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.370
But Linda and Alice were
roommates here in 1948.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.480
And I love to think of these
incredible women climbing ropes

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.060
here in what was then the
gym or playing basketball.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.390
We understand it must
have been half-court.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.550
But we're just
sitting in this place

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.850
that has such a
history for us to take

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.080
on the topic of the night.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.240
This of course is now
the Knafel Center.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.030
It's the main meeting place
at what's now the Radcliffe

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.710
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.510
For those of you
unfamiliar, it's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.760
the successor to
Radcliffe College.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.880
It's Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.810
Notice I said advanced
study, not just study--

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.960
advanced study here.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.500
They share transformative ideas
from across all disciplines.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.320
They have leading
experts from all fields

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.870
who share their knowledge,
invite the public in

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.740
to participate.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.990
And by the way, at
WBUR we pride ourselves

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.090
on having the same mission--

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.160
sharing thoughts,
transformative thoughts,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.860
across all disciplines and
inviting you the public in.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.640
So we are thrilled to be
a partner of this evening.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.840
And tonight's experts--
man, we were taken.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.929
I said this is a tweet
waiting to happen.

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:10.970
We were back there, I
said, let's take a picture.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.340
And the thing almost exploded.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.020
There's so much power.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.149
They are all
beneficiaries of Title IX,

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.250
which of course was the landmark
legislation enacted in 1972--

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.770
too late for me as a teenager.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.170
But it mandated gender
equality for all institutions

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.640
receiving federal aid.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.490
And that of course
changed opportunities

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.230
for all young women.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.360
You didn't have to just
go stand on the balance

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.910
beam for hours at a time.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.760
You could possibly be on teams.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.310
And our panelists have
played basketball in college

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.050
and in professional
leagues, they've

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.780
won national championships
and Olympic medals.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.810
From there, one has gone on to
a career in politics, another

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.150
into medicine, another
into business--

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.820
and I should of course note
another into journalism.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.630
And the legacy of Title
IX is in the lives

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.810
that they are living today.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.185
So before we even start, can
we have a round of applause,

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:05.230
please for the women
were about to meet.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.420
Tonight we're going to celebrate
the upcoming 45th anniversary

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.000
of Title IX.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.374
We're going to
explore its legacy

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:16.680
from all different
viewpoints, hear

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.570
from our outstanding
panelists and moderator,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.180
and then you the audience.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.000
Now to the moderator.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.950
My dear friend Rick Carlisle--

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.180
and as often as I can, I
put that sentence together.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.210
He's of course the
former Celtic and now

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.800
the coach of the
Dallas Mavericks.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.274
So my dear friend Rick
Carlisle once said to me,

00:05:35.274 --> 00:05:37.065
you know, there's this
Shira Springer girl.

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:41.870
You ought to keep an eye on her
because she is the real deal.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.820
I did, she is.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.270
Rick is known for being a quiet
mentor to many young women.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.030
Shira blew him away.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.080
She covered stories
at the intersection

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.950
of sports and society for 20
years at the Boston Globe,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.610
reporting on all four major
Boston professional teams

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.310
plus the NBA finals, the
World Series, the Olympics,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.840
the Boston Marathon.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.240
She served as the Globe's
Celtics beat writer

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.480
for seven years then worked
as an investigative enterprise

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.106
reporter, Olympic columnist,
women's sports columnist.

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.730
Her coverage of the
Celtics and the NBA

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.340
as well as a larger sports
world earned her awards

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.220
from the Associated Press
and from the Women's Sports

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.170
Foundation for feature writing.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.920
We are so lucky to
have her now at WBUR.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.900
She grew up in Connecticut
competing in sports,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.570
cheering on the New York
Mets, Hartford whalers.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.640
Graduated from Hartford with
honors in social studies.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.820
Ran cross-country
track in college.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.430
Little bit of overachievement
going on here.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.870
Now she runs marathons.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.520
Can't wait to hear what
race might be next for her.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.300
Rick Carlisle knew from what
he was talking about when

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.670
he spotted Shira Springer.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.890
Please welcome Shira
and as she brings up

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.940
her panel for tonight.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:03.240
- Thank you, Robin.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.120
That was really too kind.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.610
And I want to thank
Radcliffe and WBUR

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.190
for co-hosting this event.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.710
Before I turn to tonight's
conversation and our panelists,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.990
I want to go back to 1999.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.380
It's two years after the
WNBA played its first game.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.530
It's one year after women's
hockey made its winter

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.960
Olympic debut and
the US won the gold.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.150
And I want to take you back
specifically to July 10, 1999.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.480
You may remember that was
the day of the Women's World

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.270
Cup final in the Rose Bowl.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.830
I was there.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.020
I was lucky enough to have that
be one of my first assignments.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.710
And what I remember
is a packed stadium--

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.720
90,000 people showed up
to see women's soccer.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.200
You also may remember the game
ended in a penalty shootout,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.850
5-4 US victory.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.720
Brandi Chastain celebrates
by removing her shirt.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.200
And you have that iconic image.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.720
And I also remember
what happened afterwards

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.330
when I got to talk to the
players, and the coaches,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.390
and some of the
administrators from US soccer.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.780
And what I remember is that they
all saw this as a turning point

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.700
in women's sports,
that the game was

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.140
an affirmation of the gender
equity gains made since Title

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.185
IX's passage in 1972.

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.810
And there was a lot of talk not
only about the legislative part

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.890
of Title IX but about the
symbolic force of Title IX,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.620
as something that made
women think about equality

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.169
of opportunity in
sports and outside

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.059
of sports and to think
about new possibilities.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.640
And I think, as
we all know here,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.890
there's still plenty
to talk about.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.130
Because the turning
point in women's sports

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.470
never quite arrived
the way many envisioned

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.560
it would after July 1999.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.110
Women's pro soccer leagues
have been established

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.570
and folded multiple times.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.750
Women still lag behind
men in scholarship dollars

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.460
and participation.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.400
Girls drop out of
high school level

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.560
sports at an alarming rate.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.840
It's astonishing--
by age 14, they're

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.786
dropping out two
times as much as boys.

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.160
And there's still
inequality when

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.560
it comes to women in
the coaching ranks,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.670
in the executive ranks, and
the general manager ranks,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.170
and senior management in
various pro sports leagues.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.366
So a lot of work to be done.

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:28.290
So tonight with our panel I
want to talk about Title IX

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.520
not just as the
legislative part of it

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.890
but as the symbolic part--

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.490
as the symbolic force, and
to use that as a jumping off

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.890
point for a conversation
about sports and gender

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.680
that will involve all of you.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.800
And it's about more than
equality of participation.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.220
To me, it's about
funding and marketing.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.860
It's about opportunities
at the youth level,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.462
getting better facilities.

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:52.170
It's interesting.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.060
I was talking to Gevvie
about this panel.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.850
And she was telling
me the story of how

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.700
the US women's
soccer team in 1999

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.660
fought to compete
in large venues.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.002
The men on US soccer said,
oh, you'll never fill them,

00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:06.960
you'll never fill them.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.940
And the women said, no, we will.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.540
Give us those 90,000
seat stadiums.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.010
We'll put people in the seats.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.360
And they did.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.000
And then outside of sports
in a larger context,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.117
the symbolic force of
Title IX, it made women--

00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:22.950
and I don't think just
athletes, but women--

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.110
more aware of
inequalities and the fact

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.120
that they deserved bigger
roles and better treatment.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.270
And we know that
statistics show that sports

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.016
plays an important role in
developing female leaders.

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.390
It's no surprise
to me, actually,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.514
that when there was that
whole conversation-- well,

00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:41.280
when the women's hockey team
and the women's soccer team

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.540
fought for pay equality this
past year that it mirrored what

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.910
was happening with
discussions across the nation

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.320
about the gender pay gap.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.800
So anyways, that's the
way I see Title IX.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.310
I'm excited to dive into
it with our panelists.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.239
You may notice that Angela
Ruggiero is not here.

00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:03.030
Sad to say, there was
a death in her family

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.590
and she couldn't make it.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.590
But as I said, excited
for the three women

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.330
who are sitting beside me.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.390
We have Maura Healey to my left.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.380
You all know Maura Healey as
Massachusetts attorney general.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.700
But before she became--

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.684
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:20.160
Yes, a round of
applause for that.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.604
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:26.770
But before she became
attorney general,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.400
did you know that she was
a 16-year-old trying out

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.480
for the women's national
basketball team?

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.090
There was some oohs
there, so maybe not.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.910
She went on to captain the
Harvard women's basketball

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.400
team-- co-captain-- and
then played professionally

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.170
in Salzburg, Austria.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.970
And now instead of dribbling
away from pressure,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.990
she's taking on
pressure at the highest

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.220
levels of the political arena.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.300
Now Swin Cash.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.580
In her storied
basketball career--

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.640
I don't think storied
even describes it.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.350
At the college
and the pro level,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.110
she won seven championships--

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.070
two NCAA titles with UConn,
two Olympic gold medals,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.890
and three WNBA championships.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.870
But I have a feeling now she
may face her toughest challenge.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.300
She's entering the
ranks of-- or she's

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.400
in the ranks of
basketball executives.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.460
She is now the director
of player development

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.960
for the WNBA's New York Liberty.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.010
And I know that's a-- it's
a tough job you've got ahead

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.120
of you.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.160
And now Gevvie, Gevvie Stone.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.870
I have to admit--

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.990
One of my favorite moments
covering the Rio Olympics

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.690
last summer was getting to
watch Gevvie stone win silver

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.390
in singles.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.340
It was an amazing race.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:49.840
And--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.060
--I didn't expect it.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.420
I don't know if you expected it.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.850
But it was just one of
those thrilling moments

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.980
where I got to talk
with her beforehand

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.830
and I knew all the hard
work that had gone into it.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.980
And just incredibly impressed.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.870
She's a two time Olympian.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.920
She's also assistant coach
of the Radcliffe crew.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.350
And in one month, Dr Stone
will be starting her residency

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.630
in emergency medicine at
Beth Israel Deaconess.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.880
And I'm going to guess you'll
probably still find time

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.846
to row on the Charles.

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:22.733
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:23.274
- Absolutely.

00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:25.355
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:25.355 --> 00:13:26.480
- So let's start with this.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.990
I'll start a bit broadly.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.300
And I'm going to
go to you, Maura.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.540
Where would you be
without Title IX?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.970
- Well, I certainly wouldn't
be attorney general.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.680
And I say that not just because
I made that one commercial

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.880
where I spun a basketball--

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.780
--although that helped.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.500
But I think that
sports really gave me

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.720
esteem and self-confidence.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.410
I started playing
sports in the late '70s

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.710
through the '80s and
early '90s and was

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.810
a beneficiary of Title IX.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.370
And a lot of ground
had already been

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.330
broken in terms of the
formation of youth sports teams

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.060
for girls.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.910
And so I just think that as I
look back, sports and really

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.480
what was created
through Title IX, for me

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.450
it was about instilling
discipline, learning

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.600
how to compete as a girl--

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.430
I think that that's
important that we not

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.840
be afraid to compete.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.500
And I think of so many
lessons along the way

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.790
that I learned from sports.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.030
And it's clear to
me that I wouldn't

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:38.070
have had the experience
of coming to college here

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.950
and playing for Kathy
Delaney-Smith were it

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.520
not for what sports gave me
and continued to give me.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.310
And even going to try out as--

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.161
I guess I was 5-4.

00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:49.160
I've never really grown.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.451
I think that's as far as I got.

00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:52.980
I've been 5-4 since I
was in the eighth grade.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.510
- Princeton listed you at 5-6.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.280
- At 16 I thought
I was all that,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.440
and went off to try out
for the national team,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.360
and got a rude awakening.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.670
But what was really cool
about that experience

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.280
was meeting women who had--

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.170
who I had idolized.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.250
And to see women like that,
to be inspired by women

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.190
like that, definitely
motivated me.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.290
I remember thinking, boy,
if Nancy Lieberman can

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.450
win four Olympic medals,
what can I do, you know?

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.900
And so I just am forever
grateful to sports

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.720
because of what it has
given me and the experiences

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.740
that it's given me.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.870
- I'll go down the line with
Swin, if not for Title IX.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.290
- I would echo that.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.580
I think if it
wasn't for Title IX,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.160
I wouldn't be
sitting here today.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:47.640
I think Title IX for me
was a sign of opportunity.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.670
And I think it led to having
this god-given ability to play

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.410
sports and compete.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.290
But you can play sports
and compete when you

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.610
come from humble beginnings.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.869
But if there's no opportunity
to take that to the next level,

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:05.660
you're just competing
in your neighborhood.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.660
And so when my mom told me
at a young age that, hey,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.240
I can't pay for you
to go to college.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.760
But these people
are writing letters,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.297
and they see you
playing basketball,

00:16:16.297 --> 00:16:18.630
they see you doing track and
all these different things,

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.270
you have a real opportunity.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.480
It's hard to understand
that message internally

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.410
as a young kid.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.000
But my mother and I had
those conversations.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.680
And so I tell kids all the time
now is that I used basketball,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.970
basketball never used me.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.310
Because the end game
for me was always

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.980
to use my sport to
get my education

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.980
and then to be able to
go out there in the world

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.220
and make a change.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.190
And because of
basketball, I've been

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.050
able to do that
all over the world.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.510
And that is to me
pretty remarkable

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.240
thinking where I came
from to where I am today.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.740
- Gevvie?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.072
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:00.950
- I also echo what
Swin and Maura said.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.339
I think as a rower you grow up
with a very close relationship

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.150
with Title IX.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.240
My mom rowed in the '70s with--

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.060
knew the Yale women who walked
into the athletic director's

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.900
office protesting.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.740
And she raced the 1976
Olympics where they got garters

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.339
as part of their Olympic kit.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.190
Needless to say that 40 years
later we were not getting

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.359
garters in our Olympic kit.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.060
And I think that
change generationally

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.040
and growing up with a mother
who raced at the elite level was

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.520
very visible to me, how many
opportunities I got compared

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.591
to the one she got.

00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:38.090
She went to Cal Berkeley, which
didn't have a women's rowing

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.660
program at the time.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.410
So she transferred to
Cal State Long Beach

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.190
where she could row
at a local club.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.430
And I just took it for granted
that I could apply to colleges

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.209
where I could row.

00:17:47.209 --> 00:17:48.500
Not that I took it for granted.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.333
I did appreciate it.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.170
But it just-- the
number of opportunities

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.530
was so much greater at the
time that I got into the field.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.340
And it enabled me to receive
an education at the same time.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.080
And I got to grow as an athlete.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.860
And that's why I am who I
am today is really that--

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.370
chasing that student
athlete dream.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.700
- I'm curious if--

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.830
you mentioned you
had the benefit--

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.636
your mother experienced
things that you fortunately

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:13.760
did not have to experience.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.796
And I'm wondering if you--

00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:18.050
any of you personally have
experienced differences

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.210
in treatment that
have struck you.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.150
I know actually, Swin, it wasn't
during your athletic career

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.971
but broadcasting right
where were the real gender--

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:26.470
- Oh yeah.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.480
- --difference came out.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.530
Why don't you tell us
about your time at ESPN?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.030
- Um, well, yeah.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.910
Early on in my career, I
was given the opportunity

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.330
to cover the NBA.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.950
And at a time you're
24, 25-year-old coming

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.720
in talking about, well, Kobe
Bryant needs to do this,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.100
or LeBron James
needs to do this,

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.710
and this person needs to do
this, and this is what I see.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.950
And I remember a producer
pulling me aside and being

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.069
like, well, I think you
want to say it like this.

00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:01.610
And this is what-- this is the
direction I think you probably

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.900
should go in.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.510
And I took a step back.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.660
Because in my mind
I'm thinking, well,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.020
not only have I played
the game at a high level,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.600
I actually have had
conversations with these guys.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.700
And I'm pretty sure
this is what Kobe

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.890
would do in this situation.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.230
Or I'm pretty sure
if I went and talked

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.390
to Carmelo he was saying this.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.370
But a it was like being
a woman in my opinion,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.640
because I didn't play in the
NBA, and it was only the WNBA,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.370
and didn't matter if I
had an Olympic gold medal,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.560
it still wasn't equivalent
to actually talk

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.100
about men's sport over here.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.490
And as the young person
coming in, as you know--

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.620
whether it's on air
or in journalism--

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.460
you always want to take
the information in.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.830
But at the same time, you
have to have the ability

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.940
to have integrity, and know your
craft, and what you're talking

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.110
about, and be able to
stand your ground on what

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.900
your opinions are.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.030
And I had to learn that
early on in my career.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.700
But that-- the flip
side of that is

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.260
when we look at how
women's sports is covered,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.790
it's not covered the same.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.720
And that's always my issue
is that a lot of times

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.757
on the entertainment
side of sports

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:17.840
they tell you the stories.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.260
You fall in love with athletes
because you know their stories

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.060
or you have a certain team.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.712
And I know I'm in Boston, but I
grew up outside of Pittsburgh.

00:20:27.712 --> 00:20:30.170
So you talk about football,
I'm talking about the Steelers.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.570
That's just the way it is, hey.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.210
But I say that to
say is that I had--

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.620
I grew up loving that team.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.190
But if I didn't know anything
about the Pittsburgh Steelers,

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.130
and I just moved to Pittsburgh,
and they're talking about some

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.800
of the players, I'm probably
going to have a connection.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.700
Whereas if you watch women's
sports some of the time,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.510
they're coming--

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.810
if the tip is at
7:00 PM, they're

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.740
coming on at 6:59 going
right into the game.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.580
They're not telling
you the stories.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.740
They're not really packaging
it like they package the NBA

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.930
Eastern Conference finals.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.480
You're going to know when Isaiah
Thomas went to the bathroom

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.680
and what new outfit he had.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:11.526 --> 00:21:13.250
And you fall in love with it.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.740
And that's why when I
went into broadcasting

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.110
I really wanted to
continue to make sure

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.110
that I was pushing hard
for us to tell our stories.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.180
Because it's just as
important for people

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.430
to not only love our
sports but to fall in

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.375
love with the individuals.

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:32.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.810
- Speaking of knowing
the individuals,

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.143
I think you had an interesting--

00:21:38.143 --> 00:21:41.450
Gevvie had an interesting
experience at a World Cup event

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.670
that just showed the
disparity in the attention

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.425
that people pay to men's
rowing versus women's rowing.

00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:49.550
- Or, yeah, and men's issues
versus women's issues.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.750
- Yes

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.080
- At the World Cup
last year in 2016,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.292
the reigning world champion,
Kim Crow, from 2015

00:21:58.292 --> 00:21:59.750
had gotten married
over the winter.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.499
And her name was
now Kim Brennan.

00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:03.290
And the Australian
team, as is appropriate,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.420
entered her in as Kim Brennan.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.990
And when the referees-- the head
referees and head committee--

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.720
was seeding the regatta--
so they rank the top six

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.680
athletes--

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.940
they hadn't seeded her.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.410
And so we looked
at the heat sheet

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.310
and there were three of the
top rowers in one group of six

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.974
and where there
should only be two.

00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:22.640
And I look at this
and said, oh my gosh,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.800
I'm racing the Olympic champion,
and the world champion,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.450
and me-- and I've been fourth
at the world championships--

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.990
in one heat.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.669
Like what is going on?

00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:29.210
Freaking out.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.940
I'm texting Kim and
we're texting Mirka

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.210
going, how did this happen?

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.900
And one person raised their
hand at the coach's meeting--

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.219
who also noticed why
isn't Kim Brennan seeded.

00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:40.760
And the head of the
seeding committee

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.190
said, who is Kim Brennan?

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.420
We don't have any
records for her--

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.580
in all seriousness.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.780
And the head coach said, that's
Kim Crow, she got married.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.970
And just the thought process
that it wouldn't occur

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.345
to them that
Australia had gotten

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:57.620
a new single sculler in one year
whose first name was also Kim?

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.500
And they just couldn't
connect the dots.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.320
And the head of the US team,
who I think-- fortunately

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.540
in the US, we do
have a head coach

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.720
who is aware of Title
IX and women's issues.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.530
And he just-- he
rolled his eyes.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.580
Mostly it's European
men on the committee.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.889
And the fact that they had this
lack of awareness of things

00:23:19.889 --> 00:23:22.430
that women go through and lack
awareness of the women's sport

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.320
that they wouldn't have paid
attention to the reigning world

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.720
champion and future Olympic
champion that she had gotten

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.100
married.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.280
So it was definitely-- we
rolled her eyes and laughed.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.896
And now it's a great story.

00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:37.010
- Maura, I'm sure you
walk into a lot of rooms

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.500
where you might
be the only woman.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.100
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.810
Boy, I see it every day.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.330
There's a tremendous
amount of unconscious bias

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.060
in our world for all the
gains that we've made.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.330
And there is sexism out there.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.070
And I'll tell you, it's
really interesting.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:03.350
I see it so pervasively in
my job when I host meetings.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:08.170
And inevitably vast majority--
if not all-- men coming into

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.330
to meet with me, or when
I go somewhere-- but

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:16.400
look at the numbers in
C-suites, among CEOs, boards,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.900
and in elective office.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.740
At all levels, you just
see the dearth of women.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.970
And that matters.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.280
Because that translates
to policy and furthers

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.500
disparities and inequalities.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.080
And it comes up
in different ways.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.400
I've got a program in
schools here in Massachusetts

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.680
where we're teaching young
people in high school,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.050
empowering them with
the competencies

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.120
to take on things like
relationship violence

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.080
and dating violence.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.080
And a couple of months
ago I was in a school

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.750
and I was listening to a
girl tell the story about how

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.740
her boyfriend was trying to
get her to stop playing sports

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.100
and just watch his
sporting games.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.200
And that's happening today.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.720
You see a lot of girls
out there playing.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.030
It's so inspiring and wonderful.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.720
But there are
problems that remain.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.410
On the more light, I
remember March Madness

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.910
a couple of months ago.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.700
And one of the
political news outlets

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.360
tried this game among elected
officials around the country--

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.730
send us your brackets.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.280
Now, they only wanted
the men's bracket.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.790
So I sent a men's and a women's.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.120
They didn't print it, but--

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.346
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.670
It's just not acceptable.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.730
But it goes to what
both Swin and Gevvie

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.140
have been speaking about,
the inequities that exist

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.880
in sports for women right now.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.130
When you look at media and
you look at media time,

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.650
when you look at advertising
and marketing dollars,

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.442
when you look at the collegiate
level and the pro level,

00:25:57.442 --> 00:25:58.150
what's happening?

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.700
Pay disparities--
we saw it recently

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.700
with the women's hockey team.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.530
We've seen it with
the soccer team.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.770
And if you looked at
coaches across this country,

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.640
you'd see real disparities in
the collegiate ranks I'm sure.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.940
So we've got we've
got our work to do.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.410
- Yeah, I think it's interesting
you mentioned executives.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.320
One thing that came up in
researching for this panel

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.740
is there was a survey
of 400 female executives

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.300
and found that 94% of them
played sports, and out

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.460
of that number, 52% of them
at the university level.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.980
I know, Swin, you work
a lot with young girls.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.190
Does that just
underscore how important

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.939
it is to keep
these girls playing

00:26:40.939 --> 00:26:42.230
and to give them opportunities?

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:47.050
Because I think Title IX takes
care of the college level.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.600
But there's a whole
group of youth athletes.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.750
And as I mentioned, girls
drop out two times as much

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.250
as boys do.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.580
- I think it's vitally
important to get

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.980
young girls involved in sports.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.140
Because a lot of times--

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.024
and I know we have some
stage parents where

00:27:04.024 --> 00:27:05.440
everybody thinks
that their kid is

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.720
going to go pro, which is OK.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.540
It could be your dream, doesn't
mean it's your kid's dream.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.060
But the kids, what
you get out of sports,

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.500
it builds character,
bottom line.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.210
You have to learn so many
different disciplines,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.500
whether you're on a team
sport, an individual sport.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.630
There's something you're
going to get that you're

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.070
going to have to take
that into the real world,

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.732
into the business world.

00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:31.690
Now being in the front
office with the New York

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.450
Liberty, the one thing that
we look at immediately,

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.310
they want to know--
look at your resume.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.550
If you had encountered
sports or played sports

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.730
at some type of level,
we're looking at that.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.070
Because that lets
us know that you've

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.640
had to go through some things,
you understand teamwork.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.920
There's a lot of
different things

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.450
that I learned just
being in sports,

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.010
and I'll give a quick example.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.520
When I went to the University of
Connecticut and got on campus,

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.340
I came there with
four other girls--

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.740
there was five of us that
were in the freshman class.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.360
And we all had
different backgrounds.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.810
One was from the
suburbs in Dayton, Ohio;

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.480
I was from Pittsburgh area; we
had somebody from New Jersey.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.930
And then Sue, who was
my college roommate,

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.420
was from Syosset, New York.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420
And I'll never forget--

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.870
Sue and I were just
like hot and cold,

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.750
everything's
completely opposite.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.880
But we had to learn
how to work together.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.850
And the best thing for
us was that culturally we

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.430
came from two different
backgrounds-- family,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.710
upbringing,
economics, everything.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.320
But I learned probably more
from her in four years--

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.822
and I think she probably
would say the same--

00:28:37.822 --> 00:28:40.030
then anything that I learned
on the basketball court.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.910
Because we had to learn how to
deal with each other, how to

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.020
interact, how to work as a team.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.380
And that for me was like
the greatest feeling.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.880
Because I say this
all the time--

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.570
diversity, inclusion,
having women on your staff,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.030
having minorities being
part of the conversation,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.650
it gives you more
of a world view

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.380
in sports that you then can
use in the corporate world.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.897
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:02.897 --> 00:29:04.480
- You seem like
you're nodding, Maura.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.910
Do you have something you want
to add in terms of what you see

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.790
and what you-- the lessons
you took from basketball

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.050
into the political arena?

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.300
- Well, yeah.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.070
I'm new in the political arena.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.440
- You sure you weren't boxing?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.896
You sure you didn't
take up boxing

00:29:19.896 --> 00:29:21.520
before you went to
the political realm?

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:21.920
- Well.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.270
No, the good thing--
us little people, we

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.978
know how to box out
low and throw elbows.

00:29:24.978 --> 00:29:26.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:26.575 --> 00:29:29.200
And you big people don't get the
ball unless we give it to you.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.699
- Right.

00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:31.032
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:31.032 --> 00:29:33.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.360
- No, I think that the
idea about the lessons

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.300
is really true.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.810
And I know that just
running for office

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.820
there were ups and downs;
there were good polls,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.153
there were devastating polls;
there were a lot of people

00:29:46.153 --> 00:29:47.780
who counted me out.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.350
And I think that what I
learned through playing sports

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:56.270
really helped me as I approached
my campaign as a season.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:59.046
The pundits didn't know that,
but that's how I approached it.

00:29:59.046 --> 00:30:00.420
And every day was
like practice--

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.020
get out, get after it;
good days, bad days;

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.570
and see how it goes; and
always believe in yourself

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.610
and always believe
that you can win.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.802
And so that was really
incredibly empowering to me,

00:30:11.802 --> 00:30:13.760
though I didn't even
appreciate it at the time.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.264
It was just happening,
and I think the reason--

00:30:19.264 --> 00:30:20.930
in addition to having
a lot of good help

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.480
from a lot of great people
out across the state--

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.040
the reason that I was
successful in running.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.650
But I think that
statistic is interesting.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:34.200
And I think there's a
lot in that statistic.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.650
Because I think that
you do through sports

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:40.675
learn drive, and discipline,
and goal-setting, and teamwork,

00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:42.050
all of these things
that can make

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.530
you successful in any
number of environments.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.410
I also sometimes
wonder about the--

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.030
a different side of that though.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.750
And that is the presence
of sports in our culture.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:59.600
On some level, I wonder how many
male CEOs also played sports.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.960
And I wonder if women
coming into the workplace

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.500
with a commonality
with male counterparts

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.650
helps them advance
at a different pace

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.330
or in different ways.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.410
I'm just putting that
out there as a thought.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.351
I don't know if there's any
validity to it whatsoever.

00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:16.850
But--

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:17.690
- Makes sense.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.630
- --it's just something
to think about.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.390
- Gevvie, you are--
well actually,

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.840
I want to talk a little
bit about women--

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.050
and we touched
upon this earlier--

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.640
perception, marketing.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.150
I'm looking at Swin.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.570
I know Swin was behind a
campaign for the New York

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.770
Liberty.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.190
And I guess Gevvie too, just
in your experience, one,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.280
have you felt any pressure
to be a certain way,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.770
to market yourself
a certain way.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.200
You're in rowing, but you
are in an individual sport.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.680
And when the lights are
on, when the race is on,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.330
it's just you out there.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.620
And there is pressure to get--

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.760
I would assume-- sponsors and
people paying attention to you.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.149
- Yeah, I think rowing is such
a small sport that in a way

00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.690
you're lucky.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.314
You get away from a
lot of the pressure

00:32:10.314 --> 00:32:13.540
because not really-- no
one's getting a sponsorship

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.231
any way, shape, or know-how.

00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:17.730
It's rowing.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.710
- You can hope.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.032
- You can hope.

00:32:20.032 --> 00:32:24.050
But I think I definitely
see it in other sports.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.320
And I think across the
board at the Olympics

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.680
you notice that
female athletes are

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.410
more likely to have their hair
done, and their nails done,

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.880
and their makeup on.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.920
And it's almost as if their
presence on the playing

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.840
field and their performance
isn't enough of a show.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.470
And it's not enough to
look at how fast they run

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.660
or how well they
dribble-- they also have

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.340
to look good while doing it.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.150
And I think how they play
is the most beautiful thing

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:57.870
about them.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.149
And if they want to
get their nails done

00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:02.940
and then put their
makeup on, that's great.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.900
I hope that through
sports women feel

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:15.140
empowered just by the
movement and the performance

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:20.710
and don't feel pressured to
cloud that in any way, shape,

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.065
or form with a
ribbon in their hair

00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:26.410
or the color of their lipstick.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.680
And I do think you don't
see it the same extent

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.314
in male athletes.

00:33:32.314 --> 00:33:35.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.650
- Any idea how we change that?

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.730
Any suggestions?

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.700
How do we change the fact--

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.330
get people to value
the performance more

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:50.260
than the exterior, so to speak?

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.744
Any--

00:33:51.744 --> 00:33:53.160
- The thing that
comes to mind was

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.787
there was a campaign
for Ask the Athlete--

00:33:55.787 --> 00:33:57.120
I think that was the name of it.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.578
And they did a
little clip and they

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.510
asked male athletes
questions that they

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.054
had asked female athletes.

00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:02.970
Did you guys see this?

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.553
It was a little
snippet that was done.

00:34:04.553 --> 00:34:09.977
And they were asking pro
football players, pro tennis

00:34:09.977 --> 00:34:12.060
players all these things
like, oh, can you tell us

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.150
about your outfit
today; and, we heard

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.600
you broke up with
your girlfriend,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.808
can you tell us the details,
and all these questions.

00:34:18.808 --> 00:34:23.250
And the men's faces just
showed disdain or surprise,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.909
and in some cases just reacted
with, like, are you kidding?

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.969
And then they revealed that
all these questions that they

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.530
were asking were
questions that had

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.659
been asked to female athletes.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:38.264
And a lot of it
comes from what--

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.889
how the media portrays
these athletes--

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.179
as Swin was talking earlier,
creating a story that

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:46.689
represents the
athlete, not the--

00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:48.230
the player, who they
are as a player,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.969
not who they are as a
drama, as a rom com,

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.270
or anything like that.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.780
And I think what people ask
to hear-- so it goes back

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.970
to both the media and how
they portray it, but also

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.690
what people are reading and what
the fans are asking to hear.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.800
So hopefully little
girls are asking

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.250
not who made the outfit,
I want to go buy it,

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:18.380
but how many hours do you spend
in the pool and questions that

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.120
reflect performance instead
of physical appearance or love

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.640
life.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.650
- Yeah, no, I totally agree.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.910
I think there's
two things in that.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.980
I think the people
that are asking

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.530
the question, the
journalists that

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.500
are trying to get the stories,
are vitally important.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.834
There's a responsibility
that's there.

00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:43.000
I also think there's a
responsibility on the leagues

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.260
and the individuals.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.880
I know for the WNBA--

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.120
I played 15 years in the WNBA
and there was a point just

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.490
coming in early on
in my career where

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.400
it seemed like our whole
marketing campaign was

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.730
based around how we looked.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.364
And the uniforms changed--
they got a little shorter.

00:36:00.364 --> 00:36:02.780
And next thing I know when
tucking in my jersey, I'm like,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.279
I tucked in my
jersey my whole life.

00:36:04.279 --> 00:36:06.260
Who doesn't tuck in
a basketball jersey?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.310
I just never understood it.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.320
But then you look at
the fact that they

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.220
were trying to sell
us as we were feminine

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.930
but we still play basketball.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.070
Now granted, I like to dress
up, I like to take pictures.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.630
That may work for me.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.870
But it doesn't mean it
works for all the 144

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.000
women that are in the WNBA.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.610
And so I started seeing
like our marketing,

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.170
our branding was
putting everybody

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.750
into this one box,
which is not fair.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.190
I think we've gotten to a point
now where it's about the game

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.570
and how you play the game.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.000
And now you look at the
campaign of Watch me Work

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.642
and it's really about watching
how they play basketball.

00:36:46.642 --> 00:36:48.100
Whether you like
how they dress up,

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.850
whether you like how
they have their hair,

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.830
come on watch the
authentic part of the game.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.630
And it took us a while
to get to this place.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.630
But I know for me, working
with the New York Liberty,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:03.040
it's important that we have
our overarching brand of what

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.660
we want our team to be.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.660
But we also have to stay
connected to individually do

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.490
the players fit
in that and making

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:13.060
sure we're staying true to
who they are as individuals.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.780
And that's one of
the first things when

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.030
I came into the front office--

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.830
I wanted to make
sure that I made

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.870
that very clear is that
I want to make sure

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.170
our brand represents everyone
and it's just not a few.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:27.190
And I think if every
organization and league take

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.760
that responsibility on, I think
we'll be in a better place

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.870
and head to the right--

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.379
hit it in the right direction.

00:37:33.379 --> 00:37:34.670
But you have to think about it.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.160
People are consumers.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.100
And so there's a lot
of different studies

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:39.952
they do nowadays.

00:37:39.952 --> 00:37:41.410
And they figure
out how many clicks

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.880
it's going to get,
they figure out

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.350
how many people
are watching, who's

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.100
going to go purchase something.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.901
And a lot of times,
advertisers are

00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:49.150
going to go in that direction.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.360
Because it comes back to, as
you know, the bottom line.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.190
- I think the important
phrase that you

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.040
said was when I got into the
front office, I did this.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.430
And to me, so much about
what happens in sports

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.090
is about women having a voice--

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.850
and elsewhere.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.270
I think women having a voice
either in the front office,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.400
or in the attorney
general's office,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.360
and being almost a
final decision-maker.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.830
And it made me think of your
program with Game Changers.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.710
And I'm wondering if you feel
the same way in the sense that

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.930
having somebody who's attuned
to the issues a young girl might

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:23.650
face when she--

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.090
her boyfriend tells her not
to play sports or just attuned

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.120
to different issues that women--
if that makes a difference

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.070
and we need to--

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.910
it's part of what Title
IX's legacy should,

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.330
be which is getting more
women in the front office,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.650
in political office, and if that
needs to be more of a priority

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.450
in some ways.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.510
- Well, it does.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.700
Because just having
a law on the books

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.380
doesn't do anything by itself.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.370
And we've had Title IX for
a good number of years.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.630
But let's face it--

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.490
we still see a lack of
female representation

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.210
in legislatures, in
Congress, in elective office,

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.080
in boardrooms, and
running corporations.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.670
So we have work to do.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.800
There is something still really
pernicious and real inequity

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.900
out there.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.260
Look-- I'm a big
believer in women running

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.580
for office at all levels.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.790
Because I think that if
you look at policies,

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.210
look at the decision-makers.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.092
I find that picture
staggering of a few weeks

00:39:25.092 --> 00:39:27.050
ago with all those men
standing around deciding

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.133
what was going to happen
with women's health care.

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.660
But as a woman attorney
general, sure, I've

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:37.240
had a particular focus on issues
that have a certain resonance

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:37.990
with me--

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.090
human trafficking
and what's happening

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.850
to the sexual exploitation
of girls and women;

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:46.450
certainly what's happening
with relationship violence,

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.150
and teen dating violence,
and domestic violence;

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.110
pay equity-- we worked hard
this year to get a bill through,

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.730
it's the first of its
kind in the country;

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.490
and certainly issues around
health care and consumer

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.800
issues, where
disproportionately women

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.110
are the ones who
not only are making

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.450
the decisions around
households but are

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.360
the ones disproportionately
adversely affected by policies.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.670
So I'm a big one to
say get out there, run,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.560
let's get represented.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.870
People need to hire people.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.000
Take a chance and
hire women, promote

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.670
women, whatever
organization you're in.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.610
How ridiculous that you're
going to get somebody

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.830
not Swin to do the play-by-play
or cover those games.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.190
Is there anybody who has
more capacity or competence?

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.090
No.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:35.130
But you see this all the time
where fabulous, talented women

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.780
with so much--

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.960
bringing so much the
table are routinely

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.075
passed over for mediocre or
less-than-mediocre males.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:48.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:50.895 --> 00:40:56.440
So wherever you have power or
opportunity to hire and promote

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.150
women, do that.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:02.060
And stick by them
and stick with them.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.060
- Swin, what are you doing
in Liberty's front office?

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.751
I looked at your staff and I
think you're one of two women--

00:41:08.751 --> 00:41:09.250
- Yeah.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.270
- --in the front office.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.770
- Our staff I feel
is very diverse.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.046
I feel good going
into our offices

00:41:15.046 --> 00:41:17.420
because I look at some of the
other teams and their staff

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.570
and it makes me
laugh a little bit.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.940
But for me, I love
the fact that I

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.810
can come in as now a
rookie in the front office,

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.200
have these fresh ideas--

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.440
this progressive
mindset-- of where

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.670
I want to see women's sports go,
and everyone's open to listen.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.550
And yes, I played the
game for 15 years.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.990
But I'll never forget one
of the first meetings I had.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.300
And the young lady
who just got hired,

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.150
she had asked, well, what
is it exactly that you do

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.350
and what did you study in
school to help you get here?

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.720
And I said, well, in school
I studied communications.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.780
But for the last 15 years,
I've not only played basketball

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.550
here, I've also
played in Russia,

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.720
I played in the Czech
Republic, in China.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.100
15 years I was on executive
board for our committee.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.170
I went through two
CBA negotiations.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.340
I made hires at the union.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.837
I had fires at the union.

00:42:08.837 --> 00:42:11.170
I think I've got some background
and qualification to be

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.620
able to be here and do this.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.050
But you know as
athletes sometimes they

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.270
think because you play
a sport that there's

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.350
nothing else you can do.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.620
They put us all into this
box that you're just a jock.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.415
And if you know anything
about female athletes,

00:42:24.415 --> 00:42:26.540
it doesn't matter what
level that you're on-- we're

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.310
always trying to achieve in
the classroom, in our job.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.990
We love the sport,
we play the sport,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.670
but realistically
we know it's not

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.409
going to set us up for life.

00:42:36.409 --> 00:42:37.450
We're doing other things.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.940
If you go across the WNBA, you
go across our team in general,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.710
there are women
that own businesses,

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.139
there are women who are
in construction right now,

00:42:45.139 --> 00:42:47.180
there are women that are
taking their investments

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.110
and they're looking
at the markets.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.530
And if people don't open
those doors to give them

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.080
an opportunity or a chance,
how can they advance

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.742
and how can they bring
the women behind them?

00:42:56.742 --> 00:43:00.179
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.652 --> 00:43:05.060
- You've talked to me about
some interesting solutions.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.840
There was the Instagram.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.900
- Oh, we were talking--

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.230
- And to me, this
is interesting too.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.160
So there are big
solutions and then

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.850
there are little small ways
in which the bias comes out

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.560
against women's athletics.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.990
And sometimes just the
smallest little change

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:23.450
can sometimes have
large ramifications.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.920
And I think that
was what you were

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.690
thinking about when you thought
about the Instagram issue.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.710
- Yeah, we were talking
about the university level,

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.700
even at an institution
like Harvard,

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.290
which definitely values women
as a whole and thinks about it.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.850
Obviously, we're here.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.444
One of our former
captains last year,

00:43:40.444 --> 00:43:42.110
who is actually here
tonight, counted up

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.750
the pictures in the Harvard
athletics Instagram account.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.690
And it's about 2/3
male, 1/3 female?

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.050
And why?

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.710
Harvard has an equal balance in
terms of the number of sports

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.760
played by women and men.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.120
So shouldn't they represent
those sports equally

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.050
and try to increase awareness
of every sport equally?

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.750
That's the job of the
athletic department.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.010
And I think as a whole social
media has such an influence

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.060
in our world today.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.100
And it is such an easy
thing to tweak in terms

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.100
of increasing awareness.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.480
So many people-- you were
talking about clicks.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.390
So many people check Facebook,
check Instagram, check Twitter.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.550
And so when you have
accessibility in something

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.280
like that, just making
sure that on all levels

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.410
you are increasing
awareness of women and men.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.855
And also creating a--

00:44:26.855 --> 00:44:29.510
I think we were talking
about also creating a demand

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.340
and placing a value
on women's sports

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.950
that's equal to men's sports.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.340
So at Harvard you have to pay
to attend games for more men's

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.111
sports than women's sports.

00:44:39.111 --> 00:44:41.360
And obviously football throws
that off because there's

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.920
no women's football team.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.930
But even if you
eliminate football,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.767
you have to pay to
attend more men's sports

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:47.600
than women's sports.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.974
You pay to attend
men's lacrosse,

00:44:48.974 --> 00:44:51.440
you do not pay to attend
women's lacrosse game.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.730
Why?

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.080
Why should that be disparity?

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.909
If it's a money
thing, then decrease

00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:59.450
the cost of a men's ticket and
increase the cost of a woman's

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:01.490
ticket so that they're even.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.990
They should create a demand and
place a value on women's sports

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:11.360
that represents that they
hold the sport in high esteem.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.400
Everyone as a student
athlete, they're

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.730
all playing at the same level.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.630
And I think in
order for outsiders

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.060
to see that, it can begin
with an institution saying

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.920
we value these sports
equally so we are

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.680
going to treat them equally.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.240
- One other thing
I'd add is that I

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.020
think that we need to find
ways to support women.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.790
Buy season tickets, buy the
package, buy the jerseys.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.809
Have your little sons wearing
jerseys of Liberty players.

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:38.600
That'll be the day.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.610
That's what we want to see.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:43.940
So where we care
about these issues,

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.500
let's put our money, and
our wallets, and our energy,

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:53.540
and our time investing in and
supporting women's athletics.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.480
Take them to girls' high
school soccer games.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.840
Take your kids to college games.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.390
Really support the programs
and grow and create

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.240
that demand and that
consumer side of things.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.470
I think that's really important.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.575
I think that we don't
do as much as we could.

00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:12.950
- I think that we are heading
in a step in the direction.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.680
I remember the Women's World
Cup, the most recent one,

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.620
they didn't make a lot of
the jerseys in men's sizes.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.130
And the men's sizes sold
out instantaneously.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.120
That's a great step.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.292
The company is going, oh,
shoot, we made a mistake.

00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:27.500
And I think there was a
public announcement about it.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.583
Because these jerseys were
flying off the shelves.

00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:31.980
And it just didn't
occur to whatever

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.401
Nike executive to make as many
men's sizes of female jerseys.

00:46:37.401 --> 00:46:38.900
Plenty of female
wear Brady jerseys.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.540
Why shouldn't it go
the other way around?

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.830
But I think that was definitely
a step in the right direction.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:43.790
And you're absolutely right.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:44.290
- Yeah.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:48.370
And I'll just give you
this brief analogy just

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.900
to think about and not
even really answer today.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.560
But just go home
and sleep on this.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.570
Because I had a conversation
during our television

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:57.560
show with our staff.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.976
And we were in the
production room

00:46:58.976 --> 00:47:02.970
and we were talking about
how women support the NFL--

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.044
which I said earlier I
love my football team

00:47:05.044 --> 00:47:06.710
and I'm pretty sure
a lot of you in here

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.126
have a football
team you love too.

00:47:08.126 --> 00:47:10.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:15.080
But the thing was is
that we were talking--

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.760
because all the
domestic violence,

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.410
a lot of different things
were happening in the NFL.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.430
But if you looked at their
merchandise, and things

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.980
that were being purchased,
and season tickets,

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.290
none of that stuff was
really being affected.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:33.200
And it made me start
thinking about women's sports

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.570
and how hard it is for us,
for the New York Liberty,

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:42.950
to get women to come out and
support women at our game,

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.590
to buy the jerseys
or buy the tickets.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.900
And there's always a
complaint about, well,

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.270
this costs this
amount or that amount.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.180
But I looked over here
at this men's league.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.930
Yes, it's a powerhouse
and it's been there

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.310
for a number of years.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.380
But nothing was affecting--

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.680
bad news after bad news, it
wasn't affecting their numbers.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.776
And I think about why is that.

00:48:02.776 --> 00:48:05.400
And you think about it, because
there's a loyalty to your team,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.510
you love your team.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.759
You may not care what the
rest of the league is doing,

00:48:08.759 --> 00:48:11.190
but you feel like this is my
team, I'm connected to it.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.770
So for me, whenever
we get to the point

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.860
where all the New York
and around the areas

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.390
love the Liberty
and they're going

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.850
to support the Liberty, that's
when I'm like, all right,

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.349
we're moving in the
right direction.

00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:24.840
And I just don't see that
yet of women coming out

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.830
supporting women.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.340
The WNBA is the longest
professional women's league

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.450
in the world.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.850
Their union is the
longest running union

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.880
in the world that's ever been.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.020
And in order for us to keep it
going, for my 13-year-old niece

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.410
who's out there with a WNBA
basketball in a gym by herself,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.090
we have to make sure
that we support it.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:48.117
Because what's going to
happen is if it goes away,

00:48:48.117 --> 00:48:50.200
we're going to be marching
up and down the streets

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.830
and complaining about
why it didn't last.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.830
But the reality is is not
enough of us are supporting it.

00:48:59.746 --> 00:49:03.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:07.821
- That takes me nicely to what
does the future look like.

00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:10.070
And after that, we've reached
the point in the program

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.800
where it's open to
audience questions.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.220
But I want to know,
what does the future--

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.307
Swin, you gave us one
potential scary scenario

00:49:18.307 --> 00:49:20.890
of the future, which is people
marching up and down the street

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.430
without teams.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.932
But what does women's sports--

00:49:24.932 --> 00:49:26.390
what does college
sports look like,

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.973
what do professional
sports look like?

00:49:27.973 --> 00:49:32.330
Are we ever going to have that
big moment where the pro sports

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.880
and college sports get
the kind of support

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.820
that we thought they would get
coming out of the Women's World

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.140
Cup in 1999?

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.780
And I open it to all of you to
look into your crystal ball.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.380
- I'm just a firm believer in
the fire that's in our country

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:48.920
right now.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.940
And I just believe--

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.786
and I said this, and no
disrespect to the men in here,

00:49:52.786 --> 00:49:54.410
but this is just the
year of the woman.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.570
And it's time for
us to take the torch

00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:00.230
and move it forward in
all aspects of business,

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.880
and sports, and everything else.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.360
Because there just comes
a time and a moment--

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.600
and I think we're in it--

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.412
where you have to just stand up.

00:50:07.412 --> 00:50:08.870
And my mom used to
always say to me

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.370
if you don't stand
for something,

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.960
you're going to
fall for anything.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.260
And that's how I live
my life, that right

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.690
now when I speak
out, when I stand up

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.400
for things that are good or bad,
I understand it's not for me.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.370
It's for all of the girls
that are coming up behind me.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:26.996
And I think if we
have that mindset,

00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:28.370
I'm starting to
feel like there's

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.274
more of a collective with that.

00:50:31.274 --> 00:50:32.690
There could be
teams-- there could

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.360
be the soccer team
it's a moment, the USA

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.200
team it's a moment.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.470
I think right now our
country's just in that moment.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.020
And so for me, I hope
this year of the woman

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.920
is an invigorating thing that
we'll all grab ahold with

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.790
and run with it.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:50.630
The greatest thing for me
was I spoke at a university

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.300
with Dante Stallworth,
who is a friend of mine.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.020
And he actually played
here before too.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.100
And he said, yeah,
I can say it--

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.230
he said to the class,
I'm a feminist.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.850
And that just really rocked me.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.350
I thought that was pretty cool.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.960
Because I've never heard a guy
just come right out and say it.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.260
But I'm glad that men are
comfortable saying I support

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.800
women and being OK with that.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.050
So I hope that's the
direction we're going in.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:15.800
- Thoughts?

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.870
- Yeah I'm optimistic
in longer term.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.270
I think as we get farther from
Title IX and more and more

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.910
women participate
in sports, it also

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.470
is more of an opportunity
for women to become coaches.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.650
I think as a rower
being in rowing now,

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.520
rowing has been an NCAA
sport for about 20 years now.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.340
And more and more women are
entering the coaching ranks.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.130
And I think I've been very
fortunate as an athlete

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.870
to be coached by two
very strong women

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.520
and coached under a
very strong woman.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.480
I think the head coaches
are still mostly men.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.600
And as it is at NCAA
sport and as we progress,

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.570
a lot of the assistant
coaches are female.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.450
And when you get a female mentor
and a female head coach and you

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:55.550
see that female in
a position of power,

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.395
I think you can connect on
a level that you can't--

00:51:58.395 --> 00:52:00.020
there are a lot of
great men's coaches,

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.540
but you just don't see them
as a role model in the way

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.220
that you can see a
strong women's coach.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.350
And I think as we get
further from Title IX,

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.630
hopefully get more and more
females in those coaching

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.615
roles, hopefully coaching not
only females but also males.

00:52:11.615 --> 00:52:14.270
It can definitely--
why not go both ways?

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.770
- Yeah.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.470
Because now I think the number--
the latest statistic I saw

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.540
was that more than
60% of college

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.660
coaches across all
divisions are actually men.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:29.040
So women's coaches, yeah.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.350
What do you see in
the future, Maura?

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:36.240
- Well, I think there
is going to be still

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.600
a need to ensure
accountability and specifically

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.420
enforce the law.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.128
I think we're going
to see more lawsuits.

00:52:43.128 --> 00:52:46.010
I think that with this
energy, with this movement,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.910
people are going to realize,
and look for, and appreciate

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:53.189
some more of the inequalities
that exist even with Title IX.

00:52:53.189 --> 00:52:54.730
And I don't think
that's a bad thing.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:56.980
Because I think about
those women at Brown

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.230
many years ago who
brought the fight.

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.510
And if it wasn't
holding organizations,

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:06.790
institutions accountable in a
very real way, in a way that

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.370
impacted prestige
or bottom line,

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.330
we would not have seen
some of the advances.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.760
That's just the way it goes.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.030
So I actually think
we're probably in a time

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:19.090
where we're going to see
some more litigation based

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.070
on existing disparities.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:25.510
I also think that it is
optimistic where we're at.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.920
I think more women and more
girls are playing sports.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:37.150
I think that it's right we
have a concern about the lack

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.790
of women coaching right now.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:43.900
And what we've seen in
terms of the trend there,

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.190
that's an issue.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.960
I think about what Title
IX gave women access to

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.810
in terms of this license, this
freedom to not just get out

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:58.810
there and compete but to sweat.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.670
You think about
us, I think we're

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:05.729
a healthier population for
it and much better off.

00:54:05.729 --> 00:54:08.270
And I'm heartened you know when
I think about-- just a couple

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:12.010
of weeks ago, I was in a
classroom down on the South

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:12.730
Shore.

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:16.241
And I went around the room
to a group of third graders.

00:54:16.241 --> 00:54:17.740
And I'm asking all
of them what they

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.370
wanted to be when they grow up.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:23.530
And of course you know
any number of the boys

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:28.287
were pro baseball player,
pro soccer player.

00:54:28.287 --> 00:54:30.370
I try to encourage them
to keep their options open

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.240
with a backup plan.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.670
Especially the boys,
they just don't see it.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.125
But I got to this little girl.

00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:39.880
Her name was Cally.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:46.030
And she was sitting there.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:47.880
And she said she wanted to go--

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.560
she a basketball player,
she's going to go to UConn,

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.970
and then she's
going to play pro.

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:54.190
So I think about
people like Swin

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.920
blazing the trail for that
little third grader today.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.240
And that leaves me optimistic
about where we're going to go.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.560
- And now I guess we'll turn--
there are microphones being

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.060
placed.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.050
So anyone who has a
question for the panelists,

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:14.350
please step up to the
microphone and ask away.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:15.630
- My daughter is 29 now.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:16.630
But when she was about--

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:20.530
I don't know-- seven, we started
watching women's basketball,

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:21.400
college basketball.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.660
So Geno Auriemma
is like the father.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.161
I think he's the one exception
with the male coaches--

00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:28.660
I think.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.760
But I want to know--

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.597
there's always been this woman
next to him, long blond hair.

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:36.430
And she seems to be a
very important person.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.554
She's been there for years.

00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:40.630
So what would you say about
her and what's her name?

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.919
I want to give her some--

00:55:43.919 --> 00:55:45.710
- I'm going to have to
text her after this.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:49.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.257
Why else did you stay
with him for 30 years?

00:55:51.257 --> 00:55:53.340
You're just now the little
blond woman back there.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:56.470
Well, we call we call her CD.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:57.610
Her name is Chris Dailey.

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:00.160
She actually played
basketball at Rutgers.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.840
Yes, she's very tall.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.460
She played basketball
at Rutgers.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.710
She actually came in with him.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:10.010
And they together built
it from the ground up.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.690
She doesn't get enough credit.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:16.847
But I think over the years
any time players have

00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:18.930
been interviewed-- any
time I've been interviewed,

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:22.110
I never just mention him
without mentioning her.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.270
Because to me they're
a package deal.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:27.090
To me and I say
this to his face--

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.970
he doesn't get to where
he's at without her.

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.015
And a lot of people
are like, well,

00:56:32.015 --> 00:56:34.050
why didn't she go
be a head coach?

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:36.240
She enjoyed her role
and her position there.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.920
And I respect her for that.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.630
She just never felt--

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.400
as she would tell
you if she was here--

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.210
that there was a job
that was right for her.

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:49.620
And so what I learned
from her at UConn

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.950
was about who I was
as a person when

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:58.500
we step onto the court, when
we travel, how we got dressed,

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.000
how we went to banquets.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.310
She's the one-- the
mastermind behind

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.940
when we walk into a building and
we have UConn across our chest,

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.980
she's the one that was
molding all of that.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.200
So when you talk about that
role model, that mother

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.630
figure, the things
that he was never

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.890
really strong in that
area, Chris was there.

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:17.372
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.820
- Well, if you ever notice if
he's about to get a technical

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:25.320
and he's about to
get to half court,

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:29.010
she's the one that's
piddle-paddling out there

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.760
to really get him.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.200
They have a great relationship.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.650
But yeah, she's like--
if there's the godfather,

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:37.450
she's like the godmother
of UConn I guess.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:41.870
But yeah, she plays a vital
role for that university.

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:44.490
- I was thinking
about Gevvie's comment

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.340
about how the women felt
they had to dress, and look,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.340
and show themselves
in a certain way

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.050
even though they were
Olympic athletes.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.000
And I'm wondering why
we haven't commented

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.120
on the role of homophobia and
its effect on women's sport.

00:58:00.547 --> 00:58:01.880
- Well, that's a great question.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.500
I can take that head-on.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.680
Because we get it in the WNBA.

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.880
And I've asked the question.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.050
I did a piece with
The Players' Tribune--

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.780
Tanisha Wright, Essence Carson.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:16.160
And we asked those
questions of why don't we

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.774
get the same
recognition, why is it

00:58:17.774 --> 00:58:19.940
so hard for people to have
an appetite for the WNBA.

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.740
And there's two
different things--

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:27.680
people who have a problem with
the LGBTQ community and people

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:31.100
who have a problem with majority
of the league being minority.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.110
And until we have
those conversations

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:35.120
and be able to talk
about those things,

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.790
it's really hard for
you to address them.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.200
And it's not taboo.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.060
It's what it is.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.850
And I love the fact that we're
a diverse group of women.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.730
But if you just focus
on the basketball,

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:48.470
that's what it should be on.

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.900
But people are scared to
have those conversations.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.030
But our players aren't
scared to have it.

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:56.720
Our players support
across the board everyone.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.346
And I think that's been one
of the issues in the WNBA.

00:58:59.346 --> 00:59:01.220
And I can give you a
quick example, because I

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.803
want to let you ask
you your question,

00:59:02.803 --> 00:59:07.070
is that the US
women's team has won

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.880
six Olympic gold
medals in a row,

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.600
just as dominant as UConn--

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.780
six Olympic gold
medals in a row.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.790
We're close friends and
love the US soccer team.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:24.200
If you watch how our US soccer
team, from sponsorship to when

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.030
it's Olympic time, the
packages that are put around

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:31.040
and the women, and it's like
that's their time of year--

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:37.550
it is not the same with our
jewel, I feel, of US basketball

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:38.780
with six Olympic gold medals.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.390
Because that is
the goal, correct?

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.110
If you're an Olympian,
you want to try

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.390
to get to the pinnacle
of reaching gold medals.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.270
And so we asked the
question of why not us.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.890
And this was two Olympics ago--

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:50.400
why not us?

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.690
And if you look at our US
women's basketball team,

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.850
for a number of years
it's very diverse.

00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:59.990
We have women who are not afraid
to say, yes, I'm a lesbian,

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.410
yes I have a
partner, and it's OK.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:08.060
And for some of our friends
who are on the soccer team, who

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.320
also may have a partner,
they may not feel comfortable

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.360
being able to say that
or do it because they're

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.460
getting packaged and
put in a way that

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.760
is completely different.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.610
So I do think that that
is an issue that we

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.890
have to address and talk
about in order for us

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:24.200
to kind of push that aside,
and let the sport just

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.300
be the sport, and
not make it about all

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.050
these different
political issues.

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:35.190
- And I think that a
couple of things on this.

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:36.480
Look, I remember playing.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:43.590
I remember high school and in
college homophobic comments,

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.220
and characterizations,
and slights.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.630
And it just-- it was just part
of the scene, I feel like,

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:52.836
until--

01:00:52.836 --> 01:00:57.570
until-- there was actual legal
action and there ended up being

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.360
more legal action in this
country establishing rights--

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.300
greater rights and
protections for LGBT people.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.490
And I'm a beneficiary of that.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.720
But make no mistake about
it-- the homophobia is still

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.980
very real.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.220
And so it's not just
limited to sports.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.780
Look at society right now.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.080
When we have this
misogynous-in-chief in charge

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.650
of the White House, when we
have an attorney general,

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:24.750
United States Attorney
General, whose first act

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:29.010
was to rescind the guidance
for LGBT students' protections

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:29.980
in schools.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.110
These are not good signals.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:34.710
But make no mistake about it--
they reflect a homophobia that

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:40.440
is still existing across
any number of industries,

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.290
and sectors, and
spaces, and-- yeah--

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.060
on the court and
in the ball field.

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.180
It's hard being a
woman athlete, it's

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.950
hard being a gay woman athlete.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.540
It's hard being a
woman coach, it's

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.670
hard being a gay woman coach--

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.550
harder, I think.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.320
So to me it just
points to the work

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.530
we've got to do as a
society and as a culture.

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:04.650
And that starts with
repudiating and rejecting

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:08.400
racism, sexism, homophobia,
you name it in all forms

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.842
whenever we see it.

01:02:10.842 --> 01:02:14.216
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.040
- I want to go back to body
image for just a moment

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.480
but take it in a
different direction.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.960
I worked at Sports Illustrated
as one of their women

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.270
reporters in the 1970s.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.700
And I remembered that it was
very rare for women to be

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.510
on the cover of our magazine
then except in mid-February

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:37.710
when we did the--

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:38.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.310
--we did the bathing suit issue.

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:42.870
What I want to swing
back around too

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.350
now is if we look at Sports
Illustrated's bathing suit

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.690
issue this year, we
will find that there

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:52.620
are less of a bathing
suit on all of the models.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.190
But surprisingly, we will
find that in those pages

01:02:56.190 --> 01:03:00.660
there are the two top US
gymnasts from the Olympics--

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:07.140
Simone and Aly-- who are
both posed in deliberately--

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.200
and they speak about this on
their Instagram and the rest--

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.950
to show the muscularity
of their bodies.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:17.370
Because they feel as though,
particularly in their sport,

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:21.750
it's been the pixie
girl who leaps up

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.130
and the muscularity isn't
really a part of what they are.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.350
So in effect they're
showing off their bodies

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:34.650
and displaying them in this
traditionally very misogynistic

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.520
way.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.190
But I do want to
compare that to the fact

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:44.100
that in so many other instances
you do see female athletes very

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.480
scantily clad and very
much posing in ways

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.830
that are very predictable.

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:51.630
They're almost ways
that models would

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:54.550
have posed in those
swimsuit issues years ago.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:58.410
So I think we're
seeing this duality

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.710
of how we think about body
image of women athletes.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.574
And I'd just like
your thoughts on that.

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:04.740
- Can I say something first?

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.570
So, Melissa, before
you sit down,

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.170
just to recognize Melissa.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:10.590
In case, you don't know
who Melissa is, It's

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:13.740
Melissa Ludtke, personal hero.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.400
And she is one of the pioneers
in women's sports journalism.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.520
Because she sued the major
league baseball commissioner

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.130
for locker room access in 1977.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:24.880
[CHEERING]

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.368
And won, and won.

01:04:26.368 --> 01:04:29.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:40.530
Reaction to what Melissa said
or comments on the duality?

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:41.220
- Gosh.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:47.290
I think not just as athletes,
but maybe athletes because we

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:51.160
are in the position of being
in minimal clothing frequently

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.460
and shown in minimal clothing
frequently-- as a rower,

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.330
we wear unisuits.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:57.940
You can see everything
in a unisuit.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.240
And it does create
a self-consciousness

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.710
about body image.

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:06.400
And Simone and Aly have
both been very vocal--

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.110
not just through that
picture, but also

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.560
through Twitter, and Instagram,
and the like-- about the fact

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.050
that they've
received negative fan

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:18.010
feedback about their
muscles and also expressing

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.200
a pride for those muscles.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.010
It takes a lot of work
to build those muscles.

01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.770
That's purposeful.

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:29.470
And I think that they are
a little bit a younger

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.130
generation.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.820
And I hope that they're
representative of the girls who

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.980
are coming through.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.900
As one of the
coaches at Radcliffe

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.520
this year, you'd see it
in college athletes still.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.850
You see an awareness of what
their body type is compared

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:52.200
to other students on campus,
an awareness of muscles,

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.730
issues around eating.

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:57.166
And I think it is a problem.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:58.790
How to fix it right
away, I don't know.

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:02.216
But I think Simone and Aly are
taking an awesome first step.

01:06:02.216 --> 01:06:03.320
- Yeah, I think--

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.590
you see it a lot even
with Serena Williams.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:11.750
And she constantly gets
talked about her muscles 24/7.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.150
But Serena also
likes to dress up

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.347
and she likes to be in gowns.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:18.680
And there's always something
that's said about her body.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.850
I'm all for--

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.580
I don't care what age
you are as a woman

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.560
to be empowered by your body.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.900
And what I do with my body, how
I-- my body image is up to me.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.240
And I love the fact
to see athletes

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.370
embracing that and showing
their strength in it

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.530
however they do it.

01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:41.570
I do think that you can tell
when somebody is only doing it

01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:44.690
because they're collecting a
check versus somebody that's

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:46.730
doing it because it's
empowering to them

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.750
and they're sending
out a certain message.

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.680
And maybe it's not so clear,
but it's pretty clear for me.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.780
And as someone that
when I was younger,

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.480
I used to do runway modeling.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.230
And when I went into basketball,
I never wanted to touch that.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.420
I didn't want to always
go to the feminist where

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.416
I like to wear dresses and
do this because I thought

01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:07.040
that people looked
at me as being weak,

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.930
because that was a
side of me that they

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.210
didn't necessarily always see.

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:12.459
So I stayed away from that.

01:07:12.459 --> 01:07:14.000
And then I just
started embracing it,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.890
like this is who I am, OK.

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:19.070
If I want to wear these type
of clothes and everything,

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:20.430
that's who I am.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:23.560
So I thought what they did
in regards to this swimsuit

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.092
was pretty awesome.

01:07:25.092 --> 01:07:26.550
And I just think
we have to take it

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.966
for what it is because people
do it for different reasons.

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.950
- Yeah, no, I totally--

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:35.890
I respect that.

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:37.225
I think though that the--

01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:39.660
I guess I think the
swimsuit edition is

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.400
ridiculous in the sense that--

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.390
And I am all for women
showing off their muscles,

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.600
and being proud of their
bodies, and just go for it.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.740
That's awesome to me.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.110
But sometimes I wonder--

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.850
are we that
surprised that people

01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:56.790
weren't apoplectic over
the fact that the Ray Rice

01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:03.630
video or that pervasive domestic
violence or sexual assault

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:07.260
has been allowed to occur
in the NFL over the years

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.790
without any sort of
accountability or retribution?

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:13.680
Who is actually
getting that magazine,

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.680
and exactly what is that
reader, and what are they

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.529
taking as a message from that?

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.677
And I think that this is
part of society's ownership.

01:08:22.677 --> 01:08:24.510
We can talk a big game
about a lot of stuff.

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:27.620
But let's face the
reality of some

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:31.390
of what's right in front
of us with some of this.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.890
- Thank you for this
very good conversation.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.609
I wanted to ask a somewhat
different question.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:39.490
Understandably, at
this 45th anniversary

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:45.520
we are celebrating Title IX
and we are focusing on the ways

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.200
that women's athletics deserves
to get a share of the pie.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.670
And we want it to be
recognized and in many ways

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.170
to mimic male sports.

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.140
But male athletics
aren't necessarily

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.910
the panacea in all ways.

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:04.870
And male relationships around
sports aren't always ideal.

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.450
There's bullying,
there's exclusiveness,

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:10.330
there's stigmatizing
of people who aren't

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.910
competitive in the same ways.

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:13.330
So I'm wondering if--

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:16.479
what your thoughts are about
the ways in which women's sports

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.700
may be different
than men's or should

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.490
aspire to be different
than men's athletics.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.350
- I think you
should aspire to be

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:33.649
the best player in your sport.

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:37.490
I think that's what we train for
is to be the best in our sport.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.800
I can use basketball.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.560
And as analogy, I think people
always talk about, well,

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.899
the women-- the WNBA
isn't as good as the NBA

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:47.609
because they don't dunk.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:50.685
And I always ask the
question, are you

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:52.560
watching the Golden
State Warriors right now,

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.340
what do you like about them?

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.870
And people tell me,
guys will be like,

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.820
oh man, they pass the ball,
they share, they shoot threes,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.960
it's unbelievable.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.460
You see that behind
the back play--

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.540
pass?

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.300
And then I'll say, well,
you know that the women

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.590
do all that right?

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:06.720
You didn't mention
dunking one time.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.094
So now it's a thing of beauty
when the men are doing it

01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:09.760
in Golden State.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.360
And I'm like, women have been
playing fundamental basketball

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.370
forever.

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:17.160
So I just think that
women have to just

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.130
be the best they can
be, grow the league.

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.380
You're seeing younger
girls starting there really

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.032
have a vision and aspire
to being in the WNBA

01:10:25.032 --> 01:10:25.740
at a younger age.

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.156
So they're working
on their craft.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:30.460
The game is faster, women
are taller, quicker.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.920
That's what we want to see.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.830
I don't want there to be a
comparison always to the NBA.

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.660
Because at the end
of the day, I do

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.260
think earlier on in our
career right now in the WNBA,

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:43.370
we have women that understand
their place is also role models

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.716
and wanting to set an
example for the future.

01:10:46.716 --> 01:10:48.840
Whereas if you look back
when the NBA started out--

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.750
which was on tape delay, we
have a TV deal right now--

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:54.136
but they started 20
years in and there

01:10:54.136 --> 01:10:56.010
was a lot of stuff that
happened with the NBA

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:57.810
before it got to where it's at.

01:10:57.810 --> 01:10:59.380
People forget that.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.290
So I think in its
infancy for me,

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.570
I just want to see women's
sports continue to grow

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.480
and be the best that it can be.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.400
- I also think
that while men's--

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.720
I would never encourage bullying
and anything on that extreme,

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.660
I think that competition is
something that women should not

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.340
shy away from.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.700
And I think in your
comment it to me

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:25.900
implied that women should
be happy all the time

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.950
and always get along.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.800
No-- I think that one of the
best things about sport for me

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.620
was learning how to
fail and learning how

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.390
to receive negative feedback.

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.932
I think those are
two of the biggest

01:11:36.932 --> 01:11:38.140
lessons I learned from sport.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.974
My college coach was not
nice to me a lot of the time.

01:11:40.974 --> 01:11:41.640
- Join the club.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.510
- And I learned a lot from that.

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.220
I am a much stronger person
today and a much better rower

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.040
because of that.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.590
And I think not being
handled with gloves--

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:58.180
like you can't just
handle with gloves

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.221
because they're a female.

01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:01.780
I think it's OK to be
brutal and be honest.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.310
And occasionally we need that.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:06.460
I think sports is
an environment where

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.700
it's in a venue of it's own.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.890
My college coach wouldn't
be mean to me because

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:13.630
of who I am as a person.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:17.980
She would be harsh because
I was rowing incorrectly.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.850
And I think being able
to separate those two

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:24.070
and have an environment
in which you can learn

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:26.380
those lessons of
failure and criticism

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.550
in a healthy environment
is really important.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.710
And I don't think that
something being hard, or tough,

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:35.920
or failure is anything
that we should

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.870
try to correct about
women's sports.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:40.120
It shouldn't be a happy go
lucky, we love the team,

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.660
we're going to win all the time.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.660
Because then you're not
going to learn anything.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.450
I think there is something
about the harshness of sport

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:48.520
which is why we're here today.

01:12:51.304 --> 01:12:54.080
- Title IX is not
just about sports too.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.670
That's another thing.

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:57.439
This whole thing was--

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.730
there was a point to it, right?

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.250
This was about equality
of opportunity, right?

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.790
And so it's sports, it's
activities, it's programming.

01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.540
We're talking about
the context of sports.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.260
But make no mistake about it--
we get too few women in STEM.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.360
There's a lot of work we need
to do on a lot of fronts.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.000
And Title IX is there,
needs to be enforced,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.320
needs to be supported.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.320
But let's recognize too
that the goal of this

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:27.530
was really about
equality of opportunity.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.182
- So my question is
unintentionally related.

01:13:30.182 --> 01:13:31.640
I think in the last
couple of years

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.180
you've seen a growth
and a rise in women

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:38.320
in leadership and coaching
in men's sports teams.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.990
What role do you think
that kind of presence

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.210
in sport in general and
visibility on that level

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.444
plays in relation
to this as well?

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:51.550
- It's great.

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:54.280
I think it reflects that
more women are in sport,

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.617
and that they don't see a
barrier to participating

01:13:59.617 --> 01:14:01.450
in men's sports, and
they're not intimidated

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.158
by trying to participate
in men's sports.

01:14:03.158 --> 01:14:04.750
And I think some
of that confidence

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:07.550
is probably from being
an athlete themselves--

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.550
that's just a guess,
I don't know that.

01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:12.520
But I think youth--

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.659
as Shira said, there are so many
men coaching women's sports,

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:17.200
why not have it the
other way around.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.880
Women approach the game
differently, as Swin said.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.830
So if women are better at
these behind the back passes

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.700
and three pointers, why not have
a woman coaching a men's team?

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.200
That's something they might be
able to contribute to a men's

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.170
team, change the game so you're
seeing it from another angle.

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.341
And it can only
benefit everyone.

01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:34.840
- Yeah.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.710
And I always say when you
think about a women's team

01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:42.190
and they hire a male
coach, they never

01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.780
get the why are they hiring
a male coach to coach

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.610
this women's team,
this is crazy.

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:48.010
They never get that.

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:51.790
But as soon as you hear
the potential for a woman

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:53.710
to coach in the NBA,
people are, that's

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:56.350
ridiculous, why would a
woman coach in the NBA.

01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.360
Well right now you
have Becky Hammon who's

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.130
on the staff with the Spurs.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:03.700
But Adam Silver, the
commissioner of the NBA,

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.340
recently said, I expect for--

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.300
at some point soon for
a woman to be coaching--

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.280
a head coach in the NBA.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.780
I'm just waiting
for us to equal out

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.170
on a collegiate level,
high school level.

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:17.930
We might get to--

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.810
the pros may have
it before we start

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:21.140
talking about it on that level.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.080
And I think that's
what we need to stop

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.540
looking at the
male versus woman,

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:29.530
and start thinking about
what kind of coach are you,

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.990
and give more women these
opportunities because they

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.370
can coach.

01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:34.967
I know some women
that know football

01:15:34.967 --> 01:15:37.300
better than some of the coaches
they got on their staff.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.237
And I'd be like go get her.

01:15:40.237 --> 01:15:42.820
So I think that's an area that
you're hitting right on that we

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.010
need to look at as well
when we talk about Title

01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.040
IX and those issues.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.790
- You bring up Becky
Hammon and the Spurs.

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:50.498
And I think one of
the interesting things

01:15:50.498 --> 01:15:52.990
about that situation is that
it's Greg Popovich who's

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.830
considered to be the
best NBA coach around

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.530
and that he's saying
she's qualified,

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:02.140
I want her on my
staff, I want her front

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.230
and center sitting on the bench
and instructing my players.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:08.182
And I think that's another
important part of the equation.

01:16:08.182 --> 01:16:10.265
What I loved about the
opening weekend of the WNBA

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:12.370
is you had a lot
of the NBA players

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:15.590
coming out and saying how
much they love the WNBA game.

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:17.500
So I think that's
another side of it

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.510
too where we have to have--

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:21.440
we can't ignore the men.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.630
You know they have to be part
of the support in driving people

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:26.800
towards the women's game.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.320
Can't just be women
buying the jerseys.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.980
It has to be the men and people
like Greg Popovich saying, hey,

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.240
this is quality right here.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.260
- But also too
think about this--

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.494
whether it's in college--

01:16:40.494 --> 01:16:42.160
and you know this as
well-- whether it's

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.390
in college or pros, when your
athletes, your student athlete,

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.280
male and female, they
talk to each other

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.850
and you support each other.

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.030
We don't get that
kind of divisiveness.

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:55.090
A lot of times it's the
people who didn't play sports

01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.230
or now you're covering sports
and you have these opinions.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.400
But I go to the
Olympics and it's

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.500
all of the athletes
supporting each other.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.660
It's our men and women's
basketball team literally

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.260
supporting each other.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.920
We get text messages from
some of our NBA friends

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.780
that are watching the game.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.900
And it's like other people
who are covering our sport

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.980
need the men's invalidate
the fact that we're good.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.766
And I'm like, no, we're good.

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.570
You just haven't caught up yet.

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:27.160
And I think that unfortunately
that's the reality of it.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.570
And we live in that space.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.380
And I say it all the
time, I get tweets

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.560
and I get social media from guys
that I guarantee you probably

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.260
couldn't run up and
down the court one time

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.620
but he's criticized every single
thing about what a woman did

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.580
and how she plays.

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.880
And I'm like, you didn't even
play intramurals, did you?

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.990
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:48.150
You didn't really.

01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:49.260
But that's what happens.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:49.990
So yeah.

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.737
I'm sorry, go on.

01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:52.070
Sometimes I can vent about that.

01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.998
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:54.998 --> 01:17:55.980
- Hi.

01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.210
I was actually a plaintiff
on that Brown case.

01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:04.740
So thank you for acknowledging
that very complex experience

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.420
for a freshman in college.

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:09.550
- Hi, Jennifer--

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:10.560
Jennifer [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.175
- I'm also a full-time
working mom of three

01:18:14.175 --> 01:18:17.550
in a male-dominated industry.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:24.330
I sit in a lot of panels like
this thinking about action.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.440
I'm actually optimistic.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.065
But I'm also frustrated
because I think

01:18:27.065 --> 01:18:28.740
we have a lot still to do.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.080
And there's opportunity,
and exposure,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.360
and continuing the
conversation, and equal pay.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.170
And it's like where do we start.

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:42.250
And I would love to know your
opinion on what do you go back

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.690
and do right after this panel.

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:47.590
Because I know I have my own
answers to that question.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:51.980
But where do we start and how--

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:56.000
where do we make the
most impact right away?

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.420
- One thing--
everything is local.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:07.450
So look at your kid's
school, mm know look

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.420
at what's going on there for
programming and opportunity.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.100
Is it equal or is it not equal?

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.000
What do we need to do?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.030
Look at what's
happening at work.

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:21.040
When I started, I did
a training in my office

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.480
on unconscious bias.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.980
I think every
employer in this state

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:26.020
should be doing a training
on unconscious bias.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.550
Every employer in
the state ought

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:29.920
to have programs on
diversity and inclusion.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.740
If you're in a workplace,
ask that of your employer

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:35.350
or form a group to
go to your employer

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:39.700
and demand that kind of
action and assessment.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:42.550
We passed an equal pay
law here in Massachusetts.

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:46.690
Make sure that your employer
is actually enforcing that

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:49.000
and paying attention to that.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And I think the point
about where you invest--

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.630
are you taking kids to
see women and girls, say,

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.020
in sports-- and this is a
sports-specific comment.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.970
But are you taking
them to games,

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.830
are you exposing them to games?

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:04.930
If they're interested, are
you exposing-- not just

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:07.030
girls, boys most
importantly, are

01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:11.830
you exposing your young boys,
or nephews, or grandchildren

01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:13.420
to women's athletics?

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.390
When you go into the bar or
restaurant later on tonight

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:19.750
or this week and there--
try this on, it's fun--

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.840
make them watch-- you guys
play what night, Thursday?

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.610
- Yep, Thursday.

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:26.910
- Flip that channel over, OK.

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.090
- ESPN2.

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:30.216
- And make them watch ESPN2.

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:31.112
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:31.112 --> 01:20:33.870
And just find ways
to act locally.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:37.320
Where can you bring this
and where can you subtly

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.650
raise and elevate attention
and grow awareness.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:45.210
Those are some things that I
think about to start anyways.

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.900
- Yeah, no, I totally agree.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:50.654
The first thing I did
whenever I retired--

01:20:50.654 --> 01:20:52.070
and even during
my playing career,

01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.770
but when I retired, I tried
to figure out where could I

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.620
reach my hands out to,
where do the tentacles go

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.690
that I'm able to touch
the people around me.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.280
And that's who I
want to affect first.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.529
Because then I know they're
going to touch the next 10

01:21:04.529 --> 01:21:05.730
people out there.

01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:07.590
And just try to have
change every day.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.730
Because I think the small--

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.190
sometimes you-- we think
about the big picture

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:12.640
and it's overwhelming.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.910
But if I think about
within our organization

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.040
am I changing
someone's mindset, am

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.320
I helping them see
something differently,

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.110
am I invested in
pouring into our players

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:25.452
so that they're becoming better
leaders so that they can go out

01:21:25.452 --> 01:21:26.910
there and be able
to speak and talk

01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.350
about these different topics.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.030
Do they know their
history enough

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.740
to be able to speak on it?

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.486
Small things like that I
think are so important.

01:21:34.486 --> 01:21:35.610
That's where you can start.

01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:37.935
Because every day you're
going to get up and feel good

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.810
that, you know what,
I'm chucking away at it,

01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:40.920
I'm chucking away at it.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.470
Until you get in a
room like this and we

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:45.060
all have the same goals.

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:48.940
And then that's when you
really just have a big impact.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.570
- I think social media makes it
really easy in some senses too.

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:54.330
I think when you read stories
about the US women's hockey

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.950
team or the US
women's soccer team,

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.200
post, re-post, share
it with their people.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.780
Make sure that that link
in The Times or The Globe

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.775
is clicked on and it
comes up in the five read

01:22:03.775 --> 01:22:04.650
headlines of the day.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:09.270
Just promote women's sports
and women in general.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:11.770
- Demand that your community
newspapers put women--

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:14.147
girls-- on the sports pages, OK?

01:22:14.147 --> 01:22:15.730
You can all pay
attention to that too.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:18.280
- Right.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.590
- Hi.

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:23.510
I just have a suggestion.

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:27.980
I am all for all
this we want this,

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.630
we want that, we want that.

01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:31.730
But where is the action?

01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:33.350
And I have taken time--

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:36.080
I think the most important
thing in any kind of business--

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.140
because sports is a
business, it's money,

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:42.020
at the end of the day
it's an economic question.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.780
And every time you
have limited resources,

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:47.150
there's going to be two
forces at least fighting

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.540
for those resources.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.590
In order to get them, the person
who has them in their hands

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:57.610
has to release them
either because they're

01:22:57.610 --> 01:23:01.090
going to get something out
of what they're giving it to

01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:04.180
or because the other
party has found out

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.850
how they're going to get
those resources from them.

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:12.810
Sports runs on endorsement
funding and sponsorship deals.

01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:16.180
And a lot of times
that has already

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.190
gone to the male sports.

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:20.860
I think the women's
sports should go back

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.570
to a drawing board--

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:28.510
how do we invite and sustain
funding in women's sports

01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:30.250
at a micro level?

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:33.124
We want to go for big funding.

01:23:33.124 --> 01:23:34.540
For example, I'll
give an example.

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.820
Boston Breakers has
just announced today

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.890
they got Dunkin' Donuts
on board for them,

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:40.800
which is a big achievement.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.330
But that doesn't
happen every day.

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:45.940
But I looked at their packages--

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.860
anybody with $5,000 can
not invest as a partner

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.470
in the Boston Breakers.

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:56.350
And a lot of people are
tired of being consumers.

01:23:56.350 --> 01:24:00.640
They want to have a vested
interest in our team.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.440
They want to be stockholders
or stakeholders in a team.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:10.750
If we would give opportunities
to mothers and smaller funders

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:15.010
to come in as stockholders,
just like startups operate,

01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:17.290
and allow this to
grow, eventually

01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:22.060
if somebody has put their
time in a team, rain or shine

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.306
they're showing up.

01:24:24.306 --> 01:24:27.740
They're going to make sure there
is a buzz in the newspaper,

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.370
they're going to make sure
every politician in that area

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:32.554
is paying attention
to what's happening,

01:24:32.554 --> 01:24:34.220
they're going to hold
them accountable--

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.430
if you do not pay
attention to my team,

01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:38.080
I'm not giving you my vote.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.120
So ultimately it
comes down to are

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:45.070
you allowing this person to own
a portion of women's sports.

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:47.440
And that's what I think we
should take from this level.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.281
Thank you.

01:24:49.281 --> 01:24:52.263
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:52.263 --> 01:24:54.720
- I think that's an
interesting concept.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.960
And I'll just wrap up this
panel with this thought.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.410
When we were organizing this,
I was emailing some people

01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:04.560
I know in the community,
some longtime head

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.850
coaches of women's sports.

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:09.870
And one of them was a woman
who has coached forever

01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:12.510
in Massachusetts high
school athletics--

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:13.232
[INAUDIBLE]

01:25:13.232 --> 01:25:14.690
I don't know if
she's here tonight.

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:16.690
She said she was going to come.

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:18.640
But she said to me,
well, couple of things.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.830
First of all, I think I played
basketball in this gym way

01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:24.840
back when once upon a time.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.650
And she said, also, I'm
really happy that you're

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:33.020
organizing an event like this
because it's about vigilance.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.950
And it's about
vigilance not just

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:38.670
when it's the 45th anniversary
of Title IX coming up,

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.310
or when we're gearing
up for an Olympic year

01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:44.610
and women seem to take center
stage in Olympic years,

01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:46.760
or when there's a Women's
World Cup going on.

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.230
And I think that's an
important takeaway, which

01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:50.250
is it's about vigilance.

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:52.380
It's about having
conversations like this

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.440
all the time, year
round, every year.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.710
And it doesn't have to be
a special anniversary year.

01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:01.020
It should just be.

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.210
And with that, I would
like to again thank

01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:05.910
Radcliffe, and WBUR,
and two special people--

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:10.410
Amy McDonald and Becky Wassarman
who have been by my side as we

01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:13.140
took this from
conception to reality.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.927
So thank you and thank
