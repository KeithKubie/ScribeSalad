00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.070
You remember prime numbers right?

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.410
Numbers that can only be evenly divided by
one and themselves?

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.560
Well it turns out finding prime numbers is
not only useful for protecting data, but it

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.350
could make you money!

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.560
On December 26th, 2017, the largest prime
number ever discovered was found by Jonathan

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.009
Pace of Germantown, Tennessee.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.539
The number is over 23 million digits long,
meaning I don’t really have time in this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.420
video or my entire life to list the whole
thing out, but it’s easier to call it by

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.140
its nickname, M77232917.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.960
It gets this name because that’s the exponent
you raise 2 by to find it.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.170
Oh, and don’t forget to subtract one when
you’re done multiplying 77,232,917 twos

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.170
together.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.910
Otherwise you just created a number you can
divide by two and you’ll have wasted all

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.910
that time.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.950
Prime numbers found this way, by raising two
by a prime exponent and subtracting one, are

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.520
called Mersenne primes, named for a 17th century
French friar, hence the capital “M” in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.720
the shorthand name.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.190
3 is a Mersenne prime, since it’s two to
the second power minus one.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.680
Same for 7, which is two to the third power
minus one.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.650
But the exponent has to be prime.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.360
Two to the sixth power minus one is 63, which
is divisible by 3 so, not a prime.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.020
9 of the 10 largest primes found to date are
Mersenne primes, not because they’re the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.400
most common -- the Prime Number theorem tells
us there must be a simply huge number of undiscovered

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.140
primes between this newly found one and the
next largest Mersenne prime -- but we find

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.600
them because that’s how we keep searching
for them.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.860
In fact you can be a part of the search for
the next one!

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.070
You don’t even have to do the math yourself,
just some software provided by the Great Internet

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.570
Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS!

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.780
The software uses the idle processing power
of your CPU to run what’s called the Lucas-Lehmer

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.630
test, where Mersenne numbers are checked against
a specific set of numbers.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.930
If the Mersenne number you’re checking divides
evenly into a certain number in that set,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.320
then it passes the test and is indeed a prime
number.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.869
Obviously it takes quite a bit of horsepower
to see if a 23 million digit number divides

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.390
into an even bigger number, which is why the
project needs the public’s help.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.680
Almost 200,000 users are running the GIMPS
software and if their PC runs a number that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.010
passes the test, they could win money.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.760
Pace is eligible for a $3,000 prize, and whoever
finds a 100 million digit prime could win

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
$150,000 dollars.It’s like cryptocurrency
mining for those of us that can’t afford

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.210
to buy a dozen graphics cards.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.990
You may wonder why we bother searching for
primes at all?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.700
Why for the glory, of course!

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.989
We’ve only found 50 Mersenne Primes and
next to almost every one of them is the finder’s

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.280
name for all of nerdy eternity.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.310
Plus prime numbers play a crucial role in
keeping data secure.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.790
One standard, RSA encryption, relies on multiplying
two large prime numbers together to generate

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.790
a key.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.240
Knowing the two primes that went into the
key is the secret to decrypting the data,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.209
but it takes an impractical amount of computational
power and time to suss out what those numbers

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.240
are if you don’t already know them.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.170
So the key can be public and your data is
still secure.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.990
Of course since the Mersenne primes we’ve
been finding lately are tens of millions of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.430
digits long, these may not be the best candidates
for encryption.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.910
If you see a key that’s an absolutely huge
number, it won’t be hard to guess which

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.800
Mersenne prime went into it.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.570
Gigantic primes won’t be useful until quantum
computing is used to break RSA encryption,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.500
and even then we may just use a different
method of protecting data.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.490
So there may not be much practical use in
searching for Mersenne primes, aside from

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.280
winning that $150,000 for running a program
while you watch youtube.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.510
I gotta download that software when I get
home.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.450
Before you run off and download GIMPS, go
ahead and subscribe.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.209
And for more math, find out how ham sandwiches
are helping us understand the universe, here.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.019
The largest prime found by hand is M127, so
we’re obviously a bit past that by now.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.620
Until next time, I’m Julian, don’t forget
to share that sweet prize money with me when

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.639
you win.
