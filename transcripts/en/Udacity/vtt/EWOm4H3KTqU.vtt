00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now as a reminder, polarization occurs when we bring a charged object

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
next to an uncharged conductor and allow the charges to separate

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because the negatives are charged to the positive and the positives are repelled.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, I want to do something a little different, something that we haven't done before.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I want you to really think creatively here and tell me how can we use this idea of polarization

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to create a charged object or maybe to create two charged objects?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can start to see here that it looks like there should be a way

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to create something that's charged here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Maybe one, maybe two objects that are charged but I leave it up to you to enter into this box

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
what you think would be the best way to create charged objects using this polarization idea.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you think you have a particularly clever method, you should go to the form and share it there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Since I'm so confident that you can tell me this answer on your own,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not going to tell you at all but if the anticipation is just killing you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and you need to know if your method is right, which I bet it is,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you can go ahead and look up charging by induction.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Go ahead and enter your answer here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Don't worry, you'll be marked correct regardless of what you put

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but I hope put some time to this and I'll be going over and looking for some clever ways

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to charge an object using this idea of polarization.
