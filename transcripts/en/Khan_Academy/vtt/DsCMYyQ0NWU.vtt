00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:02.417
- [Voiceover] Nitrogen
often gets less attention

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:06.174
than carbon or oxygen, but nitrogen is

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:08.851
very important to life as well.

00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:13.018
And like carbon and oxygen, it
cycles through our biosphere.

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:17.743
Now, one thing that's maybe
surprising about nitrogen,

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:19.142
if you haven't studied it much,

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:22.587
is that it is very, very
common in our atmosphere.

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:26.670
78% of our atmosphere
is molecular nitrogen,

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:29.874
so it's in the form of N2.

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:31.766
So this right over here
is molecular nitrogen.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.933
You have two nitrogen atoms
covalently bonded to each other.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:41.809
Now, unlike carbon, which can
be directly fixed by plants,

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.537
in the carbon cycle video we talk about

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:46.695
how autotrophs like plants
can take light energy

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:49.288
and use that to fix carbon from the air

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:51.814
into a solid form and store that energy

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.158
in those carbon-carbon bonds,

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.934
nitrogen cannot be directly fixed

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.944
by complex organisms, like plants.

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:04.235
Instead, the key actor that
fixes the nitrogen from the air,

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:08.462
so you have all of these N2
molecules in the air here,

00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:10.995
the actors here aren't plants,

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:14.094
but prokaryotes, like bacteria.

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:15.921
So let me draw some soil here.

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:18.447
And the bacteria could be in
a bunch of different places.

00:01:18.447 --> 00:01:22.030
But you could have a
bacteria in this soil.

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.711
I'll draw them a little bit
bigger so you can see it.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.601
Some prokaryotes right over
here, there's the bacteria.

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.660
And certain types of bacteria are capable,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.511
and prokaryotes are
capable of fixing nitrogen.

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.443
So what they're able
to do, is they're able

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:41.135
to take that N2 and turn it into a form

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:45.412
that is more usable by
complex organisms like plants.

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:49.256
So this is the bacteria, right over here.

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.656
So that's the bacteria.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.298
That's this little circular strand of DNA,

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:53.131
I could draw other--

00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:55.488
I could make it more complicated,

00:01:55.488 --> 00:01:56.901
but let me just do it like this.

00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.484
Bacteria is able to fix that N2

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.016
and take it to ammonia, NH3.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.800
And it's this ammonia, it's this ammonia,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.453
that is really useful for plants

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:13.414
and other complex organisms.

00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:15.249
So this right over here.

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.563
So as the plant in the
video on the carbon cycle

00:02:18.563 --> 00:02:20.729
we talk about how plants fix carbon,

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.476
carbon makes up a large
part of organic molecules,

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.877
but many important organic molecules

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:29.604
also need nitrogen.

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:32.406
And these are examples
of organic molecules

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:33.713
that you will find in plants,

00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:36.145
and you'll find them in many
different types of organisms.

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:39.562
So this right over here is an amino acid,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.718
amino acid,

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.607
we see the nitrogen right over there.

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:48.768
This right over here is
our good old friend, ATP,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:53.176
adenosine triphosphate,
the quick-store of energy

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.041
in biological systems.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.042
You see the nitrogen in
blue right over here.

00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.959
This is the famous DNA,

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.089
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:08.482
And you see the nitrogens
throughout this macro molecule.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:10.848
So nitrogen is essential for life,

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:13.983
but the step of fixing that nitrogen

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:17.254
that's done by bacteria, which
can then produce the ammonia,

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.531
which is then usable by plants,

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:22.828
and then by eating the
plants, beings like you and me

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:26.269
can get that nitrogen into our systems.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.757
Now, it's not just a one-way street.

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.203
That is, we're just
going from the nitrogen

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:33.557
in the atmosphere, and it
gets fixed by prokaryotes,

00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:35.599
and then that gets used--

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.893
that gets turned into ammonia

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.756
and gets used by higher organisms.

00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:42.660
Because eventually all of
it would, would get deleted.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.077
As an organism dies, as an organism dies,

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:48.321
let's say this is a dead organism,

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:49.400
it could be a bacteria, but I'll go

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.379
with a higher organism,
a multi-cellular one,

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.824
this is a dead plant here,

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:56.186
I don't want to draw dead
animals, it's more morbid.

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:58.363
So let's say this is a dead plant there.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.231
And when it gets decomposed,

00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:03.015
and there are many
different types of bacteria,

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.888
even though I might draw them
kind of looking the same,

00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:07.865
let's say this is another
bacteria in orange.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:10.264
As these bacteria digest these plants,

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:13.458
they're able to, they could
take some of the nitrogen

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.121
and break them down into
nitrites and nitrates,

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.117
these are molecules
involving a nitrogen bonded

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.117
to two or three oxygens,

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.516
and they can take them back to ammonia.

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:28.906
So we can go back, so
we can have a bacteria

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:30.419
that take us back to ammonia,

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.242
or eventually by converting the nitrogen

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:35.285
into nitrites and
nitrates, we could go back

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:39.452
we could go back to that
molecular nitrogen, that N2.

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:45.353
That then gets released
back into the atmosphere.

00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:48.190
So, or it could get, even, you know,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.248
it could get stored in other ways as well.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.820
But, in general, as you
see here, this pattern.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.205
That we have these elements
that are essential for life.

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:59.410
They don't just disappear
or form out of nowhere,

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.535
they're constantly being
recycled in our biosphere.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.436
And nitrogen doesn't get as much attention

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:09.975
as carbon or oxygen, but
it is essential for life.

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.058
In fact, when you look at

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.120
especially plants and growing plants,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.101
and you think about fertilizer.

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:17.566
Fertilizer is something
that you should think

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:20.093
if you add it to a plant,
it's going to grow more.

00:05:20.093 --> 00:05:23.197
So without it, it kind of limits
how fast a plant can grow,

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.508
a lot of fertilizer is
going to have nitrogen,

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:27.679
and in other video, we're going
to talk about phosphorous.

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:29.548
And that phosphorous and nitrogen

00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:32.010
and their availability in the soil,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.754
is often a rate-limiting
factor for plants.

00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:37.271
And you know that, because
if you add more nitrogen

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.056
or that phosphorous, it will
add more ammonia to that soil,

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:43.223
you're going to, the plants
are going to grow faster.
