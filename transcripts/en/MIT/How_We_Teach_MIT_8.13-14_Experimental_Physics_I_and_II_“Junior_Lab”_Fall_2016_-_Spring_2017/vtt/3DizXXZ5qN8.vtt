ATISSA BANUAZIZI: In this
class, the WRAP instructors

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.730
don't participate
directly in the grading

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.550
of those presentations.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.250
We serve more as coaches.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
And that can be sort of
helpful for the students,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.870
because they come to us, and
we're completely on their team.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.220
We are there not to tell
them what they did wrong,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.020
but to help them make it better.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.340
So I mentioned that we don't
participate in the grading

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.370
of the actual presentations.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.400
The meetings that
they have with us

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.340
are factored into their
grade to a degree.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.970
They get a certain number
of participation points

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.250
for coming and
actively participating

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.820
in the meetings with us.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.110
One nice thing about the way
that the class is administered

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.160
is that the WRAP instructors
are present at the final grading

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.180
meetings.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900
And we do give input
into how we see

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
the progress that the
individual students have made.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.500
And so sometimes,
we can really speak

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.280
to the particular challenges
that the students have

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.630
overcome, the way in which
that they have really applied

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.340
themselves to do better.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.550
And that can be a not
insignificant part

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.839
of the conversation.
