00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:19.600
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
is an institution known and respected the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.330
world over for its relative impartiality and
objectivity compared to many other news sources,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.300
with numerous surveys showing that the BBC
is one of the most trusted sources of news

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.870
in both the UK and the US. But we’re not
here to talk about that. We’re here to talk

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.840
about dinner jackets, Received Pronunciation,
the Nazis, and what all of this has to do

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.190
with the BBC News.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.800
Back when the BBC was first launched in 1922,
the first General Manager of the corporation,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.840
Scottish engineer Sir John Reith, was insistent
that the BBC be as formal and quintessentially

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.630
British as possible, and he created a number
of rules towards this end. (Fun fact: Reith

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.180
had no experience with anything related to
broadcasting when he applied to manage the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.199
BBC).

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.680
One thing in particular Reith stressed when
he first helmed the BBC is that the newscasters

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.110
spoke the “King’s English“, known today
as “BBC English” or more technically “Received

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.360
Pronunciation”, as he felt it was “a style
or quality of English that would not be laughed

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.330
at in any part of the country”. Reith was
also aware that the broadcasts might be played

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.390
abroad and felt that a regional accent would
be difficult for non-Britain’s to understand.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.459
Reith also noted,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.690
We have made a special effort to secure in
our stations men who, in the presentation

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.030
of program items, the reading of news bulletins
and so on, can be relied upon to employ the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.600
correct pronunciation of the English tongue…
I have frequently heard that disputes as to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.450
the right pronunciation of words have been
settled by reference of the manner in which

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.390
they have been spoken on the wireless. No
one would deny the great advantage of a standard

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.349
pronunciation of the language, not only in
theory but in practice. Our responsibilities

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.950
in this matter are obvious, since in talking
to so vast a multitude, mistakes are likely

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.180
to be promulgated to a much greater extent
than was ever possible before.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.770
Further, in the 1929 BBC Handbook, it was
noted that their pronunciation guidelines

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.990
in this matter “[are] not to be regarded
as implying that all other pronunciations

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.170
are wrong: the recommendations are made in
order to ensure uniformity of practice, and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
to protect the Announcers from the criticism
to which the very peculiar nature of their

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.890
work renders them liable.”

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.880
As for Received Pronunciation or RP as it’s
often abbreviated to, it is defined as: “The

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.030
standard form of British English pronunciation”
(Though, funny enough, RP is only used by

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.380
an estimated 2-3% of English people today,
with the number of Scottish, Irish and Welsh

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.470
users being described as “negligible”.)

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.900
First defined in 1869 by linguist, A. J. Ellis,
Received Pronunciation basically entails pronouncing

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.680
your words “properly” as they are written
in the dictionary.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.180
Although the general idea behind Received
Pronunciation is to attempt to remove a person’s

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.710
regional accent, it is nonetheless commonly
associated with the south of England and the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.840
upper class. Meaning that although Received
Pronunciation masks a person’s regional

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.280
background, it says a lot about a person’s
social upbringing and how they were educated.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.120
With this in mind, although one of Reith’s
goals in using RP was to appeal to the widest

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.800
audience possible, many listeners still felt
alienated by the broadcasts being beamed into

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.720
their homes because of this “upper class”
accent being used. Despite this, newscasters

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.080
were required to use Received Pronunciation
right up until World War 2.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.460
Why did this change during the war? The Ministry
of Information was worried about the Nazis

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.240
hijacking the radio waves.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.990
You see, during World War 2, Nazi Germany
invested a lot of time and money in training

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.520
its spies and propagandists to speak using
perfect Received Pronunciation so that they

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.320
could effectively pass as Brits. Thus, the
Ministry of Information became quite concerned

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.120
that the Nazis could potentially issue orders
over the radio in a voice that would be indistinguishable

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.020
from one of their own newscasters. In addition,
the then Deputy Prime Minister, Clement Attlee,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.979
noted the aforementioned fact that the total
monopoly newscasters with upper class sounding

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.490
voices had on the news was offensive to the
working class.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.490
This image of newsreaders being stuffy, upper
class toffs wasn’t helped by an edict passed

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.130
down in 1926 from Reith that stated any newscaster
reading the news after 8PM had to wear a dinner

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.449
jacket while on air, despite that no one could
see them. Former BBC radio personality Stuart

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.949
Hibberd noted of this,

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.639
Personally, I have always thought it only
right and proper that announcers should wear

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.560
evening dress on duty… There are, of course,
certain disadvantages. It is not ideal kit

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.449
in which to read the News- I myself hate having
anything tight around my neck when broadcasting-

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.580
and I remember that more than once the engineers
said that my shirt-front creaked during the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.419
reading of the bulletin. (This- is London,
1950)

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.699
In any event, as a result of the concerns
of Attlee and the Ministry of Information,

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.270
the BBC hired several newscasters possessing
broad regional accents that would be more

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.949
difficult for Nazis to perfectly copy and
would hopefully appeal to the “common man”.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.669
The first person to read the news on the BBC
possessing a regional accent was one Wilfred

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.939
Pickles, who spoke with a broad Yorkshire
accent. Far from being a popular move, when

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.629
Pickles was hired by the BBC in 1941, his
accent offended many listeners so much that

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.340
they wrote letters to the BBC, blasting them
for having the audacity to sully the news

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.710
with the (smooth, sensual sounds of the amazing
and superior) Yorkshireman’s voice. (Fun

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.960
fact: The author of this piece has the same
accent… No big deal.)

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.309
In fact, by 1949, Pickles himself noted that
because of his accent, he had become the “central

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:09.719
feature in a heated national controversy”,
during which Pickles was frequently made fun

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.550
of by various London cartoonists and in other
forms of popular media.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.909
Nonetheless, after the end of World War 2,
the BBC continued to loosen its guidelines

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.499
and with the advent of more localised news,
began to hire more people who spoke with the

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.680
respective accent of the region they were
being broadcast.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.029
That said, the BBC does continue to generally
use newscasters with more mild accents in

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:44.379
international broadcasts to make sure they
are as understandable as possible to those

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.800
audiences.
