00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.439
Disney films have made great strides in their
portrayal of women, from the entirely domestic

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.119
and dependent Snow White in 1937

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.700
to the adventurous
and unconstrained Merida in 2012.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.700
It’s hard. to go a single day on the Internet without
finding yet another blog post about the free-spirited

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.690
women in Disney movies, especially the Disney
Princesses. They all praise Disney movies

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.059
for making great steps towards women’s rights
in our society. But who cares? These are just

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.019
movies. Shouldn’t we stop relying on fictional
storytelling to comment on reality? I want

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.010
to argue that film is in fact one of the best
methods of commenting on a society, and a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.010
Disney Princess can have more influence on
a society than any politician or leader.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.769
Every popular film, to some extent, conforms
with the society it was made in. Think about

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.770
it. If a movie was released this year that
generalized all African Americans as unintelligent

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.240
and sexually aggressive towards women and
also made out the Klu Klux Klan as heroes,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.440
would it be a commercial success? Probably
not. That wouldn’t conform to the values

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.500
of our present society. But in the early 1900’s,
this kind of film could be a critical hit

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.179
because that society conformed to those believes.
And it was. In 1915, “The Birth of a Nation”

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.580
was released and became the highest grossing
film of the year despite generalizing African

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.520
Americans as unintelligent and the KKK as
heroes. What I’m saying is, people don’t

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.910
like seeing movies that greatly contradict
their views, so the most commercially successful

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.830
movies generally avoid so much controversy
that nobody pays to see the movie. In other

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.330
words, commercially successful movies are
a commentary on what the popular beliefs were

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.060
at the time of its making. Of course, there
are plenty of thought-provoking, society-critiquing

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.360
movies out there, but we certainly don’t
see them topping the box office. So where

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.030
do the Disney Princesses fit into this? Disney
produces some of the most popular films of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.860
all time, with 13 of the 25 highest grossing
films in history from the Walt Disney Corporation.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.989
The Disney Princess films are some of their
most successful. Let’s take a look at how

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.569
Disney films conform with the societies they
were made in.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.739
Snow White takes place in Germany in the 1500’s,
but it’s very much a portrayal of life for

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.670
women in America when it was made in 1937.
Women at this time were taught that their

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.420
place was in the home, and Snow White is a
perfect representation of that view. For her,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.319
a home is the only safe place. The outside
world is scary, her safety is in a house where

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.170
she feeds, cooks, and cleans for others, and
her life is eventually saved by a man. Snow

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.660
White is more telling a description of the
societal perceptions of women at that time

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.550
than any textbook. Through fiction, we get
a taste of reality.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.310
Ariel reflects society's portrayal of women
during the creation of The Little Mermaid.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.670
In 1989, America has accepted the deviation
from the “Nuclear Family” and a women’s

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.050
role outside of the home. Ariel leaves her
home, the ocean, in search for her destiny.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.480
But what is she in search for? A man. 1989
America still believes a woman’s main goal

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.700
is to find a husband and start a family. Society
has not yet reached the milestone of seeing

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.490
women independent of a man, and that is reflected
in the popular cinema of that era.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.420
Merida in Brave shows society's current view
of women. She is fierce, independent, and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.450
doesn’t need a man. In fact, she outperforms
other men in her world. In our society, we

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.319
now recognize that women can do anything a
man can do AND don’t need men in their lives

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.850
to be happy. Women can now choose their own
fate.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.170
When you see a film, it may take place in
the past, or the distant future, but the film

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.370
is always subtly commenting about the society
it was made in. Wall-E is about a future where

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.069
humans had to escape an inhabitable planet,
but it’s really a commentary about how we

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.290
mistreat the environment today. Mulan takes
place in ancient China but is about how masculine

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.959
qualities are not exclusive to men in our
current society.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.709
So heres a question. Films are influenced
by society’s views, but can society’s

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.630
views be influenced by film? They reach such
a wide audience and can provide such powerful

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.400
messages that they change society’s views
in radical ways. Like when Jaws led to a huge

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.280
drop in beach tourism, when men started forming
their own fight clubs, or when a movie inspires

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.370
some southerners to bring back the KKK. Philadelphia
is such an important film because it was the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.459
first big production to portray a man with
the HIV virus and was a major inspiration

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.819
for the founding of an international AIDS
awareness association in 1997. Philadelphia

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.260
touched the hearts of Americans and brought
an awareness to the struggles of the disease

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.960
in a way a simple awareness campaign never
could have.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.380
What makes Disney Princesses so important
is that they’re marketed towards families

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.410
and especially children. Children, specifically
girls, idolize these princesses. They dress

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.680
up like them. They mimic them. They act just
like them. Don’t we want to raise girls

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.239
who become women with strong views of themselves?
If Disney Princesses present demeaning, domesticating

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.280
values for women, then women will become that
through mimicking that behavior. Disney Princesses

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.720
shape the character of the children that watch
because girls want to be the princess they

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.460
see on screen. So what character should we
show them?

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:28.939
Thanks for watching.
