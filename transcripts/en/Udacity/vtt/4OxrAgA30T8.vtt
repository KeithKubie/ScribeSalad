00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.890
So we saw that if we ask these three questions. Well

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.250
we needed three questions to be sure that we will find the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.090
gold star, by opening box, but we don't need three questions.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.930
If we are little smarter about our questions, we only need 2.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.680
And the way to do it in 2 questions is to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.290
ask for questions that gives us more information. So the problem with

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.590
asking the Is it in the green box? question first

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
Is that 3/4 of the time, the answer is no.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.200
And if we're trying to use yes, no questions. Or we're trying to

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.750
use bits to get as much information as possible, what we want to do

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.760
is ask questions where the answer is equally likely to be yes as

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.530
it is to be no. We want a question where half the time the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.850
answer is yes and half the time the answer is no. If the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.660
question isn't like that, so if it's a question where it's no more

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.800
often than it's yes, well then we could guess the answer is no

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.710
and be right more than half the time. So we're not getting a full

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.850
bit of information in the result, because we had a good chance

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.580
of being right without getting that answer. So we want to figure out

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.320
questions where the answer is equally likely to be yes. As it

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.620
is to be no. So we could ask that as our first

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.360
question. So we're going to ask, is the gold star in either the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.770
green or the purple box? So the answer is yes if it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.530
in one of those two boxes. The answer is no if it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.570
in either the blue or the red box. So, there are four boxes.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.960
For two of the boxes the answer is going to be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.630
yes, so half the time the answer is yes. So that

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.140
means, we're gaining one full bit of information. If the answer

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.530
is yes, we've learned that it's in either the green or

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.330
the pop-, purple box. If the answer is no, we've learned

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.580
that it's in either the blue or the red box. And

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.390
so if the answer is yes, well now we need to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.460
ask one more question. To figure out which box it's in.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.590
And that could be, is it in the green box?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.050
And so, if we ask that question, if the answer is

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.590
yes, well then we know it's in the green box. If

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.080
the answer is no, then we know it's in the purple

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
box. We only needed two questions to get to the right

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.830
box. And that's the same, if the answer was no to

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.660
this. Well then we can ask is it in the blue

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.600
box? That's a yes no question. If the answer is yes,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.229
well then we know it's in the blue box.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.000
If the answer is no, then we know that it's

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.530
in the red box. So now, we can cover

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.510
all four possible boxes. We didn't need three questions like

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.180
we did when we asked, is it in the green box, is it in the purple box, is it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.100
in the blue box? We might have needed three

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.800
questions to determine the box, here we only needed two.
