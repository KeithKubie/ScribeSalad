00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
 It seems that our planet has become more interdependent than ever, 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.600
 But loneliness is twice that of America since the 1980s, with more than 40 percent of adults feeling so. 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.500
 So, should you worry if you feel the same thing? Can the unit kill you? 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 Unity is a psychological technique designed to motivate you to seek social interactions, 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.400
 But largely subjective. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.900
 In other words, if you feel lonely, then you are alone. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500
 This does not necessarily mean you are isolated, or you do not have friends; 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
 It just means that those social interactions that are necessary for you have not materialized. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.200
 We often think of loneliness as something to the elderly, 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.600
 But a recent study found that young people between the ages of 16 and 24 were more affected than any other group. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.400
 In one of the most painful studies, scientists have discovered that being lonely makes cold symptoms worse. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.700
 Hundreds of healthy people tested isolation measure, 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 They were then given nasal passages containing the common cold virus. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 (Ugh) 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.900
 At this stage, those who were sick with the disease were isolated in five-day hotel rooms, 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.700
 Those who reported feeling lonely before taking the test were also reported to have worse cold symptoms. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.900
 Have you ever noticed that food tastes better when you are hungry? 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 Scientists have already seen the same phenomenon with unity. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.200
 When those participants were connected to MRI devices and showed the image of one of their loved ones and the image of a stranger 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 Those who scored high results in the UCLA unit gauge test 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 Showed a greater reaction in the reward system in the brain when they saw the image of one of their loved ones, 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.800
 While those who did not have a high sense of loneliness showed a similar response between a loved one and a stranger. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.000
 This helps us to know that this does not mean that these individuals lack close relationships, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 It means that they yearn to promote that social interaction. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.800
 Chronic loneliness can also change your body at the cellular level. Research has concluded that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 People who feel lonely have 209 different gene expressions in some of their white blood cells 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.700
 Including increased activity of inflammatory agents. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.600
 Now, inflammation is an important response to injuries, 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.800
 But chronic inflammation destroys your body. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 As a result, we see weak social relations 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.900
 There is a 29% increase in coronary heart disease 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.700
 An increase of 32% for stroke. 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.700
 In general, people with strong social relationships have a 50% greater chance of survival overall. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.000
 This means they are less likely to die during the same time period. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.100
 Making loneliness a deadly risk, such as a 15-cigarette drink a day, lack of exercise, or obesity. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.700
 So, yes, loneliness can increase your chances of dying. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 The growing number of people who feel lonely may be due to changes in our culture. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 Global capitalism and its focus on the individual has changed our ability to have strong social ties. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.800
 If you feel lonely, know that you are not alone. 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.300
 This is usually not a reflection of whether you are loved or not, and there is a small step you can take today to feel more connected: 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.400
 Try to make visual communication more profound, both with those people you know, or even a passerby on the street. 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.600
 Studies have shown that visual communication is a movement that makes both parties involved 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 Feel more connected with humanity. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.820
 [If you have not learned yet, we have launched Greg and Mitch.] 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.900
 [We have made a complete transformation for the first time.] 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500
 [If you want to see this really great video, you can see it here.] 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 [We also started a weekly radio program called "Side Note" to be broadcast every Wednesday] 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.900
 [In which we discuss controversial topics, and then navigate through everything related to science through it.] 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.300
 [So we'll leave you the link in the video description.] 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.600
 [Do not forget to subscribe to our channel, and hope to see you next Thursday and a new scientific video, to meet!]
