00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.610
If you’ve ever been to London, or even seen
a picture of London, you’ve probably seen

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.940
the giant clock tower at the corner of the
Palace of Westminster. This tower is one of

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.780
London’s major icons, ranking right up there
with red double-decker buses, the London Eye,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.780
and Platform 9 ¾.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.450
Contrary to popular belief, the clock tower
itself is not named “Big Ben”. Rather,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.790
it is named “Elizabeth Tower”, after Queen
Elizabeth II; named such during her Diamond

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.120
Jubilee (the 2012 60th anniversary of her
accession to the throne). Before that, it

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160
was just called “Clock Tower”. So why
is it so often called “Big Ben”? That

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.699
is due to the great bell inside the tower
that chimes the hour out and goes by that

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.170
name. Over time this has morphed into many
calling the clock tower itself that even today,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.180
despite the recent, very public, name change.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.889
So how did “Big Ben”- the great bell-
get its name? People seemed to be in the habit

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.569
of nicknaming giant bells and Big Ben was
one of the biggest in the world and the largest

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.190
in the British Isles at the time of its casting,
so certainly name-worthy. The origin of Big

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.490
Ben’s name is probably rooted in Sir Benjamin
Hall. Hall was reportedly a large man (6 ft.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.570
4 in. or 1.93 m, with a girth to match) and
was the first Commissioner of Works, affectionately

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.470
known as “Big Ben.”

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.260
On the side of the great bell there was also
supposedly the inscription “Sir Benjamin

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.080
Hall MP Chief Commissioner of Works” in
his honor, so the workers and others took

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.720
to calling the bell “Big Ben”.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.530
If you’re wondering why that text is not
inscribed there anymore (if it ever truly

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.660
was), it’s because the current Big Ben is
not the original. The original bell actually

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.000
cracked before the clock itself was even installed
in the tower (more on this later). As to why

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.590
the name supposedly was inscribed on the first
and not the second bell, the reason often

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.530
given is that Sir Hall was no longer the Chief
Commissioner when the second bell was cast.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
In addition, different founders were used
to cast the second bell, so they may not have

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.210
felt inclined to put the inscription on.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.090
As there is little documented evidence on
the origin of the name “Big Ben”, we can’t

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
say for 100% certainty that it was named after
Sir Benjamin Hall. Another possibility that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.410
has been proposed is that it was named after
Benjamin Caunt, a very popular heavyweight

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.530
boxing champion in the 1850s, who was also
nicknamed “Big Ben”.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.330
Yet another popular theory is that it was
named in 1857 during a sitting of the House

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.880
of Commons. At some point someone, tired of
the long meeting over the naming of the great

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.410
bell, just shouted “Why not call it Big
Ben?” as a joke while Sir Benjamin Hall

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.319
was talking. However, if such a thing actually
happened, there should be Parliament records

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.200
of this, but there is not. Thus, it’s thought
the original Hall inscription story is more

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.350
likely; though in both that story and the
Parliament story, it was named after Sir Hall

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.350
who was integrally connected with the building
of the tower, clock, and bells.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.140
As to why the clock tower was built in the
first place, in 1834, a fire destroyed the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.010
Palace of Westminster—then the seat of the
British government—leaving only a few parts

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.501
of the palace standing. The next year, with
reconstruction well on its way, Parliament

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:58.890
opted to include a clock tower in the redesign.
It wasn’t the first clock tower that the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.520
parliament buildings had seen. The first one
was built between 1288 and 1290 and contained

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.140
a bell known as “Great Edward” or “Great
Tom.” A second tower, containing the first

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.770
public chiming clock in England, replaced
the first in 1367. In 1707, that tower was

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.900
demolished because it had fallen into disrepair.
Instead of replacing the tower with another,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.090
a sundial was put up in its place.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.400
After the fire, Sir Charles Barry’s design
for the new Houses of Parliament was chosen

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.770
out of 97 designs submitted for consideration-
his design didn’t originally include a clock

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.540
tower. He added one in 1836 and later drew
up a detailed design with the help of Augustus

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.860
Pugin. Pugin was never recognized by Barry
for supplying the design for the clock, despite

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.770
Pugin saying, “I never worked so hard in
my life as for Mr. Barry for tomorrow I render

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.459
all the designs for finishing his bell tower
&amp; it is beautiful…”

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.430
The tower was Pugin’s last design. In 1852,
before work on the tower was completed, Pugin

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.360
suffered a breakdown. He was unable to speak
coherently or recognize his family, and died

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.470
several months later despite attempted therapy.
He was only forty years old and never knew

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.530
how famous his last design would become.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.319
Construction on the tower began September
28, 1843. It was built from the inside out

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.209
so that scaffolding couldn’t be seen by
passers-by.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.100
Besides Pugin’s work, Sir Charles Barry
also sought additional help when it came to

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.519
the actual clock mechanism itself. He chose
Benjamin Lewis Vuillamy, who was the Queen’s

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.530
clockmaker, to work on a design, though other
clockmakers were also brought in to give their

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.620
advice and opinions. In 1846, a competition
was held to see who would build the clock,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.890
but some amazingly tough standards- for the
age- were set by the Astronomer Royal, Sir

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.720
George Airy. Airy stated that the clock needed
to strike the hour within one second’s accuracy,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.290
and the performance of the clock was to be
telegraphed to the Greenwich Observatory twice

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.190
daily. This harsh criteria caused seven years
of delay.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.240
When Edward John Dent was finally appointed
to build the clock in 1852, he found that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.790
the tower was too small for the initial clock
design. This caused further delays and alterations

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.410
had to be made to the tune of £100 (adjusted
for inflation by average earnings, that’s

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.190
about £69,000 today). To top it all off,
after finally getting construction underway,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.750
Dent died the next year and his stepson had
to take over. The clock was finally finished

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.170
in 1854, costing a total of £2500 to make.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.050
The clock’s delay didn’t end up mattering
very much, as the clock tower itself had suffered

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.060
delays as well. The clock wasn’t actually
installed until 1859. During the two-year

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.070
wait, modifications were made to meet the
Astronomer Royal’s standards. For instance,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.500
Edmund Beckett Denison invented a “Double
Three-Legged Gravity Escapement” for the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.150
clock which made sure that the pendulum wasn’t
affected by wind or other external factors

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.120
putting pressure on the clock’s hands. Also
known as the Grimthorpe Escapement, this revolutionary

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.870
invention is still used on many clocks throughout
the world today.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.150
When the clock was finally installed in April
1859, it didn’t work. The original cast

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.780
iron hands were too heavy to keep time and
had to be replaced by lighter copper hands.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.040
At last, on May 31, 1859, the clock began
successfully keeping time. But the tower wasn’t

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.780
yet completed—it also needed a bell.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.680
Like the rest of the features of the tower,
the great bell also suffered delays. The first

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.120
great bell was cast in 1856 and hung in the
New Palace Yard where it was tested every

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.199
day. On October 17, 1857, as mentioned previously,
a crack over a metre long appeared on the

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.210
bell. Fingers were pointed, but no one fessed
up. Because the original bell casters—the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.480
Warners—asked for too much to replace the
bell, the Whitechapel Foundry got the job

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.260
for the replacement. The second bell weighed
2.5 tonnes less than the first (13.5 tons

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.270
instead of 16), but it was still so large
that it took thirty hours to winch it up to

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.509
the belfry in the tower.

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:42.410
At last, on July 11, 1859, Big Ben rang out
for the first time. Unfortunately, in September

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.380
of that year, a crack appeared in the bell
again. This time supposedly because the hammer

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.220
used to strike it was approximately two times
the maximum weight the original bell founder

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.450
specified for the bell. This crack caused
the great bell to remain silent for a few

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.570
years. However, in 1863, Airy came up with
a solution: turn the bell so that the hammer

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.550
struck a different spot, make the hammer lighter,
and cut a small square in the bell so that

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.010
the crack wouldn’t spread. His solution
worked, and to this day, the same cracked

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:22.850
“Big Ben” sits in the belfry, ringing
away on

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:29.629
the hour.
