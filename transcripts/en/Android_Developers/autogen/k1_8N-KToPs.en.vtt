00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.529
now this is going to be a quick one
because there's not a lot to this out

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:43.539
because there's not a lot to this out
 

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:44.350
because there's not a lot to this out
yeah

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360
yeah
 

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.980
yeah
but I did have some issues with not just

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:47.990
but I did have some issues with not just
 

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.500
but I did have some issues with not just
our prescriptions for travel app which

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.510
our prescriptions for travel app which
 

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.060
our prescriptions for travel app which
don't necessarily apply to this

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.070
don't necessarily apply to this
 

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:57.070
don't necessarily apply to this
particular out but with the UI the first

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080
particular out but with the UI the first
 

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.700
particular out but with the UI the first
problem that I had is that this area

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:00.710
problem that I had is that this area
 

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.590
problem that I had is that this area
here at al this looks like a viewpager

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600
here at al this looks like a viewpager
 

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.360
here at al this looks like a viewpager
it right yeah it looks like you should

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.370
it right yeah it looks like you should
 

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.350
it right yeah it looks like you should
be able to fling that around no however

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360
be able to fling that around no however
 

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.120
be able to fling that around no however
this is ok so the a lockable right now I

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.130
this is ok so the a lockable right now I
 

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.860
this is ok so the a lockable right now I
think that they may have done that

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:14.870
think that they may have done that
 

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.930
think that they may have done that
because when you get to the map which is

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:19.940
because when you get to the map which is
 

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.220
because when you get to the map which is
zoomed way way way out it's a little bit

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.230
zoomed way way way out it's a little bit
 

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.380
zoomed way way way out it's a little bit
difficult to operate this as a view

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:26.390
difficult to operate this as a view
 

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.419
difficult to operate this as a view
pager and that's understandable but yeah

00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:28.429
pager and that's understandable but yeah
 

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:30.490
pager and that's understandable but yeah
I don't feel like that's necessarily an

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:30.500
I don't feel like that's necessarily an
 

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.159
I don't feel like that's necessarily an
excuse for making it completely broken

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:33.169
excuse for making it completely broken
 

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:35.320
excuse for making it completely broken
everywhere else yeah I mean there are

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.330
everywhere else yeah I mean there are
 

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.730
everywhere else yeah I mean there are
ways that you can sort of do an edge

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:36.740
ways that you can sort of do an edge
 

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.230
ways that you can sort of do an edge
swipe as well so you can still have a

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240
swipe as well so you can still have a
 

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.570
swipe as well so you can still have a
view pager type functionality while

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:40.580
view pager type functionality while
 

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.810
view pager type functionality while
you've still got a full screen multi pan

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:42.820
you've still got a full screen multi pan
 

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.159
you've still got a full screen multi pan
you know it also bothered me that the

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:48.169
you know it also bothered me that the
 

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:51.580
you know it also bothered me that the
search tab doesn't actually search it's

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:51.590
search tab doesn't actually search it's
 

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.530
search tab doesn't actually search it's
just the map view so it's more browse

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:53.540
just the map view so it's more browse
 

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.570
just the map view so it's more browse
like browse fine let's just write and

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:55.580
like browse fine let's just write and
 

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.060
like browse fine let's just write and
then I have to do it such as to actually

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:58.070
then I have to do it such as to actually
 

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.590
then I have to do it such as to actually
now they are doing the regular search

00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600
now they are doing the regular search
 

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.900
now they are doing the regular search
bar in the action bar so that's very

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:01.910
bar in the action bar so that's very
 

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.340
bar in the action bar so that's very
good I'm not the nice the right way

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:03.350
good I'm not the nice the right way
 

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.570
good I'm not the nice the right way
which is nice to see you've got your

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:04.580
which is nice to see you've got your
 

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.490
which is nice to see you've got your
appropriate up affordance there to

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:06.500
appropriate up affordance there to
 

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.440
appropriate up affordance there to
escape out of it which is it's nice to

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.450
escape out of it which is it's nice to
 

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.750
escape out of it which is it's nice to
see you can see here one thing that I

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760
see you can see here one thing that I
 

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.880
see you can see here one thing that I
noticed was that we're actually cutting

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:12.890
noticed was that we're actually cutting
 

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.740
noticed was that we're actually cutting
off the name of the app while we're in

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:14.750
off the name of the app while we're in
 

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.810
off the name of the app while we're in
portrait mode so it seems like this

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:16.820
portrait mode so it seems like this
 

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.610
portrait mode so it seems like this
might be an opportunity to drop the name

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:18.620
might be an opportunity to drop the name
 

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.169
might be an opportunity to drop the name
completely and just stick with the logo

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:20.179
completely and just stick with the logo
 

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:22.090
completely and just stick with the logo
rather than having an abbreviated name

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.100
rather than having an abbreviated name
 

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.380
rather than having an abbreviated name
which just kind of makes it look

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:23.390
which just kind of makes it look
 

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.159
which just kind of makes it look
squished mm-hmm you also might give some

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:27.169
squished mm-hmm you also might give some
 

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:30.340
squished mm-hmm you also might give some
serious thought to completely getting

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:30.350
serious thought to completely getting
 

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.159
serious thought to completely getting
rid of these tabs and making those a

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:32.169
rid of these tabs and making those a
 

00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:34.659
rid of these tabs and making those a
navigation drop-down so obviously you've

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:34.669
navigation drop-down so obviously you've
 

00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:36.520
navigation drop-down so obviously you've
decided that you don't want viewpoint

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:36.530
decided that you don't want viewpoint
 

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.070
decided that you don't want viewpoint
view pager activities and if you don't

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080
view pager activities and if you don't
 

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.650
view pager activities and if you don't
want a view pager then being able to

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.660
want a view pager then being able to
 

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.010
want a view pager then being able to
just tap on the app icon have a drop

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:45.020
just tap on the app icon have a drop
 

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.770
just tap on the app icon have a drop
down navigation is going to be just as

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:47.780
down navigation is going to be just as
 

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.630
down navigation is going to be just as
fast pretty much just as discoverable

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640
fast pretty much just as discoverable
 

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.890
fast pretty much just as discoverable
and you get this screen real estate

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:50.900
and you get this screen real estate
 

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.049
and you get this screen real estate
thing if I'm if I'm not mistaken I

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:53.059
thing if I'm if I'm not mistaken I
 

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:54.549
thing if I'm if I'm not mistaken I
believe that if you actually use the

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559
believe that if you actually use the
 

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.540
believe that if you actually use the
standard action bar tab

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:56.550
standard action bar tab
 

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.310
standard action bar tab
it will switch between having a

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320
it will switch between having a
 

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.020
it will switch between having a
drop-down navigation in portrait mode

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.030
drop-down navigation in portrait mode
 

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.760
drop-down navigation in portrait mode
and if you've got space so landscape

switched to a tab layout instead very

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:05.730
switched to a tab layout instead very

mentioned before to you that once you're

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:10.680
mentioned before to you that once you're
 

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.340
mentioned before to you that once you're
on this map zooming in is not

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:13.350
on this map zooming in is not
 

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.730
on this map zooming in is not
particularly efficient and if you

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740
particularly efficient and if you
 

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.040
particularly efficient and if you
already know where you want to go being

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.050
already know where you want to go being
 

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.290

able to zoom in on the specific location

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:21.300
able to zoom in on the specific location
 

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.410
able to zoom in on the specific location
that you wanted is nigh impossible right

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:24.420
that you wanted is nigh impossible right
 

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.510
that you wanted is nigh impossible right
the best way I've found to do that is to

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520
the best way I've found to do that is to
 

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.360
the best way I've found to do that is to
actually tap this key a little place is

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.370
actually tap this key a little place is
 

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.820
actually tap this key a little place is
key and that'll show you things that you

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:31.830
key and that'll show you things that you
 

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.740
key and that'll show you things that you
can zoom in on gotcha and then you can

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:33.750
can zoom in on gotcha and then you can
 

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.020
can zoom in on gotcha and then you can
just keep hitting up right until your

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.030
just keep hitting up right until your
 

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.540
just keep hitting up right until your
ends readjusting and just feeling

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:38.550
ends readjusting and just feeling
 

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.700
ends readjusting and just feeling
frustrated the whole time right this is

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.710
frustrated the whole time right this is
 

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.940
frustrated the whole time right this is
something where honestly it might be

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:43.950
something where honestly it might be
 

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.470
something where honestly it might be
better to just integrate with a nice

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480
better to just integrate with a nice
 

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.640
better to just integrate with a nice
Maps API or at least give some thought

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:49.650
Maps API or at least give some thought
 

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.850
Maps API or at least give some thought
to how you would zoom in directly I

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860
to how you would zoom in directly I
 

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.680
to how you would zoom in directly I
actually thought this button might do it

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:54.690
actually thought this button might do it
 

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.650
actually thought this button might do it
but I say that is exactly the opposite

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:57.660
but I say that is exactly the opposite
 

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.090
but I say that is exactly the opposite
of what I wanted that's interesting as

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100
of what I wanted that's interesting as
 

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.650
of what I wanted that's interesting as
well I look at that icon and the first

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:00.660
well I look at that icon and the first
 

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.480
well I look at that icon and the first
thing I think is a full screen like I

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.490
thing I think is a full screen like I
 

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.760
thing I think is a full screen like I
expect it to just get go full screen and

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:04.770
expect it to just get go full screen and
 

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.200
expect it to just get go full screen and
it doesn't so that's a little bit

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.210
it doesn't so that's a little bit
 

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.600
it doesn't so that's a little bit
confusing so how can i zoom well I have

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:08.610
confusing so how can i zoom well I have
 

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:12.160
confusing so how can i zoom well I have
to actually select it a menu which wow

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.170
to actually select it a menu which wow
 

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.010
to actually select it a menu which wow
haha okay 1995 called they want your

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020
haha okay 1995 called they want your
 

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.100
haha okay 1995 called they want your
model of user interaction back yeah

there's no problem in taking some of the

there's no problem in taking some of the
 

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.670
there's no problem in taking some of the
built-in framework components and

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:02.680
built-in framework components and

little bit of urine spice to it but it

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:05.380
little bit of urine spice to it but it
 

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.720
little bit of urine spice to it but it
is something you want to do carefully

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:06.730
is something you want to do carefully
 

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.120
is something you want to do carefully
knowing that at any time you could run

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.130

the risk of starting to look aged and
 

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.890
the risk of starting to look aged and
all it's also very difficult to get back

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:13.900
all it's also very difficult to get back
 

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.750
all it's also very difficult to get back
to where you were yeah I noticed that

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760
to where you were yeah I noticed that
 

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.180
to where you were yeah I noticed that
the navigation isn't quite like really

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:18.190
the navigation isn't quite like really
 

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.210
the navigation isn't quite like really
easy to back out of something in fact

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:21.220
easy to back out of something in fact
 

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.730
easy to back out of something in fact
they have multiple ways to back out of a

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:23.740
they have multiple ways to back out of a
 

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.530
they have multiple ways to back out of a
screen including the up affordance and

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:25.540
screen including the up affordance and
 

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.970
screen including the up affordance and
an action button and the back button but

an action button and the back button but
 

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.920

then to get back into that hotel search

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:31.930
then to get back into that hotel search
 

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.629
then to get back into that hotel search
you gotta research

00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:33.639
you gotta research
 

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:35.430
you gotta research
that's a pain it's one of the things

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440
that's a pain it's one of the things
 

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.989
that's a pain it's one of the things
which which I noticed about this happen

00:30:36.989 --> 00:30:36.999
which which I noticed about this happen
 

00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:38.609
which which I noticed about this happen
or something I've seen quite a lot off

00:30:38.609 --> 00:30:38.619
or something I've seen quite a lot off
 

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:40.680
or something I've seen quite a lot off
is sort of you navigate into something

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:40.690
is sort of you navigate into something
 

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.419
is sort of you navigate into something
which has a view pager and then that

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:42.429
which has a view pager and then that
 

00:30:42.429 --> 00:30:44.609
which has a view pager and then that
view pager has entirely different

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:44.619
view pager has entirely different
 

00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:46.469
view pager has entirely different
contexts so it's like this is about the

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:46.479
contexts so it's like this is about the
 

00:30:46.479 --> 00:30:48.839
contexts so it's like this is about the
hotel this is reviews and as you're

00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:48.849
hotel this is reviews and as you're
 

00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:50.159
hotel this is reviews and as you're
swiping through it makes sense but you

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:50.169
swiping through it makes sense but you
 

00:30:50.169 --> 00:30:51.629
swiping through it makes sense but you
kind of feel like you're navigating

00:30:51.629 --> 00:30:51.639
kind of feel like you're navigating
 

00:30:51.639 --> 00:30:54.149
kind of feel like you're navigating
through the app because it's a sort of a

00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159
through the app because it's a sort of a
 

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:56.879
through the app because it's a sort of a
totally different UI and then I often

00:30:56.879 --> 00:30:56.889
totally different UI and then I often
 

00:30:56.889 --> 00:30:58.709
totally different UI and then I often
find myself then heading back to them

00:30:58.709 --> 00:30:58.719
find myself then heading back to them
 

00:30:58.719 --> 00:31:01.469
find myself then heading back to them
you know go back to say the previous you

00:31:01.469 --> 00:31:01.479
you know go back to say the previous you
 

00:31:01.479 --> 00:31:03.389
you know go back to say the previous you
know the previous view pager which isn't

00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399
know the previous view pager which isn't
 

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:05.039
know the previous view pager which isn't
the behavior that should happen but then

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:05.049
the behavior that should happen but then
 

00:31:05.049 --> 00:31:08.489
the behavior that should happen but then
i find myself back here but here at the

00:31:08.489 --> 00:31:08.499
i find myself back here but here at the
 

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.319
i find myself back here but here at the
at the search screen and then i have to

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:10.329
at the search screen and then i have to
 

00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:11.549
at the search screen and then i have to
do the whole thing again i have to wait

00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559
do the whole thing again i have to wait
 

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:13.409
do the whole thing again i have to wait
for it to complete and so you kind of

00:31:13.409 --> 00:31:13.419
for it to complete and so you kind of
 

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:16.499
for it to complete and so you kind of
want a way to prevent that accidental

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:16.509
want a way to prevent that accidental
 

00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:18.089
want a way to prevent that accidental
back behavior from really ruining your

00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:18.099
back behavior from really ruining your
 

00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:21.079
back behavior from really ruining your
day now what's even worse is that here

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:21.089
day now what's even worse is that here
 

00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:23.940
day now what's even worse is that here
i'm going through exactly the same dance

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:23.950
i'm going through exactly the same dance
 

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.779
i'm going through exactly the same dance
that i had to go and last time which is

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:26.789
that i had to go and last time which is
 

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:30.569
that i had to go and last time which is
extremely disturbing considering that if

00:31:30.569 --> 00:31:30.579
extremely disturbing considering that if
 

00:31:30.579 --> 00:31:32.399
extremely disturbing considering that if
i go all the way back here and try a

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:32.409
i go all the way back here and try a
 

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:35.579
i go all the way back here and try a
flight search it has a recent searches

00:31:35.579 --> 00:31:35.589
flight search it has a recent searches
 

00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:38.009
flight search it has a recent searches
option yeah so why doesn't it have a

00:31:38.009 --> 00:31:38.019
option yeah so why doesn't it have a
 

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:41.069
option yeah so why doesn't it have a
recent searches option for hotels I'm

00:31:41.069 --> 00:31:41.079
recent searches option for hotels I'm
 

00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:44.459
recent searches option for hotels I'm
actually more likely to need that since

00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:44.469
actually more likely to need that since
 

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.549

the interesting thing here so I looked
at this app a little while ago and

from and two dates I made the mistake
 

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.459

and that'll give you a one way and that
gives me a one-way flight and then i

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.070
gives me a one-way flight and then i

how to turn a one-way flight into a
 

00:33:00.739 --> 00:33:02.799
how to turn a one-way flight into a
return flight until someone had the good

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:02.809
return flight until someone had the good
 

00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:05.019

result in a in a one way and that
 

00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:24.399
result in a in a one way and that
perhaps they should click a return date

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:24.409
perhaps they should click a return date
 

00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:26.469
perhaps they should click a return date
if they want to have returned now here's

00:33:26.469 --> 00:33:26.479

i think a lot of this comes from making

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440
i think a lot of this comes from making
 

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.500
i think a lot of this comes from making
some assumptions about the devices that

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:08.510
some assumptions about the devices that
 

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.710
some assumptions about the devices that
you programmed on especially when it

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720
you programmed on especially when it
 

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.779
you programmed on especially when it
comes to screen size and density

00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:13.789
comes to screen size and density
 

00:34:13.789 --> 00:34:16.960
comes to screen size and density
remember that some screens are

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:16.970
remember that some screens are
 

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:19.779
remember that some screens are
relatively small but incredibly dense

00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:19.789
relatively small but incredibly dense
 

00:34:19.789 --> 00:34:22.690
relatively small but incredibly dense
and if you're not thinking about that

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:22.700
and if you're not thinking about that
 

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.710
and if you're not thinking about that
sort of HD density

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720
sort of HD density
 

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.379
sort of HD density
then you're gonna have a bad time and

alright so kayak I thought was not

alright so kayak I thought was not
really a great design from the UI

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:32.250
really a great design from the UI
 

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.859
really a great design from the UI
standpoint it certainly doesn't feel at

I'm going to probably miss it it's it
 

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.329
I'm going to probably miss it it's it
and then it's not even a button it's

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339
and then it's not even a button it's
 

00:38:50.339 --> 00:38:52.789
and then it's not even a button it's
kind of a drawer and the reverse drew

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:52.799
kind of a drawer and the reverse drew
 

00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:54.470
kind of a drawer and the reverse drew
it's an interesting pattern that it was

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480
it's an interesting pattern that it was
 

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.299
it's an interesting pattern that it was
popular for a little while until people

realized it's kind of counterintuitive

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:57.630
realized it's kind of counterintuitive
 

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.750
realized it's kind of counterintuitive
you know the drawer comes down from the

and it should at least have some

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640
and it should at least have some
 

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.520
and it should at least have some
indication that it's a drawer damp so

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:10.530
indication that it's a drawer damp so
 

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.240
indication that it's a drawer damp so
all it's got is a little gradient on it

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.250
all it's got is a little gradient on it

so I'm I'm good with that but you know

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:38.069
so I'm I'm good with that but you know
 

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:42.200
so I'm I'm good with that but you know
it's a little unnecessary now when I

it's a little unnecessary now when I
 

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.510
it's a little unnecessary now when I
actually search it gives me a progress

about it was earlier when I was inside

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260
about it was earlier when I was inside

turns out that progress bar goes at a

00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619
turns out that progress bar goes at a
 

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:00.140
turns out that progress bar goes at a

constant speed hits ninety-nine percent
and then just stopped problems abuzz

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359
and then just stopped problems abuzz
 

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:07.490
and then just stopped problems abuzz
ahad yes I probably a bar was not the

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500
ahad yes I probably a bar was not the
 

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.099
ahad yes I probably a bar was not the
greatest idea I think so a progress

00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:10.109
greatest idea I think so a progress

sure that would work alright so we get

into this uh once again we get some

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.170
into this uh once again we get some

branding here which is I think

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:43.420
branding here which is I think
 

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.160
branding here which is I think
attractive um feels a little odd to me

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.170
attractive um feels a little odd to me
 

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.560
attractive um feels a little odd to me
given that we have very little space on

there feels a little bit like wasted

00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359
there feels a little bit like wasted
 

00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:01.380
there feels a little bit like wasted
space too but I think that's a matter of

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:01.390
space too but I think that's a matter of
 

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.710
space too but I think that's a matter of
opinion yeah I think my biggest concern

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720
opinion yeah I think my biggest concern
 

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.780
opinion yeah I think my biggest concern
looking at this is more just the the

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:06.790
looking at this is more just the the
 

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.900
looking at this is more just the the

that that bar up the top here just looks
you know kind of weird that's true it's

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:17.890
you know kind of weird that's true it's
 

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.380
you know kind of weird that's true it's
actually really difficult to see what

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:19.390
actually really difficult to see what
 

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.990
actually really difficult to see what
your selection is yeah and then of

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000
your selection is yeah and then of
 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.570
your selection is yeah and then of
course we've got from from gradient land

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:24.580
course we've got from from gradient land
 

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.260

yeah why plus you know this idea that

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.180
yeah why plus you know this idea that
 

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.390
yeah why plus you know this idea that
you'll lose on safe progress don't tell

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400
you'll lose on safe progress don't tell
 

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.859
you'll lose on safe progress don't tell
me that I'm going to lose progress just

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:34.869
me that I'm going to lose progress just
 

00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:36.270
me that I'm going to lose progress just
make it so that I don't lose progress

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280
make it so that I don't lose progress
 

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.180
make it so that I don't lose progress
right exactly it's again it's the you're

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.190
right exactly it's again it's the you're
 

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.410
right exactly it's again it's the you're
holding it wrong that's not the way this

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:40.420
holding it wrong that's not the way this
 

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.480
holding it wrong that's not the way this
app works don't don't do it this way if

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:42.490
app works don't don't do it this way if
 

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.970
app works don't don't do it this way if
you have enough users who are using the

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:44.980
you have enough users who are using the
 

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.620
you have enough users who are using the
app wrong that you feel the need to tell

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:46.630
app wrong that you feel the need to tell
 

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.030
app wrong that you feel the need to tell
them that they're using the app wrong

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040
them that they're using the app wrong
 

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.890
them that they're using the app wrong
maybe they're not the ones that are

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:49.900
maybe they're not the ones that are
 

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.109
maybe they're not the ones that are
wrong I'm just saying right so anyway

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119

let's um you know so it's got a lot of
the the features that you expect I think

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:58.300
the the features that you expect I think
 

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.250
the the features that you expect I think
they're all done relatively well I don't

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:02.260
they're all done relatively well I don't
 

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.330
they're all done relatively well I don't
know who this map provider is buying but

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:06.340
know who this map provider is buying but
 

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.370
know who this map provider is buying but
you know they say this scene be all

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:08.380
you know they say this scene be all
 

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.740
you know they say this scene be all
right up and coming you know whatever

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:10.750
right up and coming you know whatever
 

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:15.720
right up and coming you know whatever
it's doing hard I this plus and minus

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:15.730
it's doing hard I this plus and minus
 

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.000
it's doing hard I this plus and minus
zoom buttons I think we're maybe stolen

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.010
zoom buttons I think we're maybe stolen
 

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:19.770
zoom buttons I think we're maybe stolen
from somewhere yeah that looks actually

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:19.780
from somewhere yeah that looks actually
 

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.750
from somewhere yeah that looks actually
looks like mono in fairness I think

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760
looks like mono in fairness I think
 

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.760
looks like mono in fairness I think
that's the the default control that you

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:23.770
that's the the default control that you
 

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.470
that's the the default control that you
can apply to any map or indeed anything

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480
can apply to any map or indeed anything
 

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.359
can apply to any map or indeed anything
so that's you know it just looks kind of

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:27.369
so that's you know it just looks kind of
 

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:29.220
so that's you know it just looks kind of
old school but I think that's uh yeah

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.230
old school but I think that's uh yeah
 

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.540
old school but I think that's uh yeah
all right there at the Android what's

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:30.550
all right there at the Android what's
 

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.090
all right there at the Android what's
really there with the gradient well i

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.100
really there with the gradient well i
 

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.830
really there with the gradient well i

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:34.840
think it was was for backing gingerbread
 

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.590

got the rounded corners uh you know i
 

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.910

it looks good the main question I had
 

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.950
it looks good the main question I had
when I saw those is is it going to

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960
when I saw those is is it going to
 

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.599
when I saw those is is it going to
perform well and the truth is yes it

00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:52.609
perform well and the truth is yes it
 

00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:54.069
perform well and the truth is yes it
performs a really really well this is

00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079
performs a really really well this is
 

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:59.859

bother us just because we feel like in

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.150
bother us just because we feel like in
 

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.720

android it should be apparent to

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:10.730
android it should be apparent to
 

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.349
android it should be apparent to
everyone that items in a list can be

everyone that items in a list can be

clicked on to get more stuff and if you

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:17.990
clicked on to get more stuff and if you
 

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.099
clicked on to get more stuff and if you
have a chevron it sort of implies that

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:21.109
have a chevron it sort of implies that
 

00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:22.809
have a chevron it sort of implies that
there's something special about that

00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:22.819
there's something special about that
 

00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:24.670
there's something special about that
chevron as opposed to the rest of the

chevron as opposed to the rest of the
 

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.069
chevron as opposed to the rest of the
list item and that's very rarely the

00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079
list item and that's very rarely the
 

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:29.500
list item and that's very rarely the
case yeah and if it is the case then you

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:29.510
case yeah and if it is the case then you
 

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.150
case yeah and if it is the case then you
should actually separate it out and

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160
should actually separate it out and
 

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.589
should actually separate it out and
maybe consider using something more

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599
maybe consider using something more
 

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:34.750
maybe consider using something more
descriptive than a chevron for it the

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760
descriptive than a chevron for it the
 

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.760
descriptive than a chevron for it the
main problem though that I have with

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:36.770
main problem though that I have with

optimized for mobile yeah so all of a

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:51.500
optimized for mobile yeah so all of a
 

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.930

sudden I'm back in a web browser

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:52.940
sudden I'm back in a web browser
 

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.599
sudden I'm back in a web browser
thinking well wow why did I download

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:55.609
thinking well wow why did I download
 

00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:57.730
thinking well wow why did I download
this app it's just it's just a bunch of

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:57.740
this app it's just it's just a bunch of
 

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.530
this app it's just it's just a bunch of
bookmarks yeah why would you download an

00:43:59.530 --> 00:43:59.540
bookmarks yeah why would you download an
 

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.630
bookmarks yeah why would you download an
app that's just a bookmark all right but

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640
app that's just a bookmark all right but
 

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.210
app that's just a bookmark all right but
again we do have a lot of nice features

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.220
again we do have a lot of nice features
 

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.299
again we do have a lot of nice features
yeah yeah on track of here we've got you

00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:10.309
yeah yeah on track of here we've got you
 

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:11.980
yeah yeah on track of here we've got you
know currency conversion to a lot of the

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:11.990
know currency conversion to a lot of the
 

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.150
know currency conversion to a lot of the
stuff that you want to have and use

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160
stuff that you want to have and use
 

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.160
stuff that you want to have and use
while you're on the go I mean one thing

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:15.170
while you're on the go I mean one thing
 

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.809
while you're on the go I mean one thing
which I would point out here that so in

00:44:16.809 --> 00:44:16.819
which I would point out here that so in
 

00:44:16.819 --> 00:44:18.280
which I would point out here that so in
this implementation they don't have a

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:18.290
this implementation they don't have a
 

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.289
this implementation they don't have a
real action bar or at least they don't

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:20.299
real action bar or at least they don't
 

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:22.210
real action bar or at least they don't
always use it and so you've got this

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:22.220
always use it and so you've got this
 

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.010
always use it and so you've got this
list view which is kind of a dashboard

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:24.020
list view which is kind of a dashboard
 

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.170
list view which is kind of a dashboard
pattern but as a list so it kind of

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:26.180
pattern but as a list so it kind of
 

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.210
pattern but as a list so it kind of
skirts the you know the guidelines there

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:28.220
skirts the you know the guidelines there
 

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.309
skirts the you know the guidelines there
yeah it is my ask myself how does this

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319
yeah it is my ask myself how does this
 

00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:32.380
yeah it is my ask myself how does this
all fit together it seems like what we

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:32.390
all fit together it seems like what we
 

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.660
all fit together it seems like what we
don't is put a grab bag of really

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:34.670
don't is put a grab bag of really
 

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:36.099
don't is put a grab bag of really
interesting functionality I'm sorry I

00:44:36.099 --> 00:44:36.109
interesting functionality I'm sorry I
 

00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:37.180
interesting functionality I'm sorry I
didn't mean to step on this foot that's

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:37.190
didn't mean to step on this foot that's
 

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.220
didn't mean to step on this foot that's
alright that's alright yeah this whole

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:39.230
alright that's alright yeah this whole
 

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.930
alright that's alright yeah this whole
this whole standing up thing is going to

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:40.940
this whole standing up thing is going to
 

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.569
this whole standing up thing is going to
take some of mine used to yeah so the

00:44:43.569 --> 00:44:43.579
take some of mine used to yeah so the
 

00:44:43.579 --> 00:44:46.089
take some of mine used to yeah so the
problem is you've got a grab bag of

00:44:46.089 --> 00:44:46.099
problem is you've got a grab bag of
 

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:48.299
problem is you've got a grab bag of
functionality all of which seems useful

00:44:48.299 --> 00:44:48.309
functionality all of which seems useful
 

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:53.440
functionality all of which seems useful
but none of which really does a task for

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:53.450
but none of which really does a task for
 

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.920
but none of which really does a task for
me it's not a task oriented interface

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:55.930
me it's not a task oriented interface
 

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.530
me it's not a task oriented interface
what I really need is something that's

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:58.540
what I really need is something that's
 

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.200
what I really need is something that's
going to take me through the entire

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:01.210
going to take me through the entire
 

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:02.580
going to take me through the entire
process you know where do you want to go

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:02.590
process you know where do you want to go
 

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.200
process you know where do you want to go
how do you want to get there what do you

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.210
how do you want to get there what do you
 

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.910
how do you want to get there what do you
want to do when you're there here's

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920
want to do when you're there here's
 

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.740
want to do when you're there here's
where the holes are you know you forgot

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:07.750
where the holes are you know you forgot
 

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.470
where the holes are you know you forgot
to get transportation from this flight

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480
to get transportation from this flight
 

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.050
to get transportation from this flight
to this hotel what are you doing yeah

exactly and even here like you look

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:14.710
exactly and even here like you look
 

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:15.780
exactly and even here like you look
you're looking at the assassin there's

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:15.790
you're looking at the assassin there's
 

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.310
you're looking at the assassin there's
just an overwhelming number of things

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:17.320
just an overwhelming number of things
 

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.170
just an overwhelming number of things

and then let's talk about the tabs above

00:54:23.759 --> 00:54:23.769
and then let's talk about the tabs above
 

00:54:23.769 --> 00:54:25.739
and then let's talk about the tabs above
it was you know I wouldn't use this word

00:54:25.739 --> 00:54:25.749
it was you know I wouldn't use this word

feels and I rather suspect this might be
 

00:54:35.289 --> 00:54:37.469
feels and I rather suspect this might be
the case that this is actually at least

00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:37.479
the case that this is actually at least
