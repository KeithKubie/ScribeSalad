00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.610
Are you a lazy slob who hates to work and
sits around all day?

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.610
ME TOO.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.879
I mean really - is this episode over yet?

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.590
It's nap time.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.990
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.020
Some have called the onset of the 21st century
the couch potatofication of Amurica!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.710
And yes, that is scientific terminology.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.751
There's so much to do and see in the world!

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.280
....And you can do it all from the comfort
of your own sofa.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
Or office chair.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.280
Or...wherever you happen to be sitting.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.710
Now, a new study is saying hey, the fact that
you sit on your butt so much may not be just

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.020
because of lifestyle changes of the modern
world, it might actually be because of....your

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.020
genes.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.120
This is some of the first hard evidence that
some people may in fact be predisposed to

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.120
laziness!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.790
It's the excuse to sit around that we've all
been hoping and waiting for.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.180
The study was recently published in the American
Journal of Physiology.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.329
Scientists at the University of Missouri basically
monitored a bunch of rats and then sorted

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.960
them into 2 groups based on how much physical
activity the rats did on their own: one group

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.420
was the "super runners" and the other was
the "couch potatoes".

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.570
Then each group was isolated so they could
only breed with their own kind.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.579
They bred the rats for 10 generations, and
what did they find?

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.649
The offspring of the super runners were willfully
running an average of 10x longer every day

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.829
than the couch potato group.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.270
To be sure it was actually genetic they looked
at things like mitochondrial content in the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.219
muscle cells, gotta check in on how the powerhouses
are running.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.409
They also looked at that rat's body composition.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.210
In the end, they pinned 36 genes that may
influence couch potato behavior -- narrowed

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.430
down from 17,000.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.899
Now they've gotta figure out WHICH genes exactly
and, of course, if this applies to humans.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.599
Which sounds like a lot of work, if you ask
me.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.999
The study draws up that age old question,
right?

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.069
Nature or nurture?

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.200
Am I lazy because I'm hardwired for it?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.329
Or am I lazy because that's the lifestyle
I was brought up with?

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.329
Because I lack discipline?

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.590
Or because I just really don't care?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.079
As we discover that a lot of these traits
may in fact start in our genes, how much of

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.130
said laziness is related to factors that are
in my control?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
I ask because I feel like in my heart of hearts,
I am just.....so unbelievably lazy.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.890
But I force myself to NOT be lazy.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.590
I hate every minute of it.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.770
BUT I STILL DO IT.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.780
Is that nature or nature?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.780
So, peeps.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.180
Are you a couch potato or a super-runner?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.180
Nature or nurture?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.670
Tell me about it down below and I'll catcha
next time here on DNews.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.970
Byebye!
