<i> The last time I came here,</i>

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.704
<i> I walked 90 miles
 across the dry,</i>

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:42.575
<i> forgotten river channel.</i>

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.912
<i> But in the spring of 2014,
 something happened.</i>

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:50.816
<i> A river of sand became wet
 once again,</i>

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.485
<i> and the first time
 the Colorado River</i>

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.089
<i> kissed the sea
 in nearly in two decades.</i>

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.525
<i> We can bring a river
 back to life, if we try.</i>

very much for coming.

It's a great honor to be here.

About 20 years ago,
I had the...

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.214
the unusual experience to walk
into the building next door

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:24.584
and try to sell them a story,

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.487
which ended up
being my first story

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.089
with National Geographic.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.925
<i> It was a story of taking
 a biplane</i>

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.961
<i> from London to Cape Town
 in South Africa.</i>

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.463
<i> We re-enacted the first
 African air-passage.</i>

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.066
<i> They did it in 1920,
 we did it in 1998.</i>

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.068
<i> They did it in 43 days
 in 1920,</i>

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.437
<i> we did it in 58 in 1998.</i>

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.406
( laughter )

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.541
<i> But it gave me
 a very unusual perspective,</i>

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.377
not only on African aviation,
but on rivers.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.879
I got to fly up
the length of the Nile River,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.513
the longest in the world.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.348
So, I came home and...

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.085
and started talking
to my father actually who

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:00.386
got me pointed
in this direction,

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.688
<i> of looking
 at the Colorado River.</i>

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.957
<i> A river that
 I actually grew up on,</i>

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.459
<i> but I didn't really know it
 that well, to be honest.</i>

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.361
<i> I knew that the Grand Canyon
 is there in the middle,</i>

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.596
<i> but I really didn't know
 what happens</i>

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.597
<i> to the end of the river
 below the Grand Canyon</i>

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.032
<i> and where does the river
 actually go,</i>

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.333
<i> where does it end.</i>

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.135
<i> And as a native Coloradan,</i>

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.439
<i> who grew up right there,
 in the Roaring Fork Valley,</i>

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.374
<i> I thought it would be
 an interesting story</i>

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.409
<i> to follow this river.
 So, I came back home.</i>

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.113
<i> I came back to a field
 I spent a lot of time in.</i>

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.282
<i> I'd come every summer
 back home</i>

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.584
<i> and work on the ranch and
 move sprinklers like this</i>

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.252
<i> for flood irrigation systems
 and I started wondering</i>

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.621
<i> about the water
 and where this goes.</i>

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.257
<i> And how long
 will it take this water</i>

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.059
<i> to actually go to the sea,
 so I followed it.</i>

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.161
<i> I first started up in the
 mountains where I live.</i>

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.997
<i> This is Pyramid Peak,
 14,000 feet.</i>

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.465
<i> I have actually
 skied this peak,</i>

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.767
<i> and I skied it in June</i>

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.135
<i> when there was
 nine feet of snow.</i>

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.370
<i> I took this photo
 on Christmas day</i>

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.870
<i> two years ago,</i>

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.339
<i> there is three inches of snow.</i>

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.474
<i> So, we are facing some
 climate change issues</i>

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:56.742
<i> and we are also seeing
 some influence</i>

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:58.344
<i> coming in from the west to us.</i>

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.246
<i> This is Snowmass Peak,</i>

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.715
<i> not far from where I live,
 also 14,000 feet,</i>

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.818
<i> and you see that brown tint,
 that's actually dust</i>

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.587
<i> that's been blown in
 from the west</i>

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.621
<i> because of more development
 basically through</i>

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.724
<i> road constructions,
 some oil and gas.</i>

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.259
And what happens is it creates
a trans-evaporation process

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.328
where the particles in the...

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.764
of the dust actually
retain the sun's heat

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.967
and melt the snow up faster.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.135
So, we are losing a runoff
at a much faster rate,

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:24.737
They say
we're losing the river,

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.238
about 5% of the river

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.941
due to this trans-evaporation
process.

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.844
<i> And the Colorado
 is not the largest</i>

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.346
<i> or the longest river
 in the US.</i>

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.514
<i> It is actually seventh.</i>

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:36.649
<i> But many would argue</i>

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.084
<i> that it's the most loved
 and litigated.</i>

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.920
<i> This is near Kremmling,
 Colorado</i>

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.288
<i> and if you look
 at the top of the frame</i>

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.755
<i> that's looking due east,</i>

00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:46.326
<i> I'm looking
 at the Continental Divide,</i>

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.561
<i> you look what appears to be
 a healthy river,</i>

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.830
<i> but in fact, this river is
 actually flowing at about</i>

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.266
<i> 50% of its
 traditional capacity.</i>

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.968
<i> There are 22 trans-basin
 diversion projects,</i>

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:57.736
<i> basically tunnels
 that you can't see</i>

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.405
<i> that are going underneath</i>

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.906
<i> the Continental Divide,
 in the top of the frame,</i>

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.541
<i> and taking water to
 Denver, Boulder,</i>

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.943
<i> Fort Collins,
 Colorado Springs...</i>

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:06.345
Now what's interesting
about this is

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.880
that water goes over there,
that's great,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.882
they need the water,
but that water never returns

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.484
to the Colorado River basins.
So we are taking water

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.186
that would end up
in the Pacific,

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.988
and we are taking
and putting it in the Atlantic.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:18.190
So, we are seeing changes
right out at the gates.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.326
<i> They did a study
 on the Colorado River</i>

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.495
<i> and just the value it
 brings from recreation.</i>

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:24.897
<i> They've came back
 with a staggering figure,</i>

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:28.100
<i> that is $ 26 billion
 that this river produces,</i>

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.636
<i> in revenue through fishing,
 rafting, picnicking,</i>

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.471
<i> any form of recreation
 on the length of the river</i>

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.074
<i> that runs 1500 miles.</i>

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.942
If you put that
on the Forbes 500 list,

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.444
it would be ahead of
Progressive Insurance

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.912
and US Airways.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:42.849
So, a river with water in it
has value.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.419
<i> Most of that water goes
 towards agriculture.</i>

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.555
<i> So, I focused a lot
 on the aerial perspective,</i>

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.090
<i> in part, because I think
 it gives us</i>

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.692
<i> a perspective of
 where we've been</i>

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.627
<i> and where we are going
 with our landscape,</i>

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.530
<i> but also because I had this
 crazy guy on the right,</i>

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.132
<i> who I could hire at a rather
 affordable price, my father.</i>

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:01.466
( laughter )

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.235
<i> So, as we follow this river,</i>

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:05.604
<i> we are going to come
 into Utah,</i>

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:07.239
<i> beautiful landscape
 and you can see</i>

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.908
<i> how this river is
 sculpting through it.</i>

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:12.445
<i> This Castle Valley. And
 if you get on the ground,</i>

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:17.250
<i> in Canyonlands National
 Park area, Mesa Arch.</i>

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.418
<i> A remarkable landscape
 that's been shaped with</i>

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:21.353
<i> the uplift
 of the Colorado plateau and</i>

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.622
<i> the Colorado River of course,
 helping carve it out</i>

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:26.492
<i> and create this
 magnificent architecture.</i>

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.127
<i> You could do
 about a 90 degree turn,</i>

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:30.896
<i> go over another ridge and
 you would look over on this.</i>

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:33.299
<i> It is a potash mine.</i>

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.800
<i> We actually need potash
 for fertilizer.</i>

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.202
<i> I have nothing
 against potash</i>

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.271
<i> but this image I used
 to represent industry,</i>

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.972
<i> because industry is becoming
 a large straw</i>

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.641
<i> on Colorado River.</i>

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.875
Potash may not be
that terrible,

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:46.378
but oil and gas recently
has been picking up

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.181
significantly
in this part of the world.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.682
There was recently
a water auction

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.283
for... during drought

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.385
and all the farmers went
to the water auction to see

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:55.120
if they can get more water
through this drought year.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.156
And they were outbid
on every single count

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.991
by oil and gas companies.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.726
And one oil and
gas well can use

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.229
one to five million
gallons of water.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.831
<i> Just downstream is one
 of my favorite images.</i>

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:07.366
<i> I took this with my father.</i>

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.800
<i> We had to actually break
 into the airport</i>

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.470
<i> because to get here
 at sunrise,</i>

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.372
<i> the airport opened
 at sunrise,</i>

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.775
<i> so I had to crawl over the
 fence and let him in.</i>

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.644
<i> But this is a double oxbow
 naturally occurring,</i>

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.613
<i> and just downstream there,
 you come into, what I call</i>

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.015
<i> the seas of the desert'.</i>

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.617
<i> This is Lake Powell,
 the change is dramatic</i>

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:27.853
<i> the ecology of this river.</i>

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:29.621
<i> They say that it receives</i>

00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:32.424
<i> up to 1400
 cargo ship containers a day</i>

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:34.660
<i> of silt and sediment,
 that's basically the memory</i>

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.628
<i> of the Colorado Rockies
 falling down</i>

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.298
<i> and it gets deposited
 in this reservoir</i>

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:42.234
<i> which affects the fish
 and ecology downstream.</i>

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:45.170
And we are quickly finding out
how much sediment is in there

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.907
and what's happening because
the lake is dropping rapidly.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.376
We are in our second decade
of drought

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.479
<i> and that white line
 is the bathtub ring</i>

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.948
<i> on Lake Powell.
 It's about 75 feet.</i>

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.084
<i> Lake Powell is now
 at 51% capacity.</i>

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:00.252
<i> If you go there right now,</i>

00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:02.522
<i> it's dropping
 one to six inches a day.</i>

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.625
<i> And that's the dam,
 Glen Canyon dam.</i>

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.161
<i> It produces
a 120 million dollars in revenue</i>

00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:10.729
<i> through its
 hydroelectric program.</i>

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.097
<i> It goes back to
 Federal programs</i>

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:13.699
<i> for transmission lines
 and actually</i>

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.269
<i> native fish species programs
 downstream.</i>

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.070
<i> We are getting to
 such a point of</i>

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.540
<i> drought and
 water shortage that</i>

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.475
<i> we are approaching
 what is called 'Dead Pool'</i>

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.877
<i> when there isn't enough water
 to go over through</i>

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.079
<i> the turbines
 and spin those turbines.</i>

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:30.983
<i> Now just below that dam,
 starts the Grand Canyon.</i>

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:35.021
<i> It is 277 miles of one of
 the most enchanted places</i>

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.522
<i> on the planet
 that I've seen.</i>

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.690
<i> It's like going to
 another world of</i>

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.992
<i> geology and magic.</i>

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.894
<i> Of course,
 it is not real anymore</i>

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:43.529
<i> to some degree because
 this river fluctuates</i>

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.798
<i> through the habits
 and needs of man</i>

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.267
<i> as we have
 hydroelectric demands with</i>

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:50.303
<i> air conditioning
 and what not.</i>

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.071
It's called...

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.639
as a whole the Grand Canyon
is called as

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.041
'America's Roofless
Cathedral'.

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:58.944
<i> There is a proposal out there
 right now</i>

00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:02.381
<i> to build a 1.4 mile long
 tramway,</i>

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:05.784
<i> it will descend 1300 feet
 and carry 4000 people a day</i>

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.819
<i> into the Grand Canyon.</i>

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:11.156
Now, those of the people that
don't like to hike or boat,

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:13.559
may think that's great.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:16.896
However, it is also a sacred
confluence right there.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.998
Believed to be sacred
by the Hopi and the Zuni

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.766
and some of the Navajo,

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.968
so it is creating
a big controversy

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:24.670
and we are going to see
that play out

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.971
in the next few years.

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.907
<i> This is the
 humpback chub.</i>

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.308
<i> They've basically been
 swimming in this river</i>

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.010
<i> for 6000 years.</i>

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.278
<i> And now there is only
 about 6000 of them left,</i>

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:35.580
<i> because they like warm water
 and once we put that dam</i>

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.882
<i> and of course
 it is the cold water</i>

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:38.784
<i> coming up through the dam,
 so they've retreated</i>

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.119
<i> to this little confluence,
 it's milky color</i>

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:44.090
<i> because of its
 high calcium content.</i>

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.158
<i> There's four species of
 endangered fish left,</i>

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:47.960
<i> two have already
 gone extinct.</i>

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.763
<i> This is Nankoweap Point.</i>

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:53.532
<i> And those are the granaries
 of the Puebloans</i>

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.235
<i> that have been there
 since 1100 A.D.</i>

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:58.704
<i> And so many
 of the Native Americans</i>

00:08:58.704 --> 00:08:59.939
<i> who live around
 the Grand Canyon,</i>

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.440
<i> there are actually 11 tribes
 that surround</i>

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.442
<i> the Grand Canyon
 National Park,</i>

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:05.143
<i> and they believe
 that this is</i>

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.945
<i> where they came from
 and where they go.</i>

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:09.214
<i> This is their spirit world.</i>

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.716
And just to give you
a little idea behind

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.218
capturing
some of these images,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.887
I conceived this image
about five years ago,

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.389
when I went down there on
another trip,

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.891
but you have to...
first you have to get a permit

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.293
to get down there.
You get that,

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.761
then you go down
on the river trip,

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.596
then you have to secure
a camp site near the spot

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.130
because
you can't reserve those,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.732
it's 'first come first serve'.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.600
Then you have to hopefully
time your permit lines up

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.869
with the full moon,
then you have to go up

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.970
with some,
some high powered spotlights

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.639
because you can't go up
to the Granary,

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.175
so you've got to shine them
on a very specific tripod.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.443
And hope it all lines up
and boom!

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:41.146
That's what sometimes
one image can take.

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:45.417
Now, we may go through
whooping and hollering

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:47.219
as tourists
in the Grand Canyon, but

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:49.255
there are many people
who take it very seriously.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.991
<i> This is a Havasupai elder
 who has come down.</i>

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.726
<i> I happened to go down there
 this last spring</i>

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.294
<i> and it just
 coincided with</i>

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:58.664
<i> the Hopi, Zuni, Navajo and
 Hualapai spiritual trips.</i>

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.465
<i> That's partially funded by
 that money coming upstream</i>

00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:02.367
<i> from the Glen Canyon dam.</i>

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.470
<i> So, this is a big deal
 and of course, I asked him,</i>

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.038
<i> 'What do you think about
 all these people hooting and</i>

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.840
<i> hollering and having parties
 in the Grand Canyon?'</i>

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.941
<i> He says, 'Well, there's
 nothing I can do about it,</i>

00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:12.344
<i> but I just hope
 you respect it.'</i>

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:14.980
<i> In 1903, President Roosevelt</i>

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.616
<i> came to the South Rim
 of this Canyon.</i>

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.384
<i> It's on the right side,
 you can see the South Rim</i>

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:20.919
<i> and in the very right corner
 up there</i>

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.922
<i> and he says,
 'Leave it as it is.</i>

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.957
<i> The ages have been
 at work on this</i>

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.125
<i> and man can only mar it.'</i>

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:28.793
<i> And I think we've done
 a pretty good job,</i>

00:10:28.793 --> 00:10:31.363
<i> but the threats are
 definitely looming</i>

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:32.798
<i> in the distance to mar it.</i>

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.267
There's new development
that wants to be built up

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.202
all around the Grand Canyon,
there's water challenges,

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:38.637
there's this tramway.

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:40.872
Uranium mines have been trying
to get in there for a while,

00:10:40.872 --> 00:10:43.408
they've been fended off
for about 20 years.

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:45.344
But it's something
that's not going to go away

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.779
anytime soon if we don't keep
a close eye on it.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:49.448
<i> The river on the other hand,</i>

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:51.082
<i> we may have not done
 the best job</i>

00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:52.918
<i> of maintaining it
 through the Canyon.</i>

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.087
<i> Now the water color here
 is emerald green,</i>

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.855
<i> it looks beautiful,
 but it is not very natural,</i>

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:58.791
<i> and it just represents
 how we have changed</i>

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.792
<i> the dynamic of this river
 and of course that</i>

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:04.530
<i> clear waters eroding a lot
 of natural sand and sediment.</i>

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.132
<i> Now, this is one of
 the most storied rapids,</i>

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:09.635
<i> this is called the V-wave,
 if you can get through here</i>

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.403
<i> and not lose your oars,
 you're in great shape.</i>

00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:14.339
<i> I went through it with my
 brother in these boats</i>

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:16.509
<i> that some boatmen described
 as being built of</i>

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.343
<i> papier-mâché and
 baby bird bones.</i>

00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:20.045
( laughter )

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:22.481
<i> This is the 'oh crap' face
 of here we go</i>

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.016
<i> into the V-wave,
 I'm on the left,</i>

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.818
<i> my brother on the right,</i>

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:28.320
<i> he's got more of
 an 'oh crap' face.</i>

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.890
<i> This is 'Oh God, we've just...
 plan A has just gone sideways,</i>

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.592
<i> because
 we've just lost an oar,</i>

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.427
<i> we're going to plan B'.</i>

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:37.997
<i> This is
 'Oh we are going to die'</i>

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.598
<i> because we are going into
 the big kahuna wave now</i>

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:40.999
<i> with no oars.</i>

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.935
<i> We're taking this little tiny
 flimsy wooden boat,</i>

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:45.337
<i> through the middle
 of this giant rapid</i>

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:46.838
<i> and we realize
 we're about to flip.</i>

00:11:46.838 --> 00:11:49.942
So... we thought we were dead.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.910
But we made it somehow.
( laughter )

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.379
<i> Of course
 we smiled at the end.</i>

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.813
<i> It was the first time
 I got to show my brother</i>

00:11:54.813 --> 00:11:56.215
<i> the Grand Canyon,</i>

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.050
<i> it was a highlight for me
 because</i>

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.385
<i> this river on some levels,</i>

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.487
<i> there's an expression
 called, 'river capture'.</i>

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:04.857
where one watershed
will basically

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.858
out-erode another one
and capture its water

00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:08.493
and take it with you.

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:10.262
And essentially
what has happened to me is

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:12.264
I feel like the Colorado River
on some level

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.134
has captured my curiosity
and part of my soul,

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.735
so I keep going back,
so it was a real treat

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.336
to share with my brother.

00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:21.273
<i> When you leave
 the Grand Canyon you come</i>

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.009
<i> to Lake Mead, Hoover dam.
 You've all heard of this</i>

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:25.778
<i> remarkable piece of
 engineering</i>

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.379
<i> that they built in 1935,</i>

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.915
<i> it used to be the largest dam
 in the world.</i>

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:33.953
<i> And just like upstream, but
 even worse at this point,</i>

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:38.890
<i> Lake Mead is now at its
 all-time record low, 39%.</i>

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.761
<i> Las Vegas,</i>
which sits next to Lake Mead

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.862
and myself included
when I started this project,

00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:45.597
many of us point to Las Vegas,

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:48.200
the oasis dream,
the big problem.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.236
Their water intake is so close
to the water level now,

00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:52.805
Lake Mead, that they are
actually spending

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.240
a billion dollars to construct
the third straw.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.978
They are basically building
a bathtub drain,

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.580
from under here, all the way
back over to Vegas.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.114
Because if the water level
gets any closer

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:05.317
to their intake valve, by law

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.686
they might not be able to
use it.

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:08.821
So, we are fearing

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.490
some very significant changes
in infrastructure.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.993
Vegas at the same time,

00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:18.029
which is very interesting
to me when I learned this,

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.266
they wrote a law of the river
in 1922

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.068
which basically divvied up
the Colorado River into

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:27.106
seven states, they cut it up
into different pies,

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:30.208
and nobody... Vegas didn't
really exist in 1922,

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:33.311
so nobody expected there to be
this booming oasis dream.

00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:34.913
So, they didn't give them
very much water.

00:13:34.913 --> 00:13:37.983
<i> So, Vegas is now forced to
 use their water very wisely.</i>

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.885
<i> They recycle a lot of their
 fountains and pools,</i>

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.453
<i> they do mandatory
 pool coverings,</i>

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.555
<i> a lot of fountains are
 grey water,</i>

00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:45.090
<i> they've been taking</i>

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.060
the smart-scaping,
zero-scaping to another level.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.095
They realized 70%
of their water

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.963
<i> from the Colorado river is
 going to people's front lawns,</i>

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:53.298
<i> so they started a program</i>

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:55.066
<i> where they actually pay people</i>

00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.402
<i> $ 2 a square foot,
 and it is now a $ 1.50,</i>

00:13:57.402 --> 00:13:59.605
<i> to tear out their
 front lawn.</i>

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.773
<i> I took that first picture
 at 8 in the morning.</i>

00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:04.042
<i> I took that picture same day
 at 11.</i>

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:06.578
<i> Crew came in,
 ripped out the lawn,</i>

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:08.313
<i> gave the guy a check,
 and adios!</i>

00:14:08.313 --> 00:14:10.815
( laughter )

00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:13.352
<i> And the hope of course,
 is that the oasis dream</i>

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.188
<i> that many of us may love
 and enjoy</i>

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.490
<i> will be able to continue
 on some level but also</i>

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.926
<i> the oasis dream for
 critters like this,</i>

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.494
<i> the Rocky Mountain toad,</i>

00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:24.095
<i> that had a love affair
 with my camera</i>

00:14:24.095 --> 00:14:26.164
<i> when I was looking for
 humpback chub,</i>

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:30.202
<i> wouldn't leave me alone,
 they'll have water too.</i>

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:34.440
<i> The Gila River downstream,
 this was taken in 1936.</i>

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.743
<i> One of the last tributaries
 of the Colorado.</i>

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:38.810
<i> That's today.</i>

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.546
<i> That was taken
 by my friend Jon Waterman,</i>

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.316
<i> who paddled the length
 of the Colorado River.</i>

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:47.018
<i> And then we come back down
 into Yuma, Arizona,</i>

00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:48.486
<i> right before
 the Colorado River crosses</i>

00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:50.823
<i> over the
 US-Mexican border.</i>

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.224
<i> A massive amount of
 lettuce production here,</i>

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:55.260
<i> agriculture throughout
 the region, and so</i>

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.095
<i> if you are sitting there
 saying,</i>

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.930
'This is interesting, Pete,
Colorado river is beautiful

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.666
maybe I'll go raft it one day.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.467
But I mean, come on,
I've got plenty of water here

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:05.537
in Washington D.C.,
why does this concern me?'

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.405
It actually concerns all of us
on some level

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:09.141
because every piece of lettuce

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.375
that you buy
in the grocery store

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:11.976
in the months of
December and January

00:15:11.976 --> 00:15:13.779
come from the Colorado River.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.980
That's the only place
that supplies the nation.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.317
It's basically
the nation's salad bowl

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:19.918
comes from
this part of the world.

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.453
So, we all eat
the Colorado River

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.855
whether you are
aware of it or not.

00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:26.491
I grew up on a cattle ranch,

00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:29.494
<i> I'm not opposed
 to the production of beef,</i>

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:31.130
<i> if it is done wisely.</i>

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.431
<i> I don't know if this is
 the wisest method...</i>

00:15:33.431 --> 00:15:35.334
<i> having feedlots
 in the Imperial Valley</i>

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.603
<i> where it's 128 degrees.</i>

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.904
<i> So I think
 we need to start moving</i>

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.105
<i> towards smart agriculture.</i>

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.140
There are also some
antiquated laws

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.875
where if you don't use
your water, you will lose it.

00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:45.610
So, there are farmers
in this area that are growing

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.579
five-six cuttings of alfalfa

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.048
and actually shipping it
to Asia,

00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:51.517
because they don't want to
lose their water

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.985
even though
they don't need the money.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.319
So, in some ways
we are actually

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:55.621
<i> exporting some of our water</i>

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.223
in the form of
alfalfa to Asia.

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:00.291
And then you come after...

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.194
<i> to the last major dam
 of the river.</i>

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.562
<i> There are 12 major dams
 on the river.</i>

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.097
<i> This is the Morelos dam.</i>

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.866
<i> This is U.S-Mexican border,
 for 22 miles</i>

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:10.969
<i> the river becomes the border
 and runs due south.</i>

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:13.071
<i> And if you go below the dam,</i>

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:16.040
<i> which I did with Jon
 when he was paddling,</i>

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.942
<i> just two miles into Mexico,</i>

00:16:17.942 --> 00:16:20.679
<i> you come to the end
 of the river.</i>

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.314
<i> Ben Franklin said,</i>

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.216
<i> 'We learn the value of water
 when the well runs dry'.</i>

00:16:25.216 --> 00:16:27.186
<i> This is the well running dry.</i>

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:30.756
<i> This is what it looked like
 when I was paddling through.</i>

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:34.393
Jon Waterman:
What is this stuff?

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.861
Pete McBride: All I know is
I'm not that excited

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.663
to get into this water.

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:40.599
Jon Waterman:
So this is what's become

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.568
of the mighty Colorado?

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:43.869
Pete McBride: Yeah.

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:46.538
<i> So, we packed
 up our boats..</i>

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:50.108
<i> 90 miles shy of the sea
 and started walking.</i>

00:16:50.108 --> 00:16:51.643
<i> There were many times
 where I wondered</i>

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.745
<i> why the hell I was carrying
 a boat on my back.</i>

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:56.648
( laughter )

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.217
Pete McBride: The Colorado
River has run to the Sea

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.953
of Cortez for 6 million years,
not a single drop

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:04.623
of it has run naturally
to the sea since 1998.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.091
It was one of the largest

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:07.760
desert estuaries
in North America.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.194
This is the western
flank of it

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:11.429
<i> over on the Baja side.</i>

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:14.466
<i> 3000 square miles, jaguars,
 Cottonwood forests,</i>

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:17.368
<i> it took me two days
 to find this image.</i>

00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:22.074
<i> That's what
 we've changed it to.</i>

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.976
Some people say, 'Well,
who cares about the delta,

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:27.513
you know, who... why should we
put water down there?'

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:31.316
But I... can pretty much
guarantee this guy cares.

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:33.952
<i> 20,000 Cocopah Indians
 used to live in the delta.</i>

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:37.088
<i> This was their
 traditional fishing grounds.</i>

00:17:37.088 --> 00:17:38.556
<i> This guy learned to fish here.</i>

00:17:38.556 --> 00:17:40.658
<i> It's dried up in his lifetime.</i>

00:17:40.658 --> 00:17:42.427
<i> And I'm pretty sure
 if this happened to my river</i>

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:45.697
<i> in my backyard, I'd probably
 feel similar, feel frustrated.</i>

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:48.100
<i> Just to give you an idea
 where that is exactly,</i>

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.034
<i> this little red circle,</i>

00:17:50.034 --> 00:17:51.837
<i> it's in the center,
 that's the delta.</i>

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.805
<i> That little frappuccino pit
 I was paddling,</i>

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.875
<i> it is on the middle
 bottom-third of that circle.</i>

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.876
<i> So, I think if these rivers
 often as arteries,</i>

00:17:58.876 --> 00:18:00.879
<i> they help connect communities,</i>

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.147
<i> they actually help
 connect wildlife.</i>

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:04.683
<i> They support our agriculture.</i>

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:07.185
<i> They keep salinity
 in our water table at bay.</i>

00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:08.620
<i> Potentially you know,</i>

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.456
<i> they connect our human spirit
 on some level.</i>

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:15.994
<i> So, I think the Colorado
 today is</i>

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:18.396
<i> a very powerful metaphor
 on so many levels</i>

00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:19.864
<i> because it shows us</i>

00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:21.366
<i> what happens
 when we ask too much</i>

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:24.069
<i> of a limited resource,
 it disappears.</i>

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:27.005
<i> I ended here in the delta.</i>

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:29.707
<i> This last spring there was
 an experimental pulse flow,</i>

00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:31.910
<i> thanks to the hard work of
 very, very many</i>

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.145
<i> from a vast
 group of people</i>

00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:40.852
<i> and this is what
 became of the river.</i>

00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:44.155
<i> This was actually less than
 1% of the river's annual flow.</i>

00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:45.757
<i> It was Mexico's water,</i>

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:48.493
<i> it was part of a new
 agreement called 'Minute 319'.</i>

00:18:48.493 --> 00:18:50.362
Very interesting because, uh,

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.363
Mexico basically had
an earthquake

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.132
that fractured
its irrigation system.

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:57.435
They said, 'We need some help.
We can't store water anywhere.

00:18:57.435 --> 00:18:59.571
It is time to work together
for a change'.

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.740
So, they went to the U.S.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.443
And this is two miles in

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:07.278
<i> This about where that
 frappuccino pit was.</i>

00:19:07.278 --> 00:19:08.880
<i> Beautiful scene of people
 coming out</i>

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.983
<i> from all over Mexico.</i>

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.617
<i> Not only restoring
 the vegetation,</i>

00:19:12.617 --> 00:19:14.753
<i> but the spirit of the river.</i>

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:15.887
Anyway, Mexico said

00:19:15.887 --> 00:19:17.288
'We need help'
and U.S said 'Alright'.

00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:18.856
So, they came back
to the table and said

00:19:18.856 --> 00:19:20.759
'Alright, We are going
to renegotiate Mexico's water,

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:23.094
they do get an allocation,
but now they are gonna

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:25.496
make sure that
Mexico's allocation is

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:27.799
shares in surplus
and shortage

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.068
and that they will dedicate
some water to the delta.

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.970
So, this was that water
dedicated.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.038
It was released for
eight weeks to see how it did

00:19:34.038 --> 00:19:36.941
to try to spawn
some of the seedlings,

00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:41.780
cottonwoods, and willows,
and it was pretty remarkable.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.982
We took paddle boards
and canoes

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:45.817
<i> all the way across it.</i>

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.986
<i> In 1922, Aldo Leopold</i>

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.221
<i> took a canoe across the delta
 and he wrote,</i>

00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:52.190
'The river was nowhere
and everywhere',

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.593
for he could not--
for he could not decide

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:58.229
which of a hundred green
lagoons to take to the sea.

00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.931
Beautiful line that I've used

00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:01.899
over and over at water talks
about the Colorado River,

00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:03.868
and I never ever thought that

00:20:03.868 --> 00:20:05.770
I would actually see this
and paddle

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.239
across a green lagoon
in the delta.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:08.807
So, it is very encouraging
to see

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.876
that we can make a change.

00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:18.216
( music )

00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:19.718
Male 1: We gonna have to go
over that.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.286
Pete McBride: Not good.

00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:26.491
<i> This is an improvement.
 I swear.</i>

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.993
You're moving.

00:20:28.993 --> 00:20:31.295
( speaking in Spanish )

00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:35.500
This is called moving an inch...
an hour.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.836
<i> Bushwhacking this terrain</i>

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.805
<i> in a trickle of water
 with the paddleboard</i>

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.374
<i> is an upgrade. Trust me.</i>

00:20:43.374 --> 00:20:45.944
What are we doing here?

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.346
<i> The last time
 I came here,</i>

00:20:48.346 --> 00:20:50.782
<i> I walked 90 miles
 across the dry,</i>

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:53.218
<i> forgotten river channel.</i>

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:56.721
<i> My backyard river,
 the Colorado...</i>

00:20:56.721 --> 00:21:00.425
<i> I have been chasing its flow
 for years.</i>

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.462
<i> Most people think of it
 as that loved</i>

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.363
<i> architect of the
 Grand Canyon,</i>

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:08.032
<i> carrying the memory
 of the Rocky Mountains</i>

00:21:08.032 --> 00:21:11.303
<i> near my home in Colorado.</i>

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:13.972
<i> But it is different down here
 at the end,</i>

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:16.341
<i> where severe plumbing
 on this southwest lifeline</i>

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.209
<i> have sucked it dry,</i>

00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:21.046
<i> so we can eat baby spinach
 in January.</i>

00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:28.119
<i> But in the spring of 2014,
 something happened.</i>

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:30.288
<i> Two countries decided
 to work together</i>

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.124
<i> to restore a delta.</i>

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.658
<i> The hands of many
 lifted the gates</i>

00:21:33.658 --> 00:21:35.627
<i> on the Morelos Dam</i>

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.628
<i> and released a temporary
 pulse of water.</i>

00:21:37.628 --> 00:21:39.931
<i> Less than 1%
 of the river's flow.</i>

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.933
<i> Mexico's allocated agua</i>

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:44.168
<i> into the delta
 to see what happened.</i>

00:21:44.168 --> 00:21:48.072
<i> A river of sand became wet
 once again.</i>

00:21:48.072 --> 00:21:50.775
<i> And a fiesta ignited
 down downstream.</i>

00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:54.146
( music )

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.786
<i> Locals celebrated
 the return of their Rio.</i>

00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:05.123
( music )

00:22:11.629 --> 00:22:16.000
<i> The native species
 exploded with seeds.</i>

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.937
<i> The river party only lasted
 a few weeks though.</i>

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:22.006
( music )

00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:25.409
<i> Partake? We did what
 any river lover would do.</i>

00:22:25.409 --> 00:22:30.549
<i> We floated it,
 by canoe, paddleboard,</i>

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:33.051
<i> and eventually slogged it
 by foot,</i>

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:34.686
<i> crossing the shallows.</i>

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.220
I believe
this is the Colorado,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.089
it is hard to tell
because generally

00:22:38.089 --> 00:22:40.792
the Rio Colorado had no water.

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:43.561
But as you can see,

00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:47.999
it is a pretty frigging
nice river right now.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.701
Male 2: It looks amazing.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.903
Usually,
this part of the river

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.472
is completely dry,
it's sand always,

00:22:54.472 --> 00:22:56.941
and it has been many years
like that.

00:22:56.941 --> 00:22:59.044
<i> Now on May 7th,</i>

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:03.414
<i> after nine 13-hour long
 paddling days...</i>

00:23:03.414 --> 00:23:04.949
Male 3: I'm so tired,
I can barely stand.

00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:06.618
<i> We crossed 90 miles
 of the delta</i>

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:08.253
<i> and reached the sea.</i>

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.288
<i> It was the first and
 only paddleboard crossing</i>

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.423
<i> of the new delta.</i>

00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:14.258
<i> And the first time
 the Colorado River</i>

00:23:14.258 --> 00:23:17.729
<i> kissed the sea
 in nearly two decades.</i>

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.798
<i> On many levels it was
 a preposterous journey,</i>

00:23:20.798 --> 00:23:23.401
<i> foolish, or even
 wrong headed...</i>

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.170
I don't feel like
I'm getting anywhere.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.341
<i> It was also beautiful
 and symbolic.</i>

00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:33.044
<i> That with a relative trickle,</i>

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:35.379
<i> we can bring a river
 back to life...</i>

00:23:35.379 --> 00:23:37.215
<i> if we try.</i>

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:40.718
<i> ( applause )</i>

00:23:40.718 --> 00:23:44.389
<i> ( outro music )</i>
