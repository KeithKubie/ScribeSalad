00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.130
Configuration is a kind of design

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.340
that assigns values to variables
to satisfy certain constraints.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.060
Design in general can be very
complex and sometimes very creative.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.300
Configuration is a kind
of very routine design.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.830
The kind of everyday mundane design,
which is very very common.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310
While in design in the beginning,
you do not know the components or

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.560
the arrangement of
components looks like.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.910
In configuration,
you already know all the components.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.540
You simply have to figure out
an arrangement that will satisfy

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.660
constraints.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.490
As an example,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.860
consider the furniture in the room
in which you are sitting right now.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.430
All the components, all the pieces
of furniture are already known.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.440
The room is fixed.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.100
You can't change the room either.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.910
But you certainly can move
the furniture around.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.820
There might be some constraints.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090
For example,
if the room has a couch and a TV,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.120
then you might impose a constraint that
a couch has to be in front of the TV and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.320
a certain number of feet away from it.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.220
Given the constraint that all the
furniture must somehow fit into the room

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.730
as well as the constraint that the TV
must be in front of the couch,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.180
you might first decide to place the TV
and the couch at specific locations.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750
And then having decided on
the location of the TV and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.350
the couch, decide on the location
of the other pieces of furniture.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.660
David, given the configuration is so
common, can you think of other examples?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.130
&gt;&gt; So, it seems like we could talk a lot
about the physical arrangement of things

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.390
in different types of rooms.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.010
For example, when an airline
configures a new airplane they

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.600
have to configure the arrangement of the
seats, the arrangement of the window,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.810
the arrangement of the emergency
exits and various things like that.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.800
But I think configuration really goes
beyond just configuring the physical

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.330
layout of items.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.420
So, when I'm taking a picture with
my camera phone, for example,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.310
I have to configure different
options like the focus, whether or

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.980
not the flash is on, my distance to
what I'm taking a picture of, and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.320
a few other different things like that.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.580
In doing so I'm still balancing
different restrictions.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
So, for example, if I'm taking a picture
of a landmark I can only be so

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.690
close to it.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.100
And therefore I might need to make
different decisions based on the focus

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.900
or the flash in order afford for
how far I can be from the landmark.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.230
&gt;&gt; Design in general is a very common
information processing activity.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.040
And configuration is the most
common type of design.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.340
Now that we have looked at
the definition of a configuration task,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.580
we're going to look at methods for
addressing that task.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.990
Once again recall that the components in
case of configuration are already known.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.740
We are deciding on the arrangement
of those components.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.900
We are assigning values to specific
variables of those components, for

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.730
example, sizes.
