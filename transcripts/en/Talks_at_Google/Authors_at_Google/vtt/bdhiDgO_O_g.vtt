ALLISON: OK, hello and
welcome, everybody,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.540
to today's Authors
at Google Talk.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.520
I'm incredibly excited
to be welcoming

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.590
Liz Wiseman, bestselling author
of the book "Multipliers."

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.320
And now here with us
today to talk about

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.570
her new and latest
content, "Rookie Smarts,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.760
Why Learning Beats Knowing
in the New Game of Work."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.750
We've been incredibly
lucky to work with Liz

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.160
over the last few
months, as she's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.970
been looking at this content.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.970
And I'm incredibly
excited for the content

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.850
that she'll be sharing with you
over the next 30, 35 minutes.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.720
So welcome, Liz.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.880
LIZ WISEMAN: Thank you, Allison.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.360
Thank you for being
here and tuning in.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.520
This book, really, is Part
Two of my post-Oracle therapy.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.850
So I want to start at the
very beginning of my career.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.580
I began Oracle right
out of business school,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.760
and all of my training
was in business.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.260
Now, I had taken a Fortran
class and I had worked as a TA

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.810
in the computer lab, and so
that somehow seemed like enough

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.380
for Oracle to give me my
very first job teaching

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.270
programming to all of the
new computer science grads

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.540
that we were hiring from
the best universities out

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.780
of the best programs.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.210
And so I got to teach
programming to programmers,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.070
knowing next to nothing
about programming.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.330
And it was a really
interesting, wild ride.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.139
And then my second
job at Oracle was

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:27.430
to run the training department.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.940
So I'm a year out
of school, and they

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.420
say, Liz, the company's
growing like crazy.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.700
We need to train our workforce,
which is growing rapidly.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.860
You are now the training
manager for the company,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.970
and Larry Ellison wants
a corporate university,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480
so go build Oracle University.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.830
And I knew even less
about doing that than I

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.500
did about teaching programming.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.780
And really, with actually no
ideas of my own to draw upon,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.160
I started to kind of
reach out and talk

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.910
to all the other
executives and figure out

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.880
what really needed to be done
to transfer knowledge and grow

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.540
this rapidly-growing
software company.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.680
Although my self-confidence
was probably high,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.050
my situational confidence
could not have been lower.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.540
So I stayed really
close to my stakeholders

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.220
and worked in thin
little pieces,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.640
getting feedback along the way.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.000
We kept things really
simple, because at this point

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.310
I didn't know enough to
even complexify things.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.320
That was my second job.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.800
And so, my career at Oracle
went on and on with very similar

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.740
kind of roles, being
asked to do things

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.890
I knew almost nothing about.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.390
Just at the point
where I'm starting

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.430
to feel like I know how to do
my job, 16 years into my career

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.910
it occurs to me that, finally,
for the very first time

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.540
in my career, I have a
job I'm qualified for.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.760
And it felt awful.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.840
It felt disappointing.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.210
It felt sure, it felt easy.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.700
So it was then that I left
the cradle of my career

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.630
and went out to do
something that I didn't yet

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.570
know how to do.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.530
And as I left Oracle, I felt
unsure and I felt vulnerable.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.390
And it wasn't because I was
stepping out into the unknown.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.850
I felt unsure because
I felt as if I

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.510
was carrying a
liability with me.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.024
And I started to
wonder, how might

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:29.620
what I know get in the
way of what I don't know?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.820
And about this time, a friend
of mine asked this question.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.150
He said, Liz what's the
question that you're

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.810
going to hold for
this next year?

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.170
And I wrote this question down.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.070
How does what we
know get in the way

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.830
of what we don't know,
but perhaps need to learn?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.849
Because I could see that
the world is changing.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.390
And that's really
the question that I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.740
want us to explore
together today.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.500
Is there power in not
knowing how to do something?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.480
Can being inexperienced
actually be an advantage,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.840
and can it be an advantage right
now, when the world of work

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.930
is changing really fast?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.870
And this is an interesting
place to be talking about this.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.270
We all feel it.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.860
We feel that the amount of
information is increasing.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.089
More and more people are
getting access to it,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.000
and technology's allowing
our business cycles

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.930
to spin faster and faster.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.680
And our innovation cycles are
spinning faster and faster,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.110
too, which means,
what we know doesn't

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.820
stay true for very long.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.890
That knowledge is also
becoming obsolete faster.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.390
As I was doing my
research, I pulled

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.380
a few data points together
and did some calculations

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.799
and realized that if you
work in STEM-- in technology,

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.090
in science, like virtually
everyone here on this campus

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.760
does-- what we know
today, about 15% of that

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.570
is likely to be
relevant in five years.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.570
In this environment, perhaps
the speed at which we learn

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.380
is more valuable
than what we know.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.610
So it was with this
broad curiosity

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.040
that I set out to
do my research.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.500
And Elise Foster, who's a
member of my research team,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.980
is here today.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.940
And what we did
is, we studied how

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700
experienced people versus
inexperienced people

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.270
approach their work.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.070
And I want to share
that with you.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.950
Before I share the results of
what we found in the research,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.870
I want you to spend a
little bit of time thinking

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.420
about when you were a rookie.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.860
And what I mean
by rookie is, when

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.700
you are new to something
important and hard.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.540
Doing something important and
hard for the very first time.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.300
And I'm going to ask you to
go back, to go back in time,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.900
go back in place to when you
were in a rookie assignment.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.620
And I'm going to
ask you to lock that

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.880
in and start to
think about that.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.820
And let me share with
you one such rookie move,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.510
one of many stories
of inexperience

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.390
and the value of that that
came out of my research.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.230
This is Stephanie DiMarco.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.360
She graduated in 1979
from the University

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.780
of California Berkeley.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.730
Graduates from Cal.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.870
She takes a job in the financial
services industry where

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.430
she works for a
small trading firm,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.330
and her job is to keep track
of the trading for this firm.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.770
And very quickly she
finds out that this

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.950
is a really difficult
job to do manually.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.410
This is just the beginning of
the era of enterprise computing

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.730
and automation.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.550
She can see what's
happening around her.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.320
She goes to her
management and advocates

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.230
that they automate this process.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.190
Now, at the time, the
computing industry

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.880
was dominated by what
we call "big iron."

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.450
Deck minicomputers the
size of a delivery truck,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.830
housed in a data center,
controlled by air conditioners,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.680
with a price tag of $30,000.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.260
It was the standard computing
platform at the time.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.170
Well, $30,000 is a pretty hefty
price tag for this small firm.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.790
Now meanwhile, the computer
wars are starting to wage.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.280
And actually, Stephanie with
this work that she begins,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.940
finds herself right in
the middle of these wars,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.220
because in the early
'80s, IBM comes out

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.090
with the first
personal computer.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.790
Can't do much.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.270
Everyone considers it a toy.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.350
Don't even think it
has a hard drive.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.880
It's got a price tag of $1,500.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.050
Well, within a couple
release cycles,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.860
IBM is offering a PC
that costs $5,000 that

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.090
has the same computing power
as this Deck minicomputer

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.350
with the price tag of $30,000.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.050
And Stephanie says,
well, why can't we

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.610
build these information systems
and these automation systems

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.780
on a PC?

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.460
And what do the
industry pundits say?

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.960
It's a ridiculous idea.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.730
That's a toy.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.040
You can't build robust,
scalable, secure information

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.400
systems to track financial
trading on a toy.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.690
Well, what Stephanie sees
is not only something that

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.510
seems possible, it
seems inevitable to her.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.870
She, with a partner, starts
a firm, Advent Software,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.020
with the goal of building these
high-performance information

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.565
systems on a low-cost
computing platform.

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:26.900
This is a picture
of Stephanie at one

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.960
of the early trade shows.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.350
She recalls someone referring to
Advent Software as that company

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.090
from California that's
using baby computers

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.360
and run by a little girl.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.620
Well, Stephanie and her
team built the product,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.250
and within a year they've
now got a working product.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.090
And soon they have a customer.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.920
And two customers,
and three customers,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.600
and they're building
customers one at a time.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.760
And soon, Stephanie
is schlepping

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.150
through the streets
of Manhattan,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.810
calling on financial services
firms and selling this product.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.260
This is Stephanie today.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.930
She took the company
public, and the company now

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.690
has a market capitalization
of $1.5 billion,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.710
managing trillions of
dollars worth of assets.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.290
This value and this
wealth creation,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:22.130
because one person, who was
new, under-qualified, but could

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.810
see something that
everybody else missed.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.810
She stepped down as
the CEO of Advent

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.680
to make room for the next
generation of leaders.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.497
A rookie move.

00:09:34.497 --> 00:09:35.080
A rookie move.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.810
Perhaps not a sign
of a mistake, a goof,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.750
a clumsy kind of bumbling
move, but perhaps a rookie move

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.730
is brilliant about to happen.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.275
Have you been thinking about
one of your rookie moves?

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:52.900
Because I'm going to
ask you to kind of

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.410
join me in this conversation.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.910
And what I want you
to do is, I want

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.660
you to start by
teleporting yourself.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.410
And I mean "Star
Trek Enterprise."

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.360
Get into that teleporter
and take yourself

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.590
back to when you were new to
something important and hard.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.670
And if you're here on
campus, you've got a handout.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.840
You can flip it over.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.340
There's a few
questions on the back.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.320
If you are watching
this, I'm going

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.810
to pop up a few questions.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.018
Here's what I want you to do.

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.670
I want you to take two
minutes and identify

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.630
one of these rookie challenges,
and answer these questions.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.020
And let me pop these up here.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.220
What could you see that
other people couldn't see?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.840
Who did you seek
out for guidance?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.740
What did you do to
prove yourself quickly?

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.620
How did you get feedback and
how did you stay on track?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.730
And how to recover
from mistakes?

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.300
So let me give you just a couple
minutes to reflect on that.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.505
See if you can answer as
many of these as possible,

00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:48.880
and then I want
to hear from you.

00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:55.230
OK, let me ask you share
some of the observations

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.920
from your own rookie experience.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.170
Some of you may have gone
back many, many years-- maybe

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.920
even decades-- to when you were
brand new to the workforce.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.970
Some of you may have gone
back just a couple weeks,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.410
when you're a mature,
experienced professional,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.470
but you are tackling
something that you've never

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.490
attempted before.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.740
Tell me about your experience.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.880
What did you do?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.380
Well, could you
first start me with,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.296
what could you see that
other people couldn't?

00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:24.712
And just shout it out.

00:11:24.712 --> 00:11:27.722
AUDIENCE: Technology [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:29.930
LIZ WISEMAN: So you saw new
technology on the horizon

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.240
that other people
didn't know existed.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.910
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.028
LIZ WISEMAN: What else could you
see that other people couldn't?

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:36.942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.942 --> 00:11:39.400
LIZ WISEMAN: So you could see
new tools, new methodologies.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.890
Who did you seek out?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.610
How did you stay on track?

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.942
Just shout it out.

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.681
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:47.681 --> 00:11:48.430
LIZ WISEMAN: Yeah.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.745
The need to move quickly,
and to create a prototype

00:11:50.745 --> 00:11:52.360
and prove the relevance.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.200
It's one of the things
that we've found,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.230
is that when people are
brand new to their work,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.580
they tend to work
in thin slices.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.496
What else did you do to get
feedback, to prove yourself?

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:04.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.328
LIZ WISEMAN: Yeah, shared
results more quickly,

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:08.860
because we're trying to get
feedback to stay on track.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.870
Any other thoughts about
reflecting on your own work

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.975
experience and what you did?

00:12:13.975 --> 00:12:17.340
Let me share with you what
we found in our research.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.630
So we studied about 400
scenarios, pieces of work,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.760
ranging from develop a
training class to troubleshoot

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.080
an escalated issue, to
build a corporate campus.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.610
Actually, a campus
like here at Google.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.710
And we looked at
how people operated,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.800
how they thought about
their work, what they did,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.280
and how they performed,
asking managers to rate

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.610
an experienced person
versus an inexperienced.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.360
Here's what we found in studying
those different scenarios.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.930
The first thing we found is
that experience obviously

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.680
has some upsides.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.690
As we gain experience,
we gain knowledge.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.820
We amass more data
points that gives us

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.510
greater power of intuition.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.510
We build confidence.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.980
We build credibility.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.110
We often amass resources
that prove very helpful.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.170
But there's also a number
of troubling downsides

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.420
and blind spots.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.560
What happens once
you know the pattern?

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.470
What happens?

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.100
AUDIENCE: You follow it.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.516
LIZ WISEMAN: You
follow a pattern.

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:20.070
You say, I've seen this before.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.932
And you follow it.

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:22.890
It's actually one of the
signs of intelligence,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.480
is how quickly we can spot
patterns and follow them.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.670
Is there someone here
in the room, preferable

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.890
with a big, loud voice,
who can read this for us?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.402
OK, right here.

00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:39.110
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
matter in what order

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.436
the letters in a word appear.

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:43.625
The only important thing is
that the first and last letter

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:46.800
are in the right place.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.271
The rest can be a total
mess and you can still

00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:50.270
read it without problem.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.980
LIZ WISEMAN: OK, and
keep going for us.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.038
AUDIENCE: Similarly, your mind
is reading this automatically,

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:58.370
without even thinking about it.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.980
LIZ WISEMAN: What happens
once we know the pattern?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.544
What does our mind do?

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:05.900
AUDIENCE: Fill in blanks.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.220
LIZ WISEMAN: We start
to fill in the blanks.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.678
And sometimes we
fill in the blanks

00:14:08.678 --> 00:14:11.790
with what we want to see,
rather than what's there.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.230
Often, once we know we know
that there's a pattern,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.480
we overlook mistakes.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.550
Hence why none of us really
can copy edit our own writing.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.680
Often, once we know the
answer or the pattern,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.380
we stop seeing new data points.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.770
We stop seeing
new possibilities,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.190
new tools, new methodologies.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.990
Often we stop seeking out input.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.380
We often stop seeking feedback.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:43.030
And with experience inevitably
comes bad experience.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.960
What happens once we
develop scar tissue?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.700
Now, we all know what
physical scar tissue is,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.950
and we've all got our scars.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.610
I have a couple scars on
my knee that remind me,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.260
don't race your husband
down Wildcat at Alta.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.970
Landed me in emergency surgery.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.839
ACL reconstruction.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.380
And I think about
that every time I'm

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.420
at the top of a mogul run.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.760
But what does professional
scar tissue look like?

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.710
When someone suggests
something and you've

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.470
had a bad experience with this.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.850
Quickly the hands
go up, we stop that.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.930
I've done that before.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.360
It did not work out.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.586
Well, it's as if they touch
this very sensitive scar tissue,

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:24.960
and it creates a
set of blinders.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.350
The other thing we've found
is that ignorance actually

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.370
can drive top performance.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.530
And by ignorance I
don't mean stupidity.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:40.270
By ignorance, I mean
intelligent lack of knowledge.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.736
And rather than
share lots of data

00:15:41.736 --> 00:15:44.236
points that we've found from
the research, what I want to do

00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:47.400
is just kind of
walk with me up what

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.720
it's like when we're climbing
a steep learning curve,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.590
and contrast it to
how we tend to operate

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.757
when we have experience.

00:15:52.757 --> 00:15:54.590
Now, at the beginning
of this learning curve

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.410
is kind of the
phase of ignorance.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.370
And this is where, truly,
ignorance is bliss.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.810
And we're asked to
do something hard,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.930
or maybe forced to do
something new and hard,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.430
and we're telling ourselves,
how hard can that be?

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.850
I've got this.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.890
Because we don't
know how hard it is,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.710
often we just venture out.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.200
We see this kind of gentle
learning curve, and we embark.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.110
But once we get
out there, we start

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.350
to get our very first answer to
that question, and we find out,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.330
it's actually
really, really hard.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.550
And we start to look
around, and what do we see?

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.100
We see the curve
getting steeper.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.640
We start to see the gap.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.860
The gap between what we
know and what we can do,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.530
and what our peers
are able to do,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.140
or what's needed for the job.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.130
And this is where,
typically, we start to panic.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.570
We start to panic,
and it's a panic

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.040
that either causes us to hold
back and get frozen in place,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.751
or to propel ourselves
up this learning curve.

00:16:57.751 --> 00:17:00.000
We kind of start out in what
I call "backpacker mode,"

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.630
unencumbered.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.360
But once we're out there
in this state of awareness,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.829
we start to look
for who can help us,

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.750
and we move into what I think
is the most powerful form

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.200
of learning, is
desperation learning.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.290
We don't learn because
there's a talk on campus.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.089
We don't learn because there's
a course or a curriculum

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:21.131
or a competence model.

00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:21.839
When do we learn?

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.609
We learn when we have to.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.552
We learn when it's too
painful not to learn.

00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:31.010
And this is where we kick into
what I call "hunter-gatherer

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.509
mode."

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.790
We're looking around, because we
now understand how hard it is.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.902
And we're looking
around for who can help.

00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:39.860
There's got to be someone
who knows what we do.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.590
And we tend to go into
this seeking mode.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.970
We found in the research
that, on average,

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.120
inexperienced people
seek out expertise

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.240
at five times the level
of experienced people.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.470
In other words, if you ask an
experienced person to do a job,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.410
you tend to get one
person's expertise.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.880
But when you ask
a rookie, someone

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.260
who doesn't know
what they're doing,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
you tend to get five
people's expertise brought

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.360
to bear on the problem.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.790
A more diverse view of
expertise, and often

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.750
a more current view.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.610
We then go into what I call
"firewalker mode," because we

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.190
are anxious at this stage.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.380
We still have a huge gap
that we've got to close.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.830
And so anxious, we
operate cautiously,

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.200
kind of taking
very careful steps.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.030
But we're also anxious
to prove ourselves,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.980
and so-- as Allison
said-- we operate quickly,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.020
kind of like the way someone
would walk the hot coals.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.320
Very cautious about
what you've got to do,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.420
but moving very, very
quickly across those coals.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.380
And then, once we're
out on this frontier,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.310
there's not really
an option to go back.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.200
Meaning, we're either
so far out there,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.230
everyone knows we're doing it,
we've got to figure this out,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.420
or they've just
back-filled your job

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.130
and you don't really have
a place to retreat to.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:08.560
We go into pioneer mode--
improvising, hungry, scrappy--

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.330
where we work in simple
ways, focusing on the basics.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.772
Doing what we need
to to survive.

00:19:14.772 --> 00:19:16.480
And then in comes the
contribution phase.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.040
And what we found is,
when we're inexperienced,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.930
when we contribute we
often contribute big.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.067
When we looked at how
experienced versus

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:28.650
inexperienced people
operate, we found

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.900
that, in broad industries,
people with experience

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.210
outperform people without
experience by a small margin.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.460
That's no surprise.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.760
But when we cut that data
by the knowledge industries,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.880
we find that people
without experience

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.290
tend to outperform
people with experience,

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.070
particularly when the work
is innovative in nature

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.285
and in speed.

00:19:49.285 --> 00:19:49.910
They're faster.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.790
But then, here's
the unexplored part

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.300
of the S curve, the part that
we often don't talk about.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.230
We've been on this rapid ascent.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.070
Learning fast, contributing big.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.810
And we think it's
going to continue.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.190
Often, we find ourselves
getting comfortable.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.540
Comfortable in
our own knowledge.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.070
We end up sort of
protecting the status quo.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.910
Protecting, perhaps,
the resources,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.100
the teams that we've built.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.194
Often we end up guiding,
advising, mentoring

00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:28.735
other people.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.650
We tend to pace ourselves.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.340
Rather than moving
fast, we're consistent

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.690
and we pace ourselves
where sometimes people

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.900
are sprinting around us.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.290
And we settle in, often
reusing what's available,

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:50.600
rather than reinventing
and inventing new things.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.150
As Kahlil Gibran, the
Lebanese poet, said,

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.150
comfort is a stealthy thing.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.400
It enters as a guest,
then becomes a host,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.510
and then eventually
becomes a master.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.500
And this is where the
blinders can start to kick in.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.870
I was studying these rookies.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.920
And again, by rookies I don't
mean young, or millennials.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.100
I mean the way we
operate when we

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.630
are new to something
important and hard.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.130
I found this really
interesting breed of rookies

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.560
that I came to call
"perpetual rookies."

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.180
People with deep experience,
with years of mastery,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.870
and with a lot of
success behind them

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.540
were able to retain what I
call their "rookie smarts."

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.200
And it's not that
they stay perpetually

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.090
in this state of naivete.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.370
It's that they
know how to toggle.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.630
They know when it's time to
draw upon their hard-won wisdom

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.810
and experience and bring
that to bear on a problem,

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.820
but they can also use their side
of their professional skills

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.880
and their mind that thinks
and acts like a rookie.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.490
When I studied
these professionals,

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.198
I had a number of
common characteristics.

00:22:09.198 --> 00:22:10.940
What might you expect to see?

00:22:14.047 --> 00:22:16.380
I found it interesting, because
a number of these things

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.920
are top of the hiring
profile here at Google.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.140
What would you expect?

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.990
These perpetual
rookies, they are?

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.770
AUDIENCE: Curious.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.320
LIZ WISEMAN: Curious.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.230
First and foremost,
intellectually curious.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.070
What else?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.180
AUDIENCE: Quirky.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.170
LIZ WISEMAN: Quirky.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.003
Yeah, you know what?

00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:36.570
I'm going to call that playful.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.600
I found them to be
extremely playful.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.130
And it's not the kind of playful
of Foosball tables and ping

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.130
pong tables and
slides, necessarily.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.220
It's not about bringing play
into the work environment.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.550
It's that work is play.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.880
That it's fun.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.870
That it's this
process of discovery.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.770
It's actually this joyful thing.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.900
When you've got that
playful orientation,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.286
how do you deal with
mistakes and failure?

00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:06.410
We found them to be humble.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.800
And not necessarily someone
who has a low sense of self.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.710
Not at all.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:16.170
A word that I might
use is "teachable."

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.180
We found that they
learn, maybe what

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.280
we might call "in 360
degrees," that they

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.150
can learn from anyone
in the organization.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.520
They're being taught by everyone
around them, even the novices.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.850
Even the amateurs.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.250
And lastly, we found them to
be particularly deliberate.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:33.890
Mindful.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.660
Very aware of what
they were doing.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.090
And not only aware
of how they approach

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.440
their work, but aware
of how they maintain

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.500
this youthful orientation.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.640
I'm going to share a
couple of the rookies,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.090
the perpetual rookies that
I came in to encounter.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.590
The first is Bob Hurley, the
founder of Hurley Sports.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.370
And as Bob shared
with me his story

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.650
in building this company-- the
surf, skate, action apparel

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.860
company-- he said, at every
juncture building this company

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.039
I had no clue what I was
doing, and it turned out

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:12.830
to be an advantage.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.550
And he told me this story
of building this company

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.540
with a series of what I
might call rookie moves.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.809
But the real interesting story
was, how does he maintain this?

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:24.350
The company's been
wildly successful.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.530
He's now a mature professional.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:33.280
The company's part of the
Nike family of companies.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.280
And he has this wonderful
youthful, joyful way--

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.440
and hungry way-- an intolerance
of mediocrity in the company.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.620
He said, I have my
days where I'm stuck.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.350
Absolutely stuck in a rut.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.270
Feeling complacent.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.952
Not able to see
things differently.

00:24:49.952 --> 00:24:51.410
He said, I remembered
an experience

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.930
I had many years ago
on Huntington Beach.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.620
And he described this
encounter he had with a surfer

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.835
who went by the name Rabbit.

00:24:58.835 --> 00:25:02.110
It was Wayne Bartholomew.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.390
So Bob started his
career as a surfer,

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.730
and actually shaping surfboards.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.190
And he's out surfing
one day, and Bob's

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.400
on kind of this outer edge of
this group of elite surfers.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.080
Huntington Beach,
it sounds to me

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.120
like it's more of a
clique in a high school.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.480
And there's the prime waves
where the elite surfers

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.457
operate, and then there's
kind of the lesser waves.

00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:27.040
And there are sort of degrees
of surfers and degrees of waves,

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.920
and he's surfing
on the prime waves

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.730
with these elite
professional surfers.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.620
He loses his board.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.300
The board goes under
the pier, so he

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.600
swims under the
pier to go get it.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.450
And over in the small waves,
in the inferior waves,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.900
he sees Rabbit.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.500
And he looks at him.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.650
Rabbit was the reigning world
champion surfer at the time,

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.875
from Australia.

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:55.110
And he looks over he says--
I'm a native Californian,

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.560
so I probably should be
able to do this well.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.690
I might not be.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.940
But he says to him something
to the effect of, like, dude,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.290
you're a legend.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.540
What are you doing over there?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.330
Come on, come surf
over here with us.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.480
The waves are righteous.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.920
And Rabbit says to him, he goes,
well, that's kind of you, mate,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.120
but I like to surf over
here with the kids.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.760
It's where I get my energy.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.350
And Bob has always
remembered that,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.900
and he says, those days
where I'm absolutely stuck

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.530
and I can't see
things differently,

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.475
and I've lost my sense
of joy-- he said, I go

00:26:28.475 --> 00:26:30.660
and I surf with the amateurs.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.350
And he does it literally.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.790
He'll grab his board.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.160
Go down to the beach.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.340
And not to surf with the
Hurley-sponsored professionals

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.270
that he knows.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.340
He goes down and finds the
newcomers, the unknowns

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.610
on the beach, and
he surfs with them.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.820
And it rebuilds his energy.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.070
And he said, some days
the waves aren't great,

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.170
or I don't have time
to grab my board.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.030
He said, all I do is,
I walk down the hall

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.780
and I find the rookies
in my organization.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.740
The interns.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.910
The new college grads.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.120
The people who are new to
something big in the heart.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.267
And I just spend time with
them, and they renew me.

00:27:06.267 --> 00:27:07.850
Let me see, who else
have we got here?

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:14.070
We've got Francois Truffaut,
French film director who,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:19.520
by age 50, had
directed 25 films.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.415
A master.

00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:23.290
But what was interesting,
he had this ritual.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.510
Every time he started a
film he would walk back

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.620
to the bookstore in Paris where
he bought his very first book

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.600
when he was filming
his first film,

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.620
aspiring to be a director.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.240
He went back to the bookstore
and he bought the book

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.820
on how to direct a
film, and he sat down

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.310
and he re-read it
so he could remember

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.050
what it was like to not
know how to produce a film,

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.130
and then he went to work.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.610
The third is CK Prahalad.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.720
He was a very dear
mentor to mine.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.370
He passed about four years
ago, this phenomenal management

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.830
professor.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.850
He was a fire hazard to
the University of Michigan,

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.170
because his lectures were
perpetually oversubscribed.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.050
At his memorial, we're
talking to his wife, Gayatri.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.860
And she shared with
us an experience

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:18.050
where, when he's a young tenured
professor-- he's now tenured

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.300
at the University of
Michigan-- and she sees

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.030
in the wastebasket
of his home office,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.240
she sees all these
handwritten notes.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.620
She thinks they might be these
precious research papers.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.080
She goes to pull them
out of the trash bin

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.110
and she finds that they're
actually his teaching notes,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.410
probably the most precious
resource a professor has.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.390
She pulls them out
of the wastebasket.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.820
She saves them, and she
tells CK about this.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.350
And he thanks her, and he says,
actually I put them there.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.020
And he said, I think my students
deserve my best thinking

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.020
and my fresh thinking
every semester.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.570
And then lastly, this one
comes from an internet CEO.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.890
And I asked him, how do you
keep this kind of orientation?

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.580
He said, when I am stuck
and I can't find a new idea,

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.860
and I'm struggling to
innovate, I go for a long walk.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.420
And I walk in a
single direction and I

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.400
don't allow myself to
turn back until I've

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.410
had a legitimately new idea.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:22.120
And he said, some of these walks
have been really, really long.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.340
And then he said,
truth be told, there's

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.790
something else I do
when I'm really stuck.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.320
And he said, you can't
use my name with this.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.770
He said, I go into my
closet and I strip down.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.910
I think to kind of
next to nothing.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.970
And he said, and I just
sit and I meditate.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.125
Now, I am not in any way
suggesting that any of you

00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:45.000
do this, and I know
there's a meditation room

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.270
just around the corner here.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.250
But I thought it was a
fascinating practice,

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.090
because he stripping
away more than clothes.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.800
He stripping away
assumptions, beliefs, facts,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.870
and trying to get down to
the very core of his thinking

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.890
so he can see things new.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:09.840
Deliberate practices to renew
this youthful, fresh, hungry

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.390
way of working.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.900
Is it possible, once
we've seen something,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.404
to be able to see it again?

00:30:17.404 --> 00:30:18.820
Can we see something
we've already

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.280
seen for the very first time?

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.840
Let me share an
experience where I

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.200
saw koi fish for
the very first time.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.020
This is time I'm
working at Oracle.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.060
I've got a really big job.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.760
I'm running that university.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.580
And I've also got a big family.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.229
I have three small
children, and I'm sort of

00:30:38.229 --> 00:30:40.520
in this really efficient,
productive mode, because I've

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.190
got a lot going on
and a lot to manage.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:47.720
And my boss is starting to see
early signs of burnout in me.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.850
And he says, Liz, I want
you to take a vacation.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.330
In fact, I don't want to
see you for three weeks.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.520
He kind of sentenced
me to vacation.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.080
Now, he didn't pay for it.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.560
He just sentenced me to it.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.720
And so my husband and I
decided that we would serve out

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.330
our sentence in Hawaii.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.236
That's a good place to do
this, on the island of Maui,

00:31:09.236 --> 00:31:10.860
Kaanapali Beach, at
the Sheraton there.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.600
And we've got three
small children.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.100
And anyone with
three small children

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.200
knows there's
really no such thing

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.070
as a vacation with
three small children.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:23.100
And we're about, maybe six
days into this vacation,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.070
and we get up one
morning and it's time

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.250
to go down to breakfast.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.922
My husband's sort of doing kind
of the "good husband" thing.

00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.630
It's kind of one of
these husband tricks.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.110
He says, oh here,
let me take the two.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.665
Let me take the two
girls, our oldest,

00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:39.290
and let me take them
down to breakfast.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.790
He said, why don't you get
Christian and meet up with us?

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.000
Now, this is Christian.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.220
I dug up a picture
from this trip.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:52.380
This is a three-year-old,
kind of nuclear core

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.380
of creative energy.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.960
And he is jumping on
the beds, bouncing off

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.750
the walls in his
pajamas, and I've

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.960
got to get him dressed
and sunscreened.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.140
And I am still in my
hurry and worry mode.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.400
Come on, come on.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.290
Kids, sunscreen, I'm
the equipment manager

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.780
for the family.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.290
And hurry up, come
on, quit goofing off.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.190
Hurry up, it's time to go play.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.800
And as I was thinking about
hurrying up my little boy,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.670
I remembered
something my boss had

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.670
told me about a
couple months earlier.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.190
He's a practicing
Buddhist and he

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.530
practices Buddhist meditation.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.020
He said, I've been
trying to just

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.690
be more present, with his son,
who was a little bit older.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.330
Letting his son kind
of set the pace,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.791
and go where his son wanted to
go and just be with his son.

00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:45.790
And I thought that was
an interesting challenge,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.370
and I had tucked it away for
a time when I could do that,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.250
and decided that day would be
the day that I would step out

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.720
of the role of leader, and
I would be the follower.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.920
And I decided, for
that entire day,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.890
I was going to let my son
decide where we would go

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.210
and how long we would be there.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.094
And so, getting
him suited up, we

00:33:09.094 --> 00:33:10.760
had to make it-- oh,
I don't know, maybe

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.170
about 100 yards from our hotel
room down to the breakfast hut

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.950
where my husband and
our two daughters

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.110
were-- and we set out, and
it was about 15 minutes

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.109
to make it the first 50 feet.

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:24.900
Because despite the
fact that this was just

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.250
a concrete path with
grass on both sides,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.550
my son was seeing
everything and having

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.700
to stop to notice
every bug, every blade

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.600
of grass, every flower,
every rock, and it's

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.840
now been 15 minutes and I'm
wanting us to get to breakfast.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.710
And I see up ahead we've got
to cross this little pond.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.270
And the pond's got
koi fish in it.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:52.010
And I am hoping, oh, I just hope
he doesn't notice the koi fish.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.110
Well, of course he
notices the koi fish,

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.220
and of course he stops.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.100
So following his lead, I stop.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.870
And I say something like, oh,
look at the cool koi fish.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.740
Those are great.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.200
And then I point out that
breakfast is waiting for us.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.610
Well, he's stopped.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.541
And he's now down on his knees,
and he's playing with the fish

00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:12.040
and he's got his
hands in the water.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.199
And I realize I'm going
to be there for a while,

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.780
so I drop down to my knees.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.449
And I'm squatting
down, and I can now

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.600
start to see the fish
through my son's eyes,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.710
kind of down at his level.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.770
And it's fun, and now
the fish are jumping up

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.270
and they're nibbling
at his fingers,

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.750
and it this kind
of koi fish frenzy.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.020
And that's not enough for him.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.420
He's now belly-down on this
path, playing with these fish.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.110
And so I decide, you know what?

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.130
I might as well just
surrender to this.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.719
And so I'm now belly-down
across the path,

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.340
having to apologize
to the people who

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.260
are climbing over us.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.780
And there, I just
watched the koi fish,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.750
and I watched my son play.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.590
Now, see, I had seen
koi fish before.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.500
I had seen koi fish in Kyoto
at the ancient temples.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.660
I've seen koi fish at Larry
Ellison's Japanese villa.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.980
I've seen these koi fish.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.060
But there, I could see
that they weren't just

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.740
overgrown goldfish.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.140
Each one was unique, with
amazing patterns and colors.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.190
They were magnificent.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.540
And it was there
that I truly felt

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.450
I saw koi fish for
the very first time.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:29.160
And it was when I took a turn
following instead of leading

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.510
that I started to see things
that I would've missed,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:37.010
and I started to
rediscover the familiar.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:42.110
Can we see our work
through new eyes?

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.110
What happens when
we look at our work

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:48.570
through the eyes of a rookie?

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:53.590
And what can we do to
rekindle this rookie smarts,

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.820
despite, perhaps,
years of experience?

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.446
Let me share with you a
couple ways that we see this.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.570
Let me offer five very,
very small experiments

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.940
that you might take
to rekindle this.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.830
First, you might step out of
the role of leader in a meeting,

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.660
and you might step into
the role of follower.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.590
And in that role, you might
ask the naive questions.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:24.650
Not the stupid questions
that lack sort of awareness,

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.580
but the naive
questions, the diligent

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.780
questions that help
simplify and clarify.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.790
Maybe you borrow a job.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.650
Maybe you try on someone
else's job for a day.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:42.190
Maybe you do it for a week.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.170
Allison and I have been part of
a really interesting experiment

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.596
here at Google with the
America's marketing team.

00:36:47.596 --> 00:36:49.220
And they were looking
at, what can they

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.260
do to bring this kind of
vibrant way of working

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.989
at its height on this team?

00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.780
And they decided, we're
going to swap jobs.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.240
And we're not going to
swap them for a day.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.290
We're going to swap for a week.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.930
And the team started to
pick out-- there's about,

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:07.900
what, 20 people on this team--
and they started to pick out,

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.010
oh I'll swap with you,
and I'll swap with you.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.343
And they decided, you know what?

00:37:11.343 --> 00:37:13.360
Let's go big with this.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.300
They separated into two halves.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.230
We were in a conference room.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.021
One half of the group
went out the door

00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:20.020
in the hallway this way.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.810
The other half went out here.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:26.560
And sort of reality TV-style,
I was the host in the middle,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.600
and I would say,
OK send someone in.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.930
It was like a game of
Red Rover, Red Rover,

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.290
send someone on over.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.634
And they sent in
two random people,

00:37:36.634 --> 00:37:38.300
and they walked into
the conference room

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.700
to meet the person on
their team that they

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.150
were going to swap
jobs with for a week.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.680
And they did this over
the course of the summer,

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.820
with phenomenally interesting
experiences coming out

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.710
of doing a job you
have no idea how to do,

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.220
and building that empathy
and understanding.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.410
So maybe you swap
jobs with someone.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.960
Maybe you disqualify yourself.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.950
Maybe you sign up to do a job
you have no business doing,

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.680
or lack the qualifications.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.810
And let that drag
you into new space.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.450
Maybe you staple
yourself to a problem.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.310
Something that is
outside of your job,

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.000
outside of your area of
deep expertise, and you

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.780
let that problem drag
you into new space

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.060
where your current models
and templates and methods

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.670
and agendas don't
suffice, and you

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.260
build new vibrant
ways of working.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.690
Maybe you take a
page out of CK's book

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:44.010
and throw away your notes--
your standard templates,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:49.600
meeting agendas,
talks-- and you just

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.100
build something entirely new.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.620
If you don't know
quite where to start,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.430
you might take the
little rookie quiz

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:04.480
that will help you know where
you are in this rookie zone,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.170
and what you might
do to rekindle that.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.500
Let me share what I
think I fundamentally

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.610
learned in doing this research
as I studied how people operate

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.830
with experience and
how they operate

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.740
when they're brand
new to something.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.780
Here's fundamentally
what I've learned.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.140
I've learned that not only
is this rookie zone where

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.370
we do our very best work-- that
it provokes our best thinking,

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.130
it puts us into
learning mode-- I've

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.200
found that it's actually
our happy place.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.360
It's the place where we find
our greatest satisfaction.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.580
It's actually where we
find our greatest joy.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.550
As I've asked people to think
about their own experience

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:48.790
as a rookie, I've heard
people say over and over,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.980
I want to be a rookie again.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.160
It's where I felt
the most alive.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.650
We asked about 1,000
people to tell us

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.640
how challenged they
felt in their role

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.290
and how satisfied they
were with their job,

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.700
and what we found was a
near-perfect linear correlation

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.600
between satisfaction
and challenge,

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.100
meaning as the challenge
level of a job goes up,

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.310
so does satisfaction.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.440
And, of course, vice versa.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.330
As our challenge
goes down, as we

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.660
begin to know what
we're doing, we actually

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.750
become less satisfied.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.970
Let me share this video, and
then a couple final words.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.710
This is Zia.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.310
She is a fourth-grade girl.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.120
She is at the top
of the 40-meter ski

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.560
jump at Park City, Utah,
and this is her wrestle

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.030
to do this for the
very first time.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.220
That is Zia.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.890
And I think we all have a
little bit of Zia in us.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.440
Again, what I have learned
from doing this research

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.390
is that it's not too
late to be a rookie.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:57.330
And I think in the current work
environment, our most valuable

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:03.680
professionals will be those
who use all of their experience

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.990
and can maintain
their rookie smarts,

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.330
both thinking and
operating like a rookie.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.080
I think the most valuable
leaders will be those

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.480
that help people find
the zone of discomfort.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.520
The leaders who not only give
people a pat on the back,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.470
but they give them a gentle
or not-so-gentle push

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.847
out into this discomfort zone.

00:41:25.847 --> 00:41:27.680
And I think we're going
to see that the most

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.060
valuable companies are
those that, as they grow,

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.470
retain a culture of innovation,
a culture where they can think

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.530
and operate with rookie
smarts across the company.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.640
Where they can
work with the drive

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.200
and the hunger of a newcomer.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.430
Now, I would love to
hear what's on your mind.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.014
An observation, a
question, anything.

00:41:53.014 --> 00:41:54.430
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any examples

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.700
of companies that have
this type of culture

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.010
that you've just described?

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.040
Not necessarily the
innovation part,

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.720
but the part about
a culture where

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.740
people feel like they can put
themselves into places where

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.780
they would fail, or sort
of at their learning

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.160
edge where they'll be able
to grow and continuously

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.730
be a rookie.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:18.380
Because it strikes me that,
as companies get bigger

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.110
and there's more competition,
there's also increased risk,

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.011
and so people want to
put experts in positions.

00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:26.010
LIZ WISEMAN: Absolutely.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.060
And I think this
question of, are there

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.615
companies that
operate this way, it

00:42:29.615 --> 00:42:31.073
was actually one
of the things that

00:42:31.073 --> 00:42:32.992
drove me to do this research.

00:42:32.992 --> 00:42:34.200
Born and raised in this area.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.360
I've spent my whole
career in Silicon Valley,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:41.190
and everyone wants to work
for the hottest company.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.220
And there's cafe
talk about who's hot.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.920
And it's almost like you
can set your watch ahead,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.170
I don't know, maybe 18 months.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.810
Put a note in your calendar to
say, is that company still hot?

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.520
And more often than
not the answer is no.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.470
And are there companies
that can continue

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.410
to maintain this culture?

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.530
One that I have been
watching for years is Google.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.730
I'd love to hear your
perspective on this,

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.020
but I think it's an
example of a company that

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.780
continues to hire for it,
and continues to nurture it.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.790
I know when we started
having this conversation

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.790
with the America's marketing
team, they're like,

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.370
well this is how we operate.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:23.170
We never feel like we have a
job that we're comfortable in.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:27.560
We're constantly being
pushed and moved.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.370
Vanguard is a really interesting
one, the financial services

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.990
firm.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.770
They have this extreme
rotation culture.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.270
There's an IT manager,
and he was suddenly

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.730
put in charge of
vendor management.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.036
Had no clue how to do this.

00:43:43.036 --> 00:43:44.910
He said in his first
two weeks he reached out

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.800
to 25 people trying to figure
out, what is vendor management?

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.080
What are the questions I ask?

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.960
They will move someone from
heading up a financial services

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.230
business, and then
they'll ask them

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.940
to service the CIO
for the company.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.450
And vice versa.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:09.730
Nike has a very similar kind
of culture, constantly pushing

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.520
and looking for, how do
we find the voice, often

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.140
at the bottom of
the organization?

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.300
They have something they
call the New Crew, where

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.300
they get newcomers
to the organization

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.810
that they kind of elevate up.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:26.990
And they serve for a year
kind of saying the things that

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.440
need to be said
across the company.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.540
BTS, a global consulting firm,
is another really interesting

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.330
example, hiring people with
very little experience doing

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.440
what they do-- business
simulations-- putting them

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440
in on these projects.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.080
Not sort of in the
typical consulting model

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.440
where they're on the
back-end of the project,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.160
sort of grinding
out spreadsheets

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.300
but not seen by the client.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.110
They actually push
their new talent out

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.750
in front of the
C-level officers.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.630
But they support them
with the senior partners

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.650
who back them up.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.650
And their orientation is, we're
going to put these newcomers up

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.920
on a tight rope, and we're
going to provide the safety

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.470
net underneath them.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.570
But I think Google's
hiring criteria

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:17.510
is a very interesting one,
hiring for many of these things

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:21.750
that I would kind of
call rookie smarts.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.970
Any thoughts that you see
companies that you think

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.850
do this well?

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.160
AUDIENCE: For me, I just filled
this [? 10-person ?] project

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:30.720
at Google.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.490
Actually serve a certain role
of what you talk about here.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:40.510
And now, for instance,
there are some [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.880
analysts from other
orgs just really

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.140
want to work with us
to [INAUDIBLE] project.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:55.930
[INAUDIBLE] different problem
is not in her comfort room.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:00.240
But I notice, even over
just several weeks,

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.520
[INAUDIBLE] already
learn a lot and then

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.450
actually it's a very
good experience for her

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:10.890
to learn and grow herself.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.930
That's just an example.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:18.450
Also, for me personally,
even just a [? low-key ?]

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:20.980
[INAUDIBLE] example.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.660
I also think, maybe for me,
a little bit senior analyst.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.985
And also maybe try to
find those new challenge.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:37.180
That's a way I feel I can learn
more, instead of you lead,

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.250
always lead.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.000
LIZ WISEMAN: Yeah.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.030
And I think you do see,
from what I can see,

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.330
seeds of this in the culture.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.960
And I think this is,
from my perspective, one

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.190
of the interesting
challenges, because I believe

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:49.440
that the path of
least resistance

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.400
for hot young fast-growing
technology companies

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.100
is for them to get very
comfortable and complacent.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.600
And particularly those
who have established

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.410
a lead, the easy thing to
do is to defend that lead

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.740
and to protect that lead.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.330
Mark Parker, the CEO of Nike,
he said something I thought

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:08.996
was interesting.

00:47:08.996 --> 00:47:12.150
He said, the most
dangerous position

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.130
is to be playing it safe.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:18.330
And I think one of the
applications of these ideas

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.150
is, how do companies
like Google,

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.150
who are really successful
and have gotten really

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.730
large, really smart
talented people, how

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.620
do you maintain this way
of thinking and working

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.230
despite success, and despite
that pull to keep people

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.420
where they're most valuable?

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.930
I really believe that people
are at their best and their most

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.700
valuable when they are
adjacent to what they know.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.240
And I'm not in
any way suggesting

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.420
that people should be
taken out of one job

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.280
and moved to something
absolutely foreign.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.780
And certainly,
certain kinds of work

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.360
that are high stakes--
like, none of us

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.450
wants a rookie heart surgeon.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:59.930
You don't want a rookie dentist.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:06.100
You don't want a rookie
tandem sky dive instructor.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.490
But where we can pivot
from our place of strength

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:15.510
and be pointed to a foreign
problem, a new challenge,

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:16.690
we're at our most valuable.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.350
One of the pieces of data
that we got in the research,

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:24.530
we asked people, how long after
you've been given a challenge,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.080
how does it take
to figure it out?

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.781
Kind of stop
tumbling in the ocean

00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:31.030
and get your head up and
figure out what you're doing.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.410
How long does it take to be
ready for the next challenge?

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.090
When are you ready
for the next job?

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:40.120
And then, how quickly do
you begin to feel stale?

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.920
Now, I wasn't surprised that
people feel that it takes them

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.300
about three months to
figure out the challenge.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.900
I wasn't surprised
that people are

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.680
ready for a new role
in about a year,

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.160
not that companies can be
doling out new opportunities

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.880
that fast.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.700
I wasn't surprised
that people start

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.950
to feel stale after
about 24 months.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.890
But what I was surprised
is that people say,

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.940
I'm ready for the next
challenge at three months, which

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:10.300
is to-the-day the amount of
time it takes to figure it out.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.360
And most managers
can't, like I said,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.420
dole out new jobs
and promotions.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:20.150
But virtually every manager
can offer up a new challenge.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.810
And if you're in a management
role, you might be thinking,

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.460
is this person ready
for the next hard thing?

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.410
Even within their role.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:33.140
That is what I think retains
a culture of rookie smarts,

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:37.300
feeding your team a
steady diet of challenge.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.450
Other questions or observations?

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.435
Or complete disagreements?

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.574
AUDIENCE: I'll give
you an agreement.

00:49:48.574 --> 00:49:50.740
LIZ WISEMAN: I was so hoping
for disagreement, but--

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:51.910
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.230
Before I came to
Google I was probably

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.700
on the top of your S curve.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.490
Had been there for awhile.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:01.490
And then when I came
to Google, discovered

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.250
myself very much at the bottom.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:08.050
But not in a good way, because I
was out of practice at learning

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.500
and I had been kind of writing
on my laurels for awhile,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.380
I realized.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.880
I was kind of unconscious
of it for quite awhile.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.850
And really, I think
it wasn't until I

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:24.545
did a job change, changed
teams, that I was able to really

00:50:24.545 --> 00:50:27.130
just take on something
smaller and more concentrated

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:32.370
that was more challenging,
to make myself come up

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.800
in other ways that I
just wasn't initially.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.550
LIZ WISEMAN: Yeah.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:36.050
Absolutely.

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:39.400
And I think maybe
a misinterpretation

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.660
of some of this
research in the book

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.880
might be, our most valuable
staff are young people

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.410
or millennials.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:48.850
And I don't think that's true.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:50.030
I think when people
are in a rookie zone,

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.624
they are tremendously valuable.

00:50:51.624 --> 00:50:53.790
And when we're young, we
just have a lot more things

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.270
to be rookies about.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.950
But I actually think our
most valuable professionals

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.410
are people with experience who
have been given an opportunity

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.002
to move outside of
their experience.

00:51:06.002 --> 00:51:07.960
Where that experience is
valued, it's like, OK,

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.600
now I've got a new hard
thing for you to do.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.450
It really brings out that
veteran savvy and rookie

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:21.940
smarts, and I think it's the
cheapest, most powerful way

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:26.564
to increase satisfaction
inside a company.

00:51:26.564 --> 00:51:28.980
ALLISON: Thank you so much for
the time that you've spent.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.530
[APPLAUSE]
