00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.720
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.690
I'm Tomoko Steen at Science,
Technology and Business Division.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.900
Today's event is cosponsored
with Office of Health Services.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.900 position:56%
And this is a topic really
everyone is concerned about because,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.100
you know, outbreak in hospitals,
even NIH, and also the food,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.110
a lot of antibiotics used in food.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.500 position:56%
So Dr. Price is going to talk about
several issues really concerned now.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.220
And the UN had a meeting just
recently, and that's because,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.760
you know, it's going
to be out-of-hand.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.980
So it's a worldwide concern.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Today's speaker, Dr. Price,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.160
is director of Antibiotic
Resistance Action Center,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.470
and professor of George
Washington University's Department

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.380
of Environmental and
Occupational Health

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.740
at the Milken Institute
School of Public Health.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.400
And he's also the director of
the Center for Macrobiotics

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.150
and Human Health at Translation
Genomics Research Institute.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.710
So this is a nonprofit
based in Arizona.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.860 position:56%
And Dr. Price did his PhD at Johns
Hopkins University in public health.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.660
So I think it's already a little
bit delayed, so before much adieu,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.280
please join me in welcoming
Professor Price.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.080
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Thank you.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.900
[ Applause ]

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.930
Thank you for the invitation,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.370
and for the introduction;
I appreciate that.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.430
I'm not checking my
e-mail, I just --

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.130
[laughter] I want to make sure
I don't go too far over time.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.820
So I think you recognize that this
is the world we live in today,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.080
right, the world between
the freak-out moments.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.920
So this could be applied to,
you know, perhaps gun control

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.460
and these horrible school shootings
where, you know, these take place,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.000
we freak out, we demand
action, and then we go back

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.560 position:56%
to our lives until it happens again.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.880
This could also be applied
to weird weather events

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.530
and global climate change.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.940
And some have argued that
this applies to superbugs.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.250
So we do hear about superbugs.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
They hit the mainstream media, and
we freak out for a little while,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.900
and then we go back to our
busy lives and we expect

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.200
that somebody did something
about it, right?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.120
But I would argue that
this is actually

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.100 position:56%
that graph the applies to superbugs.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.630
Because what happens is that these
things hit the mainstream media,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.130
they're circulating, we're hearing
about them, and we expect the CDC

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.100
or somebody to do something
about it.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.740
And then it kind of leaves
the media cycle, right?

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.570 position:56%
And we think that they've gone away,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.770
but in fact they're
there, they're still there.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.140
And when the next one comes
out, it's piled on top, right?

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.790
And what's happening is that the
medical community is just learning

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.350
how to deal with it.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.330
I'm going to learn
how to deal with this.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.650
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.180
Okay, stop.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.850
Thank you.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.150
All right.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.590
So, you know, the medical
communities doctors learn,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.770
they scramble, they reach higher
on those shelves of the antibiotics

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.530
and they reach for the
next one, and the next one.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.810
And they get the stool out, and
they reach out for the next one.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.460
But what's happened is that
we are running out of shelves.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.780
So we don't have new antibiotics,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.700
and the bacteria are
continuing to evolve resistance.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.790
And so we keep hearing now about
us moving towards what's called the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.030
"post-antibiotic era" in medicine.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.660
And the World Health Organization
describes this as a time

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.870
when even a scraped
knee can be a deadly --

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.710
can result in a deadly infection,
because you can get staph aureus

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.160
in that scrape, and if we
don't have the antibiotics

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.360 position:56%
to treat the staph aureus infection,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.140
that can get into your
blood and kill you.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.200
A bladder infection that's a
really painful annoyance right now,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.030
can progress to kidney infections.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.450
And once it's in your kidneys,
it can access the blood

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.810
and can cause deadly
blood infections.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.250
And so we're moving towards a time

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.240
when these really common
infections can be deadly.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.070
And I think -- so this is
not the apocalypse, right,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.590
so it's not the end of
humanity as we know it.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.280
But I don't think it's
overstating it to say that is going

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.990
to change our lives dramatically.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.040
It's going to change everything
from what procedures can take place

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.940
in the hospital, you know,
can we do that hip surgery,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.500
can we do that bowel surgery,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.470
can we give somebody
chemotherapy that's going to knock

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.240
out their immune system for
several months; probably not.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.460
And it's also going to
change the way it feels

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.030
to ride public transportation,
or ride that escalator,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.380
and grab that handle and think

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.410
about whether you picked
up a superbug or not.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.070
Right; so these superbugs have
many different monikers, right?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.660
You hear about MRSA;
who's heard about MRSA?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.910
MRSA, right, Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.770
Kills 11,000 people in the
United States each year.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.060
VRSA is just vancomycin
resistant MRSA, right?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.920 position:56%
And vancomycin is a crappy drug, but
this is the one we're really afraid

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.680
of because that's the
last drug we've got.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.410
VRA, CRA, these are just
different monikers for superbugs.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.350
And these are just basically
disease-causing bacteria

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.830
that are resistant to antibiotics,
usually multiple antibiotics,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.050
although we usually refer
to them based on one drug.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.810
And so people ask me
all the time, you know,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.510
"So how does this bacterium
-- " that's a bacterium to me,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.530
"how does a bacterium turn
into a super-bacterium?"

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.520
And that's a super bacteria to me.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.910
"How does it go from this to this?"

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.960
And it goes from this to
this by changes in the DNA.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.560
So bacteria multiply themselves,
so they don't reproduce sexually;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.990 position:56%
they just make copies of their DNA,
and then they split from one to two,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.720
and the two become
four, eight, 16, 32.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.040
And each time they do that,
they have to make copies

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.130
of four-and-a-half, sometimes,
you know, more millions of bases.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.670
So two, to four, to five million
bases of DNA, Gs, As, Ts, and Cs.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.750
And when they do that, they
can make errors and some

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.500
of those errors result
in changes in proteins

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.380
that make them resistant
to antibiotics.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.070
So the other thing that they
can do is some bacteria carry

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.770
around these extra little
packages of DNA called "plasmids,"

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.610
or other elements, and they can
pass these to other bacteria.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.740
So in a single genetic event,
they can pass resistance to six,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.800
seven different antibiotics just

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.800
by bumping together
and passing this DNA.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.010
And now what we have
is we have a world war.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.170
We have bacteria that
are already carrying lots

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.360
of different resistance genes,
and they're just waiting

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.460
for that one last resistance gene
to get that royal flush, right?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.060 position:56%
And this is what we're really afraid
of, right, we have lots of bacteria

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.700
that are one card away
from a royal flush.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.440
And now we know that that last
card is floating around out there.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.330
I'm going to come back
to this later.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.440
So that's happening all
the time in the background,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.220
but most of the time,
that's a dead end.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.720
Right; so these mutations happen,
and then those bacteria fizzle out.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.500 position:56%
But if you're in an environment
where there are lots of antibiotics,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.940
even one of those mutations
can result

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.100
in a rapid evolution
drug resistant bacteria.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.440
So in an environment where
you have lots of drugs,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.640
then the susceptible
bacteria die off --

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.830
excuse my sort of South
Park style cartoons,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.670
but these are the best I can draw,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.070
and that resistant one
then goes on to multiply.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.150
So one becomes two -- I skipped
a step, two becomes four,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.890
four becomes eight, et cetera.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.120
And you can go from a single cell

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.920
to a billion drug-resistant
bacteria in 24 hours.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.050
So E. Coli can double, can do
these doubling every 30 minutes.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.100
And E. Coli is one of the worst
superbugs that we deal with today.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.130 position:56%
So you can go from a single superbug
cell to billions in 24 hours.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.710
So there's a lot of confusion
in the mainstream media.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.760
You all are brilliant, so I
probably don't need to say this.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.140
But, you know, the media talks
about people becoming resistant

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.450
to antibiotics, but I think it's
really important to make sure

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.090
that you understand this, even
though it's a simple concept,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.140
that it's not people that
are becoming resistant

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.030
to antibiotics, it's bacteria.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.560
And those are colonizing
us and infecting us,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.000
and those infections
are harder to treat,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.210
it gives doctors fewer choices,
and these result in more

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.550
and more deaths every year.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.560
And the CDC conservatively
estimates today

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.580
that 23,000 Americans die
each year of superbugs.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.240
And Tom Frieden, the head of the
CDC underscored several times

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.000
that this was a conservative
estimate.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.900
It's really difficult to
know whether somebody died

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.830
with a drug-resistant infection,
or of a drug-resisted infection

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.030
when somebody's already sick.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.720
So understanding that
rapid evolution,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.330
understanding this
relationship underscores the fact

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.050
that each time we use antibiotics,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.020
we potentially fuel the
growth of superbugs.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.030
And Stuart Levy, one of my heroes

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.660
from Tufts University,
coined this term.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.810
He said antibiotics
are "societal drugs."

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.510
So what he was trying
to do was explain

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.970
that antibiotics are different
from any other drugs that we use.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.790
And I'd like to start
with a counterexample.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.360
So Tylenol is not a societal drug.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.330
People take Tylenol for headaches.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.080
If you misuse Tylenol,
if you overuse it,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.380 position:56%
if you use it while you're drinking,
you can get liver damage and die.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.950
People commit suicide, a horrible
suicide using lots of Tylenol.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.860
But it does affect
anybody else's ability

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.210
to take Tylenol for a headache.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.350
However, if you misuse antibiotics,
you can drive the bacteria

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.750
in your system, in your gut, on
your skin, to become resistant

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.540
to antibiotics and you can share
those bacteria with other people,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.370
preventing them from
using those same drugs.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.730
So that's what Stuart
was trying to convey

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.040 position:56%
with this idea of the societal drug.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.600
Now, when you think about
that societal nature,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.840
you have to recognize that
the context and the quantity

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.940
of antibiotics that we're
using really matters.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.450
And I think the thing
that people think of most

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.140
of the time is this context, right,
you think about the hospital,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.350
and this is where we know there are
a lot of drug-resistant bacteria.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.780
And we know that if these people
are not washing their hands,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.550
and aren't hitting that hand
sanitizer between every patient,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.740
they can become vehicles
for drug-resistant bacteria;

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.360
they can spread them around.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.070
And we have to have teams of
people wiping surfaces all the time

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.330
to keep those contact
surfaces clean.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.080
So nobody denies that, and nobody
denies that this is too much.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.770
We're using eight million
pounds of active ingredient.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.440
That's not the size
of the pill, right,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.780
that's the active drug inside the
pill; eight million pounds of that

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.420
in the united States
in human medicine.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.950
American Medical Association and
the American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.390
all these different associations
say, "This is too much.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.690
We need to cut it back.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.050
We're overusing antibiotics."

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.350
And why do they say that,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.620
because we're fueling
the growth of superbugs.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.490
And then if you have the
combination of this excessive use

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.810
and then poor hygiene, the
doc skips that hand sanitizer,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.850 position:56%
skips washing the hands, then that's
how we have those horrible hospital

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.300
outbreaks to drug-resistant
bacteria.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.330
So that's human medicine.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.060
But I want to talk
about animal production.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.230
So that's the thing I spend
most of my time studying.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.470
And here's the quantity in animal
production in the United States.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.660
This is the most recent number.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.400
And we were hoping it was
going to go down; it went up.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.590
So we're at 34 million
pounds of antibiotics

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.050
in food animal production in
the United States each year.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.270 position:56%
So you can see that that's more than
what we're using in human medicine.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.910
So let's talk about the context.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.210
So that's quantity.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.510
So this is not the context.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.610
This is my imagined
context when I was a kid.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.900
And this was -- did
anybody play with these

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.200 position:56%
when you were a kid; yes, all right.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.220
So you can buy these
on eBay it turns out.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.370
I found the era that I played
with, and I took that photo.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.870
Okay. But this is the way we
actually raise animals today.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.640
So cattle will spend part of their
lives grazing on open pastures,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.290
like my family's ranch in
Central Texas, but they'll end

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.740
up on feed lots like this
one; and that's not dirt

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.410
that they're standing around on.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.390
Pigs spend their entire lives

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.270
in concentrated animal
feeding operations today.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.980
And these are not full-grown pigs.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.530
When they're full grown,
they are snout to tail.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.420
But they are so stressed
out in this environment

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.410
that they clip the tails off
because they'll bite them off.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.380
They get very aggressive
under these conditions.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.180
Chickens, up to 100,000
in a single house.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.870
And turkeys are raised like this.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.160
So some people refer to
these as "factory farms."

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.020
But as a microbiologist, I
don't see factories making meat,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.740
I see factories making lots
and lots of bacteria, right?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.310
And when you add that magic
ingredient of low levels

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.690
of antibiotics, then you have
a factory making superbugs.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.320
And this has been established
with every study that we do

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.140
around these factory farms --

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.100
or, sorry, around these
industrial farms.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.090
We detect lots and lots of
drug-resistant bacteria.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.870
Now, one of the things that
we use the antibiotics for,

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.170
and one of the major things

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.370
that we have historically
used antibiotics for,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.380
was to make animals grow faster.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.440
So we give them low
doses of antibiotics.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.200
This was discovered in the 1940s.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.460
Like right after Alexander
Fleming discovered antibiotics,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.500
someone discovered that
giving animals low doses

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.280
of antibiotics helps
them grow faster.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.580
We don't really understand.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.600
Probably changing the microbiome;
that is the gut community

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.830
of bacteria, passing more
energy onto the animal.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.370
But we don't exactly know how
well it works, and how it works.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:11.750
But the other justified
use is preventing diseases.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.320
But some of the diseases we're
preventing are what we call

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.400
"production diseases," that
is diseases that are occurring

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.360
because of the way we're
raising these animals.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360
So I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.120 position:56%
So one of the things that we have a
lot of is shipping fever and cattle.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.400
So it turns out that when you raise
animals, you let the animals graze,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.740
you have to then get them to
those feed lots, and you put them

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.480
in these trucks to get
them to those feedlots,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.000
and sometimes you're
shipping them for days.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.410
And you stack them
up two layers high.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.900
These are cattle actually in this.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.280
This is what it looks
like when you empty it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.960
And so it doesn't take
a microbiologist

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.830
or an infectious disease doctor
to recognize that this is going

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.500
to make these animals sick.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.990
But rather than change
this system --

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.600 position:56%
don't ask me how, maybe
distributing smaller feedlots closer

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.080
to the grazing lands.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.220
Instead of changing that, we just
give them all antibiotics right

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.400
at that time when we're about
to put them all together

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.590
in those fecal wastelands.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.800
So that's one production
disease that we're treating.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.350
Another one is when you switch
these animals that have evolved

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.340
to eat grass, and you switch
them to corn and soybean,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.370
they get liver abscesses.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.680
And so rather than
trying to figure out a way

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.100 position:56%
to have them not get liver abscesses
by changing the diet or, you know,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.130
lengthening the time
that we're feeding them,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.170
we give them antibiotics, again
while they're crowded together.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.130
Okay; so here's a problem,
I think in Fisher-Price.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.100
Maybe that's not a problem, but the
public health problem that I want

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.420
to describe is that you --

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.340
each animals has trillions of
bacteria living in and on it.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.420 position:56%
So that's not trillions, but I don't
have enough pixels to draw this.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.560 position:56%
But anyway, the animal has trillions
of bacteria living in and on it.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.600
And when you feed them
antibiotics, you're going to force

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.110
that evolutionary process to
take place in those animals.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.430
Ad so the bacterial
become resistant.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.320
And then when you chop up those
animals to make pork chops,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.130 position:56%
you're going to inevitably
contaminate some of those pork chops

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.670
with some of the bacteria from
either the gut of that animal,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.800
or the skin of those animals.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.880
And then those bacteria can then go
on to cause infections in people,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.730
and we get the little frowny faces.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.420
And again, the problems
that I described before,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.180
you're giving physicians
fewer choices

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.900
for treating those infections,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.800
and we know that those infections
last longer, and they cost more

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.260
to treat, and they
result in more deaths.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.930
So I just wanted to underscore
something because, again,

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.320
there's been a lot of
confusion about this issue.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.480
The main concern -- while we are
concerned about traces of drugs

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.200
in the meat, it's not the
antibiotics in the meat

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.470
that we're most concerned
about, it's drug-resistant --

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.470
living infectious,
drug-resistant bacteria

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.820
on the meat that's the real
public health challenge.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.390 position:56%
And so sometimes you'll hear
companies describing how they remove

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.440
antibiotics early enough
so there are no drugs

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.330
in the meat, so don't worry.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.680
But that doesn't -- the
bacteria don't respond

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.980
that quickly to that removal.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.170
And so when you go to
slaughter those animals,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.170
you're going to contaminate
the meat with those bacteria.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:25.160
Okay; so for years, we -- it turns
out there's been a big argument

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.120
about this for years, and I've
been sort of part of this argument,

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.000
not as long as people Stuart Levy.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.730
Stuart Levy has been having
this argument for 40 years.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.240
But for years the argument
was framed

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.320
around the classic
food-borne pathogens

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.250
like salmonella and campylobacter.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.030
I'm sure you've all
heard of salmonella.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.520
Have you heard of campylobacter?

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.280
Okay; it turns out that they
are sort of tied number one

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.320
and number two in terms
of causing diarrhea

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.760
in the United States,
bacterial diarrhea.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.650
And together they cause
about 2.6 million cases

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.860
of diarrhea, all right?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.910
And most of that is coming from
contaminated poultry products.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.030
And the CDC estimates
that about 410,000

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.090
of these infections are
antibiotic-resistant.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.290
And that resistance can be traced
back to either contemporary

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.090
or historic use of antibiotics
in food animal production.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.270
So just to put things in
perspective, that's the population

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.590
of Miami getting drug-resistant
food borne infections

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.250
in the United States each year.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.030
But not very many people
die of those infections.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.360
So most people who get
diarrhea will have, you know,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.420
they'll be uncomfortable for five
or six days, they'll use a lot

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.720
of toilet paper, and
they'll recover.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.780
A thousand people will
not; they die.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.360 position:56%
It gets into the blood and they die.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.590
But apparently, a thousand
people is not enough

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.060
to change policy in
the United States.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.990
So we have to move --
I've been saying for years

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.330
that we have to move back.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.230
We need to move beyond the
classic food borne pathogens,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.980
because there's a lot
more than salmonella

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.050
and campylobacter in
the food supply.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.870
We need to understand the --

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.000
what we call the "colonizing
opportunist pathogens," or COPs.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.300
These are the big killers.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.760
And when you talk to an
infectious disease doc,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.610
they want to know about these guys.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.520
They don't care about
salmonella and campylobacter;

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.560
they just don't kill enough people.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.800
So we're not talking
about Andy Griffith there.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.280
We're talking more along the
lines of Harvey Keitel in the

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.190
"Bad Lieutenant," you know.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.090
Some of these movie posters really
give it all away, right, "Gambler,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.910
Thief, Junkie, Killer, Cop."

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.300
All right; anyway it's
colonizing opportunist pathogens.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.760
These include things like E. Coli,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.100
escherichia intestinal
pathogenic E. Coli,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.390
the kind that causes
bladder infections.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.930
Klebsiella pneumonia; have
you ever heard of KLEB,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.810
klebsiella, a few of you.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.540
So this is a big killer
in the United States.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.580
One of the biggest
superbugs is that klebsiella.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.770
And one of the biggest
superbugs is in E. Coli.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.160
And one of the biggest superbugs
is staph aureus, M R S A, MRSA.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.820
So COPs can live in
or on our bodies.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.580
So staph can live in your
nose, in your throat,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.120
for years without you knowing it.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.420
No symptoms.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.850
You can just be a carrier, and you
can share it with other people.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.820
E. Coli can live in
your gut for decades

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.870
and you wouldn't even know it.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.050
It doesn't cause symptoms
until it gets into the bladder,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.670
until it gets into the blood.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.240
And so you can become
this reservoir.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.030
And so these COPs cause what I
like to call "insidious epidemics."

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.740
So they can spread globally.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.040
They can get on planes with us.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.500
They get on trains and
boats, and they get on meat,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.170
and they travel the world.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.170
The problem is that they have
asymptomatic colonization.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.970
So these fever monitors in airports
are not going to work, right,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.720
they're not going to
detect these things.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.760
They're silent person-to-person
transmission.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.970
You come home from your
trip to India, or China,

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.130
or the United States, and you
bring home drug-resistant bacteria

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.300 position:56%
and share them with your family
members, and no one knows it, right,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.860
until their immune
system is knocked down.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.750
We don't know how long
they can colonize.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.490
We know that they can
be from days to years.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.280
And then it's really difficult

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.200
because you can have
animals carry them,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.350
you can have humans carry
them, you can have environment,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.320
water, carrying these bacteria.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.100
So these are really hard to study.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.920
And I like a good challenge,
and so that's what I study.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.510
And this is the machine that I use.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.600
This is the next generation
DNA sequencer.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.280
So now we have sequencers.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.040
We can sequence DNA at a rate --

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.350
at a cost that was never
even imaginable before.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.410
We can sequence bacterial
genome millions

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.140
of bases for less than $50 today.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.110 position:56%
When the anthrax letters were
mailed and we did this investigation

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.790
on the anthrax letters, it cost
half a million dollars per genome;

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.800
half a million dollars
per bacterium.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.780
Today it's $50.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.080
This is changing fast.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.850 position:56%
And it's changing what we understand
about infections, and it's so fun.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.420
I'll just tell you, I'm a Geek.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.870
Okay; so the way that -- so
what we do is we take the DNA

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:03.730
and then looking at
these little mutations,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.920
we can redraw the family
history of these bacteria.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.930
So if we have bacteria -- so
going back to the anthrax letters,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:18.070 position:56%
if we have a letter, and we have a
vial or a flask in a government lab,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.850 position:56%
and we want to know if these two are
related, we can sequence the DNA,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.600
and we can look for
these little mutations,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.520
and we could see how they're
related to one another.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.820
So we draw these little trees.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.800
And we just have -- and based
on the length of these branches

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.210
and what we call these
"common ancestors,"

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.430
the little nodes connecting
these guys,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.770
we can redraw the evolutionary
history of this bacteria,

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.840
and we can understand how
they're related to one another.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.100
And then we can actually do
something that's called "rooting,"

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.930
and we can understand
who is older --

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.420
or which nodes are older and
which ones are more derived,

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.910
that is, more recent.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.050
And this is so powerful, it's
almost like a time machine.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.410
So we can go back in time.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.240 position:56%
And we need a time machine for this
because we've been using antibiotics

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.900
in animal production
for seven years.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.960
So how much of the drug resistance
that we're dealing with today

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.950
in human medicine is due in part

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.150
because of antibiotic
use in animal production?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.360
These time machines are
helping us figure this out.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.140
So I'll tell you a little bit
about the work that we're doing

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.750
on MRSA first, and then
I'll go onto E. Coli.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.440
So MRSA -- this is
microbiologists like me are weird

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.740
so there are stuffed animals.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.800
Have you seen these
giant microbes; yes.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.150
Okay; so there are these
giant microbes teddy bears

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.970
that you would hug.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.920
I don't have one.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.550 position:56%
But if you want to learn about MRSA,

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.600
I really recommend Maryn
McKenna's book, "Superbug."

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.480
It's a great -- it's actually --

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.570
it's a very long title
if you read it.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.290
But I just focus on the
green part, "Superbug."

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.180
It's a really, really
well-written book.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.200
It reads like a novel,
but it's a nonfiction.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.470 position:56%
But if you don't have time for that,
you can just go to the CDC website

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.170
and you can learn about the
five Cs of MRSA transmission.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:57.410 position:56%
These are the things that we know
lead to the transmission of M R S A.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.480
So crowding, frequent
skin-to-skin contact,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.060
so rubbing up against one
another, compromised skin, so cuts

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.570
and abrasions, contaminated
items and surfaces,

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.060
and then a general
lack of cleanliness.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.390
The last two seem a
little redundant to me,

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.160
but I'm not criticizing the CDC.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.880
Okay. They don't go onto say where
the five Cs are really prevalent,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.680
and I guess you would want to
stay away from those places.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.240
So the five Cs are common --

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.250 position:56%
and locations where the five Cs are
common include schools, dormitories,

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.920
military barracks, households,
stay away from those,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.000
correctional facilities,
and daycare centers, right;

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.630
so all the places we
kind of hang out, right?

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.590
And I think what they're getting
at is that where you have crowding,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.990
where you have people
living close to one another,

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.840
you can pass these bacteria along.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.850
But when I see the five Cs, I
don't think about households,

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.210
I think about a concentrated
animal feeding operation.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.110
Now you have full-grown pigs.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.140
This is the way they look
when they're full-grown,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.740
just about ready for slaughter.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.040
So this is what we call a

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.480
"concentrated animal feeding
operation," crowding, contacts,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.150
compromised skin, they bite
each other, they get abrasion

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.540
from the fencing, contaminated
items and surfaces.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.960
I'd say pig poop by
definition is sort of,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.270
you know, a lack of cleanliness.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.280
So it's no wonder that we've
seen the emergence just

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.920
in the past decade or
more of something called

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.870
"livestock-associated MRSA."

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:28.110
So new strains of MRSA
directly traceable back

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.910
to livestock production,
and we call these "LA-MRSA."

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.960
So these disproportionately
affect farmers, farm workers,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.600
veterinarians, and
actually the people who live

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.080
with those people as well.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.220
So a few years ago,
we decided we wanted

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.560
to understand the origins
of pig MRSA.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.550
So we collected MRSA strains as
MRSA -- this is sequence type 398.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.860
This is just a geeky label that
people like me put on bacteria.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.240
I'll talk more about
sequence types later.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.820
But we collected all these, and
we collected them from people,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.130
and from animals, and
those that were M R S A,

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:12.120
and those that were
susceptible to Methicillin,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.530
and we sequenced the genomes
of nearly a hundred of these.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.120
And then we drew an
evolutionary tree

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.000
to understand how they were
related to one another.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.720
And so this was the tree.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.120
I don't expect you guys
to really memorize this,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.070
but each of these nodes -- sorry,
each of these little names,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.690
the little digits at the
end is a little islet,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.080
that is a different staph bacteria.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.240
And then pink is from people --

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.550
sorry pink is from animals,
and gray is from people.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.770
And you see that the pink
are all clustered up there.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.480
It turns out that that's
the livestock lineage,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.860
and these down here
are the older ones,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.010
those are the livestock
independent lineages.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.830
Those are the ones of people.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.110
And so what we learned
from doing this was

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.590
that the livestock associated

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.750
with MRSA actually evolved
from staph and people.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.050
So I have a cartoon version.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.350
I think this is better.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.960
Right; so Fisher-Price
is better even

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.660
for Nobel laureates,
they've told me.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.210
All right; so it turns out we
have staph circulating in people.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.750
Those people inadvertently
pass staph to the animals.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.410
So -- well this is kind
of gross, but, you know,

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.060
farmer blow snot rockets.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.160
Anyway, you can share
bacteria with your animals

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.550
from your nose, possibly.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:32.570
And then where we're using
lots of antibiotics in animals,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:38.660 position:56%
we get this transition from M S S
A, so susceptible, to M R S A, MRSA.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.630
And then that's spreading
now to back to people.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.700
And this is a very
clear -- we have --

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.430
this epidemiology is very clear
now that this is happening.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.300
What's also happening, and
I mentioned this before,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.310
is that the people living with
these people are at very high risk

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.670
for picking these up as well.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.300
But the story continues to evolve.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.650
So we're studying this very
intensely in Northern Europe

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.780 position:56%
where we have access to the animals,
to drug records, to everything,

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.910
whereas in the United States,
we get a shotgun in our face

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.570
when we try to go onto these farms.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.720
But there we can study
these very clearly.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.440
And we see now it's spilling
over into the general community.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.570
It's usually the people
living near these farm workers

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.610
or around the farm, so it could
be environmental exposures,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.000
or it could be secondary
exposure to these people.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.710
We've seen outbreaks in hospitals

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.200
that are clearly the
livestock strains.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.860 position:56%
And it's from these people going
into the hospital and then a mistake

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.430 position:56%
with the hand hygiene, probably, and
they pass it onto other patients.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.230
And then we now we see
for the first time,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.250 position:56%
we just published this two weeks ago
in the Clinical Infectious Diseases,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.590
a really important journal in
my field that there's evidence

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.030
of food-borne transmission too.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.500
And this is this first
time that we've seen this.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.010
So this is continuing to evolve.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.900
We see that the DNA of
these bacteria are changing,

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.360
and they appear to becoming -- some
strains are becoming adapted back

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.920
to humans, and so they could
spread better among humans.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.380
And so we're keeping
our eye on this,

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.060
and we're using these DNA
technologies to keep watching it.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.300
It's now become a textbook
example, though.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.750
So this is just my little
cue to remind me to say this.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.580
This is a textbook example of what
happens when you use antibiotics

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.710
in the livestock production,
what can happen to people.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.310
And so when I went to -- I spoke
at the CDC back in January,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.010 position:56%
and I was just, you know, going over
my slides and I put this slide in.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.080
And I said, "I should just
double-check that they still have

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.840
that up on their website."

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.510
And I went there and they'd
modified it and they added this.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.250
So they added, "And areas where
animal handling is common,

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.440
such as a veterinary clinics
and livestock settings."

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.560
So they saw our paper, I guess,
and many, many other papers coming

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.460
out on livestock associated MRSA,
and they modified their website.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.540
The CDC is -- these
are real scientists,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.420
and they are an amazing group
of people really looking

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.560
out for our health, and I
thought this was very cool.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.870
Okay; I'm switching to E. Coli now.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.010
So staph is the one that lives
on our skin and our noses.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.770
E. Coli lives in your gut.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.890
And E. Coli has a lot
of personalities.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.550
Right; there are thousands
of strains of E. Coli.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.670
But from a clinical
perspective, there's three;

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.690
there's the good, the
bad, and the ugly.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.770
So the good is the kind that about
30% of us carry in our gut now.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.370
It's just part of our microbiome,

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.100
probably just helping
us with digestion.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.290
The bad is the kind that like
the Jack-in-the-box E. Coli

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.970 position:56%
from the early '90s, right, so
these dramatic food borne outbreaks.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.000
Jack-in-the-Box responded very well
and helped have something called

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.410
"HACP, which is "hazard
analysis and control points."

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.180
So this really revolutionized
food safety in the United States.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.740
But we still have these
outbreaks of the bad E. Coli,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.310
the diarrhea-causing E. Coli.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.970
And about 52 to 100 people die

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.200
of that E. Coli each year
in the United States.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.070
But the ugly, the really, really
bad one, or super-bad as I

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.500
like to say sometimes, is the kind

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.480
that causes urinary
tract infections.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.680
And this one kills about 36,000

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.100
or 40,000 people each
year in the United States.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.780
So let me tell you a
little bit about expac,

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.930 position:56%
extra-intestinal pathogenic E. Coli.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.040
Has special features; it
has attachment factors.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.890
It has these little
hooks on its surfaces

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.880
to attach to your urethral cells.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.660
It can cloak itself
from the immune system.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.890
So it can hide itself
from the immune cells

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.210
that want to gobble it up.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.510
It can produce toxins.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.970
It can acquire iron.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.270
It can survive.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.570
It can deal with uric acid.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.700
So it can deal with the harsh
environment of the bladder.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.890
And it causes six to eight
million bladder infections

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.400
in the United States each year,

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.660
a quarter million kidney
infections, at least.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.910
I think this is an underestimate,
and these numbers are getting old.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.390
These are 2006 numbers.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.900
And also deadly blood infections.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.400
So as I said before, about
36,000 to 40,000 deaths in 2006.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.660
The number's almost
certainly higher today.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.930 position:56%
And antibiotics are critical to
prevent this ascent from the bladder

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.850
into the kidneys, and then into
the blood where it kills you.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.190
And so antibiotic resistance
is a major challenge

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.920
when it comes to expac.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.940
So I want to lock in
this relationship,

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.820
because not many people
-- I didn't know this

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.290
until I met this guy named Jim
Johnson, a wonderful professor

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.650
at the University of Minnesota.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.590
And he's like, "Lance, you
need to be looking at E. Coli,

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.080
because E. Coli causes all
these bladder infections."

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.730
It turns out it kills
-- it causes 80

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.190 position:56%
to 85 percent of bladder infections.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.730
So E. Coli is the main
neuropathogen.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.150
The gut is the immediate reservoir.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.240
So it's really E. Coli getting from
the gut into the urinary tract.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.460
I'd love to talk for a while
about how that happens,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.980
but I mean there are lots
of ways that happens.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.920
Sex is one way; the
best way, I think.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.750
So it's much better than riding a
bike with dirty underwear, I think.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.920 position:56%
[Laughter] And then so
understanding that it's the bacteria

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.970
in the gut getting
into the urinary tract.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.120
And women -- I won't
ask for a show of hands,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.840
but women are at a much greater
risk for urinary tract infections,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.820
at least until we get into our 70s.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.720
So understanding how
these things then get

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.640
into our guy is really important.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.640
And I, along with a number
of people, are real pioneers

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.840
in this field have been asking
this question, "Is it possible

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.570
that food-borne bacteria,

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.150
E. Coli are causing the
urinary tract infections?"

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.670
So this guy, Lee Riley, in the
middle was the first one working

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:40.920
with Amy Mangus, on the end
there, to ask this question.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.900
They recognized these outbreaks
of urinary tract infections

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.290
and they said, "This looks
like a food-borne outbreak."

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.890
But they were still dancing
around this a little bit,

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.420 position:56%
and it's really the genomic methods.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.470
And I'm going to tell you a
little bit about what we're doing

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.400
to really resolve this issue.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.300
That's Jim Johnson
between Amy and Lee,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.340
and this is Neal Molar
[phonetic] from Denmark

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.720
who also does really
wonderful work on this.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.300
And they're all friends
and collaborators.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.880
So in 2012 -- actually 2011,
I had this idea that I want

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.440
to do this study to understand
this, to quantify this,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.160
and to prove whether it
does or does not happen.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.120
And so I was living in Flagstaff.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.380
That's where one of
my labs is in Arizona.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.720
And it's a small
geographically-isolated city,

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.870
and we said, "Let's go
to every grocery store

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.560
in the town twice per month and
buy every brand of chicken, turkey,

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.030
and pork, and let's team up at
the hospital, where my friend,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.170
my good old classmate, runs
the infectious program --

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.590
or the infectious disease program,
and let's collect every E. Coli

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.890
from every urinary tract infection
and blood infection over the course

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:51.690
of a year the same
year, in the same town,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.620
and let's see if we can resolve
how much overlap there is."

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.990
And so we did that.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.640
And at the end of the year, we'd
sample nearly 2500 meat product,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.070
and we got almost 1300
urinary tract infections

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.220
from Flagstaff Medical Center.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.420
So this is what we found
in the meat supply.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.210
It turns out most of
the meat that we tested,

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.840
81% on average was
contaminated with E. Coli.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.110
No surprise, E. Coli is an
indicator of fecal contamination.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:23.360
You have feces in your meat.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.880
[Laughs] Sorry.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.430
Sorry, cook it, wash your hands.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.770
But nearly 90% of the
poultry products

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.830
that we tested were contaminated
with E. Coli, and 60% of pork.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.700
All right; we looked at then
what were these resistant to?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.400
They were resistant to lots
of different antibiotics.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.100
And so the blue line, the
blue column is from chicken.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.590
So this are the E.
Coli from chicken.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.930
Each of these three-letter
codes is a different antibiotic.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.950
And the percent is the percent
of the E. Coli that we tested

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.250
that was resistant to these
different antibiotics.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:01.510
And what you see, you will notice
that turkey is off-scale, right?

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.810
Why is that?

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.680
Well, I would guess that it's

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.190
because they're using
more antibiotics

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.360
than these other commodity
producers.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.230
But in the United States,
we don't have the right

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.560
to know what antibiotics are
being used in which animals,

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.510
because that's a trade secret.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.610
Antibiotic use in animal
production is a secret.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.200
It's their secret for making
cheap meat for you guys.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.370
Now, don't have that sour look.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.480 position:56%
The one place where gentamicin is --

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.810
the one place where chicken beats
turkey is actually gentamicin.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:34.890
And that's because it's legal to
inject chicken eggs with gentamicin

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.260
in the United States, to prevent
infections from possibly occurring.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.040
So we have these machines, we have
machines that injects pallets full

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.890
of eggs simultaneously while
we're also administering vaccines.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.220
Vaccines, I love; I
think that's a good idea.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.470
Injecting antibiotics
into eggs, terrible idea.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.320
And we did a study of people
who catch chickens for a living

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.830
and they had 32 times the risk

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:02.840
of carrying gentamicin resistant
E. Coli as their community peers.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.970
So now we're asking are
these bacteria related?

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:10.620
So we have 1900 -- or nearly
2,000 E. Coli from the meat.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.490 position:56%
So 81% of all those products that we
tested, we got E. Coli from there.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.500
And then we have E. Coli from
urine and blood in the hospital.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.800
And now what are we going to do,

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.100
we're going to sequence
all those genomes.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.470
I told you it got really
cheap, right?

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.550
And we have a million dollar grant.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.850
We spent it in two years.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.070
We had a million dollar
grant to do this.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.610
And so we sequenced all
of those genomes using one

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.810 position:56%
of these next generation sequencers.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.110
So we have a three-step approach.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:41.270
And this is kind of wonky, so
just roll with me for a minute.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.980
I'll boil it back down
with Fisher-Price,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.890
or I'll at least try
to be simple about it.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.920
So what we do is we
sequence the genomes,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.700
and then we do a low-resolution
genotype,

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.410
so using a standard method called
multi-locus sequence typing.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:58.710
Doesn't matter.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.710
But we assign them to a sequence
type so we can group them together.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.550
And then we use the whole
genome to understand

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.550
to make one of those family trees.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.300
If we try to do them altogether,
we lose resolution actually,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.600
so this is the way that we do it.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.800
We group them, then
we make a family tree.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.510
We group them, we make
a family tree.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.410 position:56%
And we ask at a very high resolution

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.540
with the best resolution
you could ever hope

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.620
to have using the whole genome
sequence, "How are these related

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.370
to one another, what we see in the
food and what we see in the people

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.180
in the same city, over the
same course of the year?"

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.520
Okay; so here's the first thing.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.290
So this is just that
initial grouping

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.400
and how they're related
to one another.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.700
This is really cool.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.020
So the size of the bubble is --

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.060 position:56%
sorry, the number is the sequence
type, so that's the DNA fingerprint.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.670
It doesn't matter, just like
-- consider it like a name,

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.360
Fred, Jane, Larry, whatever.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.830
So and then the size of the
bubble means that there were more

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.940
of the E. Coli with that name.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.630
So sequence slide 131 is one

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.780
of the most important E.
Coli-causing urinary tract

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.820
infections in the United States
today; actually, globally.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.520
And we did a study where we showed
it's a brand-new strain that's gone

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.020
pandemic in a very short time.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.830 position:56%
And then if it's yellow, it's urine.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.560
If it's red, it's meat.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.860
And that's not by accident.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.380
Right; so meat is red,
yellow is urine.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.520
And then if you have a
little line connecting them,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.580
they're related to one another.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.910
And I think what you can see is

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.240
that you've got your reds
all clumping together,

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.230
and you've got your
golds clumping together.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.250
So these are all related together
to one another at some level.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.470
But what you see is you have
Pac Man-shaped bubbles, right?

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:43.860
So some -- you see these red pie
pieces in the gold bubbles, right,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.950
the yellow -- urine yellow bubbles.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:51.930
And you see yellow pie pieces
in the meat red bubbles, right,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.230 position:56%
suggesting population overlap there.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.540
And but at this level, this is
low-resolution so we can't say

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:06.400
with confidence that yes, meat
was the source of that infection

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.670
from 117, or those 131 infections.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.040
We can't say that meat
was definitely a source.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.870
But what we can do is we can
take these little bubbles,

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.630
and we can draw that
high-resolution tree,

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.690
and we can actually look
at it in great detail.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.990
I hope you guys can see the color.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.320
Can you see that there's
red and black?

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.190
So black is from a urinary tract
infection, red is from meat.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:30.910
So sticking -- gold
won't show up, right,

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.370
so I had to stick with
black for this one.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.000
All right; what you see is you
have two different lineages.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.900
They're distinct, right?

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.210
So we would call none of these
urinary tract infections.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.610
We're not going to call
any of these food-borne.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.780
We're using a very conservative
view of this, and we're saying,

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.080
"These are two separate
lineages; they're unrelated."

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.380
So let me show you another one.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.860
There's ST-58, so that's
the name of that one.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.640
Let's draw a tree with that one.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.720
You see that the urinary
tract infections,

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.530
the islet of the black ones are
nested all throughout the red.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.200
They all share common
ancestors with the food,

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.870
and those are very short branches.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.050
That means that they all came from
the same population very recently.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:16.460
And so these are food-borne
urinary tract infections.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.750
So we do that with each of these
bubbles; we go through each one.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.510
SC 95 looks promising, right,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.780
it looks like there can
be some overlap there.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.310
But it turns out that --
and I know you can't --

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.280
I realize now that you
can't see the color,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.750
but the only red you see
is up there all by itself.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.380 position:56%
And so we're going to conservatively
say that these are unrelated.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.390
It's possible that they are
related, but we're going

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.170
to be very conservative
for this first round

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:43.690 position:56%
of estimating how many urinary tract
infections are coming from food.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.070
Because I can tell you, there's
an industry that does not want any

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.120
of these to be food borne.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.270
So very conservatively,
the blue circles --

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.180
and those were supposed to be
hidden until right now, surprise,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.830 position:56%
but it didn't work; the blue circles
represent all of those bubbles

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:06.150 position:56%
where we have very clear, very
close high-resolution relationships.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.670
So each of those represents
food-borne transmission;

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:14.650
in our opinion, my
opinion and my colleagues.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.390
So today -- now these
numbers are not final.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.340
If you are the media, I
wouldn't show you these data yet,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.630
but this is our most conservative
estimate, that nine percent

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.770
of the urinary tract infections
in Flagstaff, Arizona --

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.570
and Flagstaff, Arizona is very
representative of the rest

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.650
of the country, because all the
meat that we produce is produced

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.470
in these local areas and then
distributed throughout the country.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.930
So nine percent is our
very conservative estimate,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.790
and it may be as high as 12-plus.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:52.410
When we loosen up our -- yes when
we loosen it up, it's 12-plus.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.100
So we're talking about -- now
if you scale that to the rest

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.340
of the country, we're talking about
over half a million infections --

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.470
at our -- at the most conservative
estimate, half a million

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:07.370
to 700,000 infections that we
had no idea were food borne.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.420
So this represents a
totally different paradigm,

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.690
and a new conduit for
resistance genes from --

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.180
a newly-recognized conduit

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.970
of resistance genes
from animals to people.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.050
And I can tell you, the other
thing that we haven't even looked

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.410
at is the resistance genes
moving independently,

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.040
which is another thing
we have to look at.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.570
So I just want to stop here
for a second, and, you know,

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.870
I always see confusion when I talk

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.730
about food-borne urinary
tract infections.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.340
So what happens is that
you mishandle the poultry,

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.570
or you consume undercooked
poultry or some other meat,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.900 position:56%
and you consume the E. Coli, it
gets in your gut, and it grows there

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.770
for a little while and then it
makes the short trip from --

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:50.190
sorry to be graphic, from
your anus to your urethra,

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.540
and you have a bladder
infection from food.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.020
Okay; does that make sense?

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.120
So we coin this term "food-borne
urinary tract infections."

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.110
I like to call them "foodies,"
foodies against foodies.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.680
And this is truly a paradigm
shift in what is a food borne,

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.420
or a food-associated infection.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.260
Right; it's no longer --
sorry I'm a microbiologist;

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.410
it's no longer diarrhea
and vomiting, right?

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:22.230 position:56%
Now it can be MRSA infection, it can
be an untreatable bladder infection.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:26.530
And it gives us new context
for those 34 million pounds

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.950
of antibiotics that we use in
the United States each year.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:34.960
But we are not alone, right, and
we've distributed this model,

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.740 position:56%
we've shown this model of industrial
animal production to the world.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.710
And the world is changing
their consumption habits.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.000 position:56%
So the BRICS nations, Brazil,
Russian, India, China, South Africa,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.010
these countries are
developing very quickly,

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.430
and they're adopting
our meat-centric diet,

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.940
and they're adopting our
methods of producing animals

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.990 position:56%
in these industrialized system
using lots of different antibiotics.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.580
And this is a global challenge
that we all have to meet.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.180
And the problem is that we
don't have a box to stand on,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.480
because we've been doing it.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.950
We designed the system,

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:13.060
and we really haven't
changed much over the years.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.320
And my birthday is November 19th; I
don't know if you can see the date,

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.670
but November 19th this
hit the media cycle.

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.810
So new mobile resistance element
was found in animals and people.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.000
So it turns out that China
had adopted our methods

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.520
of using antibiotics in
food animal production.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.090
They were using our last
drug, a drug called Colastin,

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.280
our last drug for treating CRE,

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.710
carbapenem-resistant
enterobacteriaceae,

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.220
that's super E. Coli,
super-resistant E. Coli

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.070
and its cousins to
klebsiella and those guys.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:49.750
They were using that drug to
raise animals using our model;

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:54.180
because it was an old drug,
nobody cared about it until we ran

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.660
out of drugs and we got desperate
and we started using colistin.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.960
And then all of the sudden,

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.770
we realized that this
new gene had evolved.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.070
We'd never seen it before.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.080
It was a mobile piece of DNA,

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.830
a piece of DNA that's
very readily transmissible

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.730
between different strains
of E. Coli and klebsiella.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:17.290
And so this just hit my
field like a ton of bricks.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:22.310
And in the weeks that
followed, we had my colleagues

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.110
around the world started
scanning their databases of DNA

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.490 position:56%
and I said, "Hey, it's here already.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.790
Hey, it's over here already."

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:32.220
The highest concentration
that we've seen is in China

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.550
where they were doing this.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.920
But we found it now it's already
in the United States as well.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.740
And that's that last -- this is
the last card for that royal flush.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.530
So for CRE, some strains of
CRE are just missing one gene,

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.150
and this is it, to be untreatable.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:55.870
And so now we're talking about
untreatable bacteria on meat.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.300
But we don't even recognize
this kind

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.860
of E. Coli is food-borne pathogens.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.160
So how do we regulate that?

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.500
How do we say we don't
want your product?

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.370
And how do we respond to
China and other countries

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:11.860
that are using our last drugs
for food animal production,

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.200
or any drugs, you know, in an
abusive fashion, how do we respond

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.590
to them when we do the same
thing in the United States?

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.070
It's really difficult.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.910
So I'm just wrapping up.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:28.750
I just have a couple of final
thoughts, and then we can talk.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.140
The flyer said, "Antibiotics,
good or bad?"

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.620
Antibiotics, good.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.430
I mean, antibiotics have
saved countless lives

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.730
since their discovery,

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:43.480 position:56%
since Alexander Fleming accidentally
discovered penicillin in the 1930s,

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.320
and they were introduced
to human medicine.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.850
Yes; they have a profound effect
on our microbiome, that is,

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.150
the community of bacteria

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.340
that we actually are,
you know, dependent on.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:48:00.370 position:56%
But our microbiomes generally
recover from those temporary things,

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:05.040
and these antibiotics save us from
the immediate, the acute infection

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.410
that we're suffering from.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:07.870
Someday we might have
something better

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.330
that specifically kills
just the bad bacteria

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.060
and leaves the good bacteria
intact, and those are some

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.330
of the things we're
trying to work on at GW.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:21.210
But for now, this is the
best thing that we have,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.010
and we should really protect them.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.290
And then the other
thing I want to say is

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.710
that sick animals need antibiotics.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.850
So I don't want anybody to walk out
of here thinking that I'm saying

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.850
that we shouldn't treat sick
animals with antibiotics.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.450
We should.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:37.120
But if we have a system that
makes animals sick by design,

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.770
that system's broken and we
have to change that system.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:43.050
And we may not have to go
to something as radical

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:47.920
as free-ranging happy little pigs,
but we should be raising them

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.180
in a way that doesn't
make them sick repeatedly.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.010
I mean, if you can predict it
based on a clock or a calendar

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.220
that they're going to get sick
and you have to have antibiotics,

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.680 position:56%
that system's broken, in my opinion.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.740
And the last thing I want to
end with is a message of hope.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:08.010
I don't think that the
post-antibiotic era is inevitable.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.480
I mean, some people
have already reached it,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.920
23,000 Americans die
each year, right,

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.410
but this time when
there's just no antibiotics

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.640
at work, that's not inevitable.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.390
I just came back from Scandinavia.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.950
They really control
antibiotics in animals,

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.350
they really control
antibiotics in human medicine,

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.440
and have really good
hygiene in the hospitals,

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.210
and they have really low
drug resistance rates.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.150
And the people who have
drug-resistant infections are often

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.790
returning from travel, or have
consumed imported meat products.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:44.430
So there is hope, but we
have to do this globally.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:47.270
And I do think we can do it.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.830
So just -- none of you guys
care about this, but this is --

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.780
science takes massive teamwork.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:50:00.070
I have computer scientists, I have
clinical research coordinators,

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.400
I have clinicians, I
have lab technicians,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.870
I have very dedicated
people that work with me,

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.170
and I appreciate them all.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:13.660 position:56%
So I can just go out and talk about
it and draw Fisher-Price characters.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.750
So with that, I'll stop.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.550
Thank you.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.340
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: [Inaudible]
questions?

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.640
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Yes; I'm
very happy to take questions.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.940
I'll stay as long as you want.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.660
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Could
you repeat the questions?

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.960
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Yes.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.260
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Any questions?

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.310
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible], how do
antibiotics kill bacteria?

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.120
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: So how do
antibiotics kill bacteria?

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.400
There are a lot of different
molecular mechanisms,

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:44.790
but on a very high level, they
either block DNA synthesis,

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.630
RNA synthesis, so that's DNA
goes to RNA goes to proteins.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:53.160
They block protein synthesis,
or they block the cell walls

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.700
that the bacteria need to
hold themselves together.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.600
So they're just blocking
the essential steps

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.580
of making a bacteria.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.880
Yes.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.610
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Other question?

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.270
&gt;&gt; So how do you [inaudible]
hospitals

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:14.670
and when doctors prescribe
antibiotics,

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:19.680
they gave the suggestion
of [inaudible],

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:27.500
and what reference do they have to
make those suggestions to patients?

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.210
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: So your
question is, "One of the things

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:32.460
that doctors say is that you
should take an antibiotic

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.510
for a specific period,
and only for that period?"

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.390
Lance Price: Yes; so I think

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:43.350
that that's something they're
really trying to dial in.

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:47.920 position:56%
I mean, it's not a perfect science
yet, like how long do you take them,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.080
and how much do you take?

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.770
Right; so it's really adjusted for
body mass size, and you've noticed

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:57.750
in the United States that body
masses are changing, right?

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:03.220 position:56%
And but what we're learning is that
-- or what some drugs we're learning

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.000
that you can cut back the amount
of time that people are on,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.760
so that you reduce that pressure
on all the bacteria in the person.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.630
Right; so you can dial that back.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.300
But you should do it for -- you
should take them for as long

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.550
as the doctor says you should
take them, and let them figure

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.280
out what that time should be.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.260
But right now, you know, if they
say ten days, take it for ten days;

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.170
if they say three days,
take it for three days.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:27.620
Did I answer your question?

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.850
&gt;&gt; Right. I just think maybe
it's not optimized in regards

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:41.190
to being treated ended up
unnecessarily so that overdose

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.550
of any kind actually helped
to, you know, [inaudible].

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:45.510
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Right;
so I agree both dosing

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.970
and who gets antibiotics
is not optimized.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.090
Right; so people are --

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.690
doctors often prescribe what
we called "empirically," right?

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:56.690
So somebody comes in and they
have some symptoms that could be

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.500 position:56%
or could not be bacterial
infections, but they don't have time

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.960
to like collect the culture,
and wait for the culture,

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.680
or they don't think they have time
to do this, collect the culture,

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.840
wait for the culture to come
back, check those records,

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.670
and then make a reactive
recommendation.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:15.070
And so they just guess and they
say, "Ah, you probably have E. Coli

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:18.140
in your bladder, and it's
probably susceptible to this.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.440
Here's a prescription.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.740
Get out of here."

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.790
And so what we really want to do
is move towards a rapid molecular

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:29.230
diagnostics so they can
collect the pee in the office,

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:33.140
and within 15 minutes know
exactly what you're infected with,

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.870
what it's susceptible to, and
give you the exact antibiotics

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.020
that you should have
for the exact duration.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.860
And I think we'll be there
in a few years, actually.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.760
Yes. I mean, the molecular
techniques are out there.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:53.530
Yes. You had a question back there.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.830
Yes?

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:59.390
&gt;&gt; Yes; [inaudible] so
what is your recommendation

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.100
for staying clear of [inaudible] --

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.460
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: What should you
do; is that what you're -- [laughs]

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:09.140
&gt;&gt; Yes; should we go organic,
should we give up eating?

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.300
I mean, what is your [inaudible]?

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.600
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: So I'd
be a hypocrite to say

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.280
that you should give up meat,
although it is a healthy choice.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.870
I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:23.370
But that is one way to avoid food
borne drug-resistant bacteria.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.930 position:56%
The other part of this, though, is
that nine billion animals make a lot

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.430
of poop, and that poop is
used as fertilizer on crops

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.200
where they grow vegetables
that vegetarians eat.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.890
Right; so this is an
ecological problem.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:39.760
So we don't -- you know, consumer
choice helps, but we really --

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.980
you know, we need to tackle
this as a global community.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.340
But yes so what I do is
personally is I only buy products

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.020
that are raised from animals
raised with that antibiotic,

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.320
so I look for that label.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.040
That's the only label
that really matters there.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.240
Or organic is also a
label that indicates

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.850
that they have not been
treated with antibiotics.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:02.360
And then there's a new label that's
coming out that's responsibly used.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:10.240
What's the actual term -- anyway
there's a responsible use term

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.070
that they're working on
now, and that has to be --

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:17.670
we're really pushing for that
to be only third-party verified.

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.560
So it has the be the USDA verifying

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.770
that they're actually
using them responsibly,

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:25.040
which would only be
to treat sick animals.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.660 position:56%
And so we need -- I'm really leery
of this, but I do think that we need

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.440
to get there eventually is allowing
for the treatment of sick animals

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.140
and still selling that, you
know, with a specific label.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.010
But it has to be third-party
verified.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.960
We can't count on companies
to make that designation.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Right; I was told that organic --
there are certain levels of organic,

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.540
so they still use antibiotics,

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:51.960
or some type of hormones,
just not as many.

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.200
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Not with organic;
organics is a very tight label.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.300
That's a meaning -- natural
is just complete garbage.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.220
So natural is the one
you're probably thinking of.

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.390
That just means there's no
plastic in there, you know?

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:07.850 position:56%
[Laughter] You know, I mean, so yes.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.180
Yes, and then -- yes.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.910
&gt;&gt; Is there any significant
legislation

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.190
from [inaudible] try to
address these issues?

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.920
And if you were to impose new
legislation today to [inaudible],

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.610
what would be the key [inaudible]?

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Right; Louise
Slaughter is our only microbiologist

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:28.050
in Congress, and she has
repeatedly put forth legislation

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:34.580
to reduce antibiotic use in animal
production to only therapeutic use,

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.780
and bring all antibiotic use
under control of the veterinarian.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:44.930
And that has been received
almost as if you were proposing

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:52.110 position:56%
to require all schoolboy -- all
male children in school wear skirts.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:57.090 position:56%
It's somehow just super-radical that
you would only allow antibiotics

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.670
to be used for sick animals.

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:03.440
So Louise Slaughter's bill,
it never gets voted on.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.690
But that -- it's a great bill,
PAMTA, Preservation of Antibiotics

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.500
for Medical Treatment Act.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.040
And I can't remember the
name of the Senate side bill.

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:19.570
But I think with more and
more companies coming onboard

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:24.250 position:56%
with saying -- you know, like, big
companies like McDonald's and Tyson,

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.100
and big producers saying,
"Hey, we're going to get rid

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.390 position:56%
of non-therapeutic biotics, at least

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.180
in poultry" it makes
it a safer environments

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.000
for Congress to kind of step in.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.240 position:56%
And so we're hoping that a bill like
that might gain momentum someday,

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.010
and God Bless Louise Slaughter.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.600
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.900
What's that?

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.200
&gt;&gt; What was the name,
one more time, PAMTA?

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.180
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: PAMTA,
Preservation of Antibiotics

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.350
for Medical Treatment Act.

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.890
And I really like that.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:54.180
There's also star legislation --

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.950
I don't know if that one's
still getting introduced,

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.910
but that was something that Stuart
Levy was a real champion of,

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.800
which is just real
monitoring of antibiotics

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.100
and antibiotic resistance.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.220
And that's one of the things
that we need, we need data.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.520
I mean, it's ridiculous

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.500
that antibiotic use can be
considered a trade secret.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.170
It is a shared resource that
needs to be productive by all

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:17.190
of us, and it's just a shame.

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:19.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:23.060
And FDA has done some
things, but not enough.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:30.420
&gt;&gt; I heard that the bacteria
in pork is very hard to kill.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:38.960 position:56%
Even if you cook the pork well done,
the bacteria is still not killed.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.960
I mean, that is -- I
heard from [inaudible],

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.800
and she said that's
why we don't eat pork,

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.120
[laughter] because it's still the
same, and I heard it from somebody

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.290 position:56%
who is doing research, and I ate it.

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:57.900
So I don't know whether
that is true.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.210
To me, bacteria is
bacteria, and you kill them

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.710
at the same temperature
wherever they are, right?

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:07.930
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Yes; there can
be a little bit of variation

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:11.670
in thermo-stability,
but I'm with you.

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.690
Most it is very killable
with cooking

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:19.110
and a well-done pork chop
is not a risk factor.

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:21.800
It's handling that raw pork chop
that you bring into your house.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.890
And there used to be
something called "trichinosis,"

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:29.420
and there still is trichinosis that
you can get from undercooked pork.

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.640
But in the United States,
it's largely absent

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.750
from our pork production, and
that's not even a bacteria,

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:36.310
and that's a parasite.

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:44.070 position:56%
So we've seen some -- there are some
strains of E. Coli, for instance,

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.950
that are a little more heat-stable,

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:48.780
but nothing that could put
up with a good grilling.

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.510 position:56%
Yes. Do I need to shut up or -- yes.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:54.550
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.860
&gt;&gt; I've got a question
regarding like hand washing

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.490
and antibacterial soap,
wasn't that recently sort

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.260
of [inaudible] scaling
back the use of it?

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.560
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Right.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.560
&gt;&gt; How does that kind
of affect [inaudible] --

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.840
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Yes; so there's
something called "triclosan,"

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.880
and "triclocarban" that
they put into soaps.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.540
These are antimicrobials
that they put into soaps.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.740
And, you know, it never
really -- it was never --

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.610
triclosan soaps were never really
any better than regular soap.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.670
I mean, it's the physical
action in these little bubbles

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.360
that actually take the
bacteria off your hands

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.000 position:56%
and flush them down the sink, right?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.490
And but the problem is that those
drugs can in the environment select

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:37.790
for drug-resistant bacteria.

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:41.510
But they can also produce these
stable toxic compounds that look

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.490
like dioxin in the environment.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:48.360
And so it was never a good idea,
it was just always a sales gimmick.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.160
And so I understand that
they're trying to ban that now,

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.410
and it couldn't be sooner.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.860
Yes.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.160
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Okay.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.460
Please join me in thanking
Dr. Price.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.760
&gt;&gt; Lance Price: Oh, thank you.

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:05.300
Thank you.
