00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.275
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:04.650
ANA PATRICIA ESQUEDA: Nobody
in my family,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.066
or at least the generation
before me, has gone to college.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.420
So even within my generation,
I'm the first one.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.060
The hardest part of
being first-generation

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.400
is that you, at
least at home, don't

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.810
have anyone who's guiding you.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.950
So my mom didn't know what a
personal statement was, or she

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.700
didn't know how to
apply to financial aid.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.158
She didn't even
realize that we had

00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:26.140
to have records of our
taxes to submit every year.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.930
So it's the little things
where you take them for granted

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.830
before you're
applying to college.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.429
But then when you're
applying, and it's so hard

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:34.720
to even explain to your family.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.761
And then with me, there
was the language barrier.

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.230
NIMISHA BARTON:
Ana Patricia began

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.410
with the Princeton University
Preparatory Program, also known

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.070
as PUPP,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.960
a selective college
prep program that

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.050
helps first-gen, low-income
students in the area

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.380
get into highly selective
college programs.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.410
And then of course, FSI,
Freshman Scholars Institute,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.370
which is a summer
academic bridge program.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.120
And then finally, the Scholars
Institute Fellows Program

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.600
kind of allows us to continue
to provide mentorship

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.420
to these students, to remain
in close touch with them,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.050
primarily through the workshops.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.920
Some of the roundtables, some
of the panels that we offer,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.710
that's meant to kind of
help them navigate what it's

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.170
like to be a student
at Princeton in terms

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.854
of the academic skills
you have to have,

00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:00.270
and in terms of, just sort of
like, mental health and life

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.160
skills kind of support.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.820
ANA PATRICIA ESQUEDA: 
SIFP has also helped

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.220
in terms of building
or maintaining

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.770
that community of low-income
or first-generation students

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.090
who are kind of going through
the same thing at once,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.570
and who can help one another in
terms of how to pick a major,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.480
how to balance
your workload, how

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.185
to find internships --
things that,

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:23.170
to someone who is coming as
a first-generation college

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.510
student, you kind of
need that guidance.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.760
NIMISHA BARTON: It's extremely
important for Princeton

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.400
to continue its policies
around college access,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.860
and also to continue in the
vein that it already has begun --

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.680
creating these programs,
these continuing

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.120
support programs for students.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.240
These four-year programs,
I think, ultimately

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.221
render visible all things that
all students need to succeed.

00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:50.470
ANA PATRICIA ESQUEDA: I don't know
exactly how I got interested

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.335
in psychology.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.710
But I know what I want to do --
criminal psychology, which

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.090
would be working with inmates.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.460
Our criminal justice
system doesn't really

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.530
do justice to the inmates
that are in the prison system.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.870
And then back to my upbringing,
the criminal justice system

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.620
of Venezuela is even more
messed up in its ways.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.030
So I think having
a way to impact

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.072
the lives of those inmates,
and having a way of finding out

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:18.280
why they're doing the crimes
that they're committing,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.480
and how we can stop that before
it even gets to that point.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.700
NIMISHA BARTON: I hope
that Ana Patricia finds

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.300
independent projects with
faculty advisers and mentors

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.780
here that are really
meaningful and exciting to her.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.700
She just has so much to
offer, and so much potential.
