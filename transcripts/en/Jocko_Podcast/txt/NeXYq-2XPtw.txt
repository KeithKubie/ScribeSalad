Speaker 1:          00:00          Sometimes bad things, horrible things happen to good people and I don't, I don't know why,

Speaker 2:          00:15          but

Speaker 1:          00:17          life isn't fair that that's, that's the reality and disease like cancer and ms and horrible diseases and accidents and these things. A good person in the wrong place in the wrong time can end up just a victim of, of, of feet and, and of reality. And it can be horrible and heart wrenching, but when those bad things happen,

Speaker 2:          01:13          okay

Speaker 1:          01:14          to people around you, what are you going to do? How are you going to lead? Are you going to get angry or do you going to get frustrated? Are you going to lash out at people who, who are you going to lash out at anyways? Are you going to start going down the spiral of negativity? Are you going to let this horrible situation dictate the way you feel and the way you handle it? Are you gonna fall over and fall down and fall apart or or are you going to lead? Are you going to face this issue with courage, with resolution? I say lead, lead, step up to the challenge. Be the one that other people look to absorb that impact. Absorb that negativity. Draw fire, draw fire. That's, that's when a member of a platoon for for tactical reasons steps into the open to draw enemy fire. Maybe to give another part of his team the chance to move or, or distract the enemy. But that's what I say, draw fire, bring that pain to me. I can handle it when, when, maybe others cannot. And when, when bad things are happening, I am going to try and be the one good thing. The thing standing tall that can be relied upon because I know that that attitude will spread. It will bolster those around me and, and we will fight. And in fighting we will win. And if not the battle, and if not the war, we will win because our spirit, it will never surrender

Speaker 1:          03:57          in that that is the ultimate victory to hold your head high and even even in the face of inescapable defeat to stand and to fight, that is to win.
