00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.523
- [Voiceover] So let's say in
1950, let me write this down,

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:06.973
in 1950, there was a plot
of land that the city owns

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.233
and says, hey, you know what,
we could use some revenue,

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.430
or we would want someone to build a house.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.566
There's a housing shortage in this city.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.233
Let's sell it to someone who maybe

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:15.270
might build a house on it.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.900
So you have the city,
who is the original owner

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.200
of this particular plot of land,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.200
and they transfer title of
that plot of land to, let's say

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.766
it's a developer who's
going to be the first owner.

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:31.066
So, they transfer title of
that land to a developer.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.269
So, I'll just call them the
developer right over here,

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.533
and when they transfer
title, they record that

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:43.533
by filing a deed, so filing
a deed with the county.

00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:46.772
And you sometimes file it with the city,

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:48.117
sometimes with the county.

00:00:48.117 --> 00:00:50.628
So, this is at the county's
office right over here.

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:52.566
So, this is the county.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.700
We're going to assume that we

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.533
filed these things with the county.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.200
All right, fair enough.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.433
Let's say the developer lives
in that house for some time.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:01.466
Actually, maybe the developer

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.833
lives in that house for a while,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.500
and he and his wife, they
unfortunately pass away.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.417
And so it gets, in 1970--

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:16.333
So, let's say it's in
1970, they pass away.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.800
And so, in their--

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.166
And maybe they didn't even have a will,

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.800
and so it just gets transferred
to their closest relative.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.373
And let's say that the
developer had a brother-in-law

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:32.800
is the closest relative,
and so the property

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.166
gets transferred to the brother-in-law.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.000
So let me write this down, brother-in-law,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.533
brother-in-law of the developer.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.466
Brother-in-law of the
developer now has title,

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.479
and that will be reflected.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.361
That will be reflected in another deed.

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:54.800
So, let's call this deed one,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000
and this will be recorded in
the county recording office.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.312
This is deed two.

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:04.530
And then, let's fast forward now to 2000.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.033
The brother-in-law and his family

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:08.048
has lived there for a while.

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:13.048
And so, now it is the year 2000,

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.473
and they are looking to sell the house,

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:19.366
and there is a buyer who's
interested in that house.

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:24.366
So this is, we'll call this owner three,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.666
but before she buys the house,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.242
she prudently wants to do--

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:31.233
wants to make sure that
the title is clean,

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.700
that this brother-in-law
really does have title,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.933
that has ownership, not just
possession of the house,

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:40.100
that there aren't any liens on the house,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.173
some back taxes or some
contractor that did work

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:46.318
that claims it was never
paid, whatever it might be.

00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:50.733
So she, owner three, hires
a title search company

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.466
to do a title search, and they go to

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.390
the county recording
office, and say, okay, look,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.300
it was sold from the city
to the developer in 1950,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.700
and then the developer and his
family passed away in 1970,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.033
and so then it was transferred legally

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:03.984
to the brother-in-law.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.100
And so they say, hey, the title is clean.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.535
You can buy this house.

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:10.266
So owner three, she
decides to buy this house.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.533
She pays for it, however much money,

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:15.133
and then the title is transferred,

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:20.133
and the evidence of that
is deed number three.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.367
So you might say, okay,
this is all good and well.

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:27.166
This seems like a very
reasonable thing to do.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:31.266
She has nothing to worry
about, but what if,

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:34.476
what if right after owner
three pays all of this money

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:37.666
to the brother-in-law, let's say in 2001

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:40.733
someone shows up and says, hey, look,

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:44.767
I was the developer's long lost child.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:48.327
I had the rights to this,
not the brother-in-law.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.063
So, I lay claim.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.742
I lay claim to this house.

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:53.200
So, this right over here.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.163
So, someone says this should have been me.

00:03:56.163 --> 00:04:01.163
This should have been me.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.527
And so, therefore, they claim that

00:04:05.527 --> 00:04:08.753
this was not a valid transaction.

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.300
If this isn't a valid transaction,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.913
then this also is not a valid transaction,

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:15.500
and then they could take
this whole thing into court,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.833
which is not going to be a pleasant thing.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:21.900
It's not going to be a
pleasant thing for owner three.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.800
So, I know what you're thinking.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.766
How does an owner three protect themselves

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.486
from some random thing that
might happen like this,

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:31.571
especially because a house is

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.109
the most important transaction you make?

00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.392
If this happened, you get
bogged down in a big lawsuit,

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.604
and who knows what might happen.

00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:39.704
This could be a nightmare for owner three,

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:42.609
and that's why title insurance exists.

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.353
Title insurance.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.366
The whole purpose of title insurance is,

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:52.269
okay, you should do a title search.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.256
You should make sure
that the title is clean,

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:56.176
that there aren't any
liens or encumbrances,

00:04:56.176 --> 00:04:58.133
any claims to the property,

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.866
and that everything has been filed.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.300
You would also have a nonclean title

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.000
if somehow these people
didn't file this properly,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.835
if deed two is shady or didn't have

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:07.358
all of the proper language.

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:08.833
But even if you do all of that,

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.566
you're not 100 percent sure
that there might not be

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.266
some other weird or bizarre claims

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.033
or that something might
have been overlooked

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.500
in the title search.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.707
And so, to protect yourself,
you get title insurance,

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:23.866
and most lenders, because most of the time

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:25.866
when houses are bought,
the lender is putting up

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:27.346
the majority of the cash for it,

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.566
and in the case that the
borrower isn't able to pay it,

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:32.076
the lender takes possession of the house,

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:34.758
most lenders make you get title insurance,

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:37.627
so that they can be protected
for this exact scenario.

00:05:37.627 --> 00:05:39.135
Now you can imagine, let's say owner three

00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:40.771
took out a mortgage,
and then all of a sudden

00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:42.006
all this craziness happens.

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:43.520
It might be easier for
them to just walk away

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.966
from the mortgage, and then the bank

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:46.594
is left with all of this messiness.

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:49.280
So, the bank has a huge incentive
to have title insurance.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.900
And the whole point of title insurance

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.266
is to protect this owner or the person

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:56.600
who comes into ownership of the house,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.766
from any of this messiness
that might actually ensue.

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:02.900
So although a bank, whoever
is giving you the loan

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.100
for your house, might insist
that you have title insurance,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.933
it's probably a good
idea, even if you were

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:10.166
buying the house in cash,
even if no one was forcing you

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:11.900
to do it, just so that you make sure that

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.167
you're protected against
these type of things.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:16.800
And just to be clear,
it's not a hugely costly

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.933
type of insurance, because
these things are rare.

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:23.966
So these are rare events,
but you still want to

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:26.833
protect yourself against them happening.
