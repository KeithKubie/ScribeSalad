00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:14.140
&gt;&gt; A
question here from Rob from Loos, which is

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.610
think is in the UK,
asks, "You and others have talked about the

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.789
need to stop FGM within a
generation.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.720
Do you really think you can do it?"
Kathy?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.890
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a goal that the UN has set
that to eliminate by 2015

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460
which is the date for the millennium development
goals.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.829
I don't think there's any real we shouldn't
be trying for that.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.079
That's far enough away that we could really
do a concerted effort and

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.511
frankly, it's going to take a global campaign,
you know.

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:44.870
And we need a global campaign for girls.
This ought to be right front and center at

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.850
the beginning of it.
So I think it's doable.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.260
&gt;&gt; So there's a -- may be a parallel with
China, in that foot binding

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.460
existed for hundreds and hundreds of years.
And at various points -- I think in the Chen

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.710
Long Emperor or -- or --
it may have been before Chen Long.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.600
But that foot binding was actually punishable
by exile on the part of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.659
the parents -- had zero impact.
At various points, it was banned.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.259
No impact.
And then early in the 20th century, really

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.439
remarkable quickly, it
disappeared.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.560
And it went from a perception on the part
of parents that if they

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.869
didn't bind their daughter's feet, that it
would be hard for her to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.950
marry, to a perception that if they bound
her feet, it would be harder

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.939
for her to get married.
And, um, it, you know, I guess that --

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.999
&gt;&gt; One emperor changed the rule.
Changed the perception.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:44.450
&gt;&gt; It was a really a bottom-up social movement,
um, led by elites from

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.340
within the country, um, part of this sense
of awakening.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.829
And supported by outsiders to some degree
but -- but really led from

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.969
within, pushed from within.
So I guess the question is how we can replicate

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.249
that, and whether
groups like COSTAND are indeed -- whether

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.360
this is the next sort of foot
binding analogy, so that the change once it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.159
comes you've reached the
tipping point, it will happen very, very quickly.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.360
&gt;&gt; I just want to come back to that point
Kathy made of 2015.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.550
I wished I shared your optimism, Kathy.
I just feel that we're here talking about

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.070
solutions.
We seem to know what works.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.040
We know this model is there.
We know about the respect we have to give

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.060
to communities.
Um, and many, many local NGOs and civil society

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.980
organizations are
working on the ground, and you know to pay

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.310
tribute to all of those
small organizations really at danger as well.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.610
One of the women who's contacted me through
this campaign Lucy Maswa,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.620
who said, you know, go forth and speak at
Davos about this.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.879
And her story, once she started speaking out
within her community, she

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.420
was raped, she was beaten, she was tied to
a tree, she was jailed.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.569
She's luckily living now in the US.
But I think what we need to see is how we

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.290
can in the next five years,
if that is true, take this to scale -- I'm

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.920
using the language of Davos
there -- but really, you know, what is preventing

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.519
us if we know how to
make things change, why can't we put this

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.879
into place?
It is a funding issue?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.700
It is a global awareness issue?
What needs to happen?

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.450
What are the levers that we can pull?
If we were sitting here saying actually this

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.819
is to intractable; this is
too difficult.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.840
We're not going to address this issue.
Fair enough.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.469
But we're all sitting here in vehement agreement
that is a severe abuse

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.040
a child's right abuse, a women's right abuse.
We've got a solution.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.709
What can we do?

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.040
