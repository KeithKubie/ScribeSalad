00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.151
- [Voiceover] Use the
"Rotate" tool to find

00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:05.506
the image of pentagon CDEFG, that's this

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.491
irregular pentagon over here,

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:10.951
when rotated 270 degrees about the point

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.191
negative two comma three.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.316
The direction of rotation
by a positive angle

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:16.930
is counter-clockwise.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.755
So it's counter-clockwise.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.848
All right. Rotate tool, to rotate around

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:23.613
negative two comma three.

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:26.445
So let's click on "Rotate," and then

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.071
we want to go to the
point, they said rotate

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:29.893
around the point negative two comma three.

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:32.470
So I move this, to x equals negative two,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.072
y equals three.

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.105
That's what we want to rotate around,

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:38.251
and we want to rotate 270 degrees.

00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:39.691
So this is maybe the part that takes

00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:41.271
the most visualization.

00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.104
If we rotate 90 degrees, that would be

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:46.842
going from, if we think about this arrow,

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:48.213
actually, let me just do it.

00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:51.533
So, if I move this arrow up here,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.342
I have rotated 90 degrees,
positive 90 degrees,

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:55.887
we're moving counter-clockwise.

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:58.963
Now if I move it over
here, we have rotated

00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:02.945
180 degrees, and now I move it down here.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:07.669
I have now rotated it 270 degrees.

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:12.111
If they said 360, we would
get back to where we started.

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:17.111
So this is 270 degrees, just like that.

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.229
And, we're done.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.219
Let's check our answer,
if we got it right.
