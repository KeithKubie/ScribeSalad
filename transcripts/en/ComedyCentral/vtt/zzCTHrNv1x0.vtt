00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.669
It is time to play

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.472
Are You Ready
For Some Fuzzball?!

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:06.940
(cheering)

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.346
Now, even though
I don't understand sports,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.848
I still love the thrill of
victory and the agony of defeat,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.584
so I want to fuse the excitement
of competition with a subject

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:20.320
that even the most indoors-y
of indoor kids can enjoy:

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.055
cute animal gifts!

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.958
Uh, so, does that sound good
to you, excitable kittens?

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.960
-Oh, sure it does!
-(others aw'ing)

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.595
-Aw...
-TOMPKINS: They're trapped!

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.297
(laughter)

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.366
Comedians,
I'm gonna show you an animal

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.935
about to attempt something
amazing, and for 250 points,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.204
you have to call it
like it was a sporting event,

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.239
in your best
sideline reporter voice.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.608
First up,
this enthusiastic squirrel.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:42.743
And...

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.845
he's... oh, he's over the...

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.513
-KIRKMAN: Whoa!
-(laughter)

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:47.915
HARDWICK:
Paul.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.284
And he's cleared the...
yes, he's cleared the fence,

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.319
and oh, good news
for the neighbor's dog,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.720
finally getting his wish.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.222
(laughter, applause)

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.857
Points.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.196
-Jen. -Oh, I don't think
this was an accident.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.498
He's been so depressed
since Sheila left him.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.201
-(laughter)
-SKLAR: Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.203
-Very sports-like.
-So true. So true.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.038
Good squirrel name,
too-- Sheila.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.575
Can't take it anymore.
Sheila, why?

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:15.909
Is that Sheila next to him?

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.778
Would he do it
right in front of her?

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.746
-Oh, that... God.
-Yeah.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.715
Next up, this comfy cat.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.121
(bell dings)

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.556
Paul F. Tompkins.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.192
Well, looks like curiosity
didn't kill the cat,

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:35.929
but a spinal injury did.

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.165
Points.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:41.902
That's funny.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.572
Next up, this pup struggling
with a flip-flop.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.542
Aw, he's...

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.578
too stupid to get it in.

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.747
He's dumb. He's stupid.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.415
-What a (bleep) idiot.
-SKLAR: Yeah, right?

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.884
Paul.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.019
Well, he's having
just a little trouble

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.854
getting that flip-flop
through the door

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.358
after having successfully killed
and eaten Matthew McConaughy.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.731
Points.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:14.168
Next up, this sporty horsey.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.869
Oh.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:19.406
Yoga!

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.874
Oh. Randy.

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.844
And sadly, this is the final
nail in the coffin

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.146
of international horse pilates.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.619
Paul.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.621
And this is a very bold move

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.990
for an animal
with famously fragile legs.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.660
Namaste, you (bleep) idiot.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:43.530
Points.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.899
Just get a regular office chair.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.169
You're back'll be fine.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.104
I'll give you points
for that one.

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:53.841
And finally, this dumb duck.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.847
(babbling)

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:02.883
Paul.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.785
And, just inches
from the finish line and...

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:07.487
Oh! He tries to swim away
from the ground.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:11.358
Good thing...
good thing he's delicious.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.368
-It really is like
he goes to default. -Yes.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:21.468
Like, okay, what...
what do I know how to do?
