00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.780
Alright, so to make this work, we're going to need to build on this

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.715
idea of a joint distribution. It's not going to be obvious right away what

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.952
this has to do with machine learning, at all. But, I, it's going to

00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:12.567
connect. So, just bear with me for a little bit. Alright, so to talk

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:15.760
about this concept, what we're going to do is look at an example. And

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040
the example that I think might work, that would be nice and simple, is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.390
the notion of storm and lightning. So, here's a little picture of storm

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.670
and lightning. And what we're going to do is say, let's say, on a random

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.730
day, at 2 PM. You look outside. And, what I want you to do

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.435
is say, what fraction of the time,

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:34.650
is, is each of these different possible combination

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.240
of things happening? So, for example, what's

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.700
the probability that you look out and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.420
there's a storm and there's lightning at the same time? So, what do you think?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; On a random day?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, random day at 2 PM. And we

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.280
can be in Atlanta since that's what you're familiar with.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.590
&gt;&gt; Is it summer? Because that happens more often in the summer.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.733
&gt;&gt; Sure, let's say summer.

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:56.610
&gt;&gt; It's fairly high at 2 PM. Let's say it happens a quarter of the time.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.920
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's a rainy summer.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.920
&gt;&gt; Alright. Now, that's not the only possibility though. It

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.989
could also be that there's a storm but no lightning.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.190
&gt;&gt; Right. That happens more often at 2 PM

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.818
in the summer in Atlanta. Let's say it's mm, .4.

00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:14.610
&gt;&gt; Wow. Alright. Now what's the probability that you look

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.780
at the window and there's no storm but there is lightning.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.185
&gt;&gt; Maybe 5%.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.660
&gt;&gt; And what's the probability that you look out and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.420
there's, you know, it's nice clear there's no storm no lightning.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.760
&gt;&gt; Coincidentally I picked numbers that made it easier

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.195
for me to subtract from one. So, it's 0.3.

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right and so these, there's only, these are the only four

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.920
possibilities. We're saying. And they, so they have to add up to 100%. And

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.530
so I, yeah it had to be 30 at this point. So, it's

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530
actually more likely that there's a storm than not, according to what you said.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.202
&gt;&gt; It's Atlanta

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.280
in the summer at 2 PM.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.470
&gt;&gt; There you go. Alright. So, this is a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.900
joint distribution. And now we can actually ask various

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.850
kinds of questions about this. Oh, you know what

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.730
would be a good form for asking a question.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.670
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm looking at you quizzically.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.560
&gt;&gt; Nice. Using the fact that we are in

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.380
the same place. We are going to do a quiz.
