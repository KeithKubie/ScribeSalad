00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.100
Archimedes is
draining his bathtub.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.945
Every 2 minutes that pass, 7
gallons of water are drained.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.320
Which of the following functions
can represent the number

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.910
of gallons of water
in the tub, W,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.690
as a function of the
minutes that have passed, T?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.430
So let's think
about this visually.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.540
So let's plot the number of
gallons of water we have.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's put that in
the vertical axis.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.320
That is a function of time.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.210
As time passes, we will
lose water at a fixed rate.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.490
So this is our time
axis right over here.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.980
So we're going to start with
some initial volume of water

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.600
in the tub.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.099
And they actually
don't tell us what

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.670
our initial volume of water is.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.770
But let's just call
that capital W sub 0.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.424
So this is just the
initial volume of water.

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:48.840
We're doing
everything in gallons,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.500
so let's say the initial
number of gallons

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.860
or the number of gallons
at time equals 0.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.210
This is T equals
zero right over here.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.050
Then they tell us it every 2
minutes that pass-- so time

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.230
is going to be given in minutes.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:16.345
Time is in minutes, and the W is
in gallons-- 7 gallons of water

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:17.010
are drained.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.820
So let's say 2 minutes
pass from time equals 0.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.740
So this is 1 minute, and this
is 2 minutes right over here.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.459
So we have 2 minutes passing.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.250
And how much water is
going to get drained?

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.270
Well they tell 7 gallons
of water are drained.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.130
So after 2 minutes, we're
going to get to W0 minus 7.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830
However much water
we had before,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.010
we're going to have
7 gallons less.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.390
W0 minus 7 is where we go.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.590
And so if we were to plot
the amount of gallons

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.270
or the number of gallons we
have as a function of time,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.810
it would look
something like this.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.114
It would look like a line
that goes something like that.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:01.780
So one thing that we
could ask ourselves

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.110
is, what is the rate of
change of W with respect to T?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.690
What is the rate of change of
our vertical axis with respect

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.800
to our horizontal axis?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.970
And that's also known as
the slope of our line.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.580
So we could write that
as the rate of change--

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.510
this Delta symbol, this
Greek letter, this triangle,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.830
is just shorthand for change
in-- so our change in W

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.530
for a given change
in time, well we

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.120
know that when time increases
by 2 minutes-- and time

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.540
is in minutes-- W
decreases by 7 gallons.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.884
Because it decreases,
it's going down.

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:43.550
And we see that.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.810
This is a downward sloping
line right over here.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900
And we see it graphically
right over here.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.300
When our change in time
is equal to positive 2,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.790
our change in volume-- so
this is this distance, which

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.670
is the same thing as this
distance right over here--

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.200
our change in the number of
gallons is equal to negative 7.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.430
So this right over here
is the slope of our line

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.850
or the rate of change
of the number of gallons

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.900
with respect to time.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.470
Now, we don't know the
exact starting position

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.870
or the exact W intercept.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.640
But we just called it W sub 0.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.970
So we could write a
general equation here.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.750
We could say that
the number of gallons

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.830
is equal to the
initial gallons that we

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.710
have plus negative
7/2 times time.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.230
Or we could just
call this minus 7/2--

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.890
that's just the negative 7/2
right over there-- times time.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.560
And this should make
complete sense now.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.990
We have our vertical
axis intercept, often

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.050
called the y-intercept.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.620
But this isn't called
the y-axis anymore.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.710
We have our vertical intercept.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.550
And we also have the
slope of our line here.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.590
If you're familiar with
slope-intercept form,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.760
we'd normally write y is
equal to mx plus b, where this

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.241
is the slope and this
is the y-intercept.

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.740
We've written it
the exact same way.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.980
We've said W is equal to
negative 7/2 T plus W0.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.980
I just swapped these
two things around.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.780
And notice, this is the slope,
and this is the y-intercept.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.610
So which of these
match that pattern?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.271
Well let's see, I should start
with some positive number

00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:36.770
of gallons.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.980
And I'm subtracting
7/2 T. So the only one

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.430
that matches this is
this one right over here,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.159
is 50 minus 7/2 T. Now even
if you didn't think anything

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.700
about slopes and you were just
looking at these choices here,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.116
you would say,
well look, I should

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:53.240
start with a certain
number of gallons of water,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.110
and then it should
only decreases

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.020
as the amount of time passes.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.440
This one wouldn't satisfy this.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.246
At time equals 0, I
have no gallons here.

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:01.870
That doesn't meet
the constraints here.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.286
I have a certain
number of gallons

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.620
here, so this
doesn't make sense.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.530
Here at time equals
0, I have 100 gallons.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.460
But then as time passes,
that will only increase.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.332
So this is the faucet's on here.

00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:14.290
It's not being drained.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.920
So that doesn't work.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.850
Here, once again, I'm
starting with a certain number

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.030
of gallons when time equals 0.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.905
And then as time
passes, it's increasing

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:23.780
my number of gallons.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.906
So once again, the faucet
is on right over here.

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:27.280
So once again,
the only one where

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.154
I'm starting with a
certain number of gallons

00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:31.500
and then as time passes
my number of gallons

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.910
are reducing-- because
this is a negative value--

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.820
is this choice right over here.
