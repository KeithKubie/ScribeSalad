00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.980
Starting with the figure
shown, perform the following

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.190
transformations--
reflection over the line y

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.010
equals x minus 2, translation
by 3 in the x direction.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.130
So we're going to
shift to the right by 3

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.690
and then shift down by 9.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.802
Is a transformed
figure congruent

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:18.760
to the original figure?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.960
And actually, we could
answer this question

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.830
before we even do
the transformation,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.710
because this transformation
only involves

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.770
reflections and translations.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.510
As long as we're only
reflecting, translating,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.310
and rotating, we're going to
get to a congruent figure.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.050
The thing that will make it
not necessarily congruent

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.820
is when we dilate it.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.496
So dilating it is going to
actually scale it up or down.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:39.870
The figure will
still be similar,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930
but it won't necessarily
be congruent anymore.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.300
So I could already say yes,
the figures are congruent.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.380
But let's actually
perform the transformation

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.810
that they want us to.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.110
So a reflection over the
line y equals x minus 2.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.770
And so let's click on translate,
and this isn't popping up--

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.510
this isn't allowing us
just to do it by hand,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.659
or do it with our mouse.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.200
They want us to think about how
much-- actually we don't want

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.280
to translate first, we
want to reflect first.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.390
So once again, the reflection
line tool doesn't show up.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.120
Instead, for this
exercise, they want

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.700
us to specify two
points on the line

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.600
that we want to reflect around--
because two points define

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.100
a line.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.160
So what are two points that are
on the line y equals x minus 2?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.020
Well when x is equal
to 0, y is negative 2.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.270
And then another
point on it that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.930
might jump out at you--
when x is 2, y is 0.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.060
So we just need any two
different points on that line.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330
And then notice,
y equals x minus 2

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.740
is a line that looks like this.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.340
I'm just going to
kind of trace it.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370
I don't have my drawing
tool out right now,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.600
so it's a line that looks
something like that.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.290
Actually, let me do
it, just because I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.180
think it'll be
interesting to look at.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.300
Let me copy and paste
this right over here.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.280
And then let me put it
onto my actual scratch pad.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.520
So that's from a
previous problem.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.900
So let me clear all
of this business out.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.850
So let me paste it
right over here.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.550
And notice, we just
reflected around the line y

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.870
equals x minus 2.
y equals x minus 2.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.450
Let's see, it has its
y-intercept right over there,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.040
it has a slope of 1.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.990
So this is the line that
we just reflected around.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.790
And it looks pretty clear
that that is what happened.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.400
So just like that, I know
my line isn't as straight

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.980
as it could be, but you
get the general idea.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.260
That is the line y is
equal to x minus 2.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.634
Notice each of these points--
you drop a perpendicular

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.050
from that point,
whatever distance

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.260
that is, go the same
distance on the other side,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.970
and we have reflected over.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.630
Drop a perpendicular, same
distance on the other side.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.240
And so that is our
reflection about the line y

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.310
equals x minus 2.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.110
But we are not done yet.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.225
We now have to perform the
translation by 3, negative 9.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.210
So we're going to translate.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.810
So when we do it
by 3, it's going

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.560
to shift this to the right by 3.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.600
And then negative 9, which is
going to shift it down by 9.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.704
And we see that it did.

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:40.870
And we already said, these
are definitely congruent.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.800
We haven't scaled
this up or down,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.579
we've just translated it,
rotated it-- actually,

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.620
we didn't even rotate it.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.740
We've just translated it, and
reflected-- or reflected it,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.840
and translated it.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.360
But let's check our answer, just
to feel good about ourselves.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.370
And we got it right.
