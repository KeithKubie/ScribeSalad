00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.770
The starting block
below is 2 units long.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.500
Use the tools to the right
to convert the starting block

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.290
into both of the
goal blocks, that

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.680
are 5/8 units long, and
1 and 3/4 units long.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.754
You can see your progress
as the current block.

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:16.170
So what are they
telling us to do?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.460
So this is the starting
block, right over here.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.380
They're telling us
this is 2 units long.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.690
So a unit must be about
this long, right here.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.810
About half of this
starting block.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.560
And we have these
tools on the right.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.800
And my first goal block,
right over here in blue,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230
they say that that's 5/8.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.610
And that makes sense, because
if this is about a whole,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.170
then that looks like about 5/8.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.130
This right over here
would be about 8/8.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.590
So this looks about 5/8.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.590
And then they tell us
that this other one that's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.450
below my screen right
over here is 1 and 3/4.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.990
So they tell us that this
is 1 and 3/4 units long.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.354
1 and 3/4 is also the
same thing as 7/4.

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:50.520
So I somehow need to-- let's
see, what are my tools?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840
What are the tools
available to me?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.240
Well I can cut my starting
block into a certain number

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.170
of pieces.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.200
And then I'm going to copy
that starting block over here

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.830
for block 1, and
I'm going to try

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.379
to match it to this goal block.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410
And then I'm also going
to copy it for block 2,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.720
to match that second goal block.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.470
So I'm going to try to
get something that's 5/8,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.140
and I'm also going to try to
get something that's 1 and 3/4.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.037
Now 3/4 is the
same thing as 6/8.

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:20.120
And the reason why I care
about eighths is eighths

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.190
is a smaller unit.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.540
So if I can convert the
starting block into eighths,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.130
then I can copy it enough
times to get exactly

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.120
to 5/8, and exactly
to 1 and 3/4,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.660
which is the same thing as-- 3/4
is the exact same thing as 6/8.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.430
So let's get our starting
block into eighths.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.300
So if we're starting
with 2 wholes,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.040
if we're starting with 2 units
long-- So if I cut it once,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.050
now this is a whole unit.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.140
Now if I cut a whole,
now if I cut it twice,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.200
so now if I cut 4 times, so
I've cut my original block

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.160
into 4 times.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.610
So now this right over
here is half a unit.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.705
And actually, if I want
to convert it into eighths

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.240
I need to cut it 16 times.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.150
So let me do that.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.470
15, 16.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.820
So I cut 2 units
into 16 equal pieces.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.485
Or I guess this is 1/16 of 2, so
that is going to be an eighth.

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:17.985
And now I just have
to multiply this

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:19.318
the appropriate number of times.

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:20.850
This right over here is 5/8.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.090
This is 1/8.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.910
So let me copy
this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.600
So that is 5/8.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.250
And then here, I
need to do 1 and 3/4.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.350
Remember, 1 and 3/4 is
the same thing as 7/4.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.190
It's 4/4 plus 3/4, which is 7/4.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.300
7/4 is the same thing as 14/8.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.960
So this right over
here is 1/8, I just

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.370
need to make 14 of these.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.372
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.080
Actually, let me show
you what I'm doing.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.104
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:52.770
And there we go.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.070
That's exactly the same
length as goal block 2.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.910
This is 14/8.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.930
14/8 is the exact
same length as this.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.970
14/8 is the same
thing as 7/4, which

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.150
is the same thing as 1 and 3/4.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.370
This is 5/8, which is
the same thing as 5/8.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.680
So let's check our answer.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.665
And we got it right.
