00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.560
So in one of the last episodes, I introduced you to a legend with a longbow.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.220
He's from my hometown and his name is Byron Ferguson.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.620
He shot an aspirin out of the air in slow-motion.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.140
But there's something that happened in the arrow I didn't understand.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.360
It was deflecting and it has something to do with what's called the "archer's paradox".

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.580
What do you think, Byron?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.140
- "The archer's paradox is the demon for all archers,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
but there are ways to work around it."

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.500
Not bad!

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.060
Alright, so today on Smarter Every Day,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.680
we're gonna understand how an arrow deflects

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700
and what's called the "archer's paradox".

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.900
A paradox is a situation involving two things with a contradictory nature.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So what is the archer's paradox?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.460
What are the two things an archer has to deconflict?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
My friend John explained it to me like this.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
Let's pretend that this pecan tree is the bow

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.220
and this is the line of our bowstring.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.380
If we take an arrow and we put it into our bow and we draw the bow back,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780
and we're trying to hit that target over there,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.960
watch what happens.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
As we release the bowstring and it travels closer to the bow

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.480
- look at that -,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.460
the fact that the bow is sitting here in our way between us and the target,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.640
causes the arrow to point off in a different direction.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.960
So how can we possibly hit that target, when our arrow is pointed over there?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.720
This is the archer's paradox, because we know they actually do hit targets like that.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.560
Toy designers are cheaters: they don't deal with the paradox, they just get around it.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.920
For example, the guy who designed this suction cup bow,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.520
he doesn't go around the handle,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.940
straight through the middle.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.700
Check that out!

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.900
Whoever designed this crossbow, instead of being in line with the bow itself,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.920
the string is offset by this big rail.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.300
That way, the string is always pushing along the dart.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
So how does a longbow shooter get around this problem?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.140
Here's how: they don't have a completely rigid arrow like that,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
they have a bendable arrow like this.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020
See when it vibrates? You can see these nodal points?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.260
That's important.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.680
Check this out. As we put this real arrow into the bow here and we shoot,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.000
as we go towards the bow, the fact that we're accelerating this arrow

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.720
causes it to build strain energy, causing this big curvature.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.260
That curvature then snaps back in the other direction once it bends to a certain point

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.500
and look what we have.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.720
We have the arrow bending around the bow.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
When we release, it does something cool.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.980
It snakes around the bow, just like this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.460
and you're able to fly all the way to the target.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.520
So the archer's paradox is the fact that you have a bow in between you and the target

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.880
and you're still able to get around the bow.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.340
"The first that happens, is the arrow bends from the pressure of the string

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.340
and the front arrow being against the riser of the bow.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
As it leaves the bow, or has already cleared the bow,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740
it bends in the opposite direction.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.420
When those two cross, determines where the arrow will fly.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.360
One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points are crossed, are pointed.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.280
Whereas if this one had been here, then the arrow's gonna fly to the left.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
If it was here, the arrow flies off to the right.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.160
We want those two lined up to go straight to the target."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.720
- "Gotcha. So the fact that it bends, helps it get around the arrow rest

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.520
without going off in an angle, as if it were a straight line."

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.040
- "Correct."

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.220
- "You're pushing the string straight towards the handle, but somehow it makes it around the handle."

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.200
- "Right."

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.380
- "Yeah, and the bends is how it does that?"

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.060
- "That's correct."

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
Alright, my buddy Sander actually shoots with a compound bow.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.440
You don't do any of that longbow stuff, right?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440
- "I have one, but I'm not really good at it."

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.320
- "Alright, so what's the deal here?"

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.460
- "So a compound, there's a whole lot more going on on a compound.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.460
There are more things that can go wrong, too,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.460
but there are several advantages if they're working."

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.980
- "Yeah."

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
- "So a compound, you see that's it cut out in the middle, you get this -"

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
- "Oh, so the riser's not stout, is that what you're saying?"

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.640
- "Yes, so the arrow is travelling straight, it doesn't have to go around a riser."

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.140
- "Okay."

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860
- "And many people shoot also a drop-away rest, so it's gonna drop down.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.200
Whenever you pull the  bow back. a string attached to one of the bowstrings, pulls the rest up -"

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.720
- "Nice!"

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.020
"- centers your arrow, if you have it lined all up and square,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.720
your arrow is nice and level and then when you shoot, that arrow would dr- the rest would drop away -"

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820
- "Well, shoot it, shoot it. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let me zoom in."

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.860
"Hold on, so I'm looking at that rest, it's gonna fall away, right?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.640
- "Real fast!"

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.220
- "Okay I'm ready.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.320
Dude, that is super fast.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.720
So is the arrow touching the rest as it goes through?"

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.980
- "A little bit." - "Really?"

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.500
- "'Cause it drops but it's not, I mean, immediate, it's down before the arrow passes it."

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.200
- "So the goal here is, you don't have to bend around the riser,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200
but I bet the arrow still bends, though?"

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.900
- "It does bend and that's actually important in the straightness of the arrow flight."

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.980
Isn't that interesting?But something else is going on here.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.600
Byron Ferguson is able to predict the wobbling of that arrow so good,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.440
that he's able to hit an aspirin tablet with a vibrating arrow, just like that.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.500
So one of two things is going on. Either a) he knows some science that we don't;

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.540
or b) he's a warlock and this is all black magic.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.720
- "Okay, the stiffness of an arrow is called the spine, right?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120
And so the spine is what, Byron?"

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.620
- "The stiffness of the arrow."

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.840
- "Oh, right!

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.140
So this is your spine tester?"

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.860
- "This is the spine tester, set up right now to test the flexion of a carbon arrow."

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.640
- "Okay."

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.060
- "So we actually have a two pound weight and the arrow's suspended at 26 inches. That's for carbon."

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.780
- "Okay."

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840
- "And we read the inside of the scale here, to see how much it deflects."

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.220
- "So you, you test all of your arrows before you shoot, so that you can normalize the paradox?"

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.940
- "Correct, I want all the arrows to have the same stiffness."

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.360
- "And that's how you're able to hit things like an aspirin?"

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.780
- "That's part of it, yes."

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.480
-"There's a little bit of skill.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.660
If it's out of tolerance, you just don't even put it in your quiver?"

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.240
- "That's what those are."

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.060
- "Really? Really? You've just a got a box of stuff that you don't shoot?"

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.920
- "Yeah, they're too far out of tolerance."

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.420
- "Really? That's amazing. So, people were asking in the last video - that arrow was deflecting so much -,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.840
they're saying "How do you time that?" and the way you time that, is you know the exact spine of the arrow."

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.340
- "Correct."

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.280
- "That's awesome. This is pretty good information.So this isn't black magic, this is science?"

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.820
- "Correct."

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.320
- "That's awesome."

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.500
Byron is using science to normalize the wobble of his arrows.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.740
But less it been, there's a little bit of wizardry here, right?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.840
Because of the certain distance from his bow,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.720
he still has to know which side of the arrow that wobble's gonna be on.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.740
And then he has to line that up with an aspirin tablet.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.480
So this is a pretty good shot.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.620
In order to fully appreciate this trick shot, I'm gonna do a trick shot of my own, using the Phantom Miro.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.300
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it was sponsored by Harrys.com.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.240
Harry's makes subscription razors, that are really high-quality.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.160
They end up being about the same price the old razors I used to use

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.440
So, I have no need for my old razors, so Byron's gonna help me get rid of it.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.460
If you're interested in getting a Harry's razor - I actually shaved with one today -,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.600

- "What are you gonna try?"

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.100
- "I'm gonna try to hit it down in here, around the neck part."

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.260
- "Get it of it that way?"

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.100
- "Cut its head off."

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.600
- "Excellent.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.640
Alright, I'm gonna film this with the Phantom v711. I hope you hit it, this would be awesome!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.780
You did it!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.780

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.620
That's the first shot, Byron!"

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.060
- "Luckily!"

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.820

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.200
- "You make your own arrowheads, right?"

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.460
- "Uh no, I designed the head, it's actually made in Austria.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.620
This is what called a destructive test."

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.620
- "Holy cow, it didn't break, man! It didn't break! It didn't break!

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.600
- "Did you think it would do that?" - "I was hoping for it."
