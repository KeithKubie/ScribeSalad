MANISH BHARGAVA: Android
apps today present

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.990
a massive opportunity
for developers.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.580
And with the mobile market
emerging as a global force,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.280
to really make an impact you
have to think and act globally.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Worldwide, 1 billion Android
devices have been activated.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.220
With more than 1 million apps in
Play Store, and 50 billion apps

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.530
downloaded in over
190 countries,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.950
this is huge opportunity.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.230
My name is Manish.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.310
I'm from Google
Internationalization Team,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.990
and I want to show you
how to crack the code

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.890
to engage with the
next 5 billion users.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's look at where these
users are coming from.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.180
If you're developing
for and targeting

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.920
to only one region,
or a country,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.050
you're only getting
a piece of the pie.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.070
In particular,
with North America,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.190
you're only getting 11%
of the internet users.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.800
Similarly, supporting only
one language in your app

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.540
gives you a fraction
of the users.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.660
For example,
supporting only English

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.450
gives you 1/4 of the chunk.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.620
You are missing out on
75% of potential users.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.410
Now let's look at where these
future users are coming from.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.230
Let's focus on year over
year growth numbers.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.330
We observe double-digit
growth for emerging markets.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.890
26% in India.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980
58% for Indonesia.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.150
Compare that to 3%
in the United States.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.870
Now let's look at the
population penetration numbers.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.350
India at 11%.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.500
Indonesia at 23%.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.590
US at 78%.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.850
So the growth numbers for
emerging markets are strong.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.810
But what is even more striking
is that the room to grow

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.880
is huge.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.050
Now let's look at the
revenue opportunity.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.440
In Q1 of this year,
Japan overtook the US

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.370
as the top country by revenue.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.690
South Korea is a close third.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.210
From revenue growth
perspective, US is not even

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.550
in the top five
fastest-growing markets.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.330
South Korea is growing nearly
nine times faster than US.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.250
Japan, with three
times the growth of US,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.600
is set to continue its lead
as a top country for revenue.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.580
Availability of apps in
190 countries is great.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.370
But which market
should I enter first?

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.730
What are the key
considerations for you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.840
as you make those decisions?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.160
I'll give you three
key considerations,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.940
which will make your
decision easier.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.360
Different markets behave
differently, with respect

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.520
to their app
consumption behavior.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.400
Certain markets are mobile
pioneers-- countries

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.980
that are early adopters
of mobile technology.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.130
Notice on the far right
are many large countries,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.680
like Brazil, Russia,
and India, as well as

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.850
some smaller but
influential countries,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.150
like Switzerland and Israel.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.070
Besides sharing
similarities in app usage,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.390
these countries
tend to lag behind

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.610
in adopting mobile technologies.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.140
Another totally
different consideration

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.160
is effort required to
support a group of languages.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.310
You can support Latin
script languages easily,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.360
by doing additional
testing after translation.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.330
CJK-- Chinese, Japanese,
Korean languages--

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.010
need attention to font size,
input, and vertical display.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.920
Bi-direction languages,
like Arabic and Hebrew,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.750
are the most challenging.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.300
In these languages, the
text goes right to left;

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.330
numbers go left to right.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.340
Special attention is
needed for user interfaces

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.960
in these languages.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.740
Third and most
important consideration

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.880
is your own app key metrics.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.470
Google Play stats
come in handy here.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.580
Look out for the country
and the language dimensions.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.510
These show you where your
users are coming from,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.550
and which languages
are they using.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.070
This is a strong indicator
of the demand for your app,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.978
and will help you decide
where to localize your app.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.360
Keep your eye on the
localization tips section

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.380
in the optimization
tips section.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.260
Here, Google does
the work for you,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.425
and suggests the
market to target,

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:23.240
and languages to localize into.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.070
After looking at
the concentrations,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.100
you have decided on
the markets to enter.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.450
Next, I'll give you a
simple, two-step process

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.680
for global success.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.620
First and foremost, localize
your Play Store listing.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.740
Make sure to localize your
app name, your screenshots

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.010
and videos, and your
app description.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.430
This will help you go a long way
in your app's global success.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.950
It helps you get higher ranking
and helps you maintain it,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.640
as it reduces the
number of uninstalls.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.140
Finally, this maximizes
your search potential.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.420
This is critical,
as search accounts

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.260
for 2/3 of all the installs.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.020
And 50% of the users
search for apps weekly.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.090
Next step is to localize the
experience within your app.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.370
Localization means more
than just translation.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.130
Bring in the cultural aspects of
the country you are targeting.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.390
Your ultimate aim is to make
the users feel that the app has

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.380
been created for them,
rather than shipped to them

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.390
with some cosmetic changes.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.680
For example, here are the
Hindi and the English versions

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.800
of the Zombie Ragdoll app.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.110
Notice that in addition to
translation of the text,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.400
the developer has changed the
rocket propeller to a cricket

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.130
ball, changed the
dress of the character

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.160
to match the traditional
dress of Indian audience.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.020
When I, as a Hindi-speaking
user from India,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.460
see this in-app experience,
I am more engaged,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.035
as I feel this app has
been created for me.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.620
We just looked at
the steps needed.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.870
Now I will walk you
through how Google

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.100
can help you achieve
this global reach.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.790
In Google I/O 2013 keynote,
we announced the availability

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.320
of App Translation Service.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.310
You can now simply go to Play
Dev console, click on the APK

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.820
section to find the service.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.640
With one button click,
the translation service

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.290
is available to you.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.540
You can now follow three simple
key steps for app localization.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.060
These are-- upload your strings
file, select the languages,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.270
choose the vendor
from the marketplace.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.540
With this, you get high-quality,
human translation of your APK,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.280
and you can make it live
right from the Dev console.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.040
The service was made
available to all developers

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.780
in November 2013.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.110
In the last six
months, we have seen

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.320
200 million installs of the
apps localized by the service.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.590
Using this service makes the
process easier, cost-effective,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.840
and the turnaround time
reduces significantly,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.860
from weeks to days.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.570
For Indian Rummy app, one of the
early adopters of the service.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.330
Besides translation,
internationalization

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.210
is an integral part
of going global.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.420
Check out our related
Google I/O doc

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.830
on how to get your
app ready to play.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.320
If you have not embarked on
your journey of going global,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.080
now is the perfect
time to do it.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.030
Google is here to assist you.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.865
Go global with Google.
