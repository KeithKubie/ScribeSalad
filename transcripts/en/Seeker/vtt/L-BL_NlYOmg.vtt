00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.899
In science, it’s important to have quantifiable
data.

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:04.170
How bright is that star?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.650
How strong is that force?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.600
How smelly is that fart?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.430
Hey everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.320
I know it seems like a juvenile topic but
flatulence is a part of everyone’s lives,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.410
and it actually can tell you some interesting
things about yourself.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.110
So today, with as much maturity and aplomb
as I can muster, I’m gonna talk about booty

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.110
toots.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.820
First of all it may surprise you to learn
that gut gas contains information about your

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.820
health.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
For example: if you have lactose intolerance
it’s because your body no longer produces

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.559
an enzyme that breaks down the sugars in milk.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
Your gut bacteria on the other hand love that
stuff, and will munch it up, leaving you uncomfortable

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180
and passing the wind of Satan.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.700
Or in rare cases those bacteria that are supposed
to be in your large intestine gets in your

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
small intestine and thrive, eating nutrients
that are supposed to go to you and making

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.829
you gassy and bloated in the process.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.710
A bleeding ulcer will cause foul smelling
stool and flatus.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.240
And an excess of hydrogen sulfide, the molecule
responsible for that rotten egg smell, may

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.310
be a sign of a damaged gut lining, inflammatory
bowel disease, or even in severe cases, colon

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.310
cancer.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.729
So, if you have really rank stank, it can’t
hurt to see your doctor.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.649
But even if you’re healthy, you probably
don’t fart daisies and rainbows, and that’s

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.179
because of that gut bacteria.

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.109
They munch on the undigested nutrients on
the way to your colon, but the odorous molecules

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.849
in their waste gas make up less than 1 percent
of a fart.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.929
When you smell a fart, you're basically like
a shark detecting tiny amounts of blood in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.889
water, except with farts.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.240
Thanks, nature!

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.849
Many of the stench offenders are sulfur-based
and a prime source of sulfur in a diet is

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:34.959
from meat products.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.749
There’s also skatole, which mammals produce
from tryptophan and it smells like… skat.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.479
Though weirdly it’s also made by some flowers.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.139
So roses don’t really smell like poo poo,
but some lilies do.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.380
Vegetarians, that doesn’t mean your farts
don’t stink; sulfur is also found in broccoli,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.020
cauliflower, brussel sprouts, cabbage, almonds
and dried fruit.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.450
And while a vegetarian’s careless whispers
may be less odorous, they will likely be more

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.139
frequent due to a high-fiber diet that makes
gut bacteria thrive.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.959
What isn’t made by bacteria is surprisingly
similar to air, which makes sense considering

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.709
you swallow air when you eat.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.739
Typically farts are 59 percent nitrogen, 21
percent hydrogen, 9 percent carbon dioxide,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.379
7 percent methane and 4 percent oxygen.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.579
None of that actually smells; people tend
to think methane is the culprit because natural

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.069
gas leaks have a distinct smell…

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.640
Natural gas leaks in your home, I mean, that
one wasn’t a fart euphemism.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.209
But methane is odorless, commercial natural
gas has an artificial smell added so you know

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.040
when not to light a match.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.540
So if farts can actually tell you all this
useful stuff about your health, how do we

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.599
capture one and measure its composition?

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.650
According to Peter Gibson at Monash University
in Victoria, Australia, we can either measure

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.780
what your farts are made of by fermenting
poop, or capturing breath.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.549
Because the gases in your gut get reabsorbed
into your blood and can wind up in your mouth.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.700
That’s right, you all have fart breath.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.569
On a less serious note, in 2009 Cornell University
seniors Robert Clain and Miguel Salas designed

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.670
a machine that was an unholy combination of
a thermometer, microphone, and hydrogen sulfide

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.670
detector.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.109
When someone… *ahem* “tests” the device,
it combines information from the three sensors

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.200
to rate the sample on a scale of 0 to 9, 9
being what I can only presume is a perfect

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
fart.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.689
It’s totally normal to pass gas, yet many
people are self conscious and hold it in.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.220
But can that KILL YOU?

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.660
Nah, it can harm you in other ways though!

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.709
Tara has more here.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.389
So, do you fart?

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.560
Keep in mind that if you say no, you are a
dirty dirty liar, pants on fire, and that

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:48.900
is dangerous because the methane and hydrogen
in your farts is flammable.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.769
