00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
Part B. For x is not
equal to 0, express

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.900
f prime of x as a
piecewise-defined function.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.110
Find the value of x
for which f prime of x

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.705
is equal to negative 3.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:12.580
So the first thing you
might be wondering is,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.290
why did we even have to
take out x is equal to 0,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.100
or why is the derivative not
going to be defined there?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.770
And that's just
because you're going

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.311
to see that the derivative is
going to be something different

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:25.410
when we approach x is equal to
0 from the left, versus when we

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.160
approach x is equal
to 0 from the right.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.980
And that's why they just
took it out of there for us.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.021
But let's just figure out
what that derivative is

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:32.870
for all of the
other values of x.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.480
So f prime of x is equal
to, so for x is less than 0,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.610
we're going to take the
derivative of this first case.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910
So the derivative
of 1 is just 0.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.870
The derivative of
negative 2 sine of x.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.130
Well, the derivative of sine
of x is just cosine of x.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.460
So it's going to be
negative 2 cosine of x for x

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.620
is less than 0.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.862
And then for x is
greater than 0--

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:01.320
I'll do this in
another color, I'll

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.910
do it in orange-- we have
this case right over here.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.220
And we'll just do the
chain rule, derivative

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.230
of negative 4x with
respect to x is negative 4.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.080
And derivative of e to the
negative 4x with respect

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.327
to negative 4x is just
e to the negative 4x.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:27.160
Sometimes you could say
this is a derivative

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.340
of the inside times the
derivative of the outside,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.400
with respect to the inside.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.728
So either way, it's negative
4 e to the negative 4x

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:39.990
for x is greater than 0.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.060
So we did the first
part, we expressed f

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.910
prime of x as a
piecewise-defined function.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.410
We didn't define the derivative.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.600
I actually forgot
a parenthesis here.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.190
We didn't define the derivative
when x is equal to 0,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.870
because it's actually not
going to be defined there.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.470
Now let's do the second part.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.110
Find the value of x
for which f prime of x

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.370
is equal to negative 3.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.860
And so if this wasn't
piecewise-defined,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.960
you'd very simply
just say, look,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.079
f prime of x is
equal to negative 3.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.120
You would take whatever
f prime of x is equal to,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.340
and you'd do some
algebra to solve for it.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.460
But here you're like,
which case do I use?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
I don't know if the x
that gets us to negative 3

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.980
is going to be less
than 0, or I don't

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.646
know if it's going
to be greater than 0.

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.390
So I don't know
which case to use.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.130
And one thing that
we realize is to look

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.520
at these functions a
little bit and realize

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840
that cosine of x is
a bounded function.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.690
Cosine of x can only go between
positive 1 and negative 1.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.690
So negative 2
cosine of x can only

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.720
go between positive
2 and negative 2.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.079
So it can never
get to negative 3.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.120
So if anything's ever
going to get to negative 3,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.710
it's going to have to be
this part of the derivative,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.700
or this part of the
derivative definition.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.186
So it's going to have to be
this thing right over here.

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:55.560
And hopefully
there's some values

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.640
of x greater than 0 where
this thing right over here

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680
is equal to negative 3.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.410
So let's try it out.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.870
Negative 4 e to the
negative 4x needs

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.770
to be equal to negative 3.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.090
We can divide both
sides by negative 4.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.720
We get e to the negative
4x is equal to negative 3/4

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.730
divided by negative 4 is 3/4.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.260
We could take the natural
log of both sides,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.770
and we will get negative 4x
is equal to the natural log

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.635
of 3/4.

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:31.220
And just to be clear, what
I did here, you literally

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.646
could put the natural log
here, natural log there,

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:36.270
and you could put
the natural log there

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.720
as well to see that step.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.660
This is saying, what power do
I have to raise e to, to get e

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.679
to the negative 4x?

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.220
Well, obviously, I
just need to raise

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.110
e to the negative
4x power there.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.899
So this power is negative 4x.

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.440
And then we just
took the natural log

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.570
of the right-hand side as well.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.880
And then to solve for x,
we can divide both sides

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.060
by negative 4.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.950
So you get x is equal to-- or
we could multiply both sides

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.200
by negative 1/4, either way--
negative 1/4 natural log

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.420
of 3/4.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.650
And what we need to do
is verify that this x.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.110
So we used this case right over
here, but we have to make sure

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.130
that we can use this case,
that this x is greater than 0.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.680
And we might be
tempted right when

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.040
we look at this to
say, wait, this looks

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.000
like a negative number.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.380
But we have to remind ourselves
that the natural log of 3/4,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.375
since 3/4 is less than
e, the natural log of 3/4

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:34.750
is going to be a
negative number.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.540
It's going to be e to
some negative exponent.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.500
So since this is negative
and this part right over here

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.250
is negative, you have a
negative times a negative,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.350
so this right over here
is going to be positive.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.930
So this is a positive
value right over here.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.660
So you would use this
case right over here.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.340
So that's our answer-- x
is equal to negative 1/4

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.500
natural log of 3/4.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.680
Or the derivative, we could
write f prime of negative 1/4

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.180
times the natural log of
3/4 is equal to negative 3.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.140
And we're done.
