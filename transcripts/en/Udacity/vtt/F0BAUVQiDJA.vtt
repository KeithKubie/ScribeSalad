00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.060
You did awesome.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Is that your American accent?

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.112
&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.960
All right, anyway, in this course,
you learned that your options for

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.670
images go well beyond
a simple image tag.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.350
In fact, you can use the browser's
properties to not only change the source

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.280
of the image to ease, you know,
bandwidth requirements, but

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.390
you can also change the content of
the image using the picture element.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.990
&gt;&gt; And you learn that images
aren't always necessary.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.540
There are markup alternatives
like icon fonts and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.710
CSS styles that give you low
bandwidth options for images.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.380
&gt;&gt; But most importantly,
you learned that images

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.800
are an integral part of your
development workflow for modern sites.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.500
Images constitute an enormous percentage
of page load, and screen sizes and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.790
form factors vary so widely.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.630
Responsive design requires preparing
your images for any device.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.486
&gt;&gt; Now, you can develop images for
all of these devices.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.522
&gt;&gt; Beauty.

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.460
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Heck, yeah.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.070
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.680
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.418
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:00.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.220
&gt;&gt; Bye.
