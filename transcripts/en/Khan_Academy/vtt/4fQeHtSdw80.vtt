00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.972
- Find the area of a
square with side (6x-5y).

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:09.333
Let me draw our square
and all of the sides

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.249
of a square are going
to have the same length,

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.894
and they're telling us that the length

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.799
for each of the sides which is the same

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.134
for all of them is (6x-5y).

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:19.387
So the height would be 6x-5y,

00:00:19.387 --> 00:00:22.763
and so would the width, 6x-5y,

00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:24.587
and if we wanted to find
the area of the square

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:27.536
we just have to multiply
the width times the height.

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:30.895
So the area for this square
is just going to be the width,

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:35.895
which is (6x-5y) times the height,

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:40.957
times the height which is also (6x-5y),

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.291
so we just have to multiply
these two binomials.

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:45.998
To do this, you could either do FOIL

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:47.644
if you like memorizing things

00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:49.535
or you could just remember
this is just applying

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.375
the distributive property twice.

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:54.043
So what we could do is
distribute this entire magenta,

00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:58.486
(6x-5y), distribute it over each

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:02.517
of these terms, in the yellow (6x-5y).

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:04.875
If we do that, we will get

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:09.875
this 6x times this entire (6x-5y),

00:01:11.494 --> 00:01:16.494
so (6x-5y), and then we have -5y,

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.268
- 5y times once again,

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:25.218
the entire magenta, (6x-5y).

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.816
And what does this give us?

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:30.964
So we have, we have 6x times 6x,

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:33.767
so when I distributed just this,

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:36.264
I'm now doing the distributive
property for the second time,

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:41.058
6x times 6x is 36x squared,

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:46.058
and then when I take 6x times -5y,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.499
I get 6 times -5 is -30,

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.392
and then I have an x times y, -30xy.

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:59.357
And then I want to take,

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:01.377
I'm trying to introduce many colors here,

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:04.300
so I have this -5y times

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.729
this 6x right over here

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.024
so -5 times 6 is -30.

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:14.745
- 30 and I have a y and
an x or an x and a y,

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:18.776
and then finally I have my
last distribution to do,

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:20.918
let me do that maybe in white,

00:02:20.918 --> 00:02:25.918
I have -5y times another -5y,

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.684
so the negative times a
negative is a positive

00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:33.197
so it is positive, 5 times 5 is 25,

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:36.650
y times y is y squared.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.460
And then we are almost done.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.625
Right over here, we could say,

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.181
we can just add these two terms

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.732
in the middle right over here,

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:51.587
- 30xy-30xy is going to be -60xy.

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:58.490
So you get 36x squared -60xy +25y squared.

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:05.244
Now, there is a faster way
to do this if you recognize.

00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:08.565
If you recognize that if
I'm squaring a binomial,

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:09.899
which is essentially
what we're doing here,

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.369
this is the exact same thing

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.211
as 6x-5y squared.

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.408
So you might recognize a pattern.

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:20.963
If I have (a+b) squared,
this is the same thing

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:25.187
as (a+b) times (a+b)

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:26.755
and if you were to multiply it out

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:28.829
this exact same way we just did it here,

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.997
the pattern here is it's a
times a which is a squared,

00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:37.981
plus a times b, +ab, plus b times a,

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.827
which is also +ab, we
just switched the order,

00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:44.949
plus b squared, +b
squared so this is equal

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.485
to a squared +2ab +b squared.

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:51.500
This is kind of the fast way to look,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.250
if you're squaring any binomial,
it will be a+b squared,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.559
it will be a squared +2ab + b squared.

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.355
And if you knew this ahead of time,

00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.876
then you could have just applied that

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.313
to this squaring of the
binomial right up here

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:05.534
so let's do it that way as well.

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:10.495
So if we 6x, (6x-5y) squared,

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.080
we could just say well, this
is going to be a squared.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.551
It's going to be a squared in which

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.551
in this case is 6x squared +2ab,

00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:25.678
so that's +2 times a which is (6x)

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:28.597
times b which is (-5y),

00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:32.573
- 5y +b squared,

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:37.521
which is +(-5y), everything is squared.

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.091
And then this will simplify too,

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:43.373
6x squared is 36x squared plus,

00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:44.931
actually it's going to be a negative here

00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:47.151
because it's going to be 2 times 6 is 12

00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:51.816
times -5 is -60, we have x and a y,

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.158
x and a y, and the -5y squared

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:58.286
is +25y squared.

00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:00.464
So hopefully you saw
multiple ways to do this,

00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:01.984
if you saw this pattern immediately,

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.273
and if you knew this pattern immediately,

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:05.711
you could just cut to the
chase and go straight here,

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.088
you wouldn't have to do
distributive property twice,

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:10.502
although, this will never be wrong.
