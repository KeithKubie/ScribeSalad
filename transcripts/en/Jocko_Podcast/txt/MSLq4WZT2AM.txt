Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. There is an army cliche that I'm sure you've heard of or you've heard that goes, everyone's leadership style is different. I've heard it used many times as a coverup for a failed mission or with someone who just isn't getting it done. What's your opinion on this for all the advice that you give? There seems to be a continuous method to your madness and some basic principles for being a good leader. Does everyone have a different leadership style or is there an optimal optimal method with personality tweaks?

Speaker 2:          00:31          That's just amazing how well this Jujitsu comparison to this is, this is, this is just an incredible translation and if you know the way broad broadly you you've seen in all things because what this question is is exactly the same as the question above and the fact of the matter is, if you know Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujitsu, yeah. You know the fundamental principles of it, you can do these tweaks them. If you don't know the fundamental principles of it, you're just going to get destroyed now. Okay. If you're a catch wrestler that those have the same sort of fundamental things going on. You know what I mean? If you know sambal. So if you know judo, so I'm saying if you understand, I don't know what to call them, but if you understand like the fundamental principles of submission grappling of any kind, if you know what those are, then you can make some tweaks to them.

Speaker 2:          01:23          You can make some, some adjustments to them to bait based on your style and your body type and your personality and your strengths and weaknesses. Yes, it is the same thing with leadership. So people are going to have different styles. They're going to have different styles of leadership. Some people are super caring, charismatic, right? And that person could take advantage of their, their charisma. Some people like connect with other people really easily. Some people don't. You're going to have just different little nuances to your personality and your brain that are going to, that you're gonna make a little adaptations and your leadership style. That's okay. Where it gets not okay is if you leave the fundamental principles. That's where you have a problem with. Because there was a, there's an example that I thought of when I read this question. There was a guy that was coming through my training when I was running the uh, the advanced training for the seals and he was making actually leafs told story.

Speaker 2:          02:27          You remember life, he's told the story. I think it's in the book too. I don't remember, but it's, it's podcast book. We've talked about it a bunch. We talk about it when we to go talk to clients. Life tells the story about how he was trying to give commands over the radio and no one's doing anything because it's ineffective to give commands in the radio. You know, when there's a lot of machine gun fire and all the stuff going on. So I said a life use verbal commands and he kinda like looked at me like I was crazy and I said to him and just give it a try. He did it. It worked. A couple of years later, I'm running training. There's a guy that's given a bunch of commands on the radio and I go to him, I go, hey man, use verbal commands. And he's like, he's like, what do you mean?

Speaker 2:          03:07          And I'm like, yell at everyone so they know what it is you want them to do. They can't hear you on the radio. There's a lot of stuff going on. And he goes, I don't lead that way. That's what he said to me. I don't lead that way. And you know, they just got destroyed because you know, in his, I don't know if he thought like, hey look, I'm not going to yet. I wasn't telling him to yell at US people I was telling him like yelled the verbal commands and he wouldn't do it. And they just got annihilated all the time. And he ended up not doing well as a leader because he was breaking the fundamental principles of combat leadership, like simple, clear, concise commands that everyone understands that if they don't understand it, whose fault that is it, it's yours. And if you're talking on the radio giving these complex orders, people aren't going to understand what to do.

Speaker 2:          03:59          But if you give them the, the, the standard operating procedure, maneuver, command peel, right, that's going to get passed and everyone's going to do it. So he strayed away from the fundamental principles. It's like, it's like saying, well, you know with me, if I give you, if I use a pressure point on your neck, then I'll win. It's like, no, actually that's not going to be effective. You know, you, the pressure point thing is a fantasy. Oh No, it's real. Oh, okay. It is real. You know what? And there's, there's certain parts of your body that hurt a little bit more when you press into him. I understand that that doesn't change you from getting choked doesn't change you from getting double leg take down. You try and hit some of the pressure point while they're doing a double leg take down on you. You're not going to make it.

Speaker 2:          04:46          No, it was not going to happen. So, um, you, you, you have enough told this story too about the guy that wasn't very loud and I told them like, Hey, you've got to get louder. And eventually he got the guys that were allowed in his platoon to start giving the verbal commands cause he wasn't loud enough to do it and that was an effective way. Still using the same principle, just using a little bit of a different technique. That's fine. So yes, different leaders are going to lead differently, but the principles are going to remain the same that the principles of ownership cover, move, simple, prioritize and execute decentralized command and balancing the dichotomies. And then there's plenty of them in leadership. The good leaders out there, they will follow those principles and they'll make little tweaks to them based on their personality. And that's fine.

Speaker 2:          05:33          But a tweak doesn't require an excuse and also effective or ineffective. Like if you make a change, if you do something a certain way and it's not effective, then whatever you change, this isn't working. It's not working. So use the fundamental principles, make little APP to adaptations. It's okay. But if a leader is ineffective and they're failing, guess what? Their little adaptations like, hey, I could make up a new move, right for Jujitsu and I, and I call it the the Wizbang. Sure. And I say, Hey, I made up the school move. It's called the Wizbang and let me show it to you. And so I show it to you and you're like, well, I don't know if that'll work or not. And I like, no, it'll definitely work. The cool thing about Jujitsu is when I try it, we find out if it works. Right now, something doesn't work immediately, right.

Speaker 2:          06:19          But let's say I keep drilling it on you and drilling it on you and I can never get you in the Wiz. Okay. And then I go on a tournament and I try the Whiz Bang and I get smashed and defeated, and then I go through the constellation bracket. I tried the Wizbang and it gets smashed and defeated. Then I go on the next tournament. I try the Wizbang here, you get smashed and defeated. Then I get in the constellation bracket. I tried the Wizbang and get smashed and defeated and I do this for six months and the whizzbang never works effective or ineffective currently. In effect, it's ineffective, it's ineffective. If you're in a leadership position or someone's in a leadership position and they're failing and they're failing to execute the mission over and over and over again, they're little tweak that, a little leadership thing that they think is good to go. It's not, it's not good to go. And it probably, in fact, I'll tell you, it violates one of the fundamental principles of combat leadership. And if you can identify which one of those things it's violating, you can get them to clean it up and fix it.

Speaker 2:          07:21          So there you go. Whizz Bang. Don't try it. Don't try the Wizbang. I don't know though. I mean these digits, Jujitsu moves. You know how like guys like bus up moves, man, I don't know. It's, it's this endless thing to notice. New moves come out. Yeah, and you won't hit a move 100% of the time and you definitely won't hit it when you first started doing it. It's going to be hard. How many arm locks do you think you put on someone before you made someone tap? In the beginning you probably did 50 arm locks before you got someone to tap. Yeah, probably more. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe even more. So that doesn't mean what the after the first 49 outs and effective emoc going to do it. The big differences, the big differences on arm lock is a proven known entity covering move is a proven known entity.

Speaker 2:          08:07          Simple is a proven known entity. Prioritize. Next. Cute. Is it proven known entity? Yeah. Extreme ownership is a proven, known and decentralized command is a proven, it's like an art markets. I could choke and that's why when some people say to me, Oh, well my boss doesn't like extreme ownership, you know, I know what's happening. Like it's, they're the bosses. Ego is offended because there's some other, some somebody telling them a different way to lead. No. It's like, what do you believe in? I don't believe in extreme ownership. Oh, I blame him. I believe in placing the blame on other people. That's how I lead. That's complete. Completely ridiculous. Everybody knows that's ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. Cover move. I don't believe in cover move. Oh, so you just like your other team members to go and take care of themselves and you take care of yourself.

Speaker 2:          08:56          How does that work? It doesn't work. Keep the, oh I don't like to keep things simple. No, I like to make things so complicated. Complicated that people don't understand what I'm talking about. Does that make any sense whatsoever? No, it doesn't. Yeah. Prioritize and execute. No, don't do that. What I, what I'm going to do is spread myself so thin that I don't have the assets or resources to actually accomplish anything. That's what I'm going to do. Because that makes sense. Cause I don't believe in extreme ownership or those are the fundamental laws of combat leadership. That's where you're at. Decentralized Command. Oh, I don't believe in that. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make every single decision myself from the headquarters position. When you guys want to make a decision out there on the battlefield are out there on the, on the manufacturing floor, I want you to run every single division decision up through me.

Speaker 2:          09:40          Cause that's going to be effective. So if you violate one of these principles, you're going to have problems as a leader. If you tweak these principles, that's fine. If you look at decentralized command and you're like, you know what? I know that the normal kind of span of control is five people. I can handle more than that. I can handle nine and you step it up. That's, that's tweak. That's okay. Right? That's fine. If you pray, when you prioritize and execute, Hey, oh the way I prioritize and execute, and this is the truth. The way I prioritize and execute isn't, I look at my number one problem and I only focused on that one. I assign somebody to my number one problem and I say, hey bill, go handle that room over there. It's a problem. And then I look at Mike and say, Hey Mike, get the rest of this hallway cleared. So I'm actually handling two things, but I give build a priority. So that's a tweak. I'm using assets. That's fine. So sometimes yes, you got to make these little adjustments. Everyone's got a different leadership style, but you don't violate the principles of leadership.
