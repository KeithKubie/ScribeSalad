bag little bit yeah I love that you went
for white bread like you didn't you know

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
for white bread like you didn't you know
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.259
for white bread like you didn't you know
you didn't show trendy and go no none of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
you didn't show trendy and go no none of
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.310
you didn't show trendy and go no none of
that none of that

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320

Brady I think we need to cut the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
Brady I think we need to cut the
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519
Brady I think we need to cut the
sandwich in half but that does leave me

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
sandwich in half but that does leave me
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.429
sandwich in half but that does leave me
with a bit of a quandary because how do

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
with a bit of a quandary because how do
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.040
with a bit of a quandary because how do
I know exactly what a half a sandwich is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
I know exactly what a half a sandwich is
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.359
I know exactly what a half a sandwich is
because look you know you've got this

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
because look you know you've got this
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.550
because look you know you've got this
breads sort of lopping around there the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
breads sort of lopping around there the
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.400
breads sort of lopping around there the
ham isn't exactly even you know how do

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
ham isn't exactly even you know how do
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.720
ham isn't exactly even you know how do
you how do you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
you how do you
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.270
you how do you
if this sandwich is bit badly made as I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
if this sandwich is bit badly made as I
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220
if this sandwich is bit badly made as I
am prone to doing how can you work out

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
am prone to doing how can you work out
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.700
am prone to doing how can you work out
where halfway is defining half a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
where halfway is defining half a
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.850
where halfway is defining half a
sandwich I want exactly half of this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
sandwich I want exactly half of this
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010
sandwich I want exactly half of this
slice only exactly half of the ham and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
slice only exactly half of the ham and
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.619
slice only exactly half of the ham and
the Warren exactly half of that slice

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629
the Warren exactly half of that slice
 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.090
the Warren exactly half of that slice
does the cut have to be straight oh yeah

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
does the cut have to be straight oh yeah
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160
does the cut have to be straight oh yeah
and only one cut and it doesn't matter

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
and only one cut and it doesn't matter
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720
and only one cut and it doesn't matter
where the sandwiches I want it even if

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
where the sandwiches I want it even if
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.569
where the sandwiches I want it even if
it's like that but thankfully the ham

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
it's like that but thankfully the ham
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450
it's like that but thankfully the ham
sandwich there can help us

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
sandwich there can help us
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.929
sandwich there can help us
so the ham sandwich theorem says that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
so the ham sandwich theorem says that
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910
so the ham sandwich theorem says that
when you have three objects in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
when you have three objects in
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.109
when you have three objects in
three-dimensional space

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
three-dimensional space
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.780
three-dimensional space
you will be able to cut each of them

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
you will be able to cut each of them
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.640
you will be able to cut each of them
exactly in half using only one cut and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650
exactly in half using only one cut and
 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.690
exactly in half using only one cut and
the best way to explain this is by

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
the best way to explain this is by
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080
the best way to explain this is by
building up from just one slice let's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
building up from just one slice let's
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870
building up from just one slice let's
say that you want to cut this slice of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
say that you want to cut this slice of
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399
say that you want to cut this slice of
bread in half but let's imagine

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
bread in half but let's imagine
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960
bread in half but let's imagine
someone's already come past and taking a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
someone's already come past and taking a
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.670
someone's already come past and taking a
bit of a nibble off of it just so it's a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
bit of a nibble off of it just so it's a
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.330
bit of a nibble off of it just so it's a
bit harder yeah okay okay

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
bit harder yeah okay okay
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.929
bit harder yeah okay okay
yeah now it's obviously less obvious Wes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
yeah now it's obviously less obvious Wes
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.340
yeah now it's obviously less obvious Wes
Cutlass muck it up a little bit more

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
Cutlass muck it up a little bit more
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.940
Cutlass muck it up a little bit more
here we go

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
here we go
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590
here we go
less obvious where to cut right we want

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
less obvious where to cut right we want
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390
less obvious where to cut right we want
to get this exactly in half this this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
to get this exactly in half this this
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580
to get this exactly in half this this
slice of bread now if I hold the knife

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
slice of bread now if I hold the knife
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.270
slice of bread now if I hold the knife
here all of the bread is on this side of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
here all of the bread is on this side of
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609
here all of the bread is on this side of
the knife and if I move the knife over

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
the knife and if I move the knife over
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.670
the knife and if I move the knife over
there now all of the breads is on this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
there now all of the breads is on this
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.249
there now all of the breads is on this
side of the knife so what that means is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
side of the knife so what that means is
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.010
side of the knife so what that means is
that there must be some point in the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
that there must be some point in the
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.069
that there must be some point in the
middle where exactly half of the bread

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
middle where exactly half of the bread
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749
middle where exactly half of the bread
is on this side and half of the brailers

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
is on this side and half of the brailers
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850
is on this side and half of the brailers
on that side crossover point exactly

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
on that side crossover point exactly
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950
on that side crossover point exactly
exactly but that was me

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
exactly but that was me
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169
exactly but that was me
holding the knife at this angle and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
holding the knife at this angle and
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720
holding the knife at this angle and
moving through that way it would also be

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
moving through that way it would also be
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.050
moving through that way it would also be
true if I heard the knife that way

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
true if I heard the knife that way
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.710
true if I heard the knife that way
or more difficult to give the ankles but

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
or more difficult to give the ankles but
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.860
or more difficult to give the ankles but
that way so any angle at which I hold

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
that way so any angle at which I hold
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.440
that way so any angle at which I hold
the knife I can guarantee that there's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450
the knife I can guarantee that there's
 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590
the knife I can guarantee that there's
going to be some point where half of the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600
going to be some point where half of the
 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.570
going to be some point where half of the
bread is on either side regardless of

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
bread is on either side regardless of
 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.770
bread is on either side regardless of
the fact that the bread is all kind of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780
the fact that the bread is all kind of
 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.320
the fact that the bread is all kind of
messed up and Binny environments so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
messed up and Binny environments so
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.710
messed up and Binny environments so
that's fine now let's imagine that we

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
that's fine now let's imagine that we
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390
that's fine now let's imagine that we
add in our hand it's making a little bit

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
add in our hand it's making a little bit
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.130
add in our hand it's making a little bit
more difficult let's can fold the ham up

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
more difficult let's can fold the ham up
 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:56.040
more difficult let's can fold the ham up
in a slightly awkward way we already

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
in a slightly awkward way we already
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.180
in a slightly awkward way we already
know that we can cut this slice of bread

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190
know that we can cut this slice of bread
 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.300
know that we can cut this slice of bread
here at any angle okay so what we can do

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
here at any angle okay so what we can do
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.110
here at any angle okay so what we can do
is we can pick a point on this bread

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
is we can pick a point on this bread
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.440
is we can pick a point on this bread
let's say like that where we know that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
let's say like that where we know that
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.570
let's say like that where we know that
50% of the bread is on this side and 50%

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
50% of the bread is on this side and 50%
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.699
50% of the bread is on this side and 50%
is on that side but what you'll notice

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709
is on that side but what you'll notice
 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.360
is on that side but what you'll notice
is that all over the ham now in this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370
is that all over the ham now in this
 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.819
is that all over the ham now in this
example is on this side of the knife but

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829
example is on this side of the knife but
 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.560
example is on this side of the knife but
because we know that we can cut this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
because we know that we can cut this
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.900
because we know that we can cut this
bread at any angle you can rotate this

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
bread at any angle you can rotate this
 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.180
bread at any angle you can rotate this
knife so that now all of the ham is on

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
knife so that now all of the ham is on
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.759
knife so that now all of the ham is on
this side which means that there must be

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769
this side which means that there must be
 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.610
this side which means that there must be
a point in the middle where exactly half

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620
a point in the middle where exactly half
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.530
a point in the middle where exactly half
of the ham is on this side of the knife

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
of the ham is on this side of the knife
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.090
of the ham is on this side of the knife
and half on the other side there's one

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100
and half on the other side there's one
 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.810
and half on the other side there's one
magic line at least one magic line now

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820
magic line at least one magic line now
 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.030
magic line at least one magic line now

bread yarn Brady look at this delicious

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109
bread yarn Brady look at this delicious
 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.840
bread yarn Brady look at this delicious
sandwich I've made you can apply the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850
sandwich I've made you can apply the
 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.660
sandwich I've made you can apply the
same principles it's slightly trickier

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
same principles it's slightly trickier
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.930
same principles it's slightly trickier
to explain this one but the idea is the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
to explain this one but the idea is the
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.720
to explain this one but the idea is the
same except in this case you now have

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730
same except in this case you now have
 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.000

well so you're so sweeping over turning

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920
well so you're so sweeping over turning
 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.949
well so you're so sweeping over turning
it around and rotating it that way in

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959
it around and rotating it that way in
 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.020
it around and rotating it that way in
that way there should be a way where you

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
that way there should be a way where you
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.740
that way there should be a way where you
