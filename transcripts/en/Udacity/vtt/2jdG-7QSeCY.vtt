00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.080
Welcome back. The goal of this course is to get you to level

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.970
up from an already awesome developer

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.750
to an even awesomer design minded developer.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So let's start by reviewing what you learned

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.540
in Lesson 1. The first thing we learned in Lesson 1

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.500
was, we defined UX and disambiguated it from UI. Then

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.020
we gave you an awesome visceral example of great user experience.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt; I love that visceral example.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
&gt;&gt; And we also use two examples of a sign

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.540
in form and a checkout form to illustrate why it's bad to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.660
start with detail first thinking. It

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.960
basically causes you to only optimize locally.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. You end up creating some really awesome

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.010
forms, but the overall application might suffer, and if you zoom

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.700
out you actually get an idea what the application should do.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.780
And then you might decide you don't even need those ones.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.750
&gt;&gt; Exactly and then we also learned a technique called LO RES

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.560
wire framing, which helps you think about your application as a

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.050
series of steps that your user needs to go through to

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.850
accomplish a certain task. So now that we know that we're

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.420
supposed to think in this way, where do we go from here?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.257
What do we do next? So in Lesson 1 we are

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:07.960
really focusing on the smart phone. But now we're going to start

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.920
focusing on the person. So we need to ask ourselves, who

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060
is our end user? Or who are we making this application for?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.020
&gt;&gt; So Isabel, how do we focus on the user?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230
&gt;&gt; And that's a great question. And the answers all lie

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.030
ahead in Lesson 2, where we're going to talk all about how

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.150
to design for our end user. Before we get started, let's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.775
go over a quick overview of what you're going to learn in Lesson

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:30.140
2. We're going to discuss two things. The first is how to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.140
design applications for a specific type of user, or a persona,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.800
and their use cases. The second thing is, how to build

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.090
a feature list that's tailored for your persona and your use case

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.690
to make sure that your application will really delight your user.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.970
&gt;&gt; Sounds great, Isabelle. Let's get started
