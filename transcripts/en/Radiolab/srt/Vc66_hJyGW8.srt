1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,390
I s great. You're listening to radio,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,360
the podcast from New York
public radio, public radio, w.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,613
C. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,680
Hey everyone. Jad here from
radio lab this summer, W NYC.

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:24,760
The station that I worked for
asked me to host a singles event.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,540
I kid you not the singles event.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,550
I mean the idea they had and
this didn't start with me,

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,880
is that people love public radio and they
could find love through public radio.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,710
An interesting idea and it
made for an interesting event.

10
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,780
The Brooklyn Brewery in Williamsburg,

11
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:48,160
Brooklyn was kind enough to loan us
their space. It's an amazing space.

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,220
About 250 people showed up ready to mingle
and it was great to meet fans of the

13
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:59,620
show, people who love public radio and
also gave us a chance to explore the

14
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:04,060
biochemistry of love and a
typical radio lab fashion.

15
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:07,450
We thought for this podcast perhaps
we would play you a bit of that event.

16
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,670
[inaudible]

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,900
hello? Hello. Hello.

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,650
I salute you all for
coming tonight. I Chet.

19
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,640
Cheers everyone for making it out.

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,340
It's not an easy thing to come and
put yourself in, in a room full of,

21
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:38,360
of attractive strangers. And, uh, I, I,

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,590
you're all very brave for
doing this. We are so,

23
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,360
so excited that you've turned out.

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,930
Let me just take a quick poll the
audience to see who we've got here. Um,

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,200
how many people in this room have, uh,

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,710
have never done anything like
this ever in their lives.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,180
Ah, thank God. I'm so glad
to know I'm not alone there.

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,990
And how many people know
Radiolab have heard the show?

29
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,530
I right?

30
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,830
My people. Yes. Okay.

31
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,850
So what we generally do on
radio lab is we take a big idea,

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,670
sort of a basic fact of the
human condition, like sleep.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,480
And we ask, you know, what should
be a stupid question about it?

34
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,540
Like why do we sleep? It
turns out no one knows.

35
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:30,140
And so we go and we investigate that idea
in the most unusual ways we can think

36
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:33,860
of. That's kind of what we do.
Interviews, theater, whatever.

37
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,640
So the thought was, how can we

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,220
Radiolab a Phi, this situation right
here, given that it's not about us,

39
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,720
it's about you guys meeting people.
Um, getting to know one another.

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,340
We are your humble servants in that
endeavor. But, uh, we thought, well,

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,430
how could we sort of explore the issue
that has brought us all together,

42
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:59,690
which is love. What is love? Okay,

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,640
that's a question that's been, no, don't
freak out when I say love by the way.

44
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,570
Okay. There's no pressure.
No pressure at all.

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,130
Love is the thing that happens way
downstream many, many nights from now.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,310
You'll fifth of just,

47
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:20,420
this is just about getting to know
one of them had a fear about this.

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,500
I was like, get a say. Love
everyone's gonna go. But no.

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,420
So we call him a bunch of people and
ask them the question, what is love?

50
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,400
And it turns out love is a
many sited chemicals situation.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,250
And as I was moving
through, everyone was like,

52
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:41,870
why the hell is dopamine on
my name tag? What does that,

53
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,770
well, what I'm going to do right
now is I'm going to play some tape.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,360
It explains your name tax. I
called up a guy, Neeley Tucker,

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,940
who is going to help us understand
what is love. So you guys ready?

56
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,180
Here's some tape. All right.

57
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,270
Hi,

58
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,040
my name is Neely talker and I'm a general
assignment writer in the style section

59
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,980
of the Washington Post.

60
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,830
Okay, so I want you to
to introduce me to the,

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,450
to the posse [inaudible] chemical
posse and let's start with dopamine.

62
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,603
Tell me about dopamine.

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,130
Dopamine is essentially the chemical that
makes you feel good in your brain when

64
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:25,060
you're really, truly madly in love,
get a great big surge of dopamine,

65
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,180
which to your brain just lights up. It's
something that feels really terrific.

66
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,311
What does that mean though?

67
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,000
Like when you see that special
someone's face and you think

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,010
on the inside, is that just dopamine
searching and slashing around

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,640
that? Is Dopamine just
bouncing like, you know,

70
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,050
like a ball through a pinball machine?

71
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,760
[inaudible] yeah.

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,180
What we're talking about here is
the truly passionate form of love,

73
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,680
that real euphoria,

74
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,780
God's great free gift that's available
to everybody regardless of class, income,

75
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:59,140
race, religion. That's more of the
feeling that, that we're talking about

76
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,740
dopamine. Who here is dopamine?

77
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,220
Dopamine now you, you are the reason
we are all here tonight. Dopamine,

78
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,380
you are the reason for all the
sugary pop songs on the radio.

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,410
You are, no, no, I don't, I
don't mean that in a bad way.

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,750
You are the reason for all the overheated
love poetry that's ever been written,

81
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:27,400
dopamine it is, is the
quintessential love chemical.

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,680
It's a very powerful substance.
And if you don't believe me,

83
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,260
just to underline the point
about the power of dopamine,

84
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,410
I want to play the next clip
from a scientist, Helen Fisher,

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,390
whose research Neely Tucker was just
drawing upon when he described opening.

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,190
She talks about her methodology to a
conference that we recorded recently.

87
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,420
I'll play you just this clip just to make
it clear on how powerful dopamine is.

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,750
What I am my colleagues did was put,

89
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,950
I'm 32 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner, a

90
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,270
17 who were madly in love and the love
was excepted and 15 who were madly in

91
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,180
love and they had just been dumped. So,
uh, we, we scanned their brains, uh,

92
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,790
looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart and we
found activity and a lot of

93
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,200
brain regions. In fact,

94
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,880
one of the most important was a
brain region that becomes active, um,

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,660
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

96
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,620
So when you do cocaine,
which I know you all do,

97
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:27,410
I can see it on your faces
and when you are in love,

98
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,790
the same little gang of neurons in
your head get excited and squared out

99
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,440
dopamine. So when you, when
people say love is a drug,

100
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,530
it is literally true. So dopa bead,
raise your hands again one more time.

101
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,910
You are the engine of love and you,

102
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,720
you carry a particular importance
in tonight's proceedings.

103
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,590
However, and this brings
us to our second chemical.

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,030
Dopamine on its own is useless. Okay?

105
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,050
That's it. Hey,

106
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,480
why else would we have brought you
all together and divided you up?

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,360
Chemical number two, who here
is nor epinephrin or Epinephrin?

108
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,790
Let me introduce you to nor epinephrine.

109
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,380
All right, so introduce
me to no epinephrin.

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,380
Norepinephrine is a neuro
transmitter. It goes between, um,

111
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,610
and neurons in your brain,

112
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,120
which is a tiny little gap and it's
what communicates good feelings back and

113
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:30,150
forth. And the faster it goes,
the better you're going to feel.

114
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,040
It's another tiny little surge that
goes through and really leads to very

115
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,600
focused thought attention

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,890
and how, how exactly is that
different than dopamine?

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,100
Dopamine is a good time,

118
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,560
par dopamine sets up the party and get
you to having a good time in nor burn

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,060
effort is the thing that, that, uh,

120
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,660
makes you ask the good looking blonde
over there. If she had, you know,

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,840
I dropped by your place later,
listen to a little van Marzano,

122
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,180
have a glass of water.
And so, so, so, so that is

123
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,620
that you might have at say like
a a bar or a single sit up.

124
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:02,040
Let's say when you're in a room full
of people and you're primed and you're,

125
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,431
you're,

126
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:06,690
you're excited and you want to meet
someone and then you lock eyes with that

127
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,680
person in the whole world is
kind of drifts away. Yeah.

128
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,990
The last part of that
sentence is norepinephrine.

129
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,580
The first part might be dopamine.

130
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,801
Yeah.

131
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:18,610
More or less as I was coming out of really
focusing in on one particular thing,

132
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,750
true passion and almost the physical
sense of something that you want to take

133
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,890
care of right now.

134
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,740
It was related to me that norm for
Nevin was more like infatuation.

135
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,170
All right, so nor epinephrin.

136
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,470
I don't know if you guys heard that
subtle distinction between norepinephrine

137
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,410
and dopamine, but dopamine
puts you in the mood,

138
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,180
but it's a generalized feeling.
It's a kind of diffuse mood,

139
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,210
nor Epinephrin is the thing that focuses
that mood on one person in one place.

140
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,990
It's the thing that literally makes your
heart pound. It makes your skin sweat,

141
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,180
your hands get clammy, your
weak, your knees get weak.

142
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,490
It is the thing that actually
is the physical aspect of
attraction without which

143
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,170
dopamine would be useless. So nor
epinephrin raise your hands again.

144
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,413
[inaudible]

145
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
when you lock eyes with
that special dopamine,

146
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:17,130
someone realize that you are working
together to get the conversation started

147
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,840
chemically. One cannot exist
without the other. However,

148
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,480
and this brings us to our third and
perhaps most important chemical.

149
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,380
It turns out that you, you,

150
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,740
it turns out that there is a fatal
flaw with dopamine and nor Epinephrin

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,660
[inaudible]

152
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,660
in that dopamine and norepinephrine
come on strong and they fade quickly.

153
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,460
I know, I know.

154
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,421
However,

155
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:55,680
there is a third chemical that comes
online that carries you through into that

156
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,910
relationship and into kids and all
that. I know, I know. No, no, no,

157
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,070
no pressure, no pressure, no pressure.

158
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,970
So let me play you an introduction
to that third chemical.

159
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,570
Who's Oxytocin in here? Alright,

160
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,720
oxytocin. Listen Up.

161
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,300
All right, so we got a dopamine.
We got Nora of an Efrin,

162
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,220
both of which are good for quick highs,

163
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,490
but then there's the thing that we all
know happens after you've been with a

164
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,330
person for six months, maybe longer. Yeah.

165
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,030
It doesn't always have to be so cynical,
but you just, you know, the, the,

166
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:39,030
the fire in your loins, uh,
abs a little bit and, and,

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
and you feel something else.

168
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,980
What is that chemical that
that is that comes online

169
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,430
that's actually Towson.

170
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,600
Oh, [inaudible].

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,730
It's a long lasting chemical
in your brain that can,

172
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,330
can continue to flow
without frying your brain.

173
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,740
If you constantly had surges
of dopamine and Norepinephrine,

174
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,090
it would drive you nuts.
What kicks in is Oxytocin,

175
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,130
which doesn't have the same highs,

176
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,100
but it's a much more
sustainable way to live.

177
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,850
And what emotion or state of mind
would you associate with oxytocin?

178
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,790
Answer more of, of peace and stability
in a less intense form of, of,

179
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,150
of happiness or content. There we go.

180
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,530
Could we call it companionship
or something like

181
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,170
the longterm are lifelong
commitment that two people share,

182
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,490
that they care for each other in good
times or in bad. And they are really,

183
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,640
they're from one another, which
encompasses friendship, companionship,

184
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,500
and at the end of things, uh, love.
That's sort of what sustains us all.

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,633
Oxy.

186
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,820
All right, so just to do
a quick recap, we've have,

187
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,740
we have dopamine which goes by
its street name of romantic love.

188
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,440
That's dopamine. And then we
have norepinephrine Epinephrin,

189
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,680
which can be called different
things. Infatuation.

190
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,170
Perhaps it's the physical
aspects of attraction

191
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,420
or lust as some people in the front said.

192
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,450
And then we have the last camel would
come online, which we'll call attachment c

193
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,050
no, in order to have a lasting, true love,

194
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,340
you need all three
chemicals, people, all three.

195
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,820
A chemical Manajatwa is what's in order.

196
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,180
So that's the,

197
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,190
that brings us to our game
today or activity as it's
called your task right now

198
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:47,650
is to go and find people of
different chemical persuasions.

199
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,290
Okay. Check their name tag. You
want one of each one, oxytocin,

200
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,540
one dopamine, one norepinephrine.

201
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,310
You've got some conversation
starters on the card, go with it.

202
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,650
If it works or no, doesn't matter.

203
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,900
And then the mingling
started. It did not stop.

204
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:10,670
So we ended up cutting out
the rest of our programs

205
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,430
cause everyone was having such a
good time. But we do have it for you.

206
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,840
Hear a story told by Helen Fisher about
what can happen when you try to take the

207
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:20,600
chemicals of love into your own hands.

208
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,230
She told the story of the
Ted Conference in 2006.

209
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,090
I want to tell you a story about the
culture of love, the magic of it.

210
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,530
It was a graduate student and a,

211
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,550
this graduate student was madly in love
with another graduate student and um,

212
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,760
she was not in love with him and they
were all at a conference in Beijing and he

213
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,390
knew from our work that um,

214
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,600
if you go and do something
very novel with somebody,

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,040
you can drive up the dopamine in the
brain and perhaps triggered this brain

216
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,630
system for romantic love.

217
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,510
So he decided he'd put
science to work and uh,

218
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,770
he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him.

219
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,590
And sure enough, I've never been in one,

220
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:13,280
but apparently they go all around the
buses and the trucks and it's crazy and

221
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,200
it's noisy and it's exciting.

222
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:18,260
And he figured this would drive up the
dove of man and she'd fall in love with

223
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,010
them.

224
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,010
So off they go and she's squealing and
squeezing him and laughing and having a

225
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:27,540
wonderful time and are related.

226
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,190
They get down off of the
rickshaw them and um,

227
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,770
she throws her hands up and she says,

228
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,870
wasn't that wonderful and
wasn't there rickshaw driver,

229
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:39,704
handsome

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,513
[inaudible].

231
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,440
All right, now we'll leave
you with the following story.

232
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,630
And this is one of the most
romantic stories that I know of.

233
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:58,010
We aired it a few years back for
program that we produced on space.

234
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,670
Carl Sagan as in the Carl
Sagan of billions and billions,

235
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,610
that cross thing.

236
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,610
And in 1977 was asked by NASA to compile
essentially a mix tape of the human

237
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:15,830
experience. They asked them to
basically go out into the world record.

238
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,940
All of the sounds that reflect
human life on this planet.

239
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,330
Put it onto a gold record,
put the record into a capsule,

240
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:27,620
shoot the capsule into space so that
many millions of years from now,

241
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,080
perhaps some alien will
run across the capsule,

242
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,610
somehow play the record and learn
about us. That was the idea.

243
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,611
And so Carl Sagan appointed Annie drew
alion as the leader of the team that

244
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,790
would choose those sounds.

245
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:45,791
And I spoke with Annie many years ago
about the process that she went through to

246
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,010
choose those sounds. My visited
her upstate at, at her home,

247
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,200
and we sat in the backyard
near a waterfall. That's
the sound that you'll hear.

248
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,290
And she described how
she chose the sounds.

249
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,860
My name is Danny Durian and it was
honored to be the creative director of the

250
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:08,590
voyager interstellar messaged project,

251
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
which began in early 1977 but
now how does this come about?

252
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,340
I think about the project now and
it's so exciting to think about,

253
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,640
I mean, it's such a romantic idea. Did
you know that at the time? Absolutely.

254
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:29,641
We felt first of all that this was a
kind of sacred trust that here we were

255
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,150
habit as a very flawed
human beings with a huge,

256
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:41,560
a huge holes in our knowledge
of all of these subjects.

257
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,250
Building a cultural Noah's Ark.

258
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It was a chance to tell something of
what life on earth was like to beings of

259
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:56,340
perhaps a thousand million
years from now because the,

260
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,570
the voyager engineers were saying this
record will have a shelf life of a

261
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,830
billion years. That didn't
raise goosebumps then you'd
have to be made of wood.

262
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,620
A, it was also the, the, the,

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,180
the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so
madly in love with each other and here

264
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:18,181
we were taking on this mythic challenge
and knowing that before it was done,

265
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,910
two spacecraft would lift off from the
planet earth moving at an average speed

266
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:31,390
of 35,000 miles an hour for the
next thousand million years.

267
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,940
And on it we'd be a kiss,
a mother's first word.

268
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh come on now.

269
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,340
[inaudible]

270
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,450
greetings in the 59 most

271
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,440
populous human languages, shallow

272
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,120
Darcel Hellos, children of planet earth

273
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,380
as well as one non human language,
the readings of the humpback

274
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,713
whales.

275
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,130
And it was a sacred undertaking because
it was saying we want to be citizens of

276
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:15,280
the cosmos. They want
you to know about that.

277
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,490
[inaudible]

278
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,620
tell me about the moment you
fell in love with Carl Sagan.

279
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,030
You said it was during the
voyager compilation? Yes, it was.

280
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,490
It was on June 1st,

281
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,210
1977 I had been looking for some time
for that piece of Chinese music that we

282
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:43,410
could put on the voyager record and not
feel like idiots for having done so.

283
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,693
And um,

284
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,660
I was very excited because I'd finally
found a ethnomusicologist composer at

285
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:56,271
Columbia University who told me without
a moment's hesitation that this peace

286
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,913
flowing streams,

287
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,630
which was represented to me as one of
the oldest pieces of Chinese music,

288
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:07,530
2,500 years old. Oh, was the
piece we should put on the record.

289
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,690
So I called Carl who was traveling,

290
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,660
he was in Tucson, Arizona giving a talk.

291
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,440
And we had been alone many times during
the making of the record and his friends

292
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:23,670
for three years.

293
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,300
And neither of us had ever said anything
to the other. We were both involved,

294
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,080
Baba people. We'd had these
wonderful storing conversations,

295
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,120
but we had both been completely just
professional about everything and his

296
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:42,870
friends. And he wasn't
there. Left a message.

297
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,420
Hour later phone rings,

298
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,820
pick up the phone and I hear
this wonderful voice and he said,

299
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,940
I get back to my hotel room and I find
this message and it says any card.

300
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,540
And I say to myself, why didn't you
leave me this message 10 years ago?

301
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,520
And my heart completely skipped a beat.

302
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,520
I can still remember it so perfectly.

303
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,310
And I said, for keeps. And he
said, you mean get married?

304
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,070
And I said yes. And we had never
kissed. We had never, you know,

305
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,380
even had any kind of
personal discussion before.

306
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,750
We both hung up the phone
and I just screamed out loud.

307
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,170
I remember it so well cause it
was this great Eureka moment.

308
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,580
It was just like a scientific discovery
and then the phone rang and I was

309
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:40,470
thinking, Oh shit, you know, like, and a
phone rang and it was Carl and he said,

310
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,380
I just wanted to make sure that that
really happened. We're getting married,

311
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,500
right? And I said, yeah, we're
getting married. He said, okay,

312
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,140
just in the making sure. And um,

313
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,740
spacecraft lifted off on
August 20th and August 22nd,

314
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,060
we told everyone involved and we were
together from that moment until his death

315
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,970
in 1996 and December. Wow.

316
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,430
Talk about Romantic Micah magic.

317
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,431
And part of my feeling about
voyager obviously and part
of what I was feeling in

318
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,980
the recording of my
brainwaves, my heart, my eyes,

319
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,860
everything in that
meditation on the record,

320
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,480
I had asked Carl whether or not would
be possible to compress the impulses in

321
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,170
one's brain and nervous system into sound
and then put that sound on the record

322
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:42,400
and then think that perhaps
the extraterrestrials of
the future would be able to

323
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,210
reconstitute that data into thought.

324
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,190
And he looked at me and beautiful
May Day in New York City and said,

325
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:56,370
well, you know, now is a million
years is a long time. You know,

326
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,140
why don't you go do it?
Because who knows? You know,

327
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,270
who knows what's possible
in a thousand million years.

328
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,740
And so my brain waves and rem,

329
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,950
every little sound that my body was making
was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in

330
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,124
New York.

331
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,470
This was two days after Carla and
I declared our love for each other.

332
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:25,291
And so what I often think is that
maybe a hundred million years from now,

333
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,100
he knows somebody flags that
record down. And I always wonder,

334
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,790
because part of what I was thinking in
this meditation was about the wonder of

335
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,840
love and of being in love and to
know it's on those two spacecraft.

336
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,430
Even now in my, whenever I'm
down, you know, I'm thinking,

337
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,300
and still they move 35,000 miles an hour,

338
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,480
leaving our solar system for the
great wide open c interstellar space.
