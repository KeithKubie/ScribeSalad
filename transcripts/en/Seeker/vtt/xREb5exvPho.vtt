00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.470
Reason number 1,215 for why science rules:
it turns out, we’re all putting in way too

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.390
much time at our jobs!

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.599
Science says: work less!

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.770
Hey there working stiffs, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.810
Like many of you out there, I have a full-time
job.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.810
This.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.260
And I generally put in 40 hours a week, or
a lot more.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.510
But new research out of Australia suggests
that I may be putting my health at risk.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.740
The study published in the journal Social
Science &amp; Medicine sampled roughly 3,800 men

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.719
and 4,000 women to get an idea of how working
for a long time would affect their health.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.420
They found that on average, working more than
39 hours per week led to a decline in mental

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.420
health.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.039
Researchers think this is because it gives
you less time to eat healthy meals and to

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.440
take care of yourself.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.289
And there were actually pretty huge differences
in how men and women were affected by work.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.250
For men the upper healthy limit was pegged
around 43.5 hours, whereas for women it was

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.719
closer to 38.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.440
That difference was made even more dramatic
when considering that women are often expected

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.170
to take care of household, unpaid work in
addition to their hourly workload.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.900
Nonetheless, many countries, including the
entire European Union, have implemented a

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.000
maximum 48-hour work week.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.780
The International Labor Office has released
reports detailing how working more than 48-hours

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.420
can significantly increase the risk of mental
health problems, and working more than 60

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.810
hours regularly can even lead to physical
problems, especially cardiovascular disease.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.070
Another recent study in the Journal of Occupational
and Environmental Medicine looked at people

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.570
who’d been working for a least ten years,
and found that the risk of cardiovascular

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.170
disease increases as the number of hours worked
per week increases, with the health risk being

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.840
lowest between 40 and 45 hours per week.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.420
For those workers who sit all day in an office,
the effects can be even worse.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.061
A 2014 study of 4,000 civil servants in the
UK found that those who sat more than 25 hours

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:59.490
per week tended to increase their chances
of insulin resistance and had higher rates

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.000
of “bad” cholesterol.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.200
Both of these are risk factors for diabetes,
and the same study found that those who sat

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.369
fewer than 12 hours per day actually lowered
their risk of diabetes by up to 75%.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.170
A poll of nearly 240,000 US workers found
that among those working full-time, more than

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.880
one-in-ten had been diagnosed with depression.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.700
Of course, this only shows that people who
work full-time might also be depressed, not

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.950
that working necessarily causes depression.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.030
Nonetheless, the correlation is worth noting.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.170
And although the original study we looked
at recommends an average of 39 hours a week,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.500
that may not be the whole story when it comes
to how working affects your health.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.330
It also matters whether or not you take breaks
during the day.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.260
Although many countries have laws guaranteeing
employees regular breaks, those breaks may

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.340
not be frequent enough for maximum productivity.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.510
The brain gets tired when repeatedly stressed.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.770
And in fact, it’s possible that the best
way to boost your health and productivity

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.060
is not to come into work at all! [rimshot],
No but seriously.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.990
Working from home is getting more and more
popular thanks to the internet and telecommuting,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.990
but it’s still not the norm.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.090
A study by the National Bureau of Economic
Research looked at call center employees in

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.349
China, and their performance when working
from home.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.720
They found that on average, the employees
worked more minutes per shift, and took more

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800
calls per minute at home, bumping their productivity
by about 13% when working from home.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.730
The workers also reported higher work satisfaction.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.380
Not a surprise.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.720
So in the end, the healthiest and most productive
solution seems to be working fewer hours,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.370
from home, with plenty of breaks.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.120
So catch me next time on DNews, where I’ll
be reporting from my house.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.140
Stay tuned!

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.959
If you're stuck working long hours, would
it help to listen to music?

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.990
Do you think that would boost your productivity?

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.130
Find out in this video here.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.130
What about you?

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.319
Do you feel like you work too much?

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.810
Do you listen to music while you work?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.959
