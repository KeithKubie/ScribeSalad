00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.101 size:78% position:39%
I'm gonna start

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
before any adventures
for the magazine,

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.239
before I was out in Antarctica,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.741
before any of this happened.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.779
I'm gonna start by telling
you how cool I was as a kid,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.817
because honestly,
I was pretty cool.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.321 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was the first hipster
ever, sideways trucker hat.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.492
I was kicking OshKosh B'Gosh,
popped collar, the whole deal,

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.763
but really, the point of
this picture is to show you

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.098
that from a very young
age, I was in campgrounds

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.866 line:0%
and my brother and I
were in campgrounds

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.335 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
and we were always raised
to be in campgrounds.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
As my parents would have
it, they wanted us to go out

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.641 line:0%
from the tiniest age, and go
out and experience the world

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.910
and push our boundaries
and try to understand

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180
what the world was around us,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that was very
important in my family,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start size:88% position:13%
so they started us
skiing when we were two,

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.689 align:start size:97% position:3%
climbing when we were five,
and the whole point was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.526
to sort of define
our own borders.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.662
This is me in the
Wind River Range,

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
close to where I live
now in Bozeman, Montana,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
at about, I guess
I'm 11, 12 years old.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.973
You know, this is when
questioning boundaries

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.975
started to take
a different turn.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.577
I was a smart kid.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start size:84% position:16%
I went to high school
two years early

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you know, exploring
boundaries took on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.319
a completely different
texture at that point,

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.322
and what I mean by that
is I started exploring

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.292 align:start size:88% position:13%
social boundaries rather
than physical ones,

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start size:88% position:13%
and when you're 12
years old in high school

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.129
and you're hanging out
with 18 year old kids,

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.334 align:start size:88% position:13%
you don't have that
six years of experience

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.536 align:start size:84% position:16%
to prepare you for
that, and so honestly,

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.505
by the time I was 14 years old,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was completely dropped
out of high school.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.776
My parents sent me to rehab.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.480
I ran away three times,
and on the third time,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
as they say, the third
time is the charm,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:02.121
my parents gave up, and it's
not that they wanted to give up

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.790
or I blame them for
that, but they said,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.060
"Quite honestly, Cory,
we're scared of you.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.162
"We don't know what to do,

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.764
"and if you can't
abide by our rules,

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.534
"then you can't live at home."

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.603
So I was 14 and homeless.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
I look back on the
privilege of education

00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:24.210
and I shudder to think
what I was thinking,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.513
but that was the
decision I made,

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:30.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
but that time period
led me to observe

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.285
the world from a
very curious place.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.888 align:start size:88% position:13%
When I'm on the
streets, which was rare,

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.790
because oftentimes,
my friends helped me

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.093 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I wasn't actually sleeping
on the streets too much,

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.130
but sometimes I was,
and when I would see

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.599
people picking out
of garbage cans,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
it took on a
different tone to me.

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
When I myself would
have to look for food,

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.773
it took on a different tone,
and what I mean by that is

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:58.945 align:start size:97% position:3%
I started to see this as
closer to our natural state.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:04.149
That is a forager foraging,
and everybody in this room

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.018
is actually much further removed

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:09.489 align:start size:97% position:3%
than our evolved trajectory
than we like to think.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start size:94% position:6%
That forager is far closer
to the way we evolved,

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:17.863
and it was that story, that
time, seeing people struggle

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:22.035
that actually got me excited
about telling bigger stories,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start size:97% position:3%
and thank God for my parents
because they did start me

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.109
climbing so young that
it had a gravitational,

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.746 align:start size:97% position:3%
or I guess anti-gravitational
pull back to it.

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.416
Climbing was the thing
that got me out of this,

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.786 align:start size:94% position:6%
because I came back, I was
driven to do something,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.821
and oddly enough, visually

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:44.123
and just in the
very nature of it

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.926
it's allegorical
to human struggle.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.595
It's perfect for
telling the story

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.065 align:start size:88% position:13%
of what humans are
capable of and how much

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.201
we can overcome,
and not only that.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:59.572 align:start size:97% position:3%
Visually, it's just stunning,
and you can grab people

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.574
and you can capture
their imaginations

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.677
So my early career
was all about this.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.879
I would go out and I
would take pictures

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.648
with really crappy cameras,

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:12.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I would try to
sell them to companies,

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:15.821
and with that money, I
would go on other trips,

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.591
and I'd save it
and I'd save more

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.259
and I'd go on bigger trips

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'd sell to
different companies,

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:25.431
and so that's my whole
early career worked,

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
and for a while, it was very
sustaining and I loved it

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:32.004
because I could say I was
a professional photographer

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.639
and people would
really respect me

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.274
and I was really
proud of myself.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:38.944 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was kind of proving
people wrong at this point.

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:40.746 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was proving
everybody that said

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:44.116
I wasn't gonna amount
to anything wrong.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was saying no, I'm
gonna amount to something,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.390
and I think a lot of my early
career was dedicated to that.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.495
A lot of it was dedicated
to making single images,

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.498 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I call these
single stories, right?

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:03.569
So a single story is an
image that you provide

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.174
to a company that inspires
some sort of inspiration,

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:11.911 align:start size:88% position:13%
that really inspires
people to buy raincoats.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.184
I'm a glorified raincoat
salesman, which is fine,

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
or at least, it was
okay with me early on,

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.190
but I started to
see this divergence

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.594 align:start position:0%
between these single image
stories that I was hired to tell

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:32.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the larger narrative
that I was really engaged in,

00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start size:88% position:13%
the things that I really
wanted to talk about,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.470
which was not the heroic moment.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.108
It was the absolute opposite;
it was the anti-hero moment.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:45.044
It was the thousand yard stare.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.981
It was my version of
conflict photography

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.949
in the outdoor space.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.954
I wanted to talk about
what it's like to hurt,

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:58.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
what it feels like,
and naturally,

00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:00.926
as you travel, for those of us

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:03.462
who have had the great
privilege of traveling,

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:07.800
the more you travel, the
more engaged you become.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
You become engaged with
culture and you start to grow

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:15.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
a certain sense of compassion,
or at least, I did.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.944
This is a picture that I took
a very, very long time ago,

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:23.816 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I remember it distinctly
because all of a sudden,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.786
after looking at this
image back in Huaraz,

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:29.622
coming out of the hills in Peru,

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:32.524
I remember looking
at this and thinking,

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:35.862
oh, climbing's kinda
dumb, and it's true

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.900
because it's a very
self-indulgent act

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.202
and I realized I
needed climbing,

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.870
A, because it sustained me,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.507 align:start size:84% position:16%
and B, because it took
me to these places,

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:50.976 align:start size:84% position:16%
but the most important
thing was the thing

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.979
that I had missed to that point.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.748 align:start position:0%
I was so engaged in my own
struggle and telling that story

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.749
that I was missing
everybody around me,

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.753
so culture became
a very focal point

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.258 align:start size:88% position:13%
in my early
development, but again,

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:11.731 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wasn't a photographer
of any note at this point.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:16.302
Nobody was gonna hire me to
go tell a cultural story.

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.770
I was always gonna
be hired to go tell

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.674 align:start size:88% position:13%
the story of mountains,
and that's okay.

00:07:22.674 --> 00:07:25.577 align:start size:94% position:6%
This is a picture of
Mount Everest on the left.

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:29.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
The little one in
the middle is Lhotse.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.718 align:start size:94% position:6%
In 2010, Conrad Anker, one
of our other explorers,

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:37.223
asked if I would go here and
install time lapse cameras

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:41.026
on the Khumbu Glacier
to monitor deflation,

00:07:41.026 --> 00:07:44.262 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it was for Jim Balog's
movie, Chasing Ice,

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:48.500
'cause we wanted to look at
the impacts of climate change

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.703
on the glaciers in
the Khumbu region.

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:55.475
Coincidentally, Conrad
could kinda sense this.

00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:58.677
I mean, Conrad's been a
climber for a long time

00:07:58.677 --> 00:08:00.346
and he could just
see me looking up,

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
kinda like, I mean the
time lapse cameras are cool

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.150
but that's really cool.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.119
Like, you know,
I wanna go there.

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:11.290
And so we actually finagled,
we called down to Kathmandu

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.661
and I got a permit
to climb Lhotse.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.196 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was no way I
was gonna get a permit

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.964
to climb Everest at this
point; it was too late,

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:22.368 align:start size:88% position:13%
but they got me a
permit to climb Lhotse,

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:26.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it was unlikely
that I was gonna do it.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:30.643
There was no way, because most
people take about eight weeks

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:34.513
and they go up and down and up
and down to get acclimatized.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.181
I had been there
for three weeks.

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:37.816 align:start size:84% position:16%
I hadn't been higher
than base camp,

00:08:37.816 --> 00:08:41.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you know, I had six
days till the summit window,

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:43.455 align:start size:94% position:6%
so people were like,
well, good luck, have fun.

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:45.691
You know, go up, don't die.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.562
That's a common
theme in my life.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.230
Have fun, don't die.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.099
But I ended up climbing it.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:56.936 align:start size:84% position:16%
I ended up climbing
it in six days,

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:00.106
so a total of three and a
half weeks from my house

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.409 align:start size:97% position:3%
to the top of the fourth
highest mountain in the world,

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.177
and that got noticed.

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:08.147 align:start size:84% position:16%
It got noticed by a
guy named Simone Moro.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:10.816
Now, Simone Moro is
an Italian climber.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:14.253
He's known for hard
first winter ascents,

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:18.157
and he called me after
this climb and he said

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:21.294
in this awesome voice,
I'm gonna do it again.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.661
You guys ready?

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:24.330
He talked like this.

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.400 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm not kidding, he
calls like this, he said,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.701
"Cory, do you want
to go Gasherbrum II?

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:31.236
"Winter time, meet with us."

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:34.807 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I said, "I don't
understand what you're saying,

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.744
"but I would love to go with
you because you're my hero."

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.180 align:start size:84% position:16%
Where are we going?
Gasherbrum II.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.983 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like, okay, that
sounds great, where's that?

00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:47.686
And he goes, "It's in Pakistan,"

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.855
and for those of
you who don't know,

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:53.926 align:start size:84% position:16%
there's 14 8,000 meter
peaks in the world,

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:57.830
so 14 peaks that are above
roughly 26,000 thousand feet,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.500
and nine of them are
in Tibet and Nepal,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.036
and five of them
are in Pakistan,

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:07.640
and the nine in Tibet and
Nepal have all been climbed

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.376
or had at this point all
been climbed in winter,

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:13.612 align:start size:94% position:6%
but none of the Pakistani
8,000 meter peaks

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.214
had ever been climbed in winter

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:16.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
because they're about
600 miles north,

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:18.683
the weather's much more severe,

00:10:18.683 --> 00:10:21.687
and a lot of people at
this point, I think,

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:25.858 align:start size:97% position:3%
16 expeditions over 26
years had tried and failed.

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:32.564 align:start position:0%
But here's the thing, I jumped,
I leapt before thinking.

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:34.766
I didn't even know any of that.

00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:36.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
Likewise, I didn't know
that if I did this,

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.003
I would be the first American

00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:41.773
to climb any 8,000
meter peak in winter,

00:10:41.773 --> 00:10:45.144 align:start size:97% position:3%
but of course, I said yes, and
all of a sudden, I was here

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:49.315 align:start size:97% position:3%
on the literal, physical
border of India and Pakistan,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.353
so that's something
to pay attention to.

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:56.321
I remember taking this photo

00:10:56.321 --> 00:10:59.758
mostly because I
saw it happening.

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:02.027
I knew the sun was gonna crest

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:05.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I knew that we're
on our summit push here,

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:09.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I ran ahead in crampons,
that's really hard.

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.506 align:start size:84% position:16%
It doesn't look
cool, you're like...

00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:19.879
I ran and because I ran, I
was just so out of breath

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:25.284
that I immediately vomited,
and then I get my camera out,

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.254 align:start size:97% position:3%
I take my mittens off, I
think it's actually minus 50

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:33.592
and I pull it up and I
realize I can't take it.

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:37.028
It's frozen, I can't turn
it off shutter priority,

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.698
so I can't change the shutter
speed, I can't do anything,

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:41.867
and it's at a 50th of a second,

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.703
which for those of you who
don't know, that's very slow

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
especially when
you're just vomited

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.474 align:start size:81% position:19%
and you're like
trying to do that,

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:52.078 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I took this picture,
and that was that.

00:11:53.812 --> 00:11:55.280
I knew that moment was special

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I also
knew in that moment

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.751 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we were very
likely gonna summit.

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:03.188
But the summit there
was just the beginning.

00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:05.423
Like I said, I didn't know
I'd be the first American.

00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:07.993
I didn't know any of
that, and to be fair,

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:11.029
had I known, I don't think it
would have been good for me.

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:14.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was climbing out of
pure joy and I loved it.

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.371
As we got to the
summit, a storm hit

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:23.542
and on the way down, we were
hit by a massive avalanche.

00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:30.182
Six days out onto our
summit bid, one day,

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:33.585
the last day to base camp,
we were hit by an avalanche

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:37.022 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I sent this picture
to my mom when we got back

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:40.359 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I said, "Mom, we made
it, we're back safe."

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:44.596 align:start position:0%
And she goes, "Oh, it's a lovely
portrait, is that Dennis?"

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:47.132
And I said, "That's me, mom."

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:51.069
She goes, oh, like,
oh, that's gross.

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:55.174
And I'm like, yeah, 'cause I
look like I'm 90, it is gross.

00:12:58.343 --> 00:12:59.778
My face is all swollen.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.947 align:start size:97% position:3%
Did you know that more people
have died this year from

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.851 align:start position:0%
taking selfies than shark
attacks and lightning combined?

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.122
Yeah, it's bad news, don't do
it, but do keep taking selfies

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.623 align:start size:81% position:19%
'cause apparently,
you can get 'em

00:13:11.623 --> 00:13:15.794
on the cover of National
Geographic, that's a thing.

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:19.664
But honestly, to get serious
for a second, that moment,

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:22.801
as much as the avalanche was
a defining moment in my career

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:25.137
and this image became something,

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.839
it became much more than
I had ever anticipated.

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:31.543
It represents something much
deeper, and I look at it now,

00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:34.246 align:start size:97% position:3%
I look at the gesture, I look
at the facial expression,

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:37.616
and what I see is somebody
who's struggling to deal

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:42.220
with a traumatic event, a
very, very traumatic event.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
What happens to the
brain is when it thinks

00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:49.395
it's going to die, it quite
literally prepares for death,

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:53.098 align:start size:97% position:3%
and so when people say my
life flashed before my eyes,

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.533
that's a very real thing.

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.402
It's not the way
you think of it.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.570 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's not like all these
beautiful visions and things.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
Sometimes, you're like Cheerios,
parking tickets, you know.

00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:05.177 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's all of it, compiled,
but I see this now,

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.949
and what I see is a
person who is alive,

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.620
realizing they're alive

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:18.456
after their brain has
prepared for death,

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:22.628
and what that manifests as in
psychological terms is PTSD.

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:26.164
That's where it goes from there.

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.433 align:start size:84% position:16%
The experience is
locked in your brain.

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:31.103 align:start size:88% position:13%
Your sympathetic
nervous system kicks in

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:34.639
and you are continually
experiencing that moment

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:38.544
from that point on,
so it's spinning out,

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.912
and essentially, that's
just a corrosive method

00:14:40.912 --> 00:14:43.114 align:start size:81% position:19%
for your brain,
and what you do is

00:14:43.114 --> 00:14:46.718
you try to find anything
to calm that spinning down.

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's where all
addiction stems from.

00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:50.589
So I didn't know it at the time,

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:54.526 align:start position:0%
but G II had given me the
first American to do something,

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:58.163
8,000 meter peak in
winter, and PTSD.

00:14:58.163 --> 00:15:02.634 align:start position:0%
It's the gift that keeps on
giving, but we'll get into that.

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:05.470
I went home and I got married.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.039
I got married to
a wonderful woman.

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.776
We had a wonderful
group of friends.

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:13.111 align:start size:84% position:16%
We had incredibly
supportive families.

00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:15.714
We lived an alternate lifestyle

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:20.519
that some parents would
be a little alarmed by.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.353 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, okay, you're
gonna go climb mountains

00:15:22.353 --> 00:15:23.822
and you're gonna go climb rocks,

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:26.225 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we had very
supportive family.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:30.862 align:start size:97% position:3%
But the problem was that
even right after my marriage,

00:15:30.862 --> 00:15:33.798
I started to feel disassociated

00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:35.867
and I started to feel withdrawal

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:39.704
and I started to feel
confusion and darkness,

00:15:39.704 --> 00:15:42.074
and I didn't know what it was.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:46.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
I felt like there was a
weight pushing down on me.

00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:48.080
Like, a literal weight.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.349
I'd wake up in the morning
and my brain was just going,

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:54.352
and it was like this
very loud silence,

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:57.122
and it reminded me of
a quote that I read,

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.791
a quote from a book.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:04.263
It says, "They carried
all that they could bear,

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:07.332 align:start size:84% position:16%
"and then some,
including a silent awe

00:16:07.332 --> 00:16:11.136 align:start size:97% position:3%
"for the terrible power of
the things that they carried."

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:15.307
That's by Tim O'Brien from the
book The Things They Carried.

00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:19.378
G II didn't just
leave me with PTSD.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.512
It gave me something else.

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start size:84% position:16%
It gave me an
opportunity to provide

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.819
a storytelling example
to National Geographic.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:31.223 align:start size:94% position:6%
There was a Pakistani
military camp at base camp

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.791
and because we were
there in the winter,

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.460
they were very welcoming.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.394 align:start size:81% position:19%
They opened up
their doors to us.

00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:38.663
They were sort of
intrigued by us.

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:41.633
Who are these three crazy
guys climbing in winter?

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.702 align:start size:94% position:6%
'Cause in the summertime,
you can't go here.

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.337
It's just off limits

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.106
because there's too many
people up on the glacier,

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:51.876
and these guys are
18 to 24 years old.

00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:55.013
I was so alarmed by what I
had seen in western media

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:57.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
and what was actually
happening there,

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:58.683
so I took on the task of trying

00:16:58.683 --> 00:17:01.320
to communicate their story
in very, very brief terms,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.688
because I wanted to come
back and have something

00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:06.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
to show to Sadie
Quarrier, who had asked,

00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:08.394
she's my photo editor
here, who had asked,

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:13.165
hey, can you show me some
storytelling examples?

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was a very unique
opportunity, extremely unique,

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:19.804
and to look back at these and
see what I was trying to do,

00:17:19.804 --> 00:17:22.741
I can understand it,
and I think, you know,

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:26.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
some of 'em are okay,
but oddly enough,

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:28.146
I just wanna tell
how we got here.

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:30.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
These guys would
come over to our camp

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:31.883
and they'd kinda peek in

00:17:31.883 --> 00:17:34.920
and it's like they
were six year olds

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then they'd kinda
nervously walk in

00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:40.758
and we'd have tea with
them, and then finally,

00:17:40.758 --> 00:17:42.360
the reason it all worked out,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.997 align:start size:97% position:3%
the reason we became friends
is because they asked,

00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:50.068
hey, Cory, I know you
guys have internet.

00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:52.237
Could I check my Facebook?

00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:57.309 align:start position:0%
So now, I have a ton of
friends named Farooq, Muhammad,

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:03.815
and I'm on the TSA watch
list, which is awesome.

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
Can't get on a plane
to save my life.

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:11.323 align:start size:88% position:13%
But it was a real lesson
in creating intimacy

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:13.458 align:start size:88% position:13%
and learning through
non-verbal communication

00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.060
and trying to take
pictures that told

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.796
deeper, more meaningful stories,

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:20.165
and really using that
which is different

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:23.134 align:start size:84% position:16%
to show that which
makes us all the same.

00:18:23.134 --> 00:18:24.669
I love this photograph.

00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:26.438
It's not technically perfect.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.607
What self respecting
photographer leaves

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.309
a shadow in the bottom?

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:36.114
It's hardly in focus, but the
guy has a purple tracksuit.

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:39.451
Like, that is dope,
that is awesome.

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.788
And who dries their
clothes in minus 40?

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.291
Why would you do that?

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.792
But the thing is,
it's just like,

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:49.327
I'm a guy out drying my clothes.

00:18:49.327 --> 00:18:50.795
Sure, I'm in the
Pakistani military

00:18:50.795 --> 00:18:52.731
in the highest battlefield
in the world, but guess what?

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:55.433
It's relatable, and that's
what brings us together.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:57.301
That's the power of photography.

00:18:57.301 --> 00:19:00.472
It brings us together;
it brings us closer.

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.374
This is hard living up here.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is very intimate
space, and to be invited in

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.948
and to be shown that level of
friendship was a true gift,

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:13.084
and it made me connect
with these guys in a way,

00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:15.454
a very real way, where I started

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:18.056
feeling much more
for their struggle,

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:22.227
and their struggle is one
that is very, very real.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:26.564
Bertrand Russell has
a wonderful quote.

00:19:26.564 --> 00:19:29.834
He says, "War does not
determine who is right,

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:33.272
"only who is left,"
and I found this foot

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.943
of a Pakistani soldier frozen
in the ice on the glacier,

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:39.811 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it occurred to me that
this is somebody's son

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:43.982 align:start position:0%
and probably somebody's brother
and maybe somebody's uncle.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.587
These wars are ugly
and they leave scars,

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:52.223 align:start size:94% position:6%
and our actions as
humans have consequences.

00:19:52.223 --> 00:19:54.492
They all do, but this led me

00:19:54.492 --> 00:19:57.095
to my first assignment
for National Geographic.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.297
They said, yeah, you can
take a couple pictures.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:00.766
We'll try you out.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:04.369
Might not go so well, but
we'll give you a shot.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:06.070
It was to an area
called Mustang.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.841 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's on the northern border
of Nepal, just south of Tibet,

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.778
and it was pivotal for
Tibetan freedom fighters

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:15.346 align:start size:84% position:16%
at the end of the
cultural revolution,

00:20:15.346 --> 00:20:19.751 align:start size:97% position:3%
but before that, for thousands
of years before that,

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:23.755 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was a space of absolute
beauty and mystery.

00:20:25.423 --> 00:20:28.159
We were using climbing
to access these caves

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:30.228
and what I love about that is,

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:33.265
back to one of the previous
photographs, it's the hook.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:35.701
Adventure is the hook to get
people involved in science

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.035
and then we can talk about
culture and human migration,

00:20:38.035 --> 00:20:40.004
so when you're telling stories,

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:42.874
you wanna bring these
elements together.

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:46.678
That's sort of what I've
found works best for me,

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:49.947 align:start size:94% position:6%
and effective storytelling
always brings you in.

00:20:49.947 --> 00:20:51.950
It brings you very, very close.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.718
It takes you into the caves.

00:20:53.718 --> 00:20:56.287 align:start size:88% position:13%
It gives you the smells
and the textures.

00:20:56.287 --> 00:21:00.459
It shows you that dry, dry,
that sort of sand everywhere.

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:03.527
But it's interesting, when
I look at these now too,

00:21:03.527 --> 00:21:05.196
I feel like there's a parallel

00:21:05.196 --> 00:21:07.365 align:start size:84% position:16%
with what was
happening in my life.

00:21:07.365 --> 00:21:10.001
I felt like I was standing
at the opening of a cave,

00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.270
looking in, not
wanting to go in,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.308
but just sort of being sucked
in, and not being able to see

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:20.178
and feeling completely
this sense of vertigo.

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.713 align:start size:81% position:19%
I didn't know what
was happening,

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.281 align:start size:81% position:19%
and much like Matt
is doing here,

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.016
I was picking up random pieces

00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:27.518 align:start size:97% position:3%
and trying to fit them
together and figure them out,

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:30.122
but nothing seemed to work.

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.858 align:start position:0%
In this image, Matt is actually
finding a piece of pecha.

00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.626
Pecha is ancient script.

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:37.528
A lot of times, it
looked like this.

00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:39.431
Pick it up, blow the dust off.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, it was tax records
and things like that.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.569 align:start size:84% position:16%
Sometimes, it would
look like this,

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:47.572
and that is an illuminated
folio that predates Buddhism.

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:51.510
This is Bon, so this is
the animistic tradition

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:56.548
of the Tibetan plateau before
the spreading of Buddhism.

00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:59.584
It gives a deeper understanding

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:02.354 align:start size:81% position:19%
of how the culture
there evolved.

00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:07.491
It's really about taking images

00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:11.662
that take tiny little
pieces of the puzzle

00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:13.164
and then put them all together.

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:15.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's what a
visual narrative is,

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:17.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
and some of 'em have to take
bigger leaps than other,

00:22:17.735 --> 00:22:20.638
but it's construction
from the ground up,

00:22:20.638 --> 00:22:22.974
and you have to open yourself up

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:26.844
to seeing things in
a very different way.

00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start size:84% position:16%
After a very long
time, we finally found

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.149
what we were looking for,
which was human remains.

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.750
This is rescue archaeology.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.221 align:start size:88% position:13%
These caves are actually
literally exfoliating

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:38.657 align:start size:84% position:16%
off the side of the
mountain, so we'd go in

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.726 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we'd collect
samples that we could.

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:43.327 align:start size:97% position:3%
What we were really looking
for here were teeth.

00:22:43.327 --> 00:22:46.464
Now, if you think
of this in a way,

00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:50.034 align:start size:88% position:13%
basically, human
remains are like finding

00:22:50.034 --> 00:22:54.038 align:start size:97% position:3%
the corner and the edge pieces
of a jigsaw puzzle, right?

00:22:54.038 --> 00:22:56.708 align:start size:97% position:3%
Once you have that, you start
to piece things together.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.209
The reason teeth are
important is 'cause

00:22:58.209 --> 00:23:01.212
in your tooth enamel, there's
something called strontium.

00:23:01.212 --> 00:23:03.347
It's Sr 38 on the
periodic table,

00:23:03.347 --> 00:23:08.286
and what that has in it is a
geo thumb print, essentially.

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.488 align:start size:81% position:19%
It tells you where
you were born,

00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:13.124
so if you can find
somebody's remains

00:23:13.124 --> 00:23:15.793
and you get their
strontium index

00:23:15.793 --> 00:23:19.063
and they were born someplace
different than where they died

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.499 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you do that with
everybody in the burial crypt,

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:24.935
well, all of a sudden, you're
painting a very real picture

00:23:24.935 --> 00:23:27.571
about human migration and trade,

00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:30.075
and this is the story
of our human family.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.576
This is why this matters.

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.578
We're connecting the pieces,

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.579 align:start size:84% position:16%
and what's so
important about that,

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:37.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I think it's more
important now than ever,

00:23:37.748 --> 00:23:40.318
now, this is ancient history,
but ancient history matters

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:43.721
because it's only through
understanding our past,

00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:47.091
I mean this so much
especially this week,

00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:50.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
only through
understanding our past

00:23:50.628 --> 00:23:53.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
can we hope to
navigate our future.

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:57.535 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we have to pay
attention to this stuff.

00:23:57.535 --> 00:24:00.238
When we look back and we look
at the events that happened,

00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:02.340
how can we predict the
future, and hopefully,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.810
how can we alter it to
go down a better road?

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.379
Because honestly, we
all look up at the sky

00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:11.582
and we think the world's
so big and it's infinite.

00:24:11.582 --> 00:24:13.585
You know what? It's not.

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.154
The sky might be infinite,

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
but the world is very,
very, very finite.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.194
It's extremely finite
and extremely fragile.
