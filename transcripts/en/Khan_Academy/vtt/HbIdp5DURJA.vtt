00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.113
- [Voiceover] We've now seen a couple

00:00:01.113 --> 00:00:03.622
of examples of balancing
chemical equations.

00:00:03.622 --> 00:00:05.909
And we've seen that, okay, if let's say,

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:08.094
we're trying to balance this
equation right over here

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:09.624
and we started with the carbons.

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:12.062
I have two carbons on the reactant side.

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.490
They're both sitting in
this ethylene molecule.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.905
And so I would want two
carbons on the product side.

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.283
And right now, I only have one
carbon on the product side.

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:23.214
And so what we've done
is let's just put a two

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:25.881
out front here and so now we have two

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.168
for every molecule of ethylene

00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:30.873
and we're not done balancing
this chemical equation yet.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:35.538
We're now producing two
molecules of carbon dioxide.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.014
But one thing that you
might have been thinking,

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:38.906
"Why put this big two out front

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.054
"of the entire carbon dioxide,

00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:43.782
"I like the way these little
subscript little twos look,

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:48.203
"so why not put a two right over there. "

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.158
And the reason why you can't do that

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:53.561
is that's actually changing the molecule.

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:54.921
It's no longer carbon dioxide,

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.466
it's now this bizarre thing that

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.401
doesn't really exist in nature.

00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.049
Which is a C2O2 thing.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.664
You're actually changing the reaction

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:04.802
when you're doing that.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:06.459
When you're balancing chemical reactions,

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.671
the reaction itself is,

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.415
even before it's balanced is describing

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:12.550
something that happens.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.547
When it's unbalanced, it just doesn't

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:17.101
have the numbers right in terms

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.703
of number of molecules.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.818
So the only thing that you can

00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:21.585
change when you're changing these

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:23.441
is the number of molecules.

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.867
You can't change the number of

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.680
constituents within the molecule.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.566
And that's why we do not
change these subscripts.

00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:34.336
And if you want to visualize
it a little bit differently,

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:37.665
let's draw each of these molecules

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.366
So ethylene looks like this.

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:42.631
Double bond carbons.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:46.021
Then each carbon is
bonded to two hydrogens.

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:49.562
Notice you have two
carbons and four hydrogens.

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:53.268
Molecular oxygen, O2.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:54.255
Looks like this.

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:56.879
It's oxygen doubled bonded to oxygen.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.337
And then you have carbon dioxide.

00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:06.398
Carbon dioxide is a carbon, double bonded,

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:09.382
to two oxygens each.

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.181
And then finally, you have water.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.470
Finally, water, actually I'm going to do

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.408
this in a slightly different color.

00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:17.802
Your water right over here,

00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:21.222
this is an oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.905
So let me write the plus signs there.

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:26.008
So plus is right over there.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:30.050
So if you were to
somehow write a subscript

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.486
of two right over there, you would somehow

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.483
be changing the structure,
you would be changing

00:02:35.483 --> 00:02:38.024
what this molecule is.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.767
As opposed to that, which
we don't want to do,

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.498
we want to say, we're definitely
producing carbon dioxide.

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:43.538
We're definitely producing carbon dioxide,

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.664
but how many carbon dioxides do we produce

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:49.694
for each molecule of ethylene?

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:51.170
And so that's where we say,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.272
"Okay, we have two carbons here,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.817
"we want two carbons here."

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:55.789
We don't want to change
the actual structure here,

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.925
so let's write the two out front.

00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:00.735
So we're going to have two of these.

00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:01.817
Or if you want to do it,

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:03.699
if you want to have it more visual,

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.240
you could write it,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.118
okay, we're just going to
have another molecule here.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.564
We're just going to have another molecule.

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:11.296
So now we've balanced the carbons,

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:13.316
two carbons on the reactant side.

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:16.345
Two carbons on the product side.

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.206
And then you go to the hydrogens.

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:19.760
Say, "okay, we have four hydrogens here,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.118
"we only have two here."

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.556
Well, what if we had two
of these water molecules?

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:27.095
So, let's draw another
water molecule here.

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:30.104
So O H, and actually let me write

00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:31.984
this right over here, so
now we have two of these.

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:36.060
And now we have two of these.

00:03:36.097 --> 00:03:38.278
And now we want to balance the oxygens.

00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:40.649
So let's see, on this side
we only have two oxygens.

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.986
On this side we have one, two,

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:44.968
three, four, five, six oxygens.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:46.934
In order to balance it, we're going to

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:49.207
have six oxygens on the reactant side.

00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:51.666
We need three of these molecules.

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:57.051
So, another one and another
one right over there.

00:03:57.162 --> 00:03:58.418
And now we're all balanced.

00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:00.403
We have two carbon atoms on both sides.

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.063
Carbons, carbons.

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:05.663
We have four hydrogen atoms on both sides.

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:08.796
Here they're in the ethylene,
here they're in the waters.

00:04:08.927 --> 00:04:12.445
And then we have six
oxygen atoms on both sides.

00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:15.767
And here some of the oxygens
are in the carbon dioxides,

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:17.518
some of them are in the waters.

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:20.026
And here, they're all in
the molecular oxygens.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.165
But notice, we didn't change the

00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:25.045
actual structure of the molecules.

00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:27.923
We just changed the number
of molecules we have and

00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:30.223
that's what these coefficients in front of

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:35.320
these molecular formulas represent.
