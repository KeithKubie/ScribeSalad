00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.040
So this is what I've come up with. We captured all

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.350
the content of the page in the document object model. We

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.110
captured all the styles of the page in the CSS Object

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.470
Model. And then we merged the two and the blender tree?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.800
&gt;&gt; You mean the render tree?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.470
&gt;&gt; Oops. The render tree. Then in the layout step we compared the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.260
position of every element and calculated its.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490
Dimensions against the layout viewport. Once we

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.940
finish that, we handed layout to paint which rendered the pixels

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.100
on the page and with that, we're done. There's the page. Pshoo.
