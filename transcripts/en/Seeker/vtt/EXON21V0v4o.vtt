00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.160
Turns out that "gluten sensitivity" you have
- may be a figment of your imagination.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.270
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - to talk about
one of the most popular trends in the world

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.269
right now - the gluten-free diet!

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.131
Now you've probably seen this video that went
viral a few weeks ago.

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:27.070
It features late night talk show host Jimmy
Kimmel asking a bunch of self-described gluten-free

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:35.540
people on the street, what gluten actually
is - and no one seems to know the answer.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.270
It's a funny video, but it also highlights
the ignorance surrounding the gluten-free

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.270
trend.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.890
Now before we get into this, it should be
noted that celiac disease - which is an autoimmune

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.300
disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten
- is very much real.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.080
No one is trying to deny that.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.680
Science has unequivocally proven it.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.330
But the problem arises, when people who don't
have celiac disease - attribute their problems

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.330
to gluten.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.420
Which is happening more and more, and especially
here in America.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.640
The gluten-free trend has been around for
a while, but it exploded in 2011 - when a

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.649
professor at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne,
Australia - published a study linking gluten

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.999
to gastrointestinal distress in patients without
celiac disease.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.370
Well now, three years later, the same professor
has stepped out again, with an even more rigorous

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.409
study - that appears to debunk his original
findings.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.460
In the second study, they looked at 37 patients
with self-reported gluten sensitivities but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.390
who were confirmed to not have celiac disease.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.710
They provided patients with every single meal
for the duration of the trial - so they could

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240
be sure to eliminate any and all potential
dietary triggers.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.189
First, they fed them a baseline diet, that
was low in FODMAPs - which are short-chain

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.409
carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in
the lower intestine.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.630
They then separated the patients into three
groups - some with high-gluten diets, some

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.520
with low-gluten diets, and some with gluten-free
diets.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
None of the patients knew which diet they
were eating - yet somehow, all of them reported

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.840
a worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms over
the course of the trial.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.479
So, they repeated the study.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.390
And this time, they had patients on either
a high-gluten diet, a gluten-free diet, or

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.110
the baseline diet - which is low in FODMAPs.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.290
And STILL, almost all of the patients continued
to report an increase in symptoms.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.299
This means that gluten couldn't possibly be
the culprit - leading researchers to believe

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.140
that the real cause is psychological.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.950
Patients expected the diets to make them sick,
so they did.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.170
Interestingly, almost all of the subjects
reported an improvement in symptoms when they

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.790
were fed the low-FODMAP diet - making that
a much more likely cause of distress, than

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.790
gluten.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.989
It just so happens that FODMAPs occur mostly
in bread products - which would explain why

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.310
people who eliminate gluten from their diets
- and thus, bread - might see a reduction

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.310
in symptoms.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.269
Either way, this study effectively negates
the existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.700
- and reminds us that the gluten-free trend
that's become so popular the past few years

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.530
- has been primarily driven by consumer and
commercial interests, NOT scientific research.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.849
What do you guys think?

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.110
Is the gluten-free trend dumb?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.870
It's kinda hard to argue with evidence like
this, but I still wanna hear your opinions.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.830
So leave em in the comments below - and as
always, thanks for watching.
