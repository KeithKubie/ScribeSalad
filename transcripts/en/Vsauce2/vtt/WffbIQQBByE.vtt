00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
Vsauce!

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.370
Kevin here.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.149
Let's get into a sleeve fight with Style Feet
Voice Sight.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.070
The poodle haircut was created to help them
retrieve wild game hunted near water.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.020
The bottom half was shaved to improve buoyancy
and let them move freely in water while hair

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.840
on the chest and joints was left untouched
to keep those areas warm.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.380
The shaved face and top knot kept hair out
of the eyes and mouth and later in 18th century

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.730
France the nobility began fashioning poodle
hair into extravagant styles to match their

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.460
own ornate styles.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.989
Dogs do in fact sweat - they just do it through
their feet.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.980
When overheated dogs primarily cool down by
panting which allows moisture on the tongue

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.539
to evaporate and their fur is an insulator
- so most of a dog's sweat glands are around

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.109
its foot pads.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.379
If they leave wet paw prints on the floor
after playing - it's probably sweat.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.250
Dogs know what you're feeling because their
brains process emotion laden sounds similar

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.840
to humans.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.500
Research has shown they respond to how we
say something instead of what we say.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.900
Barking may have evolved from human training
- domesticated dogs have a complex system

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.090
of barks that humans can differentiate while
wild dogs bark infrequently or not at all.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.400
Commonly thought to have monochrome vision
dogs actually do see in color.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.030
Human eyes have three cones that detect color
while dogs only have two - leaving them with

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.560
the ability to distinguish between blue and
yellow but not green and red.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
So a dog rainbow looks like this.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.900
And we're left with Sleeve Fight.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.400
During the Tang Dynasty in Ancient China tiny
pekingese dogs were bred to fit in the sleeves

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.630
of their master's silk robes.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.460
They were used not only for warmth but also
as a hidden last line of defense against intruders.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.150
And as always - thanks for watching.
