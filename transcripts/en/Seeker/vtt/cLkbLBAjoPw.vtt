00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.230
Humans are pretty cocky, we like to think
we have the best features, but some animals

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.790
have specializations we could only DREAM OF.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.680
Howdy animals, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.340
Animals in the wild are subject to evolution's
guiding hand.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340
Animals are more like paintings than photographs.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.290
Next time you're at a portrait gallery, don't
just glance at the faces -- look at the items

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.199
on the tables, the clothing -- it was all
meticulously picked for specific reasons.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.730
Biology follows a similar process with millennia
of natural selection.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.640
For example, research this week confirmed
part of the reason why zebras got their stripes.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.370
Common wisdom would say it's for camouflage,
or that the crazy stripes cause a dazzle effect

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.399
for possible predators, but research published
in Nature Communications is all like, "aww

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.399
hellll nah."

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.469
It's to fight off little fly bites.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.430
African flies are awful.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.170
Species include tsetse flies which can transmit
fatal diseases even to the zebra.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.520
Flies are attracted to dark colors, and the
short hair found on zebra hyde isn't enough

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.130
to keep the fly off their bodies -- but by
studying their visual systems, scientists

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.499
conclude the zebra stripes seem to screw up
the fly's vision!

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.039
If they can't see to come in for a landing,
then the fly will go bite some OTHER animal.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.039
Nice!

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.639
Zebra's aren't the only ones with this less-than-obvious
adaptation.

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.390
What do you think the Lion's mane is for?

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.479
Making it look big and awesome; or to protect
the lion's neck.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.479
Except, nope.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.889
American Scientist published an article in
2005 detailing 30 years of lion study.

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:42.889
Lions manes aren't for intimidation or protection
-- based on ALL the data, manes are for the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:43.889
ladies.

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:49.460
Darker, larger manes indicate a well fed lion,
who is obviously good at hunting, and higher

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.779
levels of testosterone, which is great for
breeding.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.332
These aren't the only ways animals unexpectedly
adapt to their surroundings.

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:59.799
If you're looking at giraffes you probably
figure, oh... those trees are tall, thus...

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.799
long necks?

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.799
Right?

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.799
BUZZZ, wrong again!

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.119
Studying these animals biologists guess the
long neck has nothing to do with the height

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.459
of their preferred food source, because it's
extremely dangerous for a giraffe who needs

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.989
to drink, bending all the way down like that...

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.219
Not to mention, the neck is horrible for the
giraffe's heart -- it has to work REALLY HARD

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:23.060
to pump blood all the way up there!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.319
Giraffe's long necks are to compete for mates,
ever seen a giraffe fighting another giraffe?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.959
They whip their thick-skulled, horned heads
at other males trying to fight for the right

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.959
to party!

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.959
It's crazy.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.459
Physics tells us this makes their head accelerate
dramatically in comparison to the movement

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.069
required at the base of the neck.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.569
Scientists are still studying the giraffe,
but Uppsala University found the necks and

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.269
skulls of males to be longer and heavier than
females -- which would support the neck for

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.269
sex theory.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.470
I guess we'll have to put our NECK on the
line and really, REACH for more study!

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.969
Know of any other unexpected adaptations?

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.470
Not like, stripes for camouflage, we're looking
for stuff that's not obvious at all!

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.650
Tell us down below or come to GooglePlus,
Twitter or Facebook we're DNews, and we're

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.650
easy to find.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.680
Thanks for watching!
