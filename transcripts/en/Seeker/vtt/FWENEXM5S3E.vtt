00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.890
Graphene is heralded as a wonder-material
that could completely change our world.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.289
Its incredibly flexible, strong and conductive
carbon structure promises to revolutionize

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.329
energy storage, computing, and technology
as we know it.

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.470
But graphene isn’t the only nanocarbon out
there with promising applications.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.960
There’s one in particular that’s been
capturing scientists’ attention for decades,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.720
and it has the potential to be even more game-changing
than our fan favorite graphene.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.170
The only thing is, no one’s actually figured
out how to make it... until now.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.820
Currently, scientists know how to create two
kinds of nanocarbons; those with positive

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.200
curvature, like nanotubes and buckyballs,
and those with zero curvature, like graphene.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.190
But scientists have theorized that a third
group should exist-- nanocarbons with negative

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.180
curvature, also known as Schwarzites.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.310
We’ve made them before on a much larger
scale out of polymers and have found them

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.970
to be remarkably light and strong.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.470
Swap these polymers for sheets of carbon molecules,
and in theory, you have a schwarzite, a 3D

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.320
version of graphene.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.220
Its negative curvature creates a structure
with an optimized balance of surface area

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.990
and interior volume.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.020
And that’s the clincher, because then you’d
then have the conductivity of graphene arranged

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.150
elegantly in 3 dimensions, in a way that can
store an enormous amount of electrical charge.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.690
See, since batteries and supercapacitors require
3-dimensional electrodes to store energy,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.730
scientists have had to force 2d graphene into
3d structures to make it useful in those applications.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.010
But, schwarzites solve that problem altogether
because they’re already 3D.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.310
This could lead to supercapacitors that charge
your phone in seconds and batteries that can

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.790
store more energy and that have longer lifetimes.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.130
But... all of this rests on scientists being
able to actually make carbon schwarzites.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.860
Aaand… that’s proven difficult.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.900
But we haven’t given up, and after decades
of searching, new international research led

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.240
by a team at UC Berkeley has finally cracked
the code.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.729
To make their schwarzites, the team used materials
called zeolites, which are porous minerals

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.020
commonly used in laundry detergent.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.850
The researchers injected a vapor of carbon
molecules into the pores of these zeolite

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.189
structures, and watched as the carbon arranged
itself in sheets along the insides of the

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.189
pores.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.069
Then, all they had to do was dissolve the
zeolite away and voila!

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.010
A bonafide schwarzite.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.260
So boom we did it!

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.930
Time to go make supercapacitors and batteries
out of this ish, right?

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.980
Well, not exactly.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.959
This newest research was done on a computer,
as a simulation.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.829
And while it proves this process could work,
scientists will still need to experiment to

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.680
find the best conditions to actually make
it in the lab.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.120
Then, once they do that, they still need to
find a method that’s cost effective before

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.799
we see it in any commercial applications.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.999
But don’t get too depressed, as the author
of the paper pointed out, “that’s the

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.939
same story that was given for graphene 10
years ago,” and since then, the cost has

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.970
come way down, and graphene is starting to
make its way onto the commercial stage.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.549
So, as for our schwarzite fantasies, maybe
it’s only a matter of time.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.739
One last thing, Schwarzites are named after
19th century German scientist, Hermann Schwarz,

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.989
who studied the negative curvature in soap
bubbles, you know, because that’s what I’d

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:02.989
like to spend my days doing.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.909
