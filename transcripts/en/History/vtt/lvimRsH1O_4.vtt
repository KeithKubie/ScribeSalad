00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.632
NARRATOR: In April of 2014,
ancient astronaut theorist

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:11.302
Giorgio Tsoukalos traveled
to Walker Air Force Base

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:15.682
in Roswell, New Mexico to meet
with the city's mayor, Del

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.185
Jurney, and to get a
rare look at the hangar

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.480
where the Roswell wreckage
and extraterrestrial bodies

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.232
were allegedly first taken.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.657
Wow!

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:33.742
This is huge.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.077
So what do you think?

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.912
Man, I have
goosebumps right now.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.414
I mean, we're
walking on history.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.124
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.418
Are you familiar where the
spot is, what it actually--

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.628
Well, the
information that I have

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.839
says that it was probably
right over here in the corner.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.508
They took them over there, did
an examination of the bodies.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.721
So this is where it was.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.014
This is it, yeah.
Come on in.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.562
They had the debris out
here in the hangar area,

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:07.025
and they bring the
bodies inside this room.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.359
I really don't
know what to say.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.862
Because if this was
it, you're standing

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:15.450
where extraterrestrial
beings might have been.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.580
Where did the debris go?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.081
Where did it end up?

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.250
Well, it ended up with
the government, of course.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.668
My understanding
is that they took

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.338
the bodies to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.424
Certainly probably took the
debris as well and have it

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.761
well-preserved in a military
installation someplace.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.141
NARRATOR: Roswell
researchers suggest

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.894
a government-sanctioned
bond of secrecy

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.939
has prevented witnesses
of the crash and retrieval

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.900
from coming forward publicly.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.612
But many did choose to
come forward later in life,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.073
including the first
military officer

00:01:55.073 --> 00:02:00.411
to arrive at the Roswell crash
site, Major Jesse Marcel.

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:03.206
According to his
grandson, Marcel

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.877
privately shared many details of
his experience with the family.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.337
JESSE MARCEL: My
grandfather, Major Jesse

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.755
Marcel, he was head
of intelligence

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.507
for the 509th bombing group.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.260
As a kid, basically,
around the dinner table,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.011
we talked about Roswell.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.558
And through conversations, we
learned that my grandfather was

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.977
the lead investigator
into what has become

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.979
known as the Roswell incident.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.522
And when he was
looking at the debris,

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.315
he couldn't make heads
or tails or any sense

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.733
out of what he was looking at.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.735
He had gathered
some of the debris

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.612
and decided to take
it home with him.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.906
He came to this idea that--
he said, whatever this stuff

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.491
is, it's very significant.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.951
It's going to change humanity.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.328
And I want my family
to be part of it.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.039
This is very important.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.208
NARRATOR: According
to the family's story,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:51.170
Major Marcel came home after
his first visit to the site

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.674
and laid the debris out on
the floor of their kitchen.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.802
Some of the material was
a strange, thin metal

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:02.056
similar to foil, except when
crumpled up into a ball,

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:06.519
it would bounce back
to its flawless state.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.815
Marcel also claims the metal
was not the same material

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.775
featured in
newspaper photographs

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.111
being held by his grandfather.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.863
There's a pretty
famous picture

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.073
of him holding a piece of debris
which is just a piece of foil,

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.325
basically.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.826
And it was weather
balloon material.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.078
He begrudgingly went along
with the story, held it.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.372
And if you take a look at
that, you'll notice that he's

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.832
not looking at the camera.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:31.294
He's looking up at somebody
barking him orders.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.295
He fell in line begrudgingly and
did what he was supposed to do.
