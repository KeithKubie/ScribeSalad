00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
We found a new pattern in the primes! One
that we didn't know was there.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.320
Primes don't like to repeat their last digits.
It's really, really strange. A prime could end with a one,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.660
three, a seven, or a nine. I mean the exceptions are two
itself, which obviously end in a two and five itself.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.860
But apart from that, they end with a one, a three, a seven, or a nine, right.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.939
And because we hope that primes are random, or they feel like they kind of appear randomly, that each one of those

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.320
should be equally likely and something
strange has happened, so some mathematicians

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.100
in Stanford have looked at this and they've
looked at consecutive primes and they've

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.800
noticed things like if a prime ends in
a nine, it's actually more likely to,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.320
for the next prime to end in a one, rather than a nine or a three or a seven.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.380
So you would expect all of those to equally likely
to turn up next

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.560
but when they did it and they looked at the
first hundred million primes and when

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.770
they did that, if you had a prime ending in
a nine the chance the next prime ended in a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.340
nine was eighteen percent, which is not a
quarter, and the chance that ended in a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.300
one was greater than a quarter, it was thirty-two percent. It shouldn't be! That shouldn't be how it is, but that's what they found out.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.400
Let's find out why this is. So
if the primes are random, then these prime

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.259
endings here: one, three, seven, and nine, they should each appear about a quarter of the time, and

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.099
if we had the consecutive primes and we look at
their prime endings

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.829
we would have sixteen options: You have a one and a one, so that would be a prime ending in a one followed

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:58.490
by a prime ending in a one. Or it could be a one followed by a three, a one followed by seven, a one followed by nine

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.390
These are the options.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.590
Ok, there are sixteen options when you're
looking at two consecutive primes so if

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.710
it was random they should all appear
one-sixteenth of the time equally likely of the time.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.650
That's not they've found at all.  In particular, these diagonal entries here - so the one, one; three, three;

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:25.000
seven, seven; nine, nine - are least likely to turn up. So, the primes aren't
repeating themselves and there's a few

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.960
explanations for why this could be the
case which I'm going to dismiss. I'm going to give you a few explanations which aren't the reason why this is happening.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.950
So one might be: "Okay if you have a
prime ending with a nine, then well you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.489
have to go through all the other numbers
before you get to another prime ending with a nine."

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.980
Or, you have to go through the numbers
that end with a one, and a three, and a seven before you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.340
get to another number ending with a nine, so. [Brady Haran] It's further away!  [James Grime] It's further away, right.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.660
And unfortunately, that isn't enough to explain the bias that we found. if that's the case then we're
looking for prime gaps less than ten.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.030
Right? That means you have the next one in less than ten so you're going for a prime ending in a one next, or the prime ending with a three next.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.450
and prime gaps less than ten are not that many and so that's not enough to explain how biased

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.130
this is. The bias is bigger than that, so
that's no good.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.160
Another explanation might be: I
said that these prime endings one, three, seven and nine

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.300
if this was a random thing they should be
appearing a quarter of the time each.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.640
Maybe the explanation is that that's not a true thing maybe the bias comes from the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.410
primes themselves and that doesn't work
out either there is a slight bias in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.780
the primes and it's something we know
about. It's called Chebyshev's bias.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.450
It says that primes ending in three and
seven are slightly more likely.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.190
That is something we know about, we know why
that happens, and it's such a slight thing.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.090
It is not enough. So there is this known
bias in prime number endings,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.660
so under that assumption, the pair three-three and seven-seven

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.220
should turn up more often, right? And the complete opposite is true. In fact, three-three and seven-seven

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.850
are the least likely that are turning up.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.270
which is the exact opposite of what it
should be, and nine-one are actually the most common pair!

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.920
which is not what it should be at all.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.260
Ok, maybe, oh maybe it's just a base 10
thing, you know. Base ten, you know, who cares about base ten, right?

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.940
If it was a fundamental property
of primes, it would happen in any base.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.970
And it does. That's what they found. So they checked it in other bases and they

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.330
found the bias is still there, so it
appears to be a fundamental property of

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.030
the primes. For example, if we do it in
base three. It will only end with a one or two

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.370
unless it's three itself, right, we can ignore that one. You got two endings they should turn

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.760
about fifty percent of the time each, which is about
right, again Chebyshev's bias

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.380
says just a little, slight bias toward the two, but its tiny. 
It's pretty much fifty-fifty, it's pretty much

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.100
a coin toss. In fact that's what inspired
this investigation, and the guys who

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.600
did this investigation were thinking
about coin tosses and said "Well primes

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.220
in base three are like a coin toss. Let's see if that's the same thing because that's a random event."

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.320
And then they found this completely different thing, this skew that primes don't like to repeat themselves.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.940
And that's not something that would happen in coin tosses.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.540
So if we did it in base three, we would have four prime endings, wouldn't we?

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.960
We would have one-one, one-two, two-one, and two-two. And again they
found the same thing.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.740
These ones with the repetition are the least likely to
occur. They looked at the first million primes.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.180
And if you look at first million primes, then
they should all be equally likely to turn up a quarter of the time:

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.800
Two-hundred and fifty thousand.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.420
But no, they didn't get that, so these
ones, with the repetition, were less than

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.420
two hundred and fifty thousand. The ones without a repetition were more than two hundred and fifty thousand.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.360
So the mathematicians who have been investigating this have tried to come up with an explanation for this.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.380
And their explanation relies on a
conjecture that goes back a hundred years.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.000
It's a conjecture by Hardy and Littlewood and they had a conjecture about the density of primes:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.540
how many primes you can find in patterns. So you can consider all kinds of patterns

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:50.400
Like twin primes, that's a pattern, or cousin primes, which have gaps or four, or sexy primes, who have gaps of 6.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.520
So they had this conjecture about how many of these
you should find, and the conjecture has not been proven

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.530
There's a lot of evidence that supports
that it's true, so if you look at the

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.890
numerical evidence, it appears to be true but it hasn't been proven.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.620
So the mathematicians looking at this pattern used a modified version of that conjecture and they came

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.930
up with a formula that they think might
explain this idea.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.300
So that formula was the proportion of this pattern - let's say you've got prime endings a and b, so if we're

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.110
doing it in base ten, this could be one-one or three-seven, or nine-one.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.370
So we're looking at the proportion of these endings and they come up with a formula. The formula was:

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:43.830
one over the number of allowed endings,  so this is like one sixteenth from what I've been doing in base ten

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.620
right? So when it's equally likely, these are the allowed endings there. Sixteen of them.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.660
So the proportion is one over the
allowed endings multiplied by a thing.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:04.860
Right, and what is this thing? That thing depends on if that pattern repeats, if you've got a equals b in that formula.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.800
If a equals b, that will affect what that
thing is. I'll show you what it looks like in base three.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.380
It's kind of ok in base three.  We're looking at proportions of these endings.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:23.540
If they're the same like this: a, a. So that would, in base three, the one-one endings and the two-two endings.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.320
The proportion is. If you are doing it when they're not equal,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:36.660
so if it was the one-two endings or the two-one, the proportion of a b, and I'm saying a is not the same as b

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:46.300
Plus. So this formula they've got is still a conjectured formula because it is based on this Hardy-Littlewood formula which is still a conjectured formula.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:54.080
But it fits the evidence. Once we start going off to infinity, this bias becomes less and less important.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.940
This is a bias that is hanging around so in the great infinity of numbers, this bias is evening out,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.200
but even up to a trillion there is still a noticeable bias there.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.520
