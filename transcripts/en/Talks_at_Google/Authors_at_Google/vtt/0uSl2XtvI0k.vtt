[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.720
JONNY CRANMER: Hi
everybody, and welcome

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.730
to this Talks at Google.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.250
I am very excited to been
introducing two very cool guys

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.500
this morning that I've had
the pleasure to talking to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.317
in the past.

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:20.400
And I will introduce them.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
My name is Johnny Cramner and
I work in the Google LA office.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.860
And it's my pleasure to
be talking with you guys

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.310
this morning.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.540
So Joshua Fields Millburn
and Ryan Nicodemus,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.070
better known as the minimalists,
help over 20 million people

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.530
live meaningful lives with less.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.640
They have a website,
podcasts, best selling books,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.597
a documentary on Netflix,
which is actually awesome,

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:44.680
if you haven't watched it.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.370
So I encourage you to see that.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.850
And I need my
notes for this one.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.870
You have also been featured on
"The New York Times," "The Wall

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220
Street Journal," "Forbes,"
"Time," ABC, NBC, BBC,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.020
CBC, NPR--

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:00.342
RYAN NICODEMUS: Minimalism.

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:01.650
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.170
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
E-F-G-H, H-I-J-K--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.667
RYAN NICODEMUS: I had no idea
we'd been in all those places.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.750
JONNY CRANMER: And now,
now we have you at Google.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.350
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.330
Thanks for being here, you all.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.830
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Thank you very much.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330
JONNY CRANMER: So
in true style, we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.290
want to keep this very
discussional, questions

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.850
and answers.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.350
To the audience, we're going
to reserve some time at the end

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.370
where we're going to
invite you guys to ask them

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.622
some questions live.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.080
But maybe you guys
should just like

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.889
elaborate on the
introduction, tell

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.680
us a bit more about
yourselves, and then we

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.720
can get in to some questions.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.136
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
Sure, we can just

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:39.790
talk about where we-- where
this whole thing started.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.465
We're both 35 years old now,
but about seven years ago,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.930
eight years ago,
somewhere in there, we

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.320
were kind of living the
American dream, right.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280
We both grew up poor
in Dayton, Ohio.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.720
I was on food stamps and
government assistance,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
and I thought the reason that
we were so unhappy growing up

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.840
is because we don't
have any money.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.920
And so, when I turned 18, and
I know Ryan did the same thing,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.479
I went out and got an
entry level corporate job.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.970
And I spent the next decade just
climbing the corporate ladder.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.320
And by age 28, I had achieved
everything I ever wanted,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.610
the sixth figure
salary, the luxury cars,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.190
closets full of
expensive clothes,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.810
and the big house in the suburbs
with more toilets than people.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.390
I really had all the
stuff to fill every corner

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
of my consumer driven life.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.080
And then two things
happened to me.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.600
My mom died and my marriage
ended, both in the same month.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.345
And it's going to getting in two
car crashes at the same moment.

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:49.470
Like someone side swipes
you and all of the sudden,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.580
another car hits you because
of it, right at the same time.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.610
And those two events
sort of forced

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.560
me to look around and
start to question what

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.680
had become my life's focus.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.920
And then I realized
I was so focused

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.360
on success and
achievement, and especially

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.020
like on the
accumulation of stuff.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.050
Because in our
culture, quite often,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.330
that's one of the-- the
sort of trophies of success,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.550
how many things can
I amass in my life.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.600
And I might have been
living the American dream,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.220
but it wasn't my dream.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.850
And sort of, in
a weird way, took

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.440
getting everything
I thought I wanted

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.820
to realize maybe everything
I ever wanted wasn't actually

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.540
what I wanted at all.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.959
And I started refocusing.

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.000
And I discover this thing
called minimalism right

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.420
around that time.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.650
And it was an opportunity
for me to say,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.050
you know what, some of
the things in my life

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.130
are probably important to me.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.210
I'm not against stuff.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.200
I'm not against consumption now.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.610
But at the time, I
couldn't discern really

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.920
what things add
value to my life,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.060
and what things were just
sort of in the way, what

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.660
was essential, what
was nonessential.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.280
Did you all know that the
average American household has

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.700
more than 300,000 items in it--

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.840
300,000.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.830
So it's not me going
around county people stuff.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.080
The "LA Times"
reported back in 2014.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.710
So it might be more
threat 300,000 now,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.980
if we're continuing
to amass more.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.936
But I look at that--

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:22.829
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.620
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Do
they count every spoon?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.550
Yeah, I guess you would
count every spoon.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.050
But that's the weird
thing, when you

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.674
start thinking about
minimalism though,

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:33.650
you start thinking about
like just having no things.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.230
And for me, that wasn't it.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.100
When I first
discovered minimalism,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.970
I discovered a guy
named Colin Wright.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.520
You saw the documentary,
and he's in the documentary,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.110
it's called "Minimalism."

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.470
And he owns 52 items.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.535
And everything he owns
fits in his backpack.

00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.410
And that actually worked
really well for him,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.659
because he's a world traveler.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.580
Everywhere he-- he travels
to a new country every month.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.850
Everything he owns sort
of fits in that backpack.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.300
And for him, owning
a kitchen table

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.960
is a liability because it
won't fit in the overhead bin.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.418
But I looked at
that, and I'm like,

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.870
you know what, I kind of
like owning a kitchen table.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.560
I kind of like having
a refrigerator.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.130
But that didn't work for him.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.590
But then I found other
minimalists as well,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.570
people like Leo an Eva Babelto.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.820
They live up in San Francisco.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.090
They have six kids.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.270
It's like a whole
minimalist family, right?

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.840
So it's like well, I don't
what to live like Colin.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.760
I also don't want six kids.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.510
But maybe there's a
comfortable middle.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.400
And I realized that this
thing called minimalism,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.390
there are different
flavors of it.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.397
And if I wanted to
simplify my life,

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.730
I would have to figure out
what would work right for me,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.319
what is essential for my life.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.860
It's not like there's
a list of well,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.985
here are the 100 items you
should own in your life,

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:40.560
and then you're
going to be happy.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.143
I wish we had that list, because
I could just hand that to you

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:45.121
and leave, and it'd
be a lot easier.

00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:47.370
But the truth is, the things
that add value to my life

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.900
may or may not add
value to yours.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.210
And so I've spent the
last six, seven years

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.750
now really focused on the
things that augment my life,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.810
as opposed to the
things that I'm just

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.620
supposed to have
because we're were

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.720
sold this meme or this template
of living the American dream.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.420
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah,
that's very powerful.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.160
And I guess the
first question I want

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.970
to ask you is going down the
journey for both of you, how--

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.640
well, let me phrase
it this way, what

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.764
was the easiest thing when you
started adopting minimalism

00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:21.180
into your life, and then what
was the most difficult thing

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.070
that you encountered
trying to simplify

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.007
the stuff, the people, and the
environment around you guys?

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:29.590
RYAN NICODEMUS: My
whole journey began

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.100
with what Josh and I call a
packing party, where Josh first

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.574
had introduced the term
minimalism to me months

00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:38.740
after he had been kind of
been simplifying his life.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.950
And he told me about
what he'd been doing.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.390
And I was like that sounds
like some common sense stuff.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.160
Like, oh, yeah, if I don't buy
a brand new car every two years,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.610
if I don't have this huge three
bedroom, two bathroom, 2,000

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.930
square foot home,
two living rooms.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.920
Like, I have no
idea why I thought

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.970
I would ever need two living
rooms as a single guy.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.450
But you know, I kind of the
saw how minimalism made sense.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.600
Again, if I could pare down,
I could reclaim my time.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.930
Maybe I wouldn't have to
work the 60, 70, sometimes 80

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.880
hours a week that I was putting
in to maintain this lifestyle.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.870
So you know, I'm
at lunch with Josh,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.430
and he's explaining this to me.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.000
And I look up at him,
and I'm like this

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.430
sounds pretty awesome.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.590
Like, OK, I want
to be a minimalist.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.820
I'm in.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.230
Now what?

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.810
I didn't really
know where to start.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.455
And I don't want to spend
several months simplifying

00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:31.002
like Josh.

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:31.960
That was great for him.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.910
He's always been a little
bit more patient than me.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.950
But I needed faster results.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.580
So we came up with this idea
to pack all my belongings

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.000
as if I were moving.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.700
And then I would unpack only the
items I needed over the next 21

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.760
days, to really get an
idea of what I was using

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.872
and what was adding value.

00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:51.330
So Josh came over
to literally help

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.990
me box up everything, my
clothes, kitchenware, towels,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.600
TVs, furniture.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.270
I mean, literally
everything we packed up.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.120
And you can imagine
that first night.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.120
I unpacked my toothbrush
and some toiletries,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.200
and some clothes for work the
next day, bed and bed sheets.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.350
And as time went on, I just
was unpacking less and less.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:15.460
So after three weeks, I'm
standing in my second living

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.340
room looking at these boxes,
just like stacked halfway

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.270
to my 12 foot ceiling,
but still had about 80%

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.130
of my stuff sitting there.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.297
And that for me was like, that
was the first huge light bulb

00:08:28.297 --> 00:08:28.880
moment for me.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.080
Like, here are all
these things I brought

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.990
into my life to make me happy.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.610
And hardly any of
it is doing its job.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.020
So I decided to donate
and sell all of it.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.539
Now there's a couple exceptions.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.659
Like, I'm a snowboarder.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.390
I hung on to some winter items.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.157
I hung on to my snowboard
that maybe I hadn't

00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:48.240
used in those three weeks.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.630
But for all intents
and purposes,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.140
I donated and sold everything.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.760
And I'll tell you, it was easy
for me when it came to close.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.140
Like, you go to that--

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.550
I would go to that
drawer or box that

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.134
had 20 yardworking or
painting T-shirts, like--

00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:07.050
and I'm not an artist.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.270
I mean, painting like, painting
the living room or something.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.500
And I'm like looking
at myself like, wow,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.800
like here are all these shirts
I've amassed over my life,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.820
whether it was some
kind of corporate event,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.236
they're handing
out free T-shirts,

00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:24.110
or I'm at a baseball game and
I catch a T-shirt that shot out

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.540
of a cannon.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.650
I had all the T-shirts
that I never wore,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.710
but I had them because I
wanted to hold on to them, just

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.296
in case.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:33.920
JONNY CRANMER: Sounds
like something we

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.690
do at Google a lot.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.470
A lot of free
T-shirts given out.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.720
RYAN NICODEMUS: So yeah,
that was probably the easiest

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.660
stuff to get rid of.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.120
But I'll tell you, some
stuff I didn't realize

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.860
would be so hard.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.450
Like I remember, Josh came
over after the three weeks,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.420
and he's helping me
separate these things

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.900
into different piles.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.360
And I remember watching him
take this like box of mugs,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.860
in he's putting it
in the donation pile.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.930
I'm like what are you
doing, man, I drink coffee.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.120
Why are you getting
rid of all those mugs.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.506
And he opens up it up, and
he's like, dude, there's

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:05.220
like 30 coffee mugs in here.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.270
How many cups of
coffee can you drink?

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.320
And I'm like, well, you
know, I have guests over,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.430
and what if 25 of those break.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.620
Like, what-- I'm not going
to have those backups.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.530
And he pulls out a mug and
it says world's number one

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.730
granddad on it or something.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.753
Like, I have no idea,
probably bought it

00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:24.710
for a dollar somewhere, thinking
it was funny, never used it.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.970
And I'm like, yeah,
you're right, I have not--

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.387
I have not used that in
years, and I'm probably

00:10:29.387 --> 00:10:31.470
not going to use that in
the next couple of years.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.490
But it was just kind of
amazing that the coffee mugs

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.245
was like the first
thing that I was like,

00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:41.399
whoa, can't rid of my
coffee mugs, I drink coffee.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.190
But then certainly
going into other things,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.150
like sentimental items.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.810
That was really,
really difficult.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.030
I remember I was kind of
going through some stuff.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.225
Josh had left.

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:51.637
And I came across this shoebox.

00:10:51.637 --> 00:10:52.970
It was like all my high school--

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.750
you know, my high school
memories were in this box.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.120
And I open it up and there's
some letters that my mom had

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.550
written me in high school,
and a pictures of me

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.690
in my junior prom and
senior prom dates.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.210
The shot glass they
gave us as the prom gift

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.840
at the high school.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.709
I have no idea what
they were thinking.

00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:16.250
But I came across
all these memories,

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.730
and I was like, well,
you're a minimalist now,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.580
you can't hold on to this.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.770
You got to get rid of it.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.200
And I'm like walking to the
trashcan, and I'm like, no,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.040
I can't.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.850
I'm just going to
put this one off.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.820
I'm going to wait
and was starting

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.990
to bargain with myself.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.140
And eventually,
what I kind of did

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.280
is I was like I'm going
to choose one thing out

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.270
of this box, and I'm
going to get rid of it

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.970
and just see how I
feel in the morning.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.300
So I picked out a
letter that my mom

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.950
had written me in high school.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.500
Just to kind of preface it
a little bit, of my parents

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.166
got divorced when I
was seven years old.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.550
My mom had a lot of drug
and alcohol problems.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.860
And she would just write
me some letters that

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.430
were really encouraging
during high school, and just

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.680
some intimate moments
that her and I shared.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.750
And at the end of the day, I
picked one of those letters,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.680
and before I even
read it, I sort of

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.520
like started getting
this emotion,

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.460
this emotion was being invoked.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.570
And I read the letter, and after
I got done reading the letter,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.320
it gave me a completely
different feeling.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.986
It was so weird.

00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:17.160
Like the thought of
the letter gave me

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.400
a different feeling than
actually reading the letter.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.700
So I laid it on the table,
I took my camera phone,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.957
and I took a picture of
it, zoomed in and made

00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:26.540
sure I could still
read it if I really

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.830
wanted to go back and read it.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.371
And I threw it away
in the trash can.

00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:31.260
I didn't even realize
it was in the trash can

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.810
until like the
next night or even

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.380
the night after that when I
went to go take out the trash

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.755
and there it was,
sitting on top.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.780
And I'm like, oh,
yeah, that letter.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.680
It wasn't that
hard to let go of.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.756
So I did the same thing with
a few other items in the box,

00:12:43.756 --> 00:12:45.380
just took some pictures
of it, and then

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.680
ended up just tossing it.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.560
And I haven't missed it since.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.102
I'm sure-- I had someone tweet
me the other day, because we

00:12:53.102 --> 00:12:55.310
were talking about this on
the podcast the other day.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.726
And someone tweeted
me and they're

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:59.540
like someone asked me for my
prom photo of high school,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.480
and like I threw it away,
I wish I had had it.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.430
And I'm like, , OK I don't
think everyone should hang

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.180
on to every single
picture they ever have.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.990
JOSHUA MILLBURN: I think it's--

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.180
the weird thing is, the reason
we have a lot of those 300,000

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.320
items, whatever it might be is,
is those three words that Ryan

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.100
mentioned, just in case.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.090
Like we go to get rid of
something, and you're like,

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.560
I should hold on to
this just in case

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.580
I need it someday in some
nonexistent hypothetical

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.150
future.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.080
And so we amass
these sort of hoards,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.750
and when the first
junk drawer fills up,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.160
we allocate a
second junk drawer.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.230
And that one fills up,
we would find the cabinet

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.670
or cupboard or something.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.650
And we need more and more space.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.187
And so we don't give
ourselves permission

00:13:46.187 --> 00:13:47.270
to let go of these things.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.260
And I found that I was
holding on to so many things

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.150
just in case, weather it
was a sentimental item,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.400
and I didn't have a plan
to do anything with it.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.340
I was sort of a well
organized hoarder.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.050
I wasn't a candidate for
the TV show, "Hoarders."

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.990
There were no dead cats
in my freezer or anything.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.840
But I owned a lot of stuff.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.470
So I had an ordinal system of
bins and boxes in my basement.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.480
And I used to weigh 80
pounds more than I weigh now.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.870
And so I had a lot of
like double XL shirts.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.530
That was my plan, in case--

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.220
just in case I gained
80 pounds back,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.950
I'll have these out of date
clothes to wear some day.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.700
And when you start
saying things out loud,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.033
you realize how ridiculous
many of the things that we're

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.170
holding on to are.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.227
But I just want to be
clear, don't get me wrong,

00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:38.560
there are some things that
add immense value to my life.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.476
In fact, it's the weird
paradox of minimalism.

00:14:40.476 --> 00:14:42.270
I get far more
value from the items

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.260
that I have now then if
they were watered down

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.210
by hundreds of
thousands of items.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.100
I think if you walk into my
home today, you don't walk in,

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.030
and say, oh, my god,
this guy's a minimalist.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.710
You probably just say,
wow, they're tidy.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.540
And it's because I don't
own a lot of stuff.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.880
But everything I own
now, it serves a purpose,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.244
or it brings me joy.

00:15:03.244 --> 00:15:04.660
Everything else
is out of the way.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.200
RYAN NICODEMUS: You
know, it's funny,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.600
we were on-- we were doing a
live cast a couple months ago,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.934
and I don't know what platform
we were on, but someone--

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:12.308
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
Google Hangouts.

00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:14.076
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yes,
I think that's what

00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:16.620
it was, actually, yes.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.120
And someone in the
comments section,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.780
they were like, you know, it
sounds like, I don't know what

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.113
the big deal is, guys, it
doesn't sound like you gave up

00:15:23.113 --> 00:15:24.310
anything that was important.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.302
And Josh was like,
that's exactly it.

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.010
We didn't give up
anything that's import.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.470
Everything we have in our lives
right now, it is important.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.595
And I think that's when
minimalism is really about.

00:15:33.595 --> 00:15:36.150
It's about determining what
is important in one's life.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.939
And that is different
for everyone.

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:40.230
JONNY CRANMER: So I wanted
to dig a bit deeper on that,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.109
because it's a fascinating
journey that you've

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:43.650
gone through.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.790
And I think there's two
things I'm hearing here.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.030
It's like a physical
let go of possessions

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.920
and a de-cluttering.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.020
And then there's a
psychological benefit.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.470
But they both kind of work
in tandem with each other.

00:15:58.355 --> 00:16:00.730
How did you feel when you both
went through this process?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.160
What were the
outcomes, and what made

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.770
you want to continue doing it?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.530
Because obviously,
the effects were good,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.540
whether it was like
mental, you felt better,

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.530
productivity went up.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.240
So give us some
of those examples

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.800
of why you loved it so much.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.000
JOSHUA MILLBURN: I think
the material possessions

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.277
are our physical manifestation
of what's going on inside.

00:16:20.277 --> 00:16:21.360
At least they were for me.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.280
Like, so I had all of
this external clutter.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.467
It was really a result of
a lot of internal clutter.

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:29.550
You can call it mental
clutter, emotional clutter,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.720
spiritual clutter,
financial clutter, whatever

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.780
that internal clutter is.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.080
It started with the stuff.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.200
But I also think that
minimalism isn't just

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.570
about getting rid of
your stuff either.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.710
I think anyone in here
today, tonight you

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.610
could just go home,
and rent a dumpster,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.471
and throw all your crap in
it and be utterly miserable.

00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:50.970
You just come home
to an empty house

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.190
and sulk after removing
all your pacifiers.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:59.580
And that's because the
consumption isn't the problem.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.440
Compulsory consumption
is the problem.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.860
I feel like I must do this.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.880
I have to accumulate
more, more, more, more.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.969
And so, once I started dealing
with what was going on outside,

00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:10.760
I was able to look
inward and start dealing

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.367
with what was going on inside.

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:14.450
And figured out, you know
what-- it started for me

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.730
with the finances.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.290
Because I made really good
money in the corporate world.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.676
A couple hundred thousand
dollars in Dayton, Ohio is--

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.300
I mean, King of the
Hill kind of thing.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.260
I know that's probably
not impressive here.

00:17:30.604 --> 00:17:32.270
Ryan, this is what
it feels like to have

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.750
the lowest IQ in a room.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.720
RYAN NICODEMUS: And
also stupid enough.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Also the
smallest bank account.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.540
But I realized that I started
because of the financial thing.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.009
I made good money but
spent even better money.

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:51.550
And so I had massive
amounts of debt.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.633
Sixty years worth of debt,
half a million dollars,

00:17:53.633 --> 00:17:55.250
if you count my mortgage.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.460
And so I'm like, if I regain
control of my expenses,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.060
then I won't have
this burden on me,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.310
I won't have this huge anchor,
and I won't necessarily

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.950
be tethered to this career,
that I'm starting to figure out

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.440
doesn't aline with my values.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.050
But from there, I uncovered
all these other benefits,

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.382
whether it was my health
or my relationships.

00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:13.840
I think many of
our relationships--

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.125
we were talking about this when
we had lunch a couple months

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:16.810
ago--

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.990
a lot of our relationships,
especially growing up,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.164
they're birthed out of
proximity and convenience.

00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:25.830
And so we live in the
same neighborhood,

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.760
we work in the same office, or
we went to the same high school

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.290
together, whatever it may be.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.581
And there's nothing inherently
wrong with those people.

00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:36.570
But it also might mean that
we don't share similar values.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.600
And I found in my
life, in particular,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.920
I was spending 90% of
the time, of my time,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.680
with people who didn't
share the same values as me.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.747
They were good people.

00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:47.330
They just didn't
have the same values.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.420
And I forsook the most important
relationships in my life.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.930
It's the reason
my marriage ended.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.360
It's the reason I became distant
from a lot of my other friends,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.134
is because I was so
focused on networking,

00:18:58.134 --> 00:18:59.550
and spending time
with executives,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.720
and stuff like that.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.626
And so, by dealing
with that stuff first,

00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:05.500
I was able to identify
what the benefits were

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.590
for me, whether it was finances,
or health, or relationships,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.490
or contributing to my community.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.449
And it was a more--

00:19:14.449 --> 00:19:16.990
I won't say balanced life, but
it was a more meaningful life.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.150
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.980
RYAN NICODEMUS: I think for
me, like the more revelation--

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.050
some more of the
revelation moments

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.420
I had facing my hoard of stuff
after that packing party,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.720
I just kind of looked at this
heap of tens of thousands

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.680
of dollars worth of stuff.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.850
And was forced to think
about the narrative

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.760
that I was playing
out in my head.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.440
And what I was
telling myself was,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.190
I make really good money
in the corporate world,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.290
I'm saving for retirement.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.765
I was putting away whatever
they would match, like 1%

00:19:46.765 --> 00:19:49.752
or whatever we were at,
or something, you know.

00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:51.460
But then I really
started to think about,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.460
like my goal was
to retire early.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.710
And I certainly wasn't going
to do that with the money

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.530
that I was taking
out of the paycheck.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.030
And everything else that I had
in that room-- not everything

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.029
else, but a lot of that
stuff I had in the room,

00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:03.240
I put on credit cards.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.330
And I was thinking,
wow, if I actually

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.340
would have saved
some of this money,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.260
instead of going out and trying
to buy the latest gadget,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.290
or trying to go on
the coolest vacation,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.150
or going out and racking
up $300 bar tabs,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.480
maybe I could
actually focus on what

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.330
I want my priorities to be.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.730
And I think the biggest
thing that minimalism really

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.990
helped me do, is to get clear
on what my priorities were

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.310
and what I wanted them to be.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.810
Because for the
longest time, if you

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.570
were to ask my 25 or
26-year-old self, like, hey,

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.360
Ryan, what are your priorities,
I would have said my health.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.550
If I'm not healthy,
I'm not happy.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.520
My relationships--
you know, my mom, she

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.760
lived a half hour away.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.840
I might have seen her six
or seven times a year.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.960
Health wise, I was eating
out fast food a lot.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.374
Or I would say,
oh, you know, I'm

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.790
working on the big
passion project

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.498
that I've been putting
off for two years.

00:20:52.498 --> 00:20:53.330
That's my priority.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.840
And what I realized is
I gave my priorities

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.350
a lot of lip service.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.930
And what I was able to do is
to actually make my priorities

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.530
my actual priorities.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.220
And that's what
our priorities are.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.720
It's not what we say they are.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.490
It's what we actually
do with our time.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.912
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah.

00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:10.620
Before we go done that
a little bit more,

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.550
I think one thing I found
fascinating that came out

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.690
the documentary is that if
you adopt the principlism--

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.699
principles, sorry-- of
minimalism, it can--

00:21:19.699 --> 00:21:21.490
JOSHUA MILLBURN: I like
that-- principlism.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.500
JONNY CRANMER: Where
did that word come from?

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.340
Principlisms,
minimalisms together.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.298
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Someone's
registering that URL

00:21:27.298 --> 00:21:28.660
in the crowd right now.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.600
JONNY CRANMER: New
title for a book

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.810
So you get beneficial
effects for you

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.050
as a person, probably
the people around you.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.030
But there's another
ripple effect that I felt,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.779
that I noticed from
the documentary, which

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:42.480
is it's actually beneficial
to the environment.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.140
It's beneficial to
wider groups of people.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.180
Because the consumerism
that we're so sucked into,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.700
and that we buy and hoard,
it has larger ripple effects,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.200
right?

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.450
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.160
JONNY CRANMER: So,
in essence, you're

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.951
doing a good thing for
yourself, but you're

00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:58.820
also having this wider effect.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.510
JOSHUA MILLBURN: It sounds
overly simplistic to say this,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.080
but for whatever reason, I
didn't realize it at the time,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.000
if you consume less,
you produce less waste.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.820
And I mean, it wasn't like--

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.300
I didn't approach minimalism
because I was like,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.180
I'm going to save
the environment,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.910
although it was a really
good benefit to realize,

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.610
you know what, if I
consume 90% less stuff,

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.090
I'm going to produce
90% less waste.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.140
It has that kind
of ripple effect.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.560
And so figuring out that there
are these additional benefits,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.970
once you start going
down that rabbit hole.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.850
People at work started coming
up to me, saying things like,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.205
you seem less stressed,
what's going on in your life.

00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:43.840
You seem so much calmer.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.742
Why are you being
so nice lately.

00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:49.700
Because I never jumped
up and said, look at me,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.330
I'm becoming a minimalist,
and you need to as well.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.870
And even now, Ryan and
I aren't proselytizing.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.432
I'm not trying to convert
anyone in here to minimalism.

00:22:59.432 --> 00:23:00.890
We're just sharing
something that's

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:01.973
worked really well for us.

00:23:01.973 --> 00:23:04.630
We've seen it work really well
for thousands of other people.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.390
And we want to
build to share that,

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.930
in hopes that maybe you
can get a few ingredients

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.600
from our recipe, tease
those out, and find a way

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.790
to maybe simplify a little bit,
if that's what you want to do.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.130
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah, so to bring
Google into the conversation

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.406
a little bit.

00:23:20.406 --> 00:23:21.780
I know when we
sat down at lunch,

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.120
we talked a little bit
about the digital influences

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.100
we have in our lives
that clutter it

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.714
rather than streamline it.

00:23:28.714 --> 00:23:30.297
Let's put Google in
that bucket, let's

00:23:30.297 --> 00:23:33.150
put Facebook,
Instagram, et cetera.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.420
Where do you see Google's
position in the world,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.570
as you view it
through minimalism?

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.325
Do you think that we produce
services and products that

00:23:42.325 --> 00:23:44.010
are generally good for people?

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.120
Or do you think that
in areas we clutter?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.650
JONNY CRANMER:
Yeah, I don't think

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.600
either one's mutually exclusive.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.590
I mean, if you look at the
tools that we have in our lives.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.240
If I have-- well,
here's a good example,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.915
because Ryan almost cut his
thumb off the other day.

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:02.480
If you have a knife, you're
cutting onions with it,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.910
and it's a useful tool.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.640
But you can use that knife
to do great harm as well.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.130
And so if I look at the tools
that we have in our lives,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.970
whether it is
Gmail, which I use,

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.470
obviously use Google
as a search engine.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.560
If I look at those
tools in our lives

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.714
how am I using these tools, and
am I being intentional with it.

00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.380
And I think there are
some steps that we

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.420
can take to sort of mitigate
the impulse, as well.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.690
There's an app I've
been using my phone,

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.510
called Moment, which sort of
tracks how much screen time I'm

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.166
spending on my phone.

00:24:37.166 --> 00:24:38.540
The interesting
thing about that,

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.030
as soon as I put
that up on my phone,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.370
I realized that just
by the sheer fact

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.980
that I'm tracking it, I'm
using my phone differently.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.520
Because I know I'm being
watched all of the sudden.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.040
Even thought it's just me
watching myself in a way,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.477
and I'm trying to improve that.

00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:55.310
And so my screen time
with down drastically.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.550
And I think there are
other things we can do.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.350
We can remove apps
we're not using,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.970
or apps we don't want to use.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.420
We can take temporary
of, sabbaticals.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.800
We have weekends
for a reason, right?

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.230
But do we do weekends
away from social media?

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.831
Do we have a day that this sort
of our digital sabbath day,

00:25:11.831 --> 00:25:12.330
as well.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.520
I have a good friend who
lives in Los Angeles, who

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.980
every Friday night, he
shuts off his computer

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.000
and doesn't open it back
up until Sunday morning.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.460
And so realizing that you
can set up these routines

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.001
in your life-- in fact, we were
just having this conversation

00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:28.739
on the way over here,
about why did Google--

00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:31.030
there were all these other
search engines at one point,

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.530
right?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.990
There was Dogpile, and--

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.409
RYAN NICODEMUS: Ask Jeeves.

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:38.700
JOSHUA MILLBURN: And Yahoo,
and all these other places.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.660
What made Google
really stand out?

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.860
And I mean, to me
that was the sort

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.230
of the epitome of minimalism.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.410
If you want to--

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.209
if you sort of did
a split screen,

00:25:48.209 --> 00:25:50.250
you went to Yahoo on one
page, you went to Google

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.760
on the other, and
you saw one of them

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.920
was cluttered with all this
additional information,

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.140
and one was functionally
this, right?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.030
I mean, it was one line,
you type something in there

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.694
with I'm feeling lucky, and
what was the other thing that

00:26:07.694 --> 00:26:09.860
comes up, the advance search
thing, and that was it.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.490
I mean, that was
minimalism brought

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:16.470
to the web search for the
first time in an elegant way.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.820
And what that
minimalism allowed then

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.790
was also to create the
best search engine as well.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:26.235
I mean, the reason everyone
goes to Google now, part of it

00:26:26.235 --> 00:26:27.610
has to with the
simplicity of it.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.470
But the other part is you think
you're going to get the best

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.560
results from that experience.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.340
And so, it if by stripping
everything else down

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.460
you're able to really focus
on what you're core competency

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.999
is, then that I found that
creates a better experience,

00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:43.790
not just for the user,
but for the company,

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.700
and everything else.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.300
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah,
it's interesting

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.360
when you put it that way,
because I would agree

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.776
with you, that
Google probably did

00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:53.530
have it's success by being
very simple with that homepage.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.820
So that's an interesting point.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.270
To the people that are
hear, listening, what would

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.780
you say to them, if they're
interested by minimalism,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.290
as a sort of like
beginner's guide

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.050
to start exploring how
they could bring it

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.500
into their lives.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.500
RYAN NICODEMUS: Well,
there's a few ways to start.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.462
You could have a packing party.

00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:14.710
It might be a little
unreasonable or too extreme

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.539
for a family of six or
eight, or something.

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:18.830
JONNY CRANMER: What is the
game that you guys invented?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.460
I read about this.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.960
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah, so this
is a little more approachable.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.390
We have something called
the 30 day minimalism game.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.740
And de-cluttering, it
can be boring sometimes.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.030
So Josh I decided to
make it fun by adding

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.682
a little friendly competition.

00:27:32.682 --> 00:27:34.390
So you find a friend,
or a family member,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.949
or a coworker, who wants
to get rid of stuff.

00:27:36.949 --> 00:27:38.490
And you both agree
to play this game.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.430
And you start on the
first day of the month.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.120
So you know, July is
just around the corner.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.287
You could start on July 1st.

00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.578
You both agree to get rid of
one thing on the first day

00:27:46.578 --> 00:27:47.079
the month.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:48.744
And then on the second
day of the month,

00:27:48.744 --> 00:27:49.860
you get rid of two things.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.069
And then on the third day
of the month, three things.

00:27:52.069 --> 00:27:53.235
And then on the fourth day--

00:27:53.235 --> 00:27:54.400
OK, so forth and so on.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.650
You probably get how it works.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.630
So it starts off
really, really easy,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.330
up until you get to like day
19, you get rid of 19 things.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.924
And then the next
day, on day 20,

00:28:01.924 --> 00:28:04.340
you're like oh, crap, I got
to get rid of 20 things today.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.423
And it's funny, because
my partner, Mariah, and I,

00:28:06.423 --> 00:28:08.810
we played this not too long ago.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.360
And even as me being
one of the minimalists,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.730
we still were able to make
it through the whole month.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.280
And if you do, you get
rid of about 500 items.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.460
So, you know, you bet
something real silly,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.000
like maybe a dinner,
or something small,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.795
or someone has to cook dinner.

00:28:24.795 --> 00:28:27.420
JOSHUA MILLBURN: This is Google,
you can bet a million dollars.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.135
RYAN NICODEMUS: You can
bet a million dollars.

00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:32.010
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Raise
the stakes, Nicodemus.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.550
RYAN NICODEMUS: What
Mariah did is she--

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.550
no, this is pretty good.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.020
So Mariah was
playing with a friend

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.520
of hers in Fargo, North Dakota.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.150
And the loser had to
basically karaoke a song

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.580
that the other person,
that the winner picked out.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.940
So they both ended up
making it through the month.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.190
But in that case, they both
won, because they both had

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.030
gotten rid of about 500 items.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.830
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah,
I think the other way--

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.860
that's a very
practical, how-to step.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.510
But the other side
of simplify our lives

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.540
is understanding
the why to side.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.100
What's the purpose?

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.570
And so for me the really
important question early on

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.330
was how might your life
be better with less?

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.210
And I think by
answering that question,

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.050
you're able to identify the
benefits of minimalism for you.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.080
And I think they're
different for everyone.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.090
The benefits for--

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.310
I've got a four-year-old now.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.910
The benefits for a
four-year-old are

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.890
going to be so
considerably different

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.825
from the benefits for you,
versus anyone else in the room.

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:29.700
For some people's, it's
health, its finances,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.382
reclaiming your
time, your attention.

00:29:32.382 --> 00:29:34.840
And you have to figure out what
those benefits are for you.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.423
Because that's going to give you
really the leverage you need.

00:29:37.423 --> 00:29:41.400
I think we all instinctually
know how to de-clutter.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.229
You're not going to see me and
Ryan write something like here

00:29:44.229 --> 00:29:45.770
are the 67 ways for
you to de-clutter

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.640
your closet this weekend.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.440
Because we all know
how to do that.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.130
The question is why
are we doing it.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.920
And once you understand that,
I think you have the leverage

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.110
you need to move forward.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.082
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah,
that brings up a memory.

00:29:57.082 --> 00:29:59.540
When I was listening to your
podcast, I think the last one,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.220
you had Q&amp;A. It was
an eight-year-old that

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.245
came on, and asked you how do
I apply minimalism to my life.

00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:06.120
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.661
JONNY CRANMER: Which is a-- it's
kind of crazy thing to think

00:30:08.661 --> 00:30:09.970
about, because--

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.550
you answered it well, like it
can be applied to everyone,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.860
but for a kid to ask you,
it's kind of crazy thing.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.776
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah.

00:30:16.776 --> 00:30:19.400
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah, we
had a five-year-old girl

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.870
at our last event in San Diego.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.990
And her parents were like this
is our five-year-old daughter.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.260
She's a big fan of you guys.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.410
She came up and she's like
I donated some of my clothes

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.595
yesterday.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:35.960
I was just like she is so
much further ahead than me.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.190
That is amazing that she
can get into that mindset.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.830
And for her, I
don't think it was

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.950
about not owning a lot of toys.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.000
It was the fact that--
and through her parents--

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.280
she is getting these principles,
especially the principle

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:49.940
of giving.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.869
I mean, giving is living.

00:30:51.869 --> 00:30:53.410
When I look at my
values and beliefs,

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.300
contribution is way up there.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.250
And the fact that
she's five years old,

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.083
and she can use this
thing called minimalism

00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:00.980
to help her contribute
more, beyond herself,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.870
in a meaningful way.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.120
I think that's pretty awesome.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.467
JONNY CRANMER:
Yeah, so a bit more

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.550
of a hard hitting question,
by an interesting one.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.560
Some of the folks
thought this one up.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.460
The idea of
de-cluttering and getting

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.140
rid of your
possessions, some people

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.860
would call that, perhaps,
a movement for the elite,

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.450
for people that have
money and can do that.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.620
What about those that don't have
anything, and arguably already

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.920
live a minimalist life?

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.140
How do you respond to that?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.325
And then, can the
same principles

00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:31.950
be applied to their
life, although they

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.150
don't have as much, to
make them feel they're

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.025
living a more intentional life.

00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:39.400
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
And the question

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.483
is really about privilege.

00:31:40.483 --> 00:31:42.720
And I think it's an important
question, especially

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.080
in today's environment,
because we're

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.350
seeing different
classes of people,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.081
where you have this
divide that's happening.

00:31:52.081 --> 00:31:53.580
And especially in
the United States,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.650
where you have
socio-economic classes.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.750
And I say that word
in vocal quotes.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.260
I grew up really
poor, and realized

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.450
that maybe we're not happy,
because we need more money.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.240
And so when I started
climbing the corporate ladder,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.160
I'm like wait a minute, $50,000
year isn't making me happy.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.740
I need to adjust for inflation.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.140
And so maybe it's
$75,000 a year.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.370
Maybe it's six figures, or maybe
it owning a bunch of stuff.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.990
Maybe that's going
to make me happy.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.730
And in time, what
I realized is we

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.810
weren't discontent when we
were growing up just because

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.360
of money.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.750
I mean, money will
buy you certain levels

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.230
of comfort and certain things
that you need, for sure.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.320
But beyond basic
needs, the correlation

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.320
between happiness
and money falls off

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.550
with the abruptness
of a cliff, right?

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.710
And so, what I realized is that

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.110
I was just starting to
make the same bad decisions

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.010
we made before I was 18.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.210
But money enabled me to
make even worse decisions,

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.030
go into debt with
those decisions.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.470
And so I had to
be really careful.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.820
And in a weird way, I have a
different kind of privilege.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.080
I have the privilege of
seeing both sides of it.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.090
I had the privilege of growing
up poor and being in poverty,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.430
like true poverty.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.680
Electricity being turned off
in the winter kind of poverty.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.310
And I saw that.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.590
And I contrast that
with what's going on,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.400
or what went on in my
'20s, where I ostensibly

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.640
had it all, and was still
discontented by that.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.900
And I think weather I was
poor, or when I was wealthy,

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.950
or when I'm
somewhere in between,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:40.700
I find that no matter where I am
on the soico-economic spectrum,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.270
I benefit from living a
more intentional life.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.960
In fact, I know
now, in retrospect,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.050
looking back 30
years in the past,

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.490
I would have benefited
a lot more from being

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.580
more intentional, especially
when we had fewer resources.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.520
If you don't have
that many resources,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.470
you want to be very
deliberate with how

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.850
you use those resources.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.790
And it's not just
money, by the way.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.950
Money is one resource.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.825
It's also a renewable resource.

00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.130
It's your time,
it's your attention.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.360
These are resources, these are
things that we can't get back.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.689
And so the one thing that's
been really encouraging,

00:34:12.689 --> 00:34:15.280
and one of the reasons
we go out on tour now,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.760
it's so we can listen to people.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.590
And we have factory
workers, and we have

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.530
CEOs show up at the same event.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.714
And they're asking
the same questions.

00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:27.880
I mean, the questions
manifest differently depending

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.090
where you are on the
socio-economic spectrum.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.300
But they're really saying I feel
like my life's out of control,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.840
and how do I regain
control of that life.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.570
Because we all, at
the end of the day,

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.280
we want to figure out how to
live a more meaningful life.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.880
No matter what we're doing
with our time and resources,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.260
that's really what we're
trying to accomplish.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.949
And so, minimalism's
just a way for us

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.469
to be more deliberate with
the resources we have.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.969
RYAN NICODEMUS: I'll tell you
one of my favorite experiences

00:34:57.969 --> 00:34:58.720
on tour.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.380
We went on a 100
city tour in 2014.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.800
And we were in Belfast, and
this gentleman came up to me.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.990
And at the time, because
we weren't as popular

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.360
as we are now, I guess.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.430
But we could literally
just be like, hey,

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.160
we're going to be at this coffee
shop, show up if you want to.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.049
And like 20 people, 30
people would show up.

00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:20.590
We didn't have to
charge for tickets.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.360
Now if we did that, there'd
be 600 people showing up

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.818
at a coffee shop, and the owner
would probably be mad at us

00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:26.650
for having--

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.760
what do they call that--

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.620
JOSHUA MILLBURN: A flash mob.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.786
RYAN NICODEMUS: A flash mob.

00:35:29.786 --> 00:35:31.880
A minimalist flash mob
show up at the coffee shop.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.217
But he comes up to me, and he's
like, you know, my name's Dee,

00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:36.800
and I just want to
tell you, man, he's

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.610
like thank you so much
for doing what you do.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:40.470
He's like, I am--

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.417
I'm a fighter.

00:35:41.417 --> 00:35:43.000
And I'm like, yeah,
man, me too, we're

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.430
all fighting the good fight.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.220
And he's like, no, no, like
I box, like I'm a fighter.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.070
And I'm like, oh, wow, cool man.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.820
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Are
you threatening me?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.195
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah, and I'm
look oh, cool, how is that?

00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:57.070
And he's like, I love it,
man, I absolutely love it.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.822
He was like now I'm
the guy though--

00:35:58.822 --> 00:36:00.280
and if I could do
a Belfast accent,

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.640
I would totally do his
part in that accent,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.835
but I wouldn't do it no justice.

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:06.460
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
You're Belfast accent?

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.465
JONNY CRANMER: I was
going to jump in,

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.110
but I'm not going to do it.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.324
He looked at me and I was
like, no, it's not happening.

00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:13.740
RYAN NICODEMUS:
So he's telling me

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.680
about how he loves what he does
and he was saying, like now,

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.840
I'm the fighter that
they put into the ring

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.420
to get beat up on,
like when there's

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.057
a well-known fighter that has an
exhibition match or something,

00:36:26.057 --> 00:36:28.390
I'm the one that they put in
the ring to get beat up on.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.890
He's like, but I
absolutely love it.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.547
And he's like, I also
train other fighters

00:36:32.547 --> 00:36:35.130
and I'm able to transfer some
of my knowledge to other people.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.220
He's like but I
am dirt poor, man.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.680
He goes, like, I
literally some months,

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.050
I'll sleep on my
friend's couch, and just

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.740
like really telling me how he
doesn't have a lot of money.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.950
But he's like I just want to say
thank you for helping me to not

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.470
feel like a loser.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.490
For all intents and
purposes, this guy

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.910
is living a starving
artist life.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.660
And the fact that we
can give him permission,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.950
I guess is maybe a
way to look at it,

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.640
for him to do what he loves
without worrying about what

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.764
his friends think about him,
how much money he makes,

00:37:05.764 --> 00:37:08.180
or maybe his parents are giving
him a hard time because he

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.010
doesn't make a lot of money.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.070
But the fact that
we can encourage

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.220
him to do what he loves.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.095
I mean, that's what I
really love about this.

00:37:13.095 --> 00:37:15.050
We had a girl in Adelaide
who came up to us.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.910
She was in line, and
she was like, you

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.430
know, it wasn't until I
read your book, "Everything

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.450
that Remains," I didn't
realize the bad decisions I

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.930
was making with my life.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.610
She was like I've been
homeless for years.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.910
She's like but over the
last three or four months,

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.240
I've been able to
make better decisions

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.110
through this inspiration
that you've given me.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.510
And she's like I have
a steady job now.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.990
I've been able to hold
a home for a few months.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:46.740
And stories like that, to
me, kind of automatically--

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.450
I don't want to say shuts down
the argument of privilege,

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.240
because I think it's something
that is a very important thing

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.930
to talk about.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.300
But it definitely shows how
minimalism, it does really,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.009
really apply to anyone on
the socio-economic scale.

00:38:00.009 --> 00:38:01.550
JONNY CRANMER: It
sounds like you can

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.219
just-- it enables people,
gives them more focus

00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:05.510
where they need to be focusing.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.450
And when they focus
in the right areas,

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.930
you just get that
natural energy,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.090
because you're being with
who you want to be with,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.610
you're doing what
you want to do.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.890
And that becomes your
drive and you're singly

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.119
going towards that.

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:17.660
RYAN NICODEMUS: I
just think it helps

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.010
people ask better questions,
is what I was going to say.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.570
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
That word, focus,

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.030
I think is an important one.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.132
How many of you
all are busy today?

00:38:25.132 --> 00:38:26.740
Right?

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.430
So your life's out
of control, right?

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.610
No, I'm joking, halfway.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.390
But I used to wear this term
busy as a badge of honor,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.890
right?

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.720
Hey, you want to grab
coffee tomorrow morning?

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.072
Can't, I'm so busy.

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.690
What's going on next week?

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.680
I'd love to meet, I'm
just so busy right now.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.320
And like, it was this--

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.090
it was a catch-all excuse.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.360
But really, for me
at least, it meant

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.840
that, man, I don't
really, I don't have

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.340
control of what's going on.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.220
And for me now, busy
is like the worst

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.570
four letter word there is,
because it means that I'm not

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.340
able to control my days.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.910
And so it probably
doesn't look very

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:15.380
good on a graph, like I don't do
nearly as much as I used to do.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.120
But I get a lot more meaningful
work done now I feel like.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.700
Because I'm not
busy, I'm focused.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.922
And so, in fact, anytime, when
we're on the road or something,

00:39:23.922 --> 00:39:25.880
and someone's like, oh,
you guys sure are busy.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.720
I'm like, no, we're focused.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.800
But the only way to
get there is I've

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.930
had to get good at saying no
over the last six or seven

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.430
years.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.740
And I'm far from perfect.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.160
And I say yes to the
wrong things all the time.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.800
But I'm much better now.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.050
Because I'm so much
better at saying no,

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.660
I can't do that, because
here's what I'm saying yes to.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.219
It's not just no, no, no, it's
saying yes to the right things.

00:39:49.219 --> 00:39:50.760
Because the opposite
used to be true.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.760
I'd say yes to anything
that came along.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.470
And then by default, I had
to say no to the things that

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.574
were actually important to me.

00:39:57.574 --> 00:39:59.740
JONNY CRANMER: I think I
remember when we had lunch,

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.323
maybe both of you
have this principle,

00:40:01.323 --> 00:40:04.450
that you don't have
tasks in your day.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.490
Is that accurate?

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.720
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Yeah,
for the most part.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.136
I mean, there are
always sort of--

00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:09.485
I don't have a to-do list.

00:40:09.485 --> 00:40:10.610
JONNY CRANMER: Or schedule.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.568
JOSHUA MILLBURN: We
definitely have a calendar.

00:40:12.568 --> 00:40:18.360
In fact, we use
Google calendars.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.970
And in fact, one of the things--

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.620
you can call it a productivity
hack or whatever, for me.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.430
But like I said, I'm
probably far less productive

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.890
now on the sense of just
checking things off a list.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.070
But we share the calendar with
everyone who's on our team.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:41.110
And you'll know, nope, anytime
before 2:00 PM, usually,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.950
when we're at home, you
can't book anything with me,

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.840
because I'm going to spend
that time writing, or reading,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.694
or exercising.

00:40:47.694 --> 00:40:50.110
I've got a really bad back,
so I'm doing physical therapy.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:53.010
So it's that, and so I
find ways to block off

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.610
large chunks of time that are
meaningful, like deep work

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:00.804
time, so that I am
living that best life,

00:41:00.804 --> 00:41:02.720
and I can say yes to the
most important things

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.590
during that block.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.885
And it gives me less, far
fewer hours to say yes

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:07.260
to other things,
but I still have

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.550
other time that I can say yes.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.550
But yeah, you're not going
to see back, to back,

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.030
to back meetings
for me or anything.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.450
JONNY CRANMER:
And so, how do you

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.680
guys apply that to what
you're doing nowadays.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.680
Because the amount of
TV networks I read out

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.180
at the beginning, that you've
been on, applies to everything

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.971
you're doing today.

00:41:22.971 --> 00:41:24.654
You run a website,
you have a podcast,

00:41:24.654 --> 00:41:26.070
you have a documentary
on Netflix.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.200
You write books,
you write essays,

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.035
you have courses for
people, you're here

00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:31.260
at Talks for Google.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.720
You're on a tour at the moment.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.820
I wouldn't necessarily
call that minimalist.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.810
But you guys are driving it, and
it seems to be working for you.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.860
So how do you explain that?

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.447
I mean, is it the focus the
helps you drive all that stuff?

00:41:43.447 --> 00:41:45.030
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Absolutely, you know--

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.863
first off, I'll say
when you call yourselves

00:41:46.863 --> 00:41:49.577
the minimalists, everything you
do becomes steeped in irony.

00:41:49.577 --> 00:41:51.910
I mean, we don't sell a very
minimalist amount of books.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.200
You should see the
crowds that show up.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.410
They're not a very
minimalist amount of people.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.557
Yes, we don't have a
very minimalist amount

00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:58.140
of tour stops.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.514
But at the end of
the day, if you

00:41:59.514 --> 00:42:04.180
were to look at the terminus
of what a minimalist

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.280
or what a lot of people
think a minimalist is,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.680
would be a monk in a monastery
somewhere, in a monestery

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.010
somewhere, just
meditating all day long,

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.620
owning five possessions.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.300
Well, if we did that,
we wouldn't really

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.970
be able to help many
people, would we?

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.861
So, for us, it's not about--

00:42:19.861 --> 00:42:21.110
it's not about having nothing.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.720
It's certainly not
about deprivation.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.366
Like I said earlier,
we have a lot

00:42:25.366 --> 00:42:26.740
of important things
in our lives.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.490
In fact, everything
we have is important.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.140
It adds value, or brings us
joy, or serves a purpose.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.010
And all the things
that you listed,

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.322
it's not like we
started just, oh, we're

00:42:37.322 --> 00:42:38.760
going to start the
minimalist.com,

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.640
and we got to write three books,
we got to start a podcast,

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.385
we got that documentary that's
going to come out in 2016.

00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:44.240
Oh, by the way, we've
got to plan these tours.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.510
And then, we gotta
make sure we're

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.676
on all these major networks.

00:42:46.676 --> 00:42:48.970
I mean, all of this has
happened very organically.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.800
I mean, even with
the documentary--

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.700
I remember-- our
director's up there, Matt.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.890
He came with us on tour in 2014.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:59.110
And he just filmed
a bunch of stuff.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.970
And we had no idea what
was going to become of it.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.590
We had very low expectations.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.610
But we have very high standards.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.700
And what ended up
happening was the result

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.090
that you see now, with
"Minimalism," the documentary,

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.655
about the important things.

00:43:13.655 --> 00:43:15.030
But it certainly
didn't start off

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.260
with we're going to
have Netflix deals,

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.509
we're going to be in theaters.

00:43:17.509 --> 00:43:22.030
It was just Matt, who is
a minimalist himself, just

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.610
wanted to join us
to work on something

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.740
he was passionate about.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.489
And then it turned
into something amazing.

00:43:27.489 --> 00:43:29.390
And that's kind
of a short version

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.610
of what Josh and I've done over
the last six or seven years.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.090
It's things that--
what Josh said earlier.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.410
It's things that we're
able to put on our plate

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:41.200
because we keep our plate
so clear of distractions,

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.410
that were able to
take on these things.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.430
And yes, over the last
six or seven years,

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.970
we have had some
amazing things happen.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.490
And we have had a
lot of things happen.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.340
But I kind of look at it
as something we have like

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.610
layered on top of each other.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.495
When we first started, it
was the blog and essays.

00:43:59.495 --> 00:44:01.620
And then I started getting
a bunch of emails about,

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.390
hey, can you--

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.320
2,000 word emails
on a regular basis.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.660
Like, hey, can how help me
fix all my life problems?

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.090
And I'm like, god, I
wish I could somehow

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.970
help people to do this.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.590
I can't answer every
2,000 word email I get.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.120
So I started a little mentoring,
a little coaching business.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.320
And Josh was getting a lot
of questions on writing.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.010
So he started a writing class.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.430
And then from there, we wrote
"Minimalism," our first book.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:29.220
And at the end of the day,
it was, again, layered on.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.070
We would we would
keep our plates clear,

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.700
say yes to the things
that we had time for,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.990
the things that
we had space for.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.220
And we've continued that
approach throughout.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.700
And yes, looking back,
it sounds like so much.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.510
But it's been very intentional.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.890
And the reason why we've
been able to do so much

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.200
is because we have,
again, been able to say

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.490
no to a lot of things so we
can say yes to these very

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.660
big, important things.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:55.549
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah, that's
inspiring stuff to hear.

00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:57.382
I think we're probably
approaching some time

00:44:57.382 --> 00:44:59.140
to give the audience
some questions.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.430
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Great.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.890
JONNY CRANMER: But
before we hand that over,

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.175
the final question
I have for you,

00:45:02.175 --> 00:45:04.550
and somewhat you've answered
it, but if you could just

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:05.972
pinpoint one thing.

00:45:05.972 --> 00:45:08.430
Through the journey you've both
been through in minimalism,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.888
and will continue
to have, what has

00:45:09.888 --> 00:45:13.050
been the most impactful
thing that minimalism

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.550
has brought to your life.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.720
JOSHUA MILLBURN: I think
for me, and it was actually

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.200
the hardest thing to get
rid of, was my identity.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.430
When you meet someone,
what's the first question

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.625
that they ask you?

00:45:25.625 --> 00:45:26.780
AUDIENCE: What do you do?

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.490
JOSHUA MILLBURN: What do you do?

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.090
Right?

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.280
And I think it's life's
most dangerous question.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.987
I don't think people
like have a bad intent

00:45:33.987 --> 00:45:35.320
behind that question, obviously.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320
It just becomes part of
our everyday tete-a-tete.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.450
You meet someone,
what do you do.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.825
And it's a really broad question
when you think about it.

00:45:42.825 --> 00:45:44.075
What do you mean what do I do?

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:44.880
I drink water.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.840
I go to concerts.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.570
I enjoy going to the
beach and surfing.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.576
What we mean what do I do?

00:45:49.576 --> 00:45:52.630
Oh, I mean, where you work,
how much money do you earn,

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.617
so I can compare you to me
on the socio-economic ladder.

00:45:55.617 --> 00:45:57.200
Now if we posit the
question that way,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.840
you sound like a total jerk.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.640
And so instead, we
just say what you do.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.844
And then we recite the
title on our business card.

00:46:02.844 --> 00:46:04.010
Sometimes that's impressive.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.380
I used to have an
impressive job title.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.120
I was director of operations
for 150 retail stores, which

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.700
is really ironic with the
whole minimalism thing.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.450
And so I managed a
bunch of retail stores.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:17.991
And so I would say,
here's what I do,

00:46:17.991 --> 00:46:19.280
and I'd say what do you do.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.725
But I found that I was so much
more than just that job title.

00:46:22.725 --> 00:46:24.640
There's nothing wrong
with having a job.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.320
We all have to pay
the bills and find

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.200
ways to do that in a way
that aligns with the person

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.380
we want to be.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.070
But at the same time, I
was so much more than that.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.490
So I had to untether from
what that identity was.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.670
And so when people start asking
that question, what do you do,

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.534
I'd say I'm really
passionate about writing.

00:46:41.534 --> 00:46:42.700
I didn't say I was a writer.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.590
Because then you get the
accusatory questions.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.140
What have you written,
who's your publisher, who's

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.050
your agent?

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.620
It's like, well, no one yet.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.180
But I really like writing.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.430
And so I would say I'm really
passionate about writing

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.804
and I'd flip the
question around,

00:46:53.804 --> 00:46:55.610
and I'd say what are
you passionate about?

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.276
Sometimes you get the
deer in headlights

00:46:57.276 --> 00:47:00.200
look, because they're ready
to recite that business

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200
card to you.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.350
And other times, it just
changes the direction

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.360
of the conversation.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.610
The trajectory all of the
sudden was like, well, I'm

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.010
passionate about
skiing, or snowboarding,

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.179
I really like doing this.

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:14.720
And then we end up having much
more meaningful conversations.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.820
I did that experiment for
over the course of a year.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.180
I found that I was
able to really untether

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.860
from here's what I do,
and that means that's who

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.079
I am as an individual.

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.620
JONNY CRANMER: Yeah,
that's powerful.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.620
RYAN NICODEMUS: For
me, it's freedom.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.590
I truly feel free.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.110
And what I mean
by that is I just

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.410
became debt free for the
first time a couple years ago.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.701
JONNY CRANMER: Congratulations.

00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:38.950
RYAN NICODEMUS: Thanks,
thank you very much.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.360
I mean, that is, to me,
that's a new American dream,

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.840
is having zero debt.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.840
Because we have so much
freedom in this country.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.798
I mean, an 18-year-old
can graduate high school

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:50.490
and sign up for six figures
worth of student loans.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.910
It just blows my mind,
the freedom that we have.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.260
And I'm totally ripping
this off from "Spider Man,"

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:01.340
but with that freedom,
comes great responsibility.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.220
And we have to make decisions
with all the rope that

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.430
is given to us.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:09.970
So now-- this whole
thing started with I just

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.450
wanted to pay off some debt.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.890
I wanted to l get rid
of my fancy car I had,

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:16.470
get rid of that debt payment.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.260
I wanted to get rid of my home,
that debt payment I had there.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.050
I just wanted to have a life
to where I could be a barista

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:26.570
and live off of
$25-$30,000 a year.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.550
If everything right
now, if the rug

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.530
was like slipped out
from underneath of us,

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.720
internet blew up, we
couldn't sell books online,

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.430
or we couldn't tour
anymore, whatever.

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:39.200
Let's just say
everything hit the fan.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.680
I could turn my life
around on a dime right now.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.922
I'd have to move apartments.

00:48:42.922 --> 00:48:44.380
My rent's a little
high for someone

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.010
who makes $30,000 a
year, or $25,000 a year.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.320
But I have no lease.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.950
And I can do that in a second.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:53.910
And that to me, that
is true freedom.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.890
And that is why I
think "Minimalism" is

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.760
so important for many people.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.340
It kind of helps
them to, I guess,

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.610
put a template together on
what looks free for them.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.610
And then work towards that.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.410
JONNY CRANMER:
Powerful, very powerful.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.390
So we'll turn it
back to the audience,

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.950
if anyone has any questions.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.299
I think that we
have to use this.

00:49:16.299 --> 00:49:17.590
I think we tap it and throw it.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.011
RYAN NICODEMUS: Tap it?

00:49:19.011 --> 00:49:19.760
Did I do it right?

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:26.180
Nice.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.700
AUDIENCE: 1-1-2-1-2?

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.820
First I have to get one
protest out of the way.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.280
I think it should be fine
to have one box with letters

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.780
that you got from your mother.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.360
There's something
about the paper.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.193
And it wouldn't make
you less of minimalist.

00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:40.570
Just kind of a thought there.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:41.030
RYAN NICODEMUS: Thanks, man.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.057
What's your name?

00:49:42.057 --> 00:49:42.640
AUDIENCE: Ron.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.223
RYAN NICODEMUS: Nice
to meet you, Ron.

00:49:44.223 --> 00:49:45.140
AUDIENCE: Same here.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.140
Here's my question,
and again, this

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.050
is kind of like the
privilege question.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.760
It's a question about the
bigger picture, as it were.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.950
There are I think
two forces kind

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:59.090
of going on and like
competing each other.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.344
On one hand, there
are people like you,

00:50:01.344 --> 00:50:03.510
and other well-meaning
people, who are giving people

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:07.390
the option, hey, you get
off this treadmill, or this,

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:11.110
whatever it is that you're on,
and make your priorities what

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:12.780
really works for you.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.610
And that is wonderful, and
I'm very happy that you're

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.160
getting to thousands of people
and making the changes, maybe

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.820
tens of thousands of people.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.740
On the other hand,
there is way, way,

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:29.700
way more budget going to telling
people if you buy my crap,

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.200
then you will be loved,
or you'll get laid,

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.240
or whatever it is that--

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.470
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
Commodified love.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.030
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry?

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.380
JOSHUA MILLBURN: We've
commodified love.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.421
AUDIENCE: Right, exactly.

00:50:37.421 --> 00:50:42.450
And so you may become
successful in the sense

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.090
that you would get
to a lot of people,

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.240
but it'll be a
very niche success.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.300
And what can we do about
this bigger picture,

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.220
because like I said, right
now, if you're on NBC,

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.700
still way more of the
time of their programming

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.990
is for that other messaging.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:00.720
Yeah, it's nice, they
kind of pay their dues,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.140
and let you talk there too.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.240
But you know--

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.680
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah, I
think that what we're doing

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.140
is by nature subversive to
what you're talking about,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.030
the culture that
you're talking about.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.890
And I would say we're
doing it right now,

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:21.720
by helping to share this idea,
to share this philosophy.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.910
Yeah, it is a very tough--

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:27.680
it's a tough racket, because
it is a lot of forces

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.030
that are working against us.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.174
And of course, this is
a very biased opinion.

00:51:32.174 --> 00:51:33.590
Because for last
seven years, I've

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.700
been talking about minimalism.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.090
But what I see, though, is
that five-year-old, high school

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.340
kids, college kids.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.160
And it's not just
that demographic.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.030
It's great
grandmothers, who will

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.890
bring three generations
of daughters with them

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:48.990
to our events.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:52.570
But what I am seeing
is people are starting

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.200
to realize that what
they're trying to be sold

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.260
isn't necessarily the
answer to happiness.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.110
And it doesn't take
people earning six figures

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.510
to figure that out.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.340
You're wincing, why
are you wincing?

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.140
AUDIENCE: It's just
because, in the end,

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.200
I think what most people do--
it's like the biggest effect

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.700
there, it's like that the total
sum of all the memes that go

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.240
through their brain, from one
year, and yes, people can--

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.240
some people can take
out their own thing

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.110
and kind of decide what to--

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.160
but I think in
the end, this is--

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.430
without fighting
against the problem--

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:36.110
you're fighting
it in a positive,

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:38.299
you're offering an alternative.

00:52:38.299 --> 00:52:40.340
And you're hoping that as
many people as possible

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.785
will forego the bad
option, and take that.

00:52:42.785 --> 00:52:43.660
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.300
AUDIENCE: But I'm
a little skeptical

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.550
that while this other
option is so powerful,

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.610
and kind of goes at you
from more and more avenues

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.070
and in so many
different way, I don't

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.390
think that it's really
realistic to assume

00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:00.260
that you're going to get
there, one grandma at a time.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.010
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah,
the average American

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.510
sees 5,000 bits of input a day.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:06.220
Why are you giving
this back to me?

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.840
Oh, OK.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.532
So, just real quick--

00:53:09.532 --> 00:53:10.990
I was just going
to say the average

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.140
American sees 5,000
bits of input--

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.260
I'm sorry, 5,000
advertisements a day.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.050
5,000 advertisements
a day when you're on--

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:24.570
whatever, TV, billboards,
whatever social media

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:25.071
you go to.

00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:26.278
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Google Plus.

00:53:26.278 --> 00:53:27.700
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Yes, Google Plus.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.740
JONNY CRANMER: Sent
to you by Google.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.031
RYAN NICODEMUS: Which I'll
say is by far like the most,

00:53:31.031 --> 00:53:33.510
I feel like, is the
least intrusive.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:35.990
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah, right.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:37.717
It is the least
intrusive by far.

00:53:37.717 --> 00:53:40.050
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm here at Google.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.365
But no, like, kudos to that,
because it is amazing how it--

00:53:43.365 --> 00:53:45.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] almost
as popular as you are.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:52.590
RYAN NICODEMUS: Right, but
my point is that people--

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.010
the grandma, they do need a way
to filter through those 5,000

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:57.450
advertisements a day.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.070
Because when we see
something on a billboard,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:04.680
then in a commercial,
then whatever,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.360
that will seep into
our subconscious,

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.470
and we do start to think like,
oh, man, if I got my partner

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.050
that really nice luxury car,
and put a big bow on it,

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.910
and surprised her for
Christmas, like that's

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.110
going to make me happy.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.950
Or if I go on that
vacation, yeah, it's

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.800
going to make me
really, really happy.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.890
Or yeah, if I go to
Jarod, or whatever,

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.825
if I get that big
diamond ring, like man,

00:54:24.825 --> 00:54:25.950
she's going to be so happy.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.990
Like we are told what is
going to make us happy.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:29.490
Which is really
interesting, because

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.450
like post-industrial age,
advertisements actually

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:33.640
fulfilled needs.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.930
And now we create the need.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.320
And I think that
what we're doing

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.137
is, yes, it's helping
one person at a time.

00:54:39.137 --> 00:54:41.470
I'm certainly not going to
get into the political realm.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:44.340
I think maybe that is was where
you might be going with it.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.890
But I think, but I guess
what I'm getting at though,

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.970
is that even if it was just
one person, even if it was just

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:50.470
that--

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.960
even if it was just Dee,
who came up to me and said,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.180
dude, thank you so
much for helping me not

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.620
feel like a loser
for being poor,

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.180
that would make it all worth it.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.490
And we are reaching
millions of people.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:03.090
If you have any other grand,
big ideas, I'm totally open.

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.660
But what I focus on is
what I think is right,

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.110
and what I think is adding
the most value to the people

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:10.610
out there.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.240
And that's really
what I focus on.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.050
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Real quick, I'm
not trying to change the world.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.591
I'm just trying to
help a little bit.

00:55:16.591 --> 00:55:19.720
And I think companies like
this have the opportunity

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.590
to change the world.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.950
And so I would put
it back on you.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.050
And if each one of you
finds a way, if you're

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.660
interested in helping.

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.050
I don't think it comes
down to regulating

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.240
how many items someone can own.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.280
Telling someone what
they can and can't have

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.780
is not going to be the answer.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.970
The answer is going
to be for us to find

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.805
ways to help out a little bit.

00:55:38.805 --> 00:55:40.430
And so if we can help
out a little bit,

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.680
some other people can help
out, you all can help out,

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.740
you can create
some great change.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.360
I don't want to put a
dent in the universe,

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.610
as Steve Jobs once said.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.050
I just want to show up
and help a little bit.

00:55:55.657 --> 00:55:57.240
AUDIENCE: You guys,
thank you so much.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.515
This is incredibly profound.

00:55:58.515 --> 00:55:59.890
RYAN NICODEMUS:
What's your name?

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:00.550
AUDIENCE: Conrad.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:01.620
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Nice to meet you.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.786
AUDIENCE: Literally the
realist most subversive shit

00:56:03.786 --> 00:56:07.340
I've heard in a
while, so thank you.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.674
So five years ago, I
committed Facebook suicide,

00:56:10.674 --> 00:56:11.340
pulled the plug.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:11.740
RYAN NICODEMUS: Nice.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.031
AUDIENCE: Gave people 48 hours.

00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:15.520
I'm like hit me up
IRL, as the kids say.

00:56:17.652 --> 00:56:19.860
RYAN NICODEMUS: Congrats,
by the way, that's awesome.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:20.693
AUDIENCE: Fantastic.

00:56:20.693 --> 00:56:22.610
It was liberating.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.990
The reaction from a
pretty big set of people

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.200
was swift and fierce.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.160
People what felt judged.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.760
They came back at me hard.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.389
I'm curious to know, because I'd
like to take this even further.

00:56:35.389 --> 00:56:37.430
Did you guys-- I mean you
talked about your past,

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.010
and making some
choices about people

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.550
who weren't value aligned.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.972
Did you get that same reaction?

00:56:41.972 --> 00:56:43.680
How did you process
that and redirect it?

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.030
I'm curious to know how you felt
and how you moved through that.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.410
Because I've got
to believe that you

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:48.868
experienced some
of the same stuff.

00:56:48.868 --> 00:56:50.090
JOSHUA MILLBURN: For sure.

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.715
So I think there are three types
of relationships in our lives.

00:56:52.715 --> 00:56:54.910
We have sort of our
primary relationships.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.854
The five people that are
closest to you, 10 people

00:56:57.854 --> 00:56:58.645
if you're Catholic.

00:57:01.327 --> 00:57:03.910
Then you've got your secondary
relationships, people you still

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:07.450
really care about, love,
extended family, co-workers,

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:08.090
whatever.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.610
And you have the third
tier, the periphery.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.560
And those are people that
are still in your life,

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.340
and you care about them.

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.935
I found I was spending so
much time with that periphery,

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.685
I was spending time
with the wrong people.

00:57:20.685 --> 00:57:22.890
And because of that,
those inner two layers,

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:27.530
especially the people
closest to me, they--

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:31.110
and they pretended they
understood, because oh, you're

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:34.120
out there being successful and
you're working 80 hours a week,

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.605
you know, go ahead and do that.

00:57:35.605 --> 00:57:37.550
But the truth is that
it didn't feel good,

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:38.917
it didn't feel successful.

00:57:38.917 --> 00:57:41.250
And so I had to re-prioritize
a lot of my relationships.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.930
And in doing that,
I had to cut out

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:45.660
some of the
relationships in my life.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.082
And sometimes--
sometimes we have

00:57:47.082 --> 00:57:49.300
to let go of shitty
relationships in our lives too.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:55.090
Because when I look at some of
the people in my life before,

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:56.970
a lot of people would
play the victim role.

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.910
And victims become
victimizers pretty quickly.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.050
And I realized that I could try
to repair some relationships.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.860
But there were some that
were not worth repairing.

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.570
Because I wanted
to surround myself

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.740
with people who would help me
be the ideal version of myself,

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:16.054
as opposed to dragging me back
down to a less ideal version.

00:58:16.054 --> 00:58:17.970
RYAN NICODEMUS: Yeah,
when we called ourselves

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:19.470
the minimalists,
we found out really

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.627
quickly who our friends were.

00:58:21.627 --> 00:58:24.070
It was shocking.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:27.860
Looking back, I'm really glad
that it happened that way,

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:32.380
because a lot of the people who
like instantly started judging,

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.240
and I started seeing
some of that backlash,

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:39.280
I automatically knew who were
actually my friends and who

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.220
weren't.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.549
And it took a lot of
tough conversations,

00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:43.590
even with family members.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:47.820
Like my mom called me up,
hey, son, how you doing?

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.550
I'm like, I'm
great, how are you?

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:51.010
I'm doing all right.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:53.132
She's like what's
this minimalist crap?

00:58:53.132 --> 00:58:55.821
And I was like, oh,
you found the website.

00:58:55.821 --> 00:58:57.820
She must have been Googling
my name or something

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.050
and come across it.

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.140
And I'm like yeah,
what do you think?

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.980
And she's like, I don't really
get it, like are you depressed?

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:11.880
Are you not going to be
around for holidays anymore?

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.950
Can I not buy you gifts anymore?

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.180
And I'm like, well, mom,
yes, I am depressed,

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.640
and I'm trying to get out of it.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.965
And I am using this as a way to
kind of get out of this slump

00:59:23.965 --> 00:59:25.340
that I really feel
like I've been

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.140
in for the last several years.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.390
And I said, no,
I will absolutely

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:30.360
be around for holidays.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.464
Like, in fact, I hope to see
you more than just the holidays,

00:59:33.464 --> 00:59:34.380
because that's about--

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.338
like I said earlier, I
only saw her a few times

00:59:36.338 --> 00:59:40.260
a year, major holidays, maybe
Mother's Day, her birthday.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.930
And I really want
to spend more time

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.800
having a relationship with
you, rather than focusing

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.760
on my work.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.820
And you know when it
comes to gifts, I'm like,

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.010
yeah, you know, I'd rather
you not buy me anything.

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.340
I appreciate the
sentiment that you have,

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.180
but if it's something
that I don't need,

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.660
it's not going to
serve a purpose,

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.300
or if it's not something that's
going to make me super happy,

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:09.200
don't worry about spending $15
on a necktie clip or something.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.840
And she's like, well,
I'm your mother,

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.340
and I'm still going to
buy you things anyway.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:19.840
OK, I guess as my mom, she
has that right to say that.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.320
And I'm like, mom, I just
got to be honest with you,

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.930
if you get me something
and I don't use it,

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.070
I'm going to have to
find another home for it.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.065
I'm going to have
to donate it, I'm

01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:29.314
going to have to give it away.

01:00:29.314 --> 01:00:32.160
This is not the thing to say
to your mother, by the way.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.527
She kind of reacted--

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:35.110
she was a little
angry, rightfully so.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.030
And it kind of got
a little heated.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.390
But it got to a point
where I just kind of slowed

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.890
things down.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:43.820
I'm like, mom, let me just
stop you for a second.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.110
I love you so much.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:46.110
You love me, right?

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.780
She's like, yeah, of
course, I love you.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.162
And I'm like, I want
you to be happy.

01:00:50.162 --> 01:00:51.620
You want me to be
happy too, right?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.890
She's like, yeah, of course
I want you to be happy.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:56.240
And I said, well, if
that's the case, then what

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.472
I need from you is support.

01:00:57.472 --> 01:00:59.180
I don't need you to
have a packing party.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.010
I'm not going to
come to your home

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:01.593
and judge all the
stuff that you have.

01:01:01.593 --> 01:01:03.930
All I need is for you to
support me on this journey

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.760
that I'm starting.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.680
And that is what really
got through to her.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.599
And I mimicked that conversation
with a lot of people.

01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:12.390
And what I had to
realize too is the people

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:13.950
who were doing the judging--

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.780
I got rid of my Facebook
a few months ago--

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.282
and I cannot tell you
how freeing it is.

01:01:19.282 --> 01:01:20.240
AUDIENCE: It's amazing.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.990
RYAN NICODEMUS: Oh,
my god, it's so great.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:23.090
It's unbelievable.

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:24.153
Hey Josh, how do you
know if someone got rid

01:01:24.153 --> 01:01:24.860
of their Facebook?

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.818
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Don't
worry, they'll tell you.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.280
RYAN NICODEMUS: So, I got a
little bit of the backlash

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:31.970
too on that.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.740
And I just had to remind
myself, like anytime someone

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.120
is judging me, judgment
is but a mirror

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.300
that reflects the
person's insecurities

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.050
that's doing the judging.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.760
And that is ultimately
what it comes down to.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.970
People who are my true friends,
people who actually do love me,

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.425
they're not going
to feel judged.

01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:52.050
They might have a
conversation with me.

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:53.840
They might ask me
some questions.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.259
But they're not going to
give me that backlash.

01:01:56.259 --> 01:01:58.050
People who love me and
want me to be happy,

01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.090
they will support me.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.700
And what I'll say
is doing something

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.700
like getting rid of
Facebook, or doing something

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.110
like calling yourself
a minimalist,

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:06.074
or call it simplicity.

01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:07.490
You can call it
whatever you want.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.620
We're the minimalists
because the domain

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.800
was available for like $8.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.219
So call it whatever you want.

01:02:15.219 --> 01:02:17.510
But I think doing something
like that, it is a good way

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.260
to actually see who
your true friends are,

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.889
not just to your
friends are on Facebook.

01:02:21.889 --> 01:02:23.680
JOSHUA MILLBURN: We
have time for one more?

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.030
JONNY CRANMER: I
think, is there--

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:25.665
more questions?

01:02:25.665 --> 01:02:27.123
JOSHUA MILLBURN:
One more question.

01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:31.260
AUDIENCE: Let me see
if this is working.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.110
OK, hi.

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:32.240
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Howdy.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.180
RYAN NICODEMUS: Hello.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.180
AUDIENCE: Well, I just
wanted to first point out

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.990
that while everyone thinks of
Google as a search company,

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:39.890
were actually an
advertising company.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.010
I mean, that's really
where we make our money.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:44.610
So it's kind of funny
for you guys to like say,

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:52.240
like we're forced into this
consumeristic society by ads.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.950
Like, they're
forcing you to feel

01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.530
like you need something, or
feel like you want something.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.490
And were part of that.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.940
I mean, unfortunately, our
company is part of the problem.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.846
And that's an
unfortunate thing to say.

01:03:04.846 --> 01:03:06.720
But I don't work in ads
anymore, so whatever.

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:14.260
Right in there.

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.970
But what I was going
to ask was actually

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.720
when you guys
began your journey,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.490
and you were leaving
your positions

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:25.360
at your old companies, where you
were making six figure incomes,

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.080
and you were like,
hey, I'm going

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.660
to go do this other
thing, how many people

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.920
reacted to that like
you guys are crazy?

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.220
I mean, I have to feel
like it was a lot, right?

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.095
You were talking about
your Facebook friends,

01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:37.950
and how many of them
didn't understand,

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:40.320
that's how you really separate
the wheat from the chaff,

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:40.680
right?

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.305
JOSHUA MILLBURN: They
don't believe me.

01:03:42.305 --> 01:03:45.300
Because my initial plan, before
the whole minimalist thing took

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.800
off, was I left, and I
just wanted to be a barista

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.120
and write fiction full time.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.320
That was my gig.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.360
There's a coffee shop two blocks
from my apartment that I was--

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.860
I moved into this
small apartment.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.180
And was on the way to
becoming debt free.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.970
And then like the
whole minimalism thing

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.410
was this beautiful accident.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.780
Because Ryan came to me,
and he was like, hey,

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.760
man, you've been writing
fiction for a long time.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.970
Do you think that could write
some nonfiction about sort

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.720
of this journey, we
could could share it.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.640
And that's where the
minimalist.com started,

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.120
was sort of with that journey.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.820
And when I told
people I was just

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.135
going to go write full
time, they looked at me

01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:22.260
and said you can't do that.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.597
If you could just go do
that, everyone would do it.

01:04:24.597 --> 01:04:26.930
And I'm like, you realize
there are some people who make

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.490
a living from writing, right?

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.390
Like this wouldn't be the
first time in human history

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.050
that someone became a writer.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.780
And it was also because
they didn't understand--

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.530
I didn't say well, I'm going to
make the same amount of money.

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.045
I'm like, no, I
can live off of--

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.380
the first year I left
I made $23,000 a year.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.590
It was like 90% less money.

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:52.075
But strangely, I actually
contributed more that year

01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:54.200
in terms of charity, and
time, and stuff like that,

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.760
than I had at all in
the corporate world.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.300
And so, yea, people--

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.760
it's not that they were
just confused by it,

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.760
they didn't believe me at first.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.140
But, like Ryan said,
you start to figure out

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.390
who your real friends
are, and people

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.860
who just want to
associate with you

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.444
because you had a
particular job title are.

01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:15.110
RYAN NICODEMUS: I
would say it is really

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:16.720
cool though to see Google--

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.140
I was talking to
Johnny about this

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.840
before we started this panel--

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.720
I feel like if every
corporation just

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.680
did a little bit of what Google
does, as far as they do put

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.680
people first in a lot of ways.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.880
And I am not anti-capitalist
by any stretch.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.280
But I think that the inherent
problem with capitalism

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.110
is money first.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.700
It is bottom line first, and
maybe it's people second.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.720
That's a problem.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.120
And to see a company like Google
flipping that a little bit,

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.590
I think that does provide an
example for other corporations

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:50.340
to do that.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.300
You're right, corporations,
they are inherently dangerous,

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.280
for sure.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.180
Because they do
contribute to the problem.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.760
But it would be nice to see
other corporations putting

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.534
people first, before
that bottom line.

01:06:00.534 --> 01:06:02.700
Like some of the programs
you guys have are amazing.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.590
Like what you do with
the profits, like the--

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.340
what is it called?

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.140
JONNY CRANMER: Project Lane.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.450
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Yeah, Project Lane,

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:09.741
like that is such a cool thing.

01:06:09.741 --> 01:06:11.800
Or the air drop thing you
were telling me about.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.590
JONNY CRANMER: The drones.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:13.680
RYAN NICODEMUS:
Yeah, the drones,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.760
dropping supplies and things,
that other third world

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.430
countries need.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.530
That's amazing.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.220
I can only imagine if
every company put that

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:23.969
into their work atmosphere.

01:06:23.969 --> 01:06:26.510
JOSHUA MILLBURN: There's nothing
inherintly wrong with money.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:29.090
Ryan and I aren't
allergic to money.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:32.640
And the question is what
do we do with our money.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.200
I no longer-- money is no
longer the primary driver

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.302
for doing what I do.

01:06:36.302 --> 01:06:38.260
But whenever you're making
a business decision,

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.530
it still has to be part of it.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:40.946
I can't go on tour
and perpetually

01:06:40.946 --> 01:06:42.740
lose money forever, right?

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.335
That's just a bad
business decision.

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:46.360
So then the question
is, how can I

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.814
do this so that it does
align with my values,

01:06:48.814 --> 01:06:50.647
and also make some money
on it, and then a I

01:06:50.647 --> 01:06:51.970
do some really cool
stuff with that money.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:53.470
So Ryan and I have
built orphanages,

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.820
we've funded high
schools, we've contributed

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.450
to terrorist victims, things
like that, where we couldn't

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:00.970
have done that without money.

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.740
And so money allows
you to buy a Ferrari,

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.590
or allows you to do
something really cool

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.301
to contribute to the world
beyond you in a meaningful way.

01:07:08.301 --> 01:07:10.550
AUDIENCE: That reminds me,
this month is Google Serve.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:13.950
So if you haven't signed
up for a project yet,

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:18.240
Google lets you have 20
hours of your work time

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.820
to go volunteer
for building houses

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.490
with the Habitat for Humanity,
and beach clean-up, and all

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:24.990
this stuff.

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.030
We're doing that in June.

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:26.490
JOSHUA MILLBURN: That's killer.

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:26.840
RYAN NICODEMUS:
That is very cool.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.990
AUDIENCE: If you
haven't volunteered yet,

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:29.910
you should try to sign up
for something this month.

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:31.070
RYAN NICODEMUS: Is that what
the volunteer shirts are?

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:31.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:32.490
RYAN NICODEMUS: OK, very cool.

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:33.890
JOSHUA MILLBURN: Awesome,
thank you for that.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:35.931
RYAN NICODEMUS: See, that's
a meaningful T-shirt.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.530
JONNY CRANMER: Guys,
thanks you so much.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:43.010
I know that we've come to time.
