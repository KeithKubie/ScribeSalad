00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.791
Between 1990 and 2010, 25 million Americans
lost their religion.

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:09.360
At the same time, they also began spending
400 million hours per day on the internet.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.360
Coincidence?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.920
I don't know.......

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.140
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.480
As religiosity in America continues to fall
at a pretty dramatic rate, scientists have

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.690
been asking: huh?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.690
WHYYYY???

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.770
In a new study published by MIT's Technology
Review, the findings are a little...SHOCKING.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.770
Brace yourself.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.600
They've found that the internet itself may
be responsible for the decline of faith.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.030
Using the University of Chicago's General
Social Survey, computer scientist Allen Downey

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.950
tracked the religious affiliation of thousands
of Americans against other variables like

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.410
religious upbringing, income, education, and...how
much time you spend online.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.629
Here's what he found.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.930
The strongest predictor of religious affiliation
was being raised in that religion.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.910
So, if you grew up Catholic or whatever, this
is the best predictor of being Catholic as

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.910
an adult.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.640
Downey's statistics suggest that similarly,
more people are being raised without a strong

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.190
religious affiliation.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.400
This is responsible for about 25% of the drop
in religiosity.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.250
Another 5% of the drop is attributed to the
rise in college education, which has been

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.020
happening over the same period.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.759
Those with a higher education are less likely
to call themselves religious.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.880
And then.... the controversial portion...he
found the second big drop of 25% is directly

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.469
correlated with time spent online, a category
of person which was basically non-existent

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:23.469
in the 80s.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.200
Which is a really interesting thing to think
about.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.779
Could the internet really be a catalyst for
people losing their faith?

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:28.779
Apparently, yeah!

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:34.030
But it should be noted that this is a CORRELATION,
not a causation - a scientific mantra that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.759
must be repeated ad nauseum.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.880
Basically: we can't conclude that the internet
CAUSES people to lose their faith just yet,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.139
but we can definitely observe a strong pattern
that's occurring here.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:44.569
What might the internet have to do with it?

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.060
One theory is that the internet makes it easy
for people with very different beliefs to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.530
connect personally, to communicate and challenge
the strength of their beliefs.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.669
Being more exposed to other ideologies also
breaks people out of the insulated bubble

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:58.919
of their own physical communities, where that
wasn't possible before the web.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.720
The internet also provides a vast body of
information about all different types of belief

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.969
systems -- which creates more of a demand
to question your own.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.599
Of those belief systems people are getting
more information about is a non-religious

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.470
worldview, which is becoming a more well-known
and accessible alternative to more traditional

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.470
belief systems.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.439
It's all very interesting to me -- and even
moreso that there's still about 50% of the

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.330
religiosity drop that is unaccounted for.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.299
Down below (On our facebook page), what do
you think?

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.640
Will the internet make atheists of us all?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.310
Or could the internet be used to promote religious
faith as well?

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.299
Thanks for joining me folks, I'll see you
next time with more science updates!
