(whoosh)

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.060
This program is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.213
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:13.009
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.233
(upbeat music)

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.526
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:38.700
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.810
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.550
Our guest today is Neil Shubin

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.570
who is Provost of the Field Museum

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.260
as well as Robert R. Bensley,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.900
Professor of Organismal
Biology and Anatomy

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.930
at the University of Chicago,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.470
where he serves as Associate Dean.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.580
He's the author of the
book Your Inner Fish,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.610
a Journey into the 3.5
Billion-Year History

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.370
of the Human Body.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.700
He's visiting the Berkeley campus

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.690
as the Hitchcock professor
in the spring of 2009.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.100
Neil, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.060
- Thank you.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.620
- Where we born and raised?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.540
- I was born and raised in Philadelphia.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.930
- Aha, and looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.470
shaped your thinking about the world,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.780
the universe, I should say.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.737
- Yeah my folks, I mean, my
folks encouraged curiosity

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:32.550
and that was the biggest thing in me.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.130
I was a sort of kid who
had a new hobby every week.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.190
I would want to telescope one week,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.590
rock hammer the next week,
it was always science,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.120
and they encouraged me
exploring in a lot of ways.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.710
And I think that, and I can trace so much

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.110
of my interest in science

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.540
and ultimately the way I do science

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.450
to the way my parents
encouraged my curiosity.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.639
- And I assumed that
they were very supportive

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.410
generally, basically.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.140
- Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.270
I mean one of the things we
always did was go to museums.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.340
And it was, you know just
our form of recreation,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.290
museums, acuaria, things like that.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.870
And I just remember, you know,
looking at museum exhibits

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.540
or seeing fish in the aquarium

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.140
and it would just capture my imagination

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.160
as a young kid, you know.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.592
And it still does in some ways.

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.070
- And what about high school?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.550
Any teachers before you
were off to college?

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.480
- Yeah, I had some really
excellent teachers in high school.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.990
I was really fortunate that way.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.720
What happened is actually
being in Philadelphia.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.340
In 1976 I was about 10th or
11th grade, something like that,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.760
and that was the
bicentennial celebrations,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.330
and it was a very big
deal in Philadelphia.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.210
And I had a history teacher

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.343
who wanted us to learn archeology.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.170
And he was an amateur
archaeologist himself,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.190
and he linked up with archeologists,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.880
and we were working on archeology

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.460
from of the colonial days
and it just blew my mind.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.160
That we can by digging in the dirt

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.240
learn something about our past, you know.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.290
- So in a way you're sort
of piecing things together

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.820
that would prove useful later in life.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.760
- Oh, there's no doubt, looking back,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.590
that was so critical, you know.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.140
- And undergraduate work?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.070
- Yeah. undergrad, I went to
Columbia in New York City,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.540
which was fortuitous in a lot of ways,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.130
because there's the
great museum in New York,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.870
the American Museum of Natural History

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.040
which was a venue that I
hung out and all the time.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.460
I even had a little office
when I was an undergrad there.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.280
There was a curator who basically
set me up with an office.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.600
He saw I was a curious kid,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.210
set me up with an office, a library card,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.440
and keys to the collection.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.263
And he didn't ask
anything of me other than

00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:30.810
just go explore.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.080
It was really remarkable,
what an opportunity that was.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.490
But when I was at in college

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.037
I was interested in biology,

00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:41.480
that's where I really got
interested in biology.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.410
I was started with an
interest in archeology,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.883
but then shifted to biology.

00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:48.710
It soon became clear that
if I wanted to bridge

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.980
my interest in archeology
with my interest in biology,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.240
paleontology, (chuckles)
not a bad way to go.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.857
- And is that what you majored
in as an undergraduate?

00:03:55.857 --> 00:03:58.550
- No, I majored in anthropology, biology,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.750
and I minored in geology.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.610
So there was no paleontology major,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.160
I sorta cut and pasted a lot of stuff.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.280
- And are you already seeing connections

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.510
or were connections being
made between these disciplines

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.430
as you took them as an undergraduate

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.950
and then as a graduate student?

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.070
- I see it in retrospect.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.340
At the time I wasn't seeing it,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.340
but definitely in retrospect
I see how those connections

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.720
were sitting probably in
my subconscious in some way

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.900
and influencing my behavior.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.130
Because I was also very
interested in history as well,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.290
American history, classical
history and things like that.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.890
So all these different tendrils
were sort of coming together

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.980
in paleontology, evolutionary biology.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.330
- And then on to graduate school,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.820
and where did you do your graduate work?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.980
- In Boston, at Harvard.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.220
And I entered Harvard wanting
to work on fossil mammals

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.370
and understand how mammals
diversified, you know,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.100
why if some mammals that climb trees,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.683
others that dig, and so forth.

00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:56.270
And then by about the second
year, switched to fish.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.320
For a lot of reasons.

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.350
Fish and amphibians.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.900
'Cause there are some fundamental problems

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.630
I wanted to get at.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.880
And Harvard was another good choice,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.390
because like Berkeley
actually, it's a big university

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.650
that has a museum embedded inside of it.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.020
And so, again, it's linking
from museum to the laboratory,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.474
that's always been
something that I've done

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.510
and cherished, actually.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.490
You know, a museum has
always been important to me.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.030
- It's interesting because when you think

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.710
of museums and libraries,
you don't think of

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.660
adventurers, which seems to
be a part of your personality

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.870
as we get into your work.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.240
Or is that not fair, is
that not a fair statement?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.350
- Well it's right to think on that way,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.070
but I think that's a miss.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.180
Because that's where the adventures begin.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.630
The adventures begin opening
a cabinet in a museum,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.730
seeing some specimens,
trying to figure out

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.100
the problems that those
specimens show you.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.230
It begins in a library
where you're figuring out

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.420
where to work in the field and so forth.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.200
So my starting point is
always a library or a museum

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.070
because they're revealing
to me the problems,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.580
the puzzles, you know, that needs solving.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.960
- And then, at Harvard,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.750
what did you do your dissertation on?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.450
- I worked on the
development and evolution

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.230
of the limb, arms and legs,
and I came up with a theory

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.000
of the relationship between
arms and legs and fins and fish.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.030
So sort of the transformation
of fins to limbs.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.800
Looking at embryology,
how organisms develop,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.100
and looking at fossils,
so I was trying to link

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.603
my biology and paleontology interests.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:28.640
- So let's talk about what
you are as a scientist.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.640
I guess you are both an
anatomist and a paleontologist,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.310
and so let's go down that road.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.980
What are the skill sets that you think are

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.420
required to do these fields well?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.453
- Well there's the personal skill set

00:06:47.453 --> 00:06:49.560
and then there's the scientific skills,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.055
intellectual skillset, I'll
call it intellectual, really.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:55.820
The personal skill set is you
have to be pretty patient.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.210
(chuckles)

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.590
You have to be able to
sort of sit with a problem

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.120
long enough to find an answer.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.490
Curiosity helps, 'cause
that's what drives you

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.463
and that's the fuel, is
curiosity and has always been.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.211
The intellectual skill
set I think really is

00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:12.630
you know, understanding
the structure of the body.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.170
Knowing the names of
the hulls and the bones

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.610
and the bumps and the nerves
and all that sort of stuff.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.430
Knowing quite a bit about genetics

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.400
but that's sort of critical nowadays,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.100
how genes are inherited
and how they specify

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.223
pattern and anatomy and so forth.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.560
And basically I think the other big piece

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.900
of the skill set, and this
is just sort of generic,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.120
is the willingness

00:07:37.638 --> 00:07:39.180
and lack of fear

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.600
to enter new fields and
to learn new disciplines.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.220
I mean, the way I look at my field

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.040
is not as a separate
silo, as one discipline.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.750
I really look at it as a
puzzle or a problem to solve.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.560
And if you look at it as a
puzzle or a problem to solve

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.180
different disciplines become tools to you.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.930
And so if you can somehow figure out

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.770
how to gain access to
those tools even though

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.730
they might be in another
field like geology

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.143
or or chemistry or something like that,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.800
you will be better off at the end and able

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.780
in your ability to solve your problem.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.140
So I think one of the
most important things

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.470
particularly in today's science

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.080
is the ability and desire
to collaborate or learn

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.000
and extend one's toolkit
to different disciplines.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.257
- You write in your book, you say,

00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:27.480
"the unknown should not
be a source of suspicion,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.670
fear, or retreat to superstition,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.840
but motivation to
continue asking questions

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.377
and seeking answers".

00:08:35.377 --> 00:08:38.433
So you really have to be comfortable

00:08:38.433 --> 00:08:40.800
with moving across fields.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.750
- And taking a leap into the unknown.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.550
You know, when you set off an experiment

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.200
or a new expedition or something,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.800
there's no guarantee of success.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.520
There's a level of risk-taking
that's in this as well.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.670
I mean, scientists are
always taking risks.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.410
Sometimes for quite bold ones.

00:08:59.617 --> 00:09:02.780
It is about finding answers to questions

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.555
and then ultimately, being
able to ask better questions,

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:06.410
(laughing) you know.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.920
The questions don't stop,
they just get better

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.800
hopefully, or more refined,
hopefully, if you're successful.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.593
I was a child of Apollo, the
rocket, not the Greek god.

00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:18.861
(both laughing)

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.080
When I was 14, you know, 10 to 14,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.800
that's when the missions
were going to the moon.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.100
You know, that blew my mind.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.840
That humanity can design a contraption

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.560
that takes people to the
moon and back, you know

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.520
and the ability to do that
still chokes me up to this day.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.370
It's really cool.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.540
- And in this context,
where do you see creativity?

00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:45.163
How would you characterize creativity?

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.250
Is it something that that flows

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.330
from being on top of
all of these disciplines

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.360
and being comfortable with the tools

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.010
that you just described?

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.635
- Creativity comes to us, I
mean, it's hard to capture.

00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:02.890
I think for me creativity
comes at the moments

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.250
when I'm able to throw off the constraints

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.590
of some of my previous
thinking, but not so much

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.480
that I'm not throwing
away to what I've learned.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.313
You know what I'm saying?

00:10:11.313 --> 00:10:13.800
It's it's sort of trying
to see things in a new way

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.100
that was that was sort of
invisible to me before.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.710
Because of maybe mental traps I was in,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.770
or preconceived notions that
are expectations that I have.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.760
And the more I can get away from those ,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.680
the more I can think in new ways

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.560
and do something truly creative, you know.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.436
And so to me it really comes down to

00:10:32.436 --> 00:10:35.790
trying to get rid of some
of your preconceived notions

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.790
and expectations and
always challenging them.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.150
And we're not always good at that,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.210
but I think that's how advances happened.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.330
- Now you had a fellowship at Berkeley

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.130
or the Miller fellowship, and
I think you said yesterday

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.912
in your lecture that this was
a moment in your education

00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:57.851
that was very helpful in
broadening your perspective

00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:02.016
and looking at these problems in the way

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:04.370
that integrative biology does.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.203
- Yeah, very much.

00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:06.036
I mean, remember I said, you know,

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:08.093
when I see the world as a set of problems

00:11:08.093 --> 00:11:10.292
and different disciplines
are tools to answer

00:11:10.292 --> 00:11:12.270
and help tackle those problems.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.570
When I dropped off in
Berkeley as a Miller fellow,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.250
you know, here I was in
Berkeley with a bunch of people

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.960
who look the world the same way.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.920
It was really remarkable.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.820
And so I fed off their sort
of intellectual curiosity,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.187
and energy, and interdisciplinary
approach to science

00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:26.603
and intellectual questions.

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:32.560
- Now, you are doing your work

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.450
at a time when there really, just

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.370
many, many breakthroughs
across fields, basically.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.463
And you talk about that.

00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:48.970
So, it's an exciting time to be doing

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.410
what you're doing because of
the developments in genetics,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.460
the developments in information
technology and so on.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.470
- Hugely so.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.450
I'm asking questions or able
to answer questions today

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.457
that I wasn't even thinking about

00:12:02.457 --> 00:12:05.130
10 years ago, five years ago.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.930
I mean the pace of change is so rapid.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.900
Yet we're still, what's beautiful,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.800
is to be able to apply new
techniques, new approaches

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.700
to sort of the classical problems,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.840
the questions that have been around

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.450
for long periods of times,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.930
that excited anatomist in the 1800's,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.760
to be able to address those
fundamental questions.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.500
That's where the real thrill is, you know.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.563
And when you're able to do
that, it's just so satisfying.

00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:33.617
- And in your book, you
talk about your experiences

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.773
and lecturing medical
students about human anatomy.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:43.823
So this is, I would presume that

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.100
in a previous generation,
were paleontologists

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.933
teaching in medical school?

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:51.630
- Yeah, from time to time they were.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.903
Yeah, it wasn't highly unusual.

00:12:53.903 --> 00:12:56.260
In fact, as you know,
to be a paleontologist

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.060
you have to be a pretty good anatomist.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.210
And you know, paleo anthropologists,
it's routine for them

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.408
to be involved in anatomy departments.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.050
Fish paleontologists like
myself, or amphibian ones,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.577
it's not as often.

00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:09.500
But it's not that much of a stretch.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.479
I remember when I started
teaching human anatomy

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:15.430
the students would come
to me and they'd say,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.034
Dr. Shubin, what kind of doctor are you?

00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:19.275
(both laughing)

00:13:19.275 --> 00:13:20.108
Let's see, are you a surgeon

00:13:20.108 --> 00:13:20.941
or are you a cardiologist or something?

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:22.440
I said, well, I'm a fish paleontologist.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.970
He's like, I want my money back.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.803
- A fish doctor

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:26.620
- Yeah, right, he's like,
I want my money back

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.570
or something like that.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.580
But it became pretty clear,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.090
as you can begin to teach the course,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.870
that being a paleontologist,
an embryologist,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.290
a fish paleontologist, in particular,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.380
actually offers a nice
roadmap to the human body.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.990
So became pretty, pretty
powerful actually.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.765
- And now you, in your work, you have made

00:13:43.765 --> 00:13:47.174
an important discovery and this came,

00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:49.130
and we'll talk about that in a minute,

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.820
because at some point you
decided you were interested

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.830
in these periods of revolution in

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.950
the evolution of animals and man.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.320
Talk about that interest
and where it came from.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.830
- Sure, if you look at the history of life

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.290
there are certain moments
where it seems like

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.780
revolutions in the air, where
major changes are happening.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.260
In the origin of body plans

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.740
or the origin of diverse kinds of fish,

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.845
the origin of different kinds
of creatures we call reptiles,

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:23.820
you know, things like that.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.900
Seeing those periods helps me choose

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.386
the intervals to work
on as a paleontologist.

00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:30.570
And so I work on Devonian age rocks,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.320
which are rocks about 365 to
380 or so million years old,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.150
of that portion of the Devonian.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.400
And I do that because that's
when a lot of groups of fish

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.550
first came about,
including fish with legs.

00:14:43.423 --> 00:14:45.930
And then also work on rocks
about 200 million years old,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.010
because that's when
different kinds of creatures

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.340
we call reptiles came
about, including mammals

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.832
and crocodiles and dinosaurs

00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:55.450
and all kinds of different
kinds of amphibians.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.600
So, those have always attracted me

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.570
because when you run a field expedition

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.940
in one of those intervals,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.290
there's always the chance
of finding something

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.740
that will tell you about one
of these great transformations,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.990
these great transitions.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.860
- You quote Eisenhower in your book

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.860
who said, "in preparing for battle,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.570
I have found that planning is essential

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.140
but plans are useless".

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.290
- Yeah, 'cause there's always, I mean.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.330
So take working in the
Arctic, for example.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.080
I plan like crazy to work up there.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.010
With my colleagues, you
know Ted and Garish,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.404
who we planned together.

00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:29.700
We plan the expeditions
down to the last candy bar.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.360
You know, all the food goes
up there and everything.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.580
- You better bring them, my guess,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.274
'cause it's cold up there (both chuckling)

00:15:36.274 --> 00:15:38.514
and the nearest town is not San Francisco.

00:15:38.514 --> 00:15:41.681
- Exactly, and that's your
entertainment, you know.

00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:43.113
So it's a good idea.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.790
Yet, you know I make all these plans,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.650
we do all this, and have move days,

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.227
and plan when the helicopters
are gonna get there

00:15:49.227 --> 00:15:50.650
and so forth, but at some point

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.930
you have to throw the plans away,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.380
because the facts on the
ground change everything.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.470
You have to be flexible.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.050
The weather, mechanical may be bad,

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.860
there may be mechanical problems.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.710
You may discover something in one place

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.990
and want to stay there longer,

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.300
or not be discovering something in a place

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.620
you had high hopes for.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.120
So you have to retain
a degree of flexibility

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.680
as the facts on the ground change.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.330
And the only way you can be
effective and be flexible

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.010
is to plan like crazy, I
mean you need that sort of

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.930
knowledge of all the parameters

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.909
and planning helps you do that.

00:16:21.909 --> 00:16:24.233
But you have to throw them away. (laughs)

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.480
- And you, and I want to
get the name right here,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.340
your great breakthrough

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.660
was the discovery of tiktaalik,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.320
a large freshwater fish
that had characteristics

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.470
that tell us it was a transitional figure

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.111
in the movement from fish to land.

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:52.000
Let's walk through that,
and in being interested

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.860
in these great periods of transformation

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.163
and you turn to geology first,

00:17:00.122 --> 00:17:03.100
and geology tells you a lot

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.960
about where you want to look.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.420
- Oh absolutely, I mean, we work at home,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.570
in libraries, you know,
or on the internet,

00:17:10.978 --> 00:17:13.200
or in the internet to
try to find places to go.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.720
We have a time period in mind,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.470
and the sort of the biggest parameter

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.000
to think about first is what age rocks

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.280
you're gonna work on.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.176
And that's really kind of
what drove us to think about

00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:23.940
finding tiktaalik, was that when we look

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.090
at what we knew about in the record

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:30.380
of fish evolving features
that allow their descendants

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.500
to walk on land, it came
out there's a sort of gap

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.253
in our knowledge in rocks
around 375 million years old.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.610
So that sort of insight
was really critical.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.294
Then it became clear
that we had to find rocks

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.550
of the right type, places in the world

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.980
that had rocks of the right
type to find fossil fish.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.830
And then, you know, with
that screen or that filter

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.920
we would look at geological maps.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.502
We would look at aerial photos

00:17:57.502 --> 00:18:00.530
and then try to figure out where to go.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.297
- And even college
textbooks for one thing.

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:03.130
- Well that's what I was saying,

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.963
so I applied all these great things,

00:18:03.963 --> 00:18:05.950
and we were looking at geological
maps and all this stuff.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.380
And had some ideas, but
the ultimate insight

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.140
that led to the discovery of tiktaalik

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.330
came from a college geology textbook

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.310
and showed me an area, and Ted Daeschler,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.097
who I've been working with for years,

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.650
it showed me, it showed Ted and I,

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.320
an area we hadn't even
considered before. (chuckling)

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.090
- But in the beginning, with no budget,

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:30.010
you were actually, you had a
comparable area, fortunately,

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.460
in the state of Pennsylvania
where you were teaching.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.293
- Yeah, exactly/

00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:37.130
- So you could you could go
down the road, so to speak.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.550
- Oh literally, yeah, and spend, you know,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.400
20 bucks on a field
expedition driving from a car.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.680
And that was productive,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.530
but those rocks were sort
of too young to produce

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.630
a tiktaalik like creature.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.980
We were already finding limbed animals

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.006
that were fairly far along.

00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:50.839
- Right

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.680
- You know. and so we had to move back

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.330
about 10 million years in time

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.610
and that's when the search
for a new area began

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.488
in about the mid '90s.

00:18:57.488 --> 00:19:00.970
And then we sort of ran into
this college geology textbook

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.600
during an argument, actually,
in my office in Philadelphia.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.930
We ran into this
undergraduate geology textbook

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.940
and found that the Canadian Arctic

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.303
had enormous amounts of exposed
Rock of just the right age.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.679
- Now it's very clear that
in your work serendipity,

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:22.620
is also at play, which
we haven't mentioned yet,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.258
and when you chose the site

00:19:26.258 --> 00:19:29.730
for the the kinds of formation of rocks,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.220
which were accessible, and
the rocks were from the period

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.853
that you were interested in,

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:38.650
you had an undergraduate assistant

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.650
who began this discovery, in a sense,

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.690
by being late returning back to camp,

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.960
but tell us about that.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.160
- Yeah, what happened was
we had a college student

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.750
who wanted to learn
paleontology named Jason Downs,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.130
University of Pennsylvania
at the time, he was a senior.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.693
And he came along with us.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:03.520
Jason, he somehow got separated
from the team this day.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.037
We all went back to prepare dinner,

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.930
it was around 7:00 and there was no Jason.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.830
And that's a worry.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.480
When someone gets separated
and dinner rolls around,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.313
and you're not seeing them,

00:20:12.313 --> 00:20:15.260
that's when you begin to
worry if they're in trouble.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.080
Maybe they hurt themselves,
sprained their ankle somewhere.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.124
The Arctic's a big place, and
if they're if they're hurt

00:20:21.124 --> 00:20:22.350
it would be a challenge.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.380
- And you actually go out
on your own, basically.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.470
- Well, we usually go out in groups of two

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.790
that was the weird thing about this.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.680
I mean, you're not
supposed to get separated.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.760
And Jason got separated.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.660
- I see.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.666
- And so we were beginning to worry

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:36.807
and then we heard footsteps,
you know coming to the tent.

00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:37.640
(vocalizing zipping)

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.473
Tent opens up and there's Jason.

00:20:38.473 --> 00:20:40.260
His eyes are like orbs,
you know. (chuckles)

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.093
He's out of breath.

00:20:41.093 --> 00:20:43.280
We worried that Jason's being chased

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.680
by a polar bear or what have you.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.230
But the real reason became clear

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.470
why he was so excited and late

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.740
was every pocket of
his parka and his pants

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.290
was filled with fossil fish bones.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.200
What happened is during that absence

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.768
he had discovered a
layer of rock that was,

00:20:58.768 --> 00:21:02.746
contained like a carpet
of fossil fish bones.

00:21:02.746 --> 00:21:05.220
So then, you know after talking to Jason,

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.010
after he'd calmed a bit and
told us where the area was,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.630
we decided, it's the Arctic,
it's daylight 24 hours a day,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.120
You know, dinner can wait.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.580
We grab the candy bars. (chuckles)

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.110
And off we went to Jason's little site.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.268
To look for the layer and try to map it.

00:21:19.268 --> 00:21:22.820
And it took us a while to find the layer,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.300
took quite a while, actually.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.950
And then when we did, it
turns out it was skeleton.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.890
And that layer was produced by,

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.900
That layer of fish bone
fragments was produced by,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.540
skeleton after skeleton of fossil fish

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.490
weathering out of the rocks.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.590
So it was really neat.

00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:40.710
- And, the discovery was
made on a subsequent trip?

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.725
You went back, yeah.

00:21:41.725 --> 00:21:42.920
- Yeah, several years later, actually.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.250
Nothing happened easy there.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.880
It took us about six
years to find tiktaalik.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.591
It took us a while to really hone in.

00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:52.200
Jason's site, we had to
work it for two years

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.000
before we found anything really important.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.480
- And was your fish
found at that same site?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.313
Yeah, right.

00:22:00.365 --> 00:22:04.830
And so what, do you
demarcate the site and then

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.172
it remains secure during these?

00:22:09.172 --> 00:22:10.362
- Yeah, you're in the
middle of nowhere, yeah.

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.195
You're in the middle of
nowhere, nobody's gonna

00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:12.560
see, find it.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.890
They'd have to really spend a ton of money

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.003
and time to get to it.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.560
And it's also specialized.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.610
There's no, really, there's no fear

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.576
of somebody working that site and finding

00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:25.223
and they'd have to know,
really, some detailed geology.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.880
I could take someone
to that site right now

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.700
and show it to them, and
they still wouldn't know

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.827
where the layers, you know.

00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:31.900
You have to work there for a while

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.800
to really get the nuance of what the rock

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.807
and, what the difference
between rock and fossil is,

00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:36.970
and so forth.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.410
- So the discovery is
made in the sense that,

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:45.410
hey, this is a place to look, over time,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.660
and then the, on the return
trips, you're carefully

00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:53.560
digging in to go down.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.120
- And so you're exposing
it as a big platform

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.360
a flat bed, if you will.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.800
And on that bed were skeletons,
some partial, some complete,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.050
you know, some on top of one another,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.710
some mushed against each other.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.453
And as we did it, we
weren't finding anything,

00:23:08.328 --> 00:23:10.530
you know, truly important.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.070
I mean, they were interesting,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.040
they're telling us something
about the ecosystem,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.780
but it took us a while, there
was a lot of frustration.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.870
You know, and part of it, you
know, part of this serendipity

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.320
taking over here is
being persistent enough

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.190
to let that happen.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.023
- [Harry] I see, right.

00:23:23.023 --> 00:23:26.160
- You know, and we made
the conscious decision

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.050
to stick on this site for a period of,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.940
a long period of time.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.203
You know, several years.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.610
We, in fact, the year we
ended up finding tiktaalik,

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.850
which was 2004, I remember a conversation

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.160
three months before we went to the field

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.462
with Ted and Garish,

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:42.950
really starting asking the question,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.290
do we really want to go this year?

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.376
I mean, have we done it enough?

00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:49.450
And we all decided no,
no, one more go, you know.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.710
And that's.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.030
- Now what you're finding on the top,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.170
is it different kinds of fishes

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.751
or pieces that you can't
make anything out of it?

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:05.140
And as you go down, are you going

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:10.140
into earlier or different
years, basically in the layers?

00:24:10.624 --> 00:24:11.963
- This is actually one layer.

00:24:11.963 --> 00:24:15.040
And so we expose that one
single layer as a giant bed.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.870
And it's all kinds of
different species of fish.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.790
There may be 10 to 15 species of fish

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.940
coming out of this layer.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.630
None of them horribly
novel for that time period.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.600
You know, and so we're
finding lots of fish,

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.420
and lots of different species of fish,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.813
but nothing like
tiktaalik, nothing at that,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.380
part of the Tree of Life, you know.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.120
- But they are all from the same period?

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.953
- Yeah

00:24:38.953 --> 00:24:39.786
- Basically?

00:24:39.786 --> 00:24:41.280
Now in finding them and saying,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.120
oh there's, you know, X,

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.920
or oh there's Y,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.351
that propels you forward
because it's telling you

00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:52.140
that the question mark
may be somewhere there.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.730
- Yeah, exactly, and then
when we, once we know

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.530
what tiktaalik looks like,

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.670
and that gives you confidence

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.190
that when you go somewhere else

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.960
your eye will be a little more trained

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.840
to find it if it's there.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.900
Then we have it from a
couple other sites as well.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.280
- Now how did you know what
tiktaalik would look like?

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.149
You hypothesized it, yeah.

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:12.550
- Basically, if you look at the transition

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.300
from a low fin fish to
an early limbed animal,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.720
you know, you'll see,
you go from a creature

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.850
with a conical head with
eyes on either side,

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.280
and the lobe finned fish?

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.420
These early limbed animals
so a flathead sort of thing

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.380
with eyes on top.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.010
There're other changes as well.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.280
So we knew if we had a
flat-headed fish with scales

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.390
it was gonna be really interesting.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.863
That's exactly what we found,
saw for the first time,

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.830
and that's when we knew we had tiktaalik.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.587
when we saw a flat-headed
fish, it was very serious.

00:25:35.587 --> 00:25:38.690
- And how did, can you
talk about that moment

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.841
when you saw him and

00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:43.330
what were your feelings?

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.163
- Well they're really beautiful

00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:45.707
and we discovered several of them,

00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:47.900
on the forth day of that season,

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.700
that we almost decided not to go on.

00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:54.280
And, my colleague Steve
Gatsey is a professor at Brown

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.710
was working with us that year.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.590
And we were working Jason's
site, cracking rocks.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.097
And Steve says hey guys, what's this?

00:26:01.097 --> 00:26:02.690
And we all sort of ran up.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.320
And, the head of a flat
headed fish, just sticking

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.970
right out of the side
of the hill, you know.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.400
At that moment, we knew, it was exactly

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.233
what we were looking for.

00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:12.870
We didn't know how much of
the skeleton would be there,

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.916
but we knew it was the exact creature.

00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:18.090
It was really, that moment was remarkable

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.555
because it took us six
years to get to that point.

00:26:20.555 --> 00:26:23.595
Six years of blood, seat
and tears in the Arctic.

00:26:23.595 --> 00:26:27.350
You know, it's hard working
there, both personally

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.320
and physically and financially.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.560
You know, you name it.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.400
And so everybody who was involved

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.770
in the project from the start,
who saw it at that point,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.067
it was a huge moment for us.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:37.910
The there was a (giggles), that moment

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.100
went to panic, however, because
getting the rock fossils

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.070
out of the Arctic,
particularly heavy things

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.440
and big things like titaalik.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.280
I mean titaalik, the biggest specimens are

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.113
about nine feet long, is no small matter.

00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:55.960
And our worry shifted,
not how we are gonna

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.030
find these things, to how are we gonna

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.016
get them out of the rock and back home,

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:02.120
because that year we
had really bad weather.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.150
Pretty much every day it
snowed or sleeted on us

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.130
- Everyday and it's not
really conducive for,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:08.963
- [Harry] Yeah

00:27:08.963 --> 00:27:09.979
- glue working on things or plasters

00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:12.100
and the traditional methods we use.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.690
- So is the idea that you take the whole

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.340
area around the fish out, yeah?

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.241
- Wrap it in plaster
and then back it comes.

00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:23.720
- [Harry] And transport it, is that also

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.553
a concern, I take it?

00:27:24.553 --> 00:27:25.580
- Yeah, 'cause then I need the helicopter.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.250
And so, that's why it has to be, you know.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.740
It goes a long way in a sling underneath

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.180
the helicopter or sometimes in the bed

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.240
of the helicopter in the back seat,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.520
but nestled in seat belts and, you know.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.630
And it's a long helicopter ride

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.530
and bumpy and so forth.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.780
- [Harry] So you had one?

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.550
- No, that first year we had 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.560
- But on this spotting and this siting

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.393
- That day

00:27:44.393 --> 00:27:46.620
- That day, so you were able
to take several back with you?

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.770
- The next day we found another one

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.280
and about three days later
we found another one.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.330
It was like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:56.330
Really rapid and it just was,
that week was just incredible,

00:27:56.628 --> 00:27:59.623
because we knew we had wonderful material.

00:28:03.823 --> 00:28:07.450
- At the site are you
carving him out of the rock

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.813
or are you carving the rock and taking

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:10.646
the whole magillah out?

00:28:10.646 --> 00:28:11.580
- Taking the whole magillah home.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.430
- Oh, yeah.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.169
- We don't carve them
out of the rock there.

00:28:14.169 --> 00:28:16.320
That is in the laboratory.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.420
Done under very controlled circumstances.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.770
You know, we're basically
bringing a bid boulder home.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.011
- With bones sticking out of it.

00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:23.610
And we just leave it.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.106
If the bone is showing,
we've already done too much,

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:27.217
(chuckling) you know?

00:28:27.217 --> 00:28:29.924
And so we just try to
lightly work around it.

00:28:29.924 --> 00:28:31.480
Leaving a safety margin.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.390
And you don't always get it right,

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.870
sometimes you do crack
a bone and so forth.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.703
- [Harry] Um hm

00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:37.600
- But that's okay, and
then you rough it out

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.180
and back it comes to the laboratory.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.775
It takes about a month
and a half to get home.

00:28:41.775 --> 00:28:45.210
- Now, I wanna understand how

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.557
this discovery confirmed everything

00:28:47.557 --> 00:28:51.970
that you knew about where to
look and the king of rock.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.697
So this kind of rock was one that was,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.330
such that the skeleton would
be partially visible, yeah?

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.780
- These rocks were formed
in an ancient delta system.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.070
Part of the margins or the
bank of an ancient stream

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.300
or a point bar, or some area that would

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.300
collect the skeletons as they washed

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.510
down the stream in a flooding event

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.343
or something like that.

00:29:20.343 --> 00:29:21.770
And they were rapidly buried.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.020
That's a classic environment,
fossil environment

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.274
for preserving really nice bones.

00:29:27.274 --> 00:29:28.110
- [Harry] Mm hm

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.630
- So it was clearly an ancient river

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.227
and the margin of an ancient river.

00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:34.190
And this geologies perfect for that,

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.330
to find lots of, and
there're other species

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.080
that are coming out of those rocks.

00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:44.543
- How did tiktaalik get his name?

00:29:44.543 --> 00:29:45.376
- Well what happened

00:29:45.376 --> 00:29:46.470
- [Harry] or her name?

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.978
- I have no idea, his, her or whatever

00:29:47.978 --> 00:29:49.640
- Yeah (chuckles)

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.743
- I don't know.

00:29:50.743 --> 00:29:53.470
When we found this creature, you know,

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.890
in the scientific paper it's
our job to give it a name,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.920
a generic and a specific name.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.030
And we wanted the name to be meaningful

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.220
to the Inuit community.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.380
There was a Inuit community
about 200 miles away,

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.400
that was giving us
permits to work up there.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.850
We involved some of their youth

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.787
in our field expeditions at the time.

00:30:11.787 --> 00:30:13.637
And we felt pretty connected to them.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.050
And we wanted them to feel involved

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.340
in the project and in
our work and so forth.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.340
So we worked with the Inuit
traditional knowledge elders.

00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:28.897
And we talked to them,
to come up with a name

00:30:28.897 --> 00:30:31.460
that is meaningful to them and to us

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.680
and a name that we could pronounce.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.460
Now, Inuktitut is a
very difficult language

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.659
on the English speaking tongue.

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:39.750
And so that was not an
easy thing. (chuckles)

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.390
Those two parameters weren't always easy.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.223
And so tiktaalik is their
word for fresh water fish.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.740
And the name stuck and the
species name is roseae, so.

00:30:52.048 --> 00:30:57.048
- So you take the tiktaalik
back to the laboratory

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.830
and what do you find?

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.492
Help us understand why this was

00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:06.886
such an important story
that made the cover,

00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:09.280
the front page of the New York Times.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.060
- Right, so, I wasn't the first person

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.290
to see the beautiful material.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.970
Neither was Ted or any of the other

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.910
senior scientists on the project.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:18.060
It was the fossil preparator.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.590
They're the talented people who

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.210
literally sit with a needle and a pin vice

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.480
under a microscope, removing
the rock grain by grain.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.730
Now they can do this because the bone

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.790
is harder than the rock.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.300
'cause the bone's kind of petrified.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.200
So there's a separation between the two.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.410
And so they use like little mini

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.594
dental tools and pins and
so forth, over months.

00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:42.070
So we brought these things back

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.850
and Fred Mullison in Philadelphia,

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.360
Bob Masek in Chicago worked for months

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.000
removing the rock from the bone.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
- [Harry] Are these different fish

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.460
that they're working on, or

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.820
- [ Other] Different titaalik specimens.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.653
- Yeah, yeah.

00:31:53.653 --> 00:31:55.130
- And so Bob was, we have a dinosaur lab

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:56.750
in Chicago that's really big so we had

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.800
the big specimens of titaalik in Chicago.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.230
There's a smaller lab in Philidelphia,

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.747
they're specialized for smaller stuff

00:32:02.747 --> 00:32:04.720
and so Fred was working
on the material there.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.050
And over a period of
months, tiktaalik gradually

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.920
revealed itself, you know.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.470
First we saw the flat
head with the eyes on top

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.810
Then we saw that tiktaalik has a neck

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.920
then we saw the body with the scales

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.750
on its back and fins, with fin webbing.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.980
Then Bob took apart one of the fins,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.910
took the fin webbing off.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.338
And in it we found, you
know, bones that correspond

00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:26.353
to shoulder, elbow and wrists.

00:32:26.353 --> 00:32:28.399
- [Harry] Mm hm

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:30.350
- You know, over a
period of 5, 6, 7 months,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.330
this creature starting revealing itself

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.980
as sort of a mosaic between fish

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.040
and land living, limbed animal.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.873
- [Harry] Mm hm

00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:40.250
- You know, if I was to hold
it in front of you right now,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.520
you would see is a creature
about four feet long.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.560
One of the smaller specimens.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.450
And you'd look at it and, you know,

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.520
you'd see it has scales on its back

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.510
and fins with fin webbing.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.760
You'd say, ah, fish.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.290
Until you looked at the head.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.790
You'd see it has a crocodile like,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.440
almost flat head with
eyes on top, has a neck.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.600
No fish has a neck.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.870
Then you'd see those limb bones

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.260
that start to look awfully limb like.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.370
Has big fat ribs.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.280
So it has this sort of mix between,

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.980
the characteristics of the
land living animals and fish.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.070
Found at just the right
time in the fossil record

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.930
at around 375 million years ago,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.150
when we'd expect this
transition to be happening.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.743
- So, this discovery,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.070
I wanna go, I'm fascinated
by the way in which

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.350
all these things come together

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.050
So, you're training.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.200
Your knowledge of geology tells you

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.620
which rocks to look in

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.530
and where to go.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.560
And your bringing all
your expertise to bear,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.140
but an undergraduate who
happens to be on the team

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.460
discovers the site

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.823
- Isn't that great

00:33:44.823 --> 00:33:47.900
- Yeah, yeah (both laughing)
and your perseverance

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.800
says, oh, let's go back again at a time

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.500
when you're debating whether to do that.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.550
- Exactly, and you know,
but you bring your crew,

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.840
each with different skills.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.160
And by the way, you have to cover

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.470
a lot of turf up there

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.210
- So you need a bunch of people looking,

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.120
different kinds of eyes and so forth.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.630
- By the way, Jason Downs, who was

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.270
the undergraduate when this was found

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.768
is now a post doctoral
fellow in paleontology.

00:34:08.768 --> 00:34:10.320
So he stuck with it.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.587
- [Harry] So he stuck
with it, yeah. (laughing)

00:34:11.587 --> 00:34:14.190
Having started off on a high note, yeah.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.330
So he decided to go on.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.288
So, back to the fish.

00:34:19.288 --> 00:34:22.750
So, he has a neck, he or she has a neck.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.910
And you can trace out the wrist, the ribs

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.900
and other parts, basically.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.330
And I guess you can say he's an athlete.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.174
He does a kind of push up.

00:34:32.174 --> 00:34:33.007
- [Neil] Yeah

00:34:33.007 --> 00:34:35.630
- Tell us about that and
why that's important.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.485
- Well

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:37.810
- I'm being foresetious,
I should tell you.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.250
- Sure, so titaalik is an animal that

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.240
can support itself on its fins.

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.240
That's pretty clear.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.370
- I mean appendage support
is pretty prominent

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.010
and they could flex at the elbow,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.880
extended sort of the wrist area,

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.400
the equivalent of the wrist.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.350
It has big pectoral muscles,
so it could definitely

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.763
sort of push itself up.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.540
For an animal that's supporting
itself on its appendages,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.550
it's a good thing they had a neck.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.220
Fish don't have necks
because if they want to move

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.870
their eyes or mouth in
space they just swim around.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.850
They're moving in three dimensional space.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.820
But the minute you become
fixed to the ground

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.820
or the substrate, all of the sudden,

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.090
if you want to look around, the
neck becomes very important.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.010
So the neck is tied to
having head mobility,

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.670
to move the head, eyes and
mouth, while the creature

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.721
is fixed on the ground.

00:35:21.721 --> 00:35:25.590
So you see this corelation
among the origin

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.180
of different features in
titaalik for the first time.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.850
It's really remarkable
because you're seeing

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.690
a creature that's specializing for life

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.000
in the shallows, you know.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.082
Still in water

00:35:35.082 --> 00:35:36.930
- tiktaalik has both lungs and gills.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.100
You know, it's ah, but
it's able to support itself

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.817
on the water bottom in
the shallows and maybe

00:35:40.817 --> 00:35:43.520
for short periods in the
mud flats and so forth.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.050
- Do you speculate as to why

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.350
it needed to make this
move and then adapted?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.700
- Yeah, so it's, if you look at the,

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.770
compare water to land at this time period,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.470
water is loaded with predictors,

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.210
loaded with competitors.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.210
It's a pretty, you know,
fish eat fish world

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.880
in these streams that we find titaalik in.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.913
It's living with some
10 - 15 feet long fish

00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:10.560
that are big and nasty.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.200
On land, you have some
of the earliest forests,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.930
you have large arthropods and vertebrates,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.780
but no competitors for
titaalik and its descendants.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.390
So, you know, you compare and contrast.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.900
Land is actually free of competitors,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.890
free of predictors, as apposed to water.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.980
So their may be some
influence of getting away

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.040
from the fight, if you
will, a hostile environment,

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.140
onto land and onto rich food sources,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.910
which exist on land as well.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.190
There's another kind of explanations,

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.815
which I'm not really, you know,

00:36:40.815 --> 00:36:42.863
these are not mutually exclusive.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.930
That is the notion that perhaps

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.410
rising oxygen levels towards the end of

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.360
the Devonian and later
had something to do with

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.660
creatures evolving on land and evolving,

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.860
sort of more of a
reliance on air breathing.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.300
- How long did it take for

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.640
this fish to become what
it was, do you think

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.090
in its relation to its
ancestor that had not

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:14.047
yet become distinctively
what titaalik was?

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.180
- Oh, I'd say you're
probably looking about

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.840
7 million years and then probably another

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.110
10, oh, probably another
7 to 10 million years

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.520
before you get real,
creatures with real fingers

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.870
and things like that, that
are real limbed animals.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.240
- So it's a pretty long
period of time, actually.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.787
It didn't happen fast.

00:37:29.787 --> 00:37:31.937
At least according to
the data we have now.

00:37:33.674 --> 00:37:38.190
Now, in talking about this
discovery you've helped us

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.510
understand how this, you're
working across disciplines

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.760
and about how all these
disciplines are informing

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.260
where you go, what you see, what you find

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.620
and the conclusions you reach.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.210
In your book, The Inner
Fish, you also talk about

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.043
breakthroughs in genetics
and our understanding of DNA

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.660
that essentially allows people like you,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.080
doing this kind of work
to see our relation

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.220
to living animals.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.740
To come to an understanding of

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.990
how they come to be what they are

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.450
and their relation to us, on the one hand,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.820
but also some of the same mechanisms

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.670
may have been a work in this prehistory.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.503
Talk a little about that.

00:38:30.503 --> 00:38:34.350
- Sure, you can put it really
simply and ask the question.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.430
Look at the genetic and
developmental recipe

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.730
that builds the body of
a lone living animal,

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.870
like an amphibian and look at the genetic

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.350
and developmental recipe that builds

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.420
the body of a fish.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.440
And then you can ask the simple
question to compare with.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.030
What's the different
between those two recipes,

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.160
Or among many more recipes?

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.900
- To get to the notions is,
what are the differences,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.020
the genetic differences between, sort of

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.493
the genetic recipe that
builds a limb from a fin.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.170
- Are they major, are
they minor, do you have to

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.460
involve whole new sets of genes

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.240
to have limb come on board?

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.230
And so that's sort of the motivation

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.500
when you get to the
understanding living creatures

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.570
and their genetics and
development and so forth.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.600
When you look at this in more detail

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.630
- And you look at the
genetic, sorta tool kit

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.400
that builds an appendage

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.110
Whether it's a limb or a fin,
they're actually similar.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.540
And what that's suggesting
in a very powerful way,

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.070
is that much of the machinery that builds

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.710
the skeleton of a limb is already

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.290
presence in the fin of a fish.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.389
Sharks, killios fish, things like

00:39:37.389 --> 00:39:40.659
trout and salmon and
those sorts of things.

00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:43.330
And they're distant relatives.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.020
They all have the essential tool kit

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.910
that builds a limb in place.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.400
Now there're subtle
differences between them,

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.480
but there're not huge
differences between them.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.380
So that's sort of the take
home message we're seeing.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.830
Now we're trying to get to say,

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.950
well what are these subtle differences

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.280
and how did fingers arise from those

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.860
sort of, the bones we call
radials in a fish fin.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.490
- And you can look at genes in the genome

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.720
in particular animals and
essentially experiment

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.800
in the lab with living to see how you,

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.610
what triggers the different mechanisms

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.500
to make the substantial changes.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.520
- Exactly, and we can
manipulate the embryos

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.420
and we can look at how
those, what are the switches

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.170
that turns those genes on and off.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.810
How those switches, how do they compare

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.847
between fish and a limbed animal.

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:33.027
And we can ask all those
questions with great power now.

00:40:33.027 --> 00:40:35.290
Oh, and lots of different
kinds of species.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.770
So it's a really great time
to work on all these things.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.260
- And you're saying that the

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.700
great evolutionary transformation did not

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.218
involve new DNA, it's really something

00:40:47.218 --> 00:40:50.480
getting turned on or off and, as a result

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.100
creating a new direction.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.800
- Yeah, basically, you
know, using existing genes

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.210
in new ways is sorta the idea.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.590
Redeploying them,
different times and places

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.210
And so, yeah, it didn't
involve necessarily

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.020
a great genetic revolution.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.420
It's using existing materials.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.160
And when you think about that and that

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.150
this transformation in the fossil record,

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.740
happened over tens of millions of years,

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.740
and the fact that, likely the genetic

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.510
tool kit that makes the
bodies of limbed animals

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.910
is already present in
large state, in fish,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.100
this transition becomes easy to happen

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.800
and the question becomes
why didn't it happen

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.770
a zillion times, why
did it only happen once.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.510
- And sometimes this
doesn't work in the sense

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.740
that we humans wind up
with products of evolution

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.703
that we could do without.

00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:43.158
I use the example of, hiccups
and hernias, actually.

00:41:43.158 --> 00:41:43.991
- Hernias a great one, yeah.

00:41:43.991 --> 00:41:46.120
If you'd look at a human male, I mean,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.540
it makes no sense and it's,
probably to nobody's surprise

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.526
that it makes least
sense in the genital area

00:41:51.526 --> 00:41:55.350
because the way the
spermatic cord, you know,

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:59.500
connects the testis or the vas deferens

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.480
inside the spermatic
cord, connect the testis

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.790
to the penis is this bizarre
loop its taken, you know,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.520
and it takes a bizarre course.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.650
It doesn't take the direct
route from scrotum to penis.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.740
It goes up and around
the bowl of the pelvis

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.354
and down through the hole
of the pelvis, if you will.

00:42:14.354 --> 00:42:17.080
And it's that loop and
the formation of that loop

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.990
that causes a human males problems.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.180
They're more susceptible to certain kinds

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.560
of hernias than females.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.130
And the reason for that is,
we begin our development

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.680
like a fish, with the
gonads, the primordial

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.820
for the gonads up here towards the kidneys

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.024
and the chest, and they descend over time

00:42:36.024 --> 00:42:37.490
towards the scrotum.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.270
In the females the
ovaries descend as well,

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.080
but just not as far 'cause they don't lie

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.431
in the out pocket of the body wall.

00:42:42.431 --> 00:42:45.100
And it's that formation,
that descend of the testis,

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.365
which creates a weakness
in the male body wall.

00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:49.570
And so you can have
hernias that develop during

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.210
the development of that
descent of the testis

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.060
in infants or you can have it in adults

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.380
where there's a weakness in the body wall

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.500
and portions of the gut
cavity get pushed through.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.130
- You write in your book that great ideas

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.745
begin with simple promises.

00:43:04.745 --> 00:43:08.727
And one simple idea that you're saying

00:43:08.727 --> 00:43:11.270
is driving your work is that all of us

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.143
are modified descendens of our parents.

00:43:15.915 --> 00:43:19.553
And that brings a clarity
to how all of this,

00:43:19.553 --> 00:43:21.830
that we've been talking about happens.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.210
- Yeah, and that's Charles Darwin.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.990
One of the main ideas in Charles Darwin's

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.480
origin of species is
descent with modification.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.760
That is we all modify
descendens of our parents

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.930
and we have a family
tree in our own families.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.950
But our family tree
extends to other species.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.730
And our species is a modified descendants

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.810
of the ancestorial species
that we've come from.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:42.340
And if you look at the world in a pattern

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.680
of descendants with
modification, you see the world

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.680
in to form of an evolutionary tree,

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.870
where features can be traced over millions

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.383
and billions of years to their ancestors.

00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:57.070
- Now what is one left
with when one realizes,

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.853
obviously, it's a wonderful insight,

00:44:01.471 --> 00:44:05.860
but how has it effected you're thinking

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.640
about humanities place

00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:13.800
in the universe that we live in?

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.162
- I mean, it's impossible not to see this

00:44:16.162 --> 00:44:19.780
and not to feel an
experience in a powerful way,

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.410
the connection that we have to the rest

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.010
of life on our planet.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.860
I mean, in our genes and
our bodies and everything.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.000
I mean, this is sort of written in the

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.050
Nobel Prize's Medicine of Physiology.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.680
I mean, if you look at the Nobel Prize's

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.390
Medicine or Physiology in the last, what,

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.420
17 years, who have they gone to?

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.340
Well, they've gone to
people working on flies,

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.134
people working on worms, people working on

00:44:39.134 --> 00:44:41.963
sea urchants, yeasts, sea slugs, corn.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.400
And all these are work on
other creatures to provide

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.563
insight about human health.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.090
So I'd like to think as we discover cures

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.120
or treatments for things that ail us

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.890
like Alzheimer and
various types of cancers,

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.650
those treatments or cures will ultimately

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.060
be derived from work originally done

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.022
on flies and worms and
yeast and sea urchants.

00:45:04.022 --> 00:45:05.750
I mean can you imagine a more powerful way

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.780
to state our deep connection to the rest

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.835
of life on our planet than that?

00:45:08.835 --> 00:45:11.760
And that's all because
of the evolutionary tree.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.770
You know, the descendants
with modification

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:14.870
that Darwin was talking about.

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.160
- Now how do you think that the mans power

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.490
over technology will effect our evolution?

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.380
I mean, are we gonna
see unbelievable changes

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.686
where in a sense, we are impacting

00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:34.686
these processes that you've
discovered in far away times?

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.943
- We are, I mean, our culture,

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:43.790
our society social structure, the gizmos

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:47.340
and technologies we devise,
whether it's our medicines

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:52.253
or machines that enhance
our performance, our lives,

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.400
that effect the way we see the world

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.630
and interact and behave and so forth.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.500
Those kinds of structures are very much

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.770
gonna influence our future in a great way.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.750
Much more than our genes, right?

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.760
I mean, that doesn't say
that our genetic evolution

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.820
isn't happening and continually happening

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.540
and is not important.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.120
Just look at the threats
of infectious disease

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:13.953
that we face.

00:46:13.953 --> 00:46:16.120
We're at a continual war with microbes.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.210
But sometimes we're able to mediate that

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:22.590
with our medications, but
we're, at a Darwinian level

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.748
we're still evolving, very much so

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.970
and we're still at war, if you will

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.019
with the bugs that are around us.

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.090
And we're not always at war, it's we're in

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.150
a sinbiotic relationship
with many of them as well.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.490
But our technologies are gonna
influence our performance.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.200
And they already are in so many ways.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.570
You know, look at doping scandals

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.403
and bicycling and baseball.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.390
Look at the technologies that can enhance

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:47.930
human memory and muscle mass
and all basic parameters

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.180
of what we are, you know.

00:46:50.123 --> 00:46:52.750
So, you come back in 500 years, I mean.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.558
Human performance will be
driven largely, I think

00:46:55.558 --> 00:46:58.020
by social structures and technologies

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.273
that enhance them.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.690
- Does these discoveries in
these fields that you work in,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.880
in what way do they interface with the

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.870
global warming problem, if any at all?

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.245
I mean, is it just that we get a sense of

00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:13.770
how it all, sorta fits together

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:18.550
and that at a certain point man has to

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.900
draw a line as to what it wants to do

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.431
in certain directions least
it harm the environment?

00:47:25.431 --> 00:47:26.370
- Well, on the fossil record we see

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.640
the influence of global warming.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.890
We see the influence of
global change in general

00:47:31.779 --> 00:47:34.340
on faunas and floras and
extinctions and so forth.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.350
I mean, there's a finely tuned balance

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.950
between changes in the
climate and the atmosphere

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.804
and the kinds of life and their
distribution on our planet.

00:47:43.804 --> 00:47:46.850
What's challenging here
is the rate of change

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:48.770
is not something we've
been able to measurer

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.763
in the kind of fossil record
that I work on, easily.

00:47:53.266 --> 00:47:56.000
And so, it doesn't lend
us the predictive power

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.490
in the kinds of challenges
we're gonna face

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.480
as a society as a result
of our own activities.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.970
- Looking at, reflecting
on your career now,

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.750
how would you advise
students who are interested

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.590
in this stuff to prepare for the future?

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.260
I mean, obviously become, develop skills

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.520
and a lot of discipline,
you've been saying.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.900
- Yeah, but it starts
with the liberal arts.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.733
It really does.

00:48:18.733 --> 00:48:20.630
You know, a good liberal
arts education can't be beat.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:21.463
You need it.

00:48:21.463 --> 00:48:22.296
It's an essential.

00:48:22.296 --> 00:48:25.202
Reading, writing, the
classics, literature,

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:29.170
history, science, I mean
just a liberal education

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.830
is the centerpiece for all
of this because that provides

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.580
the grounding for your curiosity.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.120
- Knowing, having a background that's

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.730
sophisticated enough so that you know

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.060
where to look when you have a question

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.620
becomes so important.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.050
And not having fear, you
know to admit ignorance

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:49.010
and ask a colleague and
go into a new field.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.030
I always encourage
students to be aggressive

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.310
with their professors and their teachers.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.130
And sit and say, look I'm
interested in this stuff.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.130
What do I need to know,
how do I do it, you know.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.230
And they'll often be your best advisors.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.140
- How do think that, let's go back to your

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.960
medical school class 'cause,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.920
How do you think you, with this background

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.030
have informed them

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:15.690
and essentially, in
some way impacted their

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.680
educational experience and the way

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:26.540
they think about the
human body as a result of

00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:30.240
the broader perspective
that you bring to anatomy?

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.440
- Well I like to think that, you know,

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.013
at best my aspiration,
let's put it that way,

00:49:34.013 --> 00:49:36.110
is that they look at the
human body in a different way.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.800
Now they are in medical school
for a very particular reason.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.795
They need to know the
structures of the body

00:49:40.795 --> 00:49:43.470
and they need to have that tool kit,

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.220
but along with that, I'd also love them

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.270
to have a appreciation of how important

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:51.680
understanding our connections
to the rest of life

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.501
are to understanding the human body.

00:49:54.501 --> 00:49:56.350
And I know for some medical students

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.183
that's been very important.

00:49:57.183 --> 00:49:59.040
They've emailed me and
we've talked about it

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.320
and you know, everybody's different.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.680
But, at least my aspiration
is absolutely that

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.330
knowing the connections we
have with the rest of life

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.424
on our planet, not only tells us about

00:50:08.424 --> 00:50:11.470
the structures of our body,
but the ways our bodies

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:14.410
are unintelligently
designed and they fall apart

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.090
from time to time.

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:19.850
- Well on that note, Neil,
I wanna thank you very much

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:20.683
for being here.

00:50:20.683 --> 00:50:22.500
Let me show your book.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.677
Your Inner Fish, which
is a fascinating read

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.710
for young and old and
it really gives a sense

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.840
of what your field is
up to and the remarkable

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.210
discoveries that you
and your team have made.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:38.140
Thank you very much.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:38.973
- Thanks for having me.

00:50:38.973 --> 00:50:40.940
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.013
for this Conversations With History.

00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:47.066
(upbeat music)

00:50:51.963 --> 00:50:54.546
(upbeat music)

00:50:59.445 --> 00:51:02.028
(upbeat music)

00:51:06.944 --> 00:51:09.527
(upbeat music)
