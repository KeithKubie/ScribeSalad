00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Well guys the weather is starting to get a bit warmer outside and that means pretty soon you are going to be pulling the barbecues out of the side shed

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.600
So for this project I thought it might be fun to try a little charcoal igniting life hack to help you with your summer grilling.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.800
now the only materials you are going to need for this simple life hack, is one of these paper egg cartons as well as some of these charcoal  briquettes that you would normally use for barbequing anyway.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.880
now if you've ever tried working with charcoal before, you are going to know that its really messy stuff and If you get this stuff on your hands it leaves marks everywhere. It's very dirty.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.180
it also takes quite a bit of work to get it to ignite.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.780
holding a simple barbeque flame against it will not light it off.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.520
it takes a lot more than that.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.840
so the purpose of today's experiment is to make a clean and tidy little charcoal starting bundle that will light off in an instant and get our charcoal glowing and make summertime barbecuing that much easier.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600
Alright so here's the basic idea:

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.740
We're going to start off with some of these paper egg cartons, they come in different sizes.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.320
you can get a pack of six for a smaller barbeque bundle

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.280
or you can just go with the 12 pack for something a little more substantial.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.480
now the idea here is almost as simple as taking your charcoal briquettes and setting them down in the slots designed for the eggs.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.580
once all the slots are filled up, go ahead and fold over the lid and now its almost ready to ignite with the exception of one small modification.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.120
when we go to light these things off we want them to catch fire and burn thoroughly. so we need a channel for the air to flow, because without the air, fire will not [ burn ]

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.740
if you look on this end of the box where it was chopped in half, you can see there are two are holes naturally formed. So we're gonna flip it around and replicate that same idea on the other end

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.400
so using a pair of scissors I just cut a
small hole in the end here so now we've got a vent hole in both of the ends,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.620
and I made a few slits along the top as well so we could peel that open and form a hole in the top as well.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.700
we want the fire to be able to flow up and through the
container and not get smushed and pushed

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.120
off to the side so there we go it almost
seems too easy but just like that we

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.420
have a clean compact container it's very
affordable and with a simple lick of a

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.600
BBQ igniter we can get our charcoal
going now without paying at any further

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.420
attention all right it's time for the
burn test so let's take this thing

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
outside light it up and see how it does
all right guys I brought you outside so

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.160
we can put this thing to the actual test
looking inside here you can see this is

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.220
charcoal straight out of the bag it has
not been pre lit it hasn't been tampered

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.400
with in any way I just stuck it in this
container we're going to light this off

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.460
so you can see how it actually performs
so you can decide for yourself if it's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.880
something you'd actually use so for
demonstrational purposes I'm going to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.040
use this little Weber grill we're going
to set this thing right down on the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.940
bottom
light it off and watch it burn.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.930
one side is lit

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.500
okay so lighting the top isn't going to
work because all the heat is traveling

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.200
upward and it's not burning down so
we're actually gonna have to light this

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.010
thing from the bottom so he can travel
up to the cold let's just light it right

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.580
here in the middle and see how that goes

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.390
the thing I love about these egg cartons
is there are natural air channels built in

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.510
to allow the air to flow and feed the
flame so even when we turn it upside

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.520
down the flame will keep going and here
you see why it's really important that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.360
we have this little vent hole in the top
to allow the air to flow and heat to build.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.520
now we wait.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.280
guys it's been 15 minutes since we first
lit it off so let's go take a look

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.780
so the charcoal has started off you can
see it's turning white there, turning into ashes

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.560
and that's exactly what we
want you can see all the paper has burned

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.830
down to a white ash but every single one
of these briquettes did start off

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.640
they're burning just the way that they
should they're all grouped together and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.800
I think at this point it should be safe
to go ahead and throw on the grill and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.900
cook up some hotdogs

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.200
alright so quick update guys our hotdogs
have been sitting on the grill for a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.060
little over half hour so let's go take
our first peek and see how they're doing.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.600
I think they're done, still nice and warm. Let's
take a look here let's crack them open

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:06.360
looks like they're cooked all the way through, even a little juicy. yum.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:23.460
perfect! six coal, six hot dogs. let's eat. grilling in May. [laughs]

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.480
now, if you want your BBQ starter to ignite even faster you can grab a small piece of printer paper and simply wrap

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.720
it around the box a thin sheet of
printer paper like this will go up in

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.870
flames a lot faster than an egg carton
and I like to wrap mine around the box

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.750
and tape it at the bottom just it looks
a little bit nicer the paper just acts

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.450
as a tinder to make the cardboard go off
a little bit faster but it also gives it

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.240
a little bit cleaner look as well and if
you just want to have a little bit more

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.150
fun and take it to the next level you
could use some string or some twine to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:55.689
bundle it up into a package or in my
case firework fuse

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:26.499
yay it works! that's actually really
cool

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.049
so there you have it guys a quick and
simple hack using some briquettes and

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:33.559
some egg cartons to make a really cool
self-starting bundle of charcoal

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.229
hey thanks for joining me for this
experiment I'll be looking for you the

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.309
next one talk to you then
