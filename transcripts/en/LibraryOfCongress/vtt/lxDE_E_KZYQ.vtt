00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Hello.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.850
Welcome to the Library
of Congress, everyone.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.010
Nice to see you at
noon on a Thursday.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.430
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.810
I'm the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center here

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.460
at the Library, and I'm
honored to present the first

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.960
of our programs associated
with the Library's Exhibit,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.430
Echoes of the Great War,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.360
American Experience
of World War I.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm going to see,
before I go any further,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.120
I want to just check
something else out.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.850
I'm just checking.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.150
How does it sound like there?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.760
Can you hear me okay?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.060
All right.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.560
This exhibition in the Southwest
Gallery of of the second floor

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.140
of the library's Historic
Thomas Jefferson Building

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.040
across the street examines
the upheaval of World War

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.130
as Americans confronted it
both at home and abroad.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.580
It considers the
debates and struggles

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.770
that surrounded US
engagement, explores US military

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.570
and Homefront mobilization
and the immensity

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.210
of industrialized warfare and
touches on the war's effects

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.340
as an international peace
settlement was negotiated,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.840
national borders were
redrawn, and soldiers returned

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.760
to reintegrate into
American society,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.790
a theme that Yusef will talk

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.840
about a little bit later
in his presentation.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.110
Today's event is
presented in conjunction

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.860
with the library's
Veteran's Day programming.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.120
This programming is
part of the Library

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.830
of Congress Veterans History
Projects programming efforts

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.300
that began on November
7th and will continue

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.380
on until November 11th.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.290
Congress created the Veterans
History Project in 2000

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.000
to collect, preserve, and
make accessible the first-hand

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.880
remembrances of America's
War veterans from World War I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.370
through the most
recent conflicts in Iraq

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.230
and Afghanistan so that future
generations may hear directly

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.740
from veterans and better
understand the realities of war.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.620
To find out more about the
Library's Veterans Day program

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.270
and its World War I exhibit,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.470
you can visit our
website, www.loc.gov.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.230
If you want to see our
literary programming,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.300
you can go to
www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.790
We also have a signup sheet
in the foyer if you want

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.840
to join our Events Listserve
and get more information

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.820
about the future of
literary programming.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.810
Before I tell you more about
this event, let me ask you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.220
to turn off your cell phones

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.930
and any other electronic
devices you have

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.670
that might interfere
with the program.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.380
Also, I'd like to let you know

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.820
that this program is being
recorded for webcast,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.660
and your participation
gives us permission

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.450
to broadcast this event.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.920
So, just so you know.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.990
The focus of the Poetry

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.870
and Literature Centers
World War I programming is

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.290
to link the literature of
the Great War to the poems

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.160
and stories of today's
American poets and writers.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.310
For our kickoff event, we've
asked one of our greatest poets

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.030
to set the stage for the series.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.480
You can read more about Yusef
Komunyakaa in your program,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.580
which should be on your chairs,
and you can see his many honors,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.400
including a Bronze Star, which
he received as Managing Editor

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.390
of the Southern Cross newspaper
during the Vietnam War.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.820
I first encountered Yusef's
work over a quarter century ago

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.370
when a professor
assigned Dien Cai Dau

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.690
in our Creative Writing
workshop, and I'm excited to say

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.570
that Dien Cai Dau is
for sale in the back.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.540
I will never forget the
experience of reading this book.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.710
I've seen war through the
beautiful and violent lyricism

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.300
of We Never Know,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.120
and of encountering the Vietnam
War first through facing it,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.170
one of the most powerful
poems of our time.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.760
I will always be grateful to
Yusef for what he taught me

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.100
in that book, and I'm thankful
he is here for us today

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.090
to remind us what
poems can do to contend

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.720
with man's most tragic
engagements.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.520
Please join me in
welcoming Yusef Komunyakaa.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:51.490
[ Audience Applause ]

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.250
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: It's
a great honor to be here.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.360
I would like to say upfront
that I'm not a historian,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.250
but I'm a poet who
loves history.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:17.810
I'm going to start by reading
some poems from the Great War.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.570
The first poem is
entitled, I'm Being Asked

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.850
to Write a War Poem,
by W.B. Yates.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:37.700
I think it better that in times

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:46.480
like these a poet's mouth
be silent; for in truth,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.150
we have no gift to
set a statesman right.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.730
He has had enough embattling.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:08.460
Who can please a young girl
and the indolence of her youth,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:16.800
or an old man upon
a winter's night?

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.580
I suppose in a certain sense,
Yates' poem is a warning,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:35.140
but I'm going to just proceed
to a poem entitled the Death

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.460
of a Soldier by Wallace Stevens.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.970
Normally, we don't associate
Stevens with World War I.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:07.990
Life, contracts, and death is
expected as a season of autumn.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.150
A soldier falls.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:20.660
He does not become a three-day's
personage imposing his

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:29.730
separation, calling for
[inaudible] death is absolute

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.600
and without memorial,
as in a season

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.720
of autumn, when the wind stops.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.690
When the wind stops and over
the heavens, the clouds go;

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.310
nevertheless, in
their direction.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:04.160
When I think about World War I
and the poetry to rise out of

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.100
that conflict, that war, that
bloody war, trench warfare,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.930
I think of Chassoon [phonetic].

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:21.030
And that's a poem
of his that's read

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:26.370
in Texan, and it's called They.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:33.590
I like the fact that it's
called They and not Me.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:45.550
The bishop tells us
when the boys come back,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.220
they will not be the same,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:57.970
for they're that
fought in a just cause.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:06.530
They lead the last
attack on antichrist.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:15.920
Their comrades' blood
has brought new right

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.500
to greed and honorable race.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.570
They have challenged death
and dared him face-to-face.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.720
We're, none of us, the same.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.310
The boys' reply, for
George lost both legs

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.850
and Bill's stone blind.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:56.860
Poor Jim's shot through
the lungs and like

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.510
to die, and Bert's gone.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:15.710
[Inaudible] Atlantic, you're
not fine; a chap who serve

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.880
but hasn't found some change,
and they're Bishop said,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.630
"The ways of God are strange."

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:46.130
Yes. E. Cummings, I have to
admit that E Cummings was one

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.530
of the first poets
I engaged with,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.390
and I never really associated
him with World War I,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:05.580
but here he is, and a strange
poem of his called Etcetera.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:20.940
My Sweet Old Etcetera, Aunt
Lucy during the recent war could

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:30.200
and what is more did tell
you just what everybody was

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.040
fighting for.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:43.690
My sister, Isabel, created
hundreds and hundreds of socks,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:53.580
not to mention shirts,
fleaproof, ear warmers,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:59.530
etcetera, wristers, etcetera.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:06.110
My mother hoped that
I would die,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.350
etcetera, bravely, of course.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:17.720
My father used to
become hoarse talking

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:24.790
about how it was a privilege,
and if only he could.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:33.880
Meanwhile, myself, etcetera,
lay quietly in the deep mud,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:42.280
etcetera, dreaming,
etcetera, of your smile, eyes,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.870
knees, and your etcetera.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.510
Come by insinuation, right.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.080
[ Audience Laughter ]

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.570
And what gets said and what
doesn't get said, I suppose.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:06.010
I think he's having fun, really.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:10.080
The Send-Off by Wilfred Owen.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.210
That's another name that really
moves to the forefront always

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.970
when we think about the
poetry of World War I.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.450
The Send-Off.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:35.310
Down the close, darkening
lanes, they sang their way

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:45.160
to the siding shed and lined
the train with faces grimly gay.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:52.420
Their breasts were struck
all white with wreath

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:58.760
and spray, as men's are, dead.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:09.240
Dull porters watched them, and a
casual tramp stood staring hard,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.450
sorry to miss them
from the upland camp.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:29.200
Then, unmoved, signals nodded,
and a lamp winked to the guard.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:38.290
So secretly, like wrongs
hushed up, they went.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.550
They were not ours.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:48.070
We never heard to which
front they were sent.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:55.540
Nor where if they yet
mock what women sent

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.440
who gave them flowers.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:08.010
Shall they return to beatings of
great bells in wild trainloads?

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:18.770
A few, a few, too few for drums
and yells, may creek back,

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:28.360
silent, to village wells
up half-known roads.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:37.530
And I'm just going to
read two more poems; well,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.930
one more poem associated
with World War I,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:46.670
and this is slightly
different for the simple reason

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.890
because we get to hear
the woman's voice.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:57.830
And that's very important
because there were 947,000 women

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:04.060
who work in the ammunition
plants, and 300 died

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.240
from TNT poison, or explosions.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.540
That's important to know.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.840
Women at Munition Making.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.780
This is my Mary Collins.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.960
Their hands should minister
unto the flame of life;

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:27.450
their fingers guide the rosy
teat, swelling with milk,

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.490
to the eager mouth of the
suckling babe or smooth

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.250
with tenderness,
softly and soothingly.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.230
The heated brow of the alien
child or stray among the curls

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.570
of the boy or girl,
thrilling to mother love.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.610
But now their hands, their
fingers are coarsened

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.320
in munition factories.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.820
Their thoughts, which should fly

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.300
like bees among the
sweetest mind;

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:12.030
flowers gaining nourishment for
the thoughts to be are bruised

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.680
against the law, kill, kill.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.090
They must take part in defacing

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.890
and destroying the
natural body which,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.580
certainly during
the dispensation

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.180
in the shrine of
the spirit, O God!

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:37.690
Throughout the ages, we
have seen, again and again,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:49.750
men by Thee created canceling
each other, and we have modeled

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:58.420
at the seeming annihilation
of Thy work.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.400
But this goes further,
taints the fountain head,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.740
mounts like a poison through
the Creators every heart.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:16.020
O God, must it anew be
sacrificed on Earth?

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:25.510
The question at the end of
the poem is really, I think,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:34.180
a moment of protest,
and I'm thinking

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.700
about other moments of protest.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:49.140
I'm particularly
thinking of an individual

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.370
by the name of Charles Young.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:19:03.160
He had done a simple,
he had wanted to be,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:13.980
he was a full colonel,
and he wanted to be part

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:27.380
of the war effort, but he was
returned as a full colonel

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:41.800
for the simple reason
because he was black.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.490
Now, he goes to prove that he
is agile, that he's physical fit

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.130
because he rides 500 miles

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:31.410
from Wilberforce,
Ohio, to DC by horse.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:42.230
And Charles Young comes up again
when we think of San Juan Hill

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.250
because at Wilberforce,
he had been instrumental

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.920
in training troops that ended

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:59.540
up at San Juan Hill
rescuing the Rough Riders.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:07.510
That was in 1898.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:20.010
What is the situation of the
black man and World War I?

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.410
For me, it's also
personal, but I'm going

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.100
to play this little
clip here from a lyric

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.970
that I wrote a few years ago.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.110
And this is about the 369th.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:58.140
&gt;&gt; I go back in time,
the times like this,

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:05.880
thinking about my
brothers fighting overseas.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.950
Aha, I go back in
time, time like this,

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.510
thinking about brothers
fighting overseas.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:22.280
[ Music ]

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:32.790
Hellfighters of Harlem,
shaking and studying

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.570
for [inaudible],
study for a number.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:43.740
Doing up the site,
[inaudible] they'll set freedom.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:53.580
Singing [inaudible], study for
a number, studying for a number.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:23:02.710
Oh, oh, oh, Jim Crowe over
here, start a war over there.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.890
&gt;&gt; In basic training,
they went to hell.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.280
Down Spartanburg,
off to World War I

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.600
with their regimental flags

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.600
and their French helmets,
down in the trenches.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.140
But they crossed the tree line,
not even giving a few inches

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.410
of the machine gun fire along
the Rhine River, River, River.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:36.590
But when all was said and done,
they had legions of honor,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.890
brass shining in the air.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.190
He was a kid; men who dare.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.550
But and Jim Crowe over here
to fight a war over there.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.510
&gt;&gt; Spare the one [inaudible];
spare the one [inaudible].

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.750
&gt;&gt; It's like we're back in
time to times like these.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.030
Thinking about the
brothers fighting overseas.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.210
&gt;&gt; Singers now; one, two,
[inaudible]; three, four,

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.570
want to leave [inaudible]
One, two, [inaudible]

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:14.270
&gt;&gt; Okay. The reason I
wrote the lyric had to do

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:26.030
with having some
history in my psyche

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:32.290
that I was wrestling with.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:40.340
First of all, the Hillfighters
of Harlem, the 369th,

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.460
fought under the French flag.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.300
Like Americans fought
under the French flag.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:25:00.400
I just wrote an introduction
for an anthology inherent

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:10.750
in the war, and I talk
about my Uncle Jesse.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:27.280
I'm just going to read a
couple of paragraphs of that.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.530
As I reflect, it seems
as if I'm transposed,

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:49.600
standing in the atmosphere of
a memory, a feeling, a place.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.120
I can see the room.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.420
I can hear a voice.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.710
Usually, I'm listening acutely.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:06.400
In this memory, time
is sequential.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.140
I'm standing in the living
room with my great uncle,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:21.480
where my great uncle is asleep,
and I hear him sob and cry.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.320
This is not the first
time I hear him this way.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.870
But in this memory,
I am six or seven,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:37.050
and only the way a
child can, I ask,

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.150
"What are you crying
about, Uncle Jesse?"

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:49.760
He rises, sits on the edge
of the couch, takes my hand

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:56.530
and says, "I was on a
death detail overseas.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.440
Soldiers were dropping
like flies.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.720
We cut trenches in the ice.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.270
I learned what dog
tags are good for.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:15.430
I put one into the mouth
of each dead soldier,

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:21.940
and the other dog
tag in a canvas bag,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.650
and we pushed the
dead into ditches

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.780
until we come back
to dig them up."

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:40.060
Then, he rose a cigarette from
his red canned, a Prince Abbott.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:47.630
My great uncle Jesse was
a veteran of World War I.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.240
He fought under the French flag

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:57.740
because at the time the US
military was segregated.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.090
This image of him
digging up corpses

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:07.070
from the trenches
recurred in my psyche.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:14.700
It had already begun to
direct my childhood play

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.850
where one fights imaginary wars.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:26.330
But perhaps this knowing
also created a real sense

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.430
of reflection.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:36.520
At only six or seven I wasn't
eager to pretend to be dead.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:57.530
I suppose, I'm going
to take a slight turn.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:05.450
I'm going to read a poem
about one year after the war;

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:15.190
it's written in 1919, and
you may know this poem,

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:20.640
If We Must Die by Claude McKay.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:31.020
If we must die, let it not be
like hogs hunted and penned

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:37.000
in an inglorious spot,
while round us bark the mad

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.620
and hungry dogs, making their
mock at our accused lot.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:52.210
If we must die, O
let us nobly die,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:59.690
so that our precious blood
may not be shed in vain;

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:08.240
then even the monsters we
defy shall be constrained

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:14.260
to honor us though dead!

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.170
O kinsmen!

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.960
We must meet the common foe!

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:29.010
Though far outnumbered
let us show us brave,

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.970
and for their thousand
blows deal one death-blow!

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:45.030
What though before us
lies the open grave?

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:52.520
Like men we'll face the
murderous, cowardly pack,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.530
pressed to the wall,
dying, but fighting back!

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:03.530
It's an interesting poem because
if we think about what happens

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:08.780
after many of the
solders return.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.000
The war ends in 1918.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.390
This is also a moment of
great conflict in America,

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.390
especially if we look at
the history of lynching,

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:31.270
and that is what essentially
Claud McKay is responding to.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:39.810
A lot of the individuals who
were lynched are actually vets.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:53.110
The other thing about the poem,
If We Must Die, Churchill,

00:31:53.110 --> 00:32:03.210
World War II, reads the poem to
the English people, to Britain.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:08.530
He doesn't say anything about
Claude McKay writing it.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:20.730
But it's an interesting moment
because the poem has a life

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:32.110
out of its context, you
know, and that is important.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:41.400
I suppose -- I'm going to
read a few of my poems.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:51.920
I'm going to read a few
poems from War Horses.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:07.350
I'm going to read from a section
called, it's a strange title,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.180
Love in a Time of War,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:15.870
but I think you can
believe in that, right.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:23.380
Here the old masters of Shock
and Awe huddle into War Room,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:31.120
talking iron, fire and sand,
alloy, and nomenclature.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.060
Their hearts lag
against the bowstring

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:41.920
as they daydream
of Odysseus's bed.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.330
But to shoot an arrow
through the bull's eye,

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:55.320
the 12 axes lined up in a row is
to sleep with one's eyes open.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:02.370
Yes, of course, there stands
lovely Penelope like a trophy,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:08.380
still holding the brass
key against her breast.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:15.340
How did the evening star
fall into that room?

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:21.870
Lost between plot and loot,
the plucked string turns

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:27.970
into a lyre, humming praises
and curses to the unborned.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.570
I want to say, okay,
here we are.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:58.290
When our hands caress
bullets and grenades or linger

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:04.560
on the turrets and luminous
wings of Reconnaissance planes,

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.670
we leave glimpses of ourselves
on the polished hardness.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:18.480
We surrender skin, hair,
sweat, and fingerprints.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.860
The assembly lines
hum to our touch,

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.220
and the grinding wheels record
our laments and laughter

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.250
into the bright metal.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:35.480
I touch your face, your breast,

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.390
the flower holding
a world in focus.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:46.000
We give ourselves to each other,
letting the workday slide away.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.380
Afterwards, lying
there facing the sky,

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:55.380
I touch the crescent-shaped
war wound.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.570
Yes, the oldest prayer is
still in my fingertips.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.250
Someone's beating a prisoner.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:24.200
Someone's counting red leaves
falling outside a clouded window

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.020
in a secret country.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.470
Someone holds back a river,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:38.390
but the next rabbit jab makes
him piss on the stone floor.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:42.220
The interrogator orders the man

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.670
to dig his grave
with a teaspoon.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:53.900
The one he loves, her name
died last night on his tongue.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:37:01.870
To revive it, to take his
mind off the electric wire,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.940
he almost said, There's
a parrot in a blue house

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.800
that knows the password,
a woman's name.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:23.350
I said I wouldn't write
about Vietnam anymore,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:36.180
and I found myself thinking
about the 14, 15 young black men

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.670
who threw themselves on grenades
in Vietnam, and I'm still trying

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.460
to make some sense out of that.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.200
Where does it come from?

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200
It's not rehearsed;
it's not practiced.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.330
Maybe you can help
me, but I'm going

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.810
to read this poem
called Grenade.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:08.570
There's no rehearsal to turn
flesh into dust so quickly.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:15.050
A hair trigger, a cocked hammer
in the brain, a split second

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.200
between man and infamy.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.650
It lands on the ground.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:25.590
A few soldiers duck, and the
others are caught in a half-run,

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:31.240
and one throws himself
down on the grenade.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:38.710
All the watches stop; the
flash, smoke, silence;

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:43.390
the sound fills the whole day.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:48.680
Flesh and earth fall into
the eyes and mouths of men;

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.010
a dream trapped in midair.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:58.120
They touch their legs and arms,
their groins, ears and nose

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.550
and saying, what happened?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.420
Some were crying;
others were laughing.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.870
Some are almost dancing.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.170
Someone tries to put the
dead man back together.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.770
"He just dove on the
damn thing, sir!"

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:21.150
The flash, smoke, silence.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.570
The day blown apart.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:28.320
For those who can walk
away, what is their burden?

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.800
Shreds, a flash, and
bloody rags gathered up

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.610
and stuffed into a bag.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.100
Each breath belongs
to him; each song,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.750
each curse; every prayer is his.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.890
Your body doesn't belong
to your mind and soul.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.520
Who are you?

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:54.660
They remember the man
left in the jungle;

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.310
the others who owe their
lives to this phantom.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.110
Do they feel like you?

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:06.560
Would his loved ones remember
him if that little park,

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.510
a statue erected in
his name didn't exist,

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.120
and does it enlarge their lives?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.760
You wish he'd lied down
in that closed coffin

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.130
and not wandered the streets or
enter your bedroom at midnight.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:29.480
The woman you love,
she'll never understand.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.580
Who would?

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:37.460
Do you remember what
he used to say,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.160
"If you give a kite too much
string, it'll break free."

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.060
That unselfish certainty.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.810
But you can't remember
when you began

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.110
to live his unspoken dreams.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:08.420
How are we doing for time?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.720
Maybe questions.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.380
Maybe a dialogue.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.700
&gt;&gt; I think that our
reading is up.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.030
I'm going to take that reading
just to ask the first question,

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.030
which is, it gets at our heart
though while we read this

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.330
[inaudible] series.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:30.190
You began by reading some
things from [Inaudible].

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:36.420
To engage here, can you talk
a little bit about [inaudible]

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.580
and War Horses and how
those poets and poems matter

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.640
to you connected to that
work, how you might have felt,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.500
continuing the kind of
theme [phonetic] versions

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.880
of those poems were engagement.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.860
Yusef Komunyakaa: Well,
it's interesting, with,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.930
especially with Yates,
because as a teenager,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:03.840
I would read Yates to my
cousin, and don't even ask me

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:09.140
where that came from, but
that was the situation.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:19.560
But I never really thought of
Yates as a war poet in any way;

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.880
and yet, when I go back
and look at his work,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.920
I do see flourishes; I
do see moments there.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.570
Even with the automatic
writing as such, you know.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:43.600
But when I started writing,
okay, I thought I would write,

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:51.130
not about Vietnam
but poems generated

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.170
through my imagination,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.330
especially when we
think its realism.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.520
Those were the poets
I was really reading,

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.920
the surrealist poets, and also
some of the Negritude poets,

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.140
such as images there,
[inaudible].

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:15.320
How did I get to the war poems?

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.240
I'll tell you exactly how.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:27.980
I was in Louisiana, and it
was a summer; it was August,

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:34.940
and I was renovating a
house, and what I liked to do

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.470
if I'm doing physical labor,

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.780
I like physical labor,
especially carpentry.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:49.560
I keep a pad of paper close by,
and I would descend the ladder

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.600
and write a line down,

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.160
and I found myself
writing a poem titled,

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.900
Somewhere near Phu Bai,

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:09.740
and I just couldn't stop writing
the Vietnam related poems.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.880
I said I would stop
writing those poems as such.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.680
Yes?

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:26.280
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.580
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa:
Somewhere near Phu Bai.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:38.570
The moon cuts through night
trees like a circular saw,

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.530
white hot, and the guard's shot.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:48.650
I leaned on the sandbags,
taking aim at whatever.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.470
Hundreds of blue still
stars cut a path,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:56.790
fanning out, shiver
for a second.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.000
If anyone's there,
don't blame me.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.690
I count the shapes ten meters
out front over and over,

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:10.000
making sure they're
always there.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.020
I don't dare blink an eye.

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.990
The white painted back

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:24.470
of the Claymore mines
like quarter moons.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:29.420
They say Victor Charlie
will paint the other sides

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.360
and turn the blast towards you.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:41.760
If I hear a noise, will I push
the button and blow myself away?

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.840
The moon grazes treetops.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.690
I count the Claymores again.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:58.350
Thinking about buckshot
kneaded into the plastic C4

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:05.650
of the brain, counting
sheep before I know it.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.980
So, yeah, that's the
point that got me

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.610
to the Vietnam-related poems.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.910
Yes?

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.720
&gt;&gt; So, my question
is [inaudible].

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.780
So, my question is I've been

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.030
to European [inaudible]
Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.520
&gt;&gt; Many of them said I never
thought about talking of it.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.220
Some of them said I never
want to talk about this.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:36.220
And some of them talk about
it and say I never want

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.520
to talk about it again.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.820
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.120
Yes.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.420
&gt;&gt; When you wrote those
poems, was it cathartic,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.640
or was it like driving or
drove into a bed of oil

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.930
where everything
came [inaudible]?

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.510
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Well,
yes, everything came forth

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.990
for the simple reason because
I think it had something to do

00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:04.370
with the way my mind works; not
to talk about things as much

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:07.670
as to visit them again and again

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:13.130
through a severe silence,
a kind of meditation.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.630
But I think it has a lot
to do with where I grew

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:22.750
up in Louisiana, a small
town, that I would venture

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:31.750
out into the trees, into
nature, and I took in all

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:36.880
of those elements; and
perhaps, in a certain sense,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.250
I was rehearsing being a poet.

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.820
I'm particularly thinking
about the small things,

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.270
how we take in the small
things, not the monumental,

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:55.420
but those small things
that are accumulative,

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.900
and before you know it,
we have a surprising world

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.860
at our hands, you
know, the psyche.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:09.670
That's what I feel.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.020
I don't know if I, if I'd grown
up in the city, I don't know

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.430
if I would write
poems in the same way.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.950
It would be entirely different

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.200
because we internalize
a terrain,

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.410
and that internalized
terrain becomes an overlay

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.820
for how we experience
and see the world.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.850
So, that's what I believe.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.150
Yes?

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:39.650
&gt;&gt; Yes. Just to continue
on that note,

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:53.370
could you describe your writing
process a little bit more

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:59.890
because as you mentioned when
you were doing carpentry work

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.300
and you have a pencil
and paper near you.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.600
How do you write a poem?

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.310
Are you involved in a workshop?

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:13.610
Do you write a poem and share it

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.110
with somebody else
and get the feedback?

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:20.550
Do you write a poem five, six,

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:24.550
or seven times before
it's considered a poem?

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:28.800
Just describe the process
by which you write a poem.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.480
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: I often
say that I love the principles

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.150
of jazz and proposition.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.860
So, I write everything down.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:41.150
Upon initially maybe 100 lines,

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.720
and I very systematically cut
it back to 40 lines or 30 lines.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.020
Sometimes, I have the allusion
that a poem is complete

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.760
that I return to
and cut it in half.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:50:02.330
Also, revising, sometimes I
start at the bottom of the poem

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:05.180
and read the poem
back up through

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:11.670
and see how many exit
points are there,

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.960
places where the poem
possibly could end

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.650
because I think we want the
reader to know everything,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:27.840
when in fact maybe that's
the wrong direction to go

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:34.150
because the reader is also
an instrument of inquiry,

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:39.150
of genius, and a cold
creator of meaning.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.940
The reader is cold
creator of meaning.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.700
Yes. I believe that.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.660
Yes?

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:04.320
&gt;&gt; Could you about with your
fellow Americans how you combine

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.400
surrealism and use it?

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:13.610
I'm thinking about folks
like you are experienced.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.560
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa:
It starts with define,

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.560
and I read everything
aloud as I'm writing.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.120
So, I think maybe
that's part of it.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.790
Also, if we think about it,

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:36.740
I remember Richard Hugo saying
something very important.

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:43.260
He said, "You know, I write
poems in long and short lines,"

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.610
And I didn't know what he was
talking about when I first heard

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:51.210
that until I really thought
about it over and over.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.070
What he was talking about
essentially was a kind

00:51:55.070 --> 00:52:02.630
of modulation, the movement of
those lines across the page,

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:09.450
not just, you know, straight
down, a vertical plunge

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:13.900
with a certain number
of syllables per line

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:19.900
because we don't really
think or speak that way.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:30.630
To just hear it; you
don't have to dance it,

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.590
but you can hear it, right.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.270
Language is our first music.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:46.710
Language is our first music,
and the body is a resonator.

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.170
Yeah.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.500
&gt;&gt; So, if you wouldn't
mind talking

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:08.080
about why someone has read,

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.260
and someone's not
a great [inaudible]

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:17.810
because having had theories
about both Americanism

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:19.410
and the ways [inaudible]

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:20.710
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yeah.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:25.500
I, yes. You know,
I've gone to Chicago

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:34.560
and there's a little park
dedicated to Milton Olive,

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:44.060
and there's a photograph of him.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.360
He's 18 years old.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:52.310
He went to job school,

00:53:52.310 --> 00:54:02.370
and I still have real
difficulty trying to go there.

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:06.330
What was he thinking?

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:19.930
Because I'm quite convinced
that if a grenade landed here,

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:25.440
who would be the volunteer?

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.520
Most people would run.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.450
That would be not
to cover the grenade

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:36.440
with one's body, you know.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.270
And so, but you have a theory.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:49.750
&gt;&gt; It's in the margin

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:53.640
that [inaudible] a life
well lived is worth a life

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.150
that has meaning.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.450
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:04.410
Yes, yes. And also,
it depends on how

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:10.180
that individual has
been initiated

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:16.740
into the family or community.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:25.010
I think that's part of it,
maybe, because it's impulsive.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.310
Yeah.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:35.390
&gt;&gt; And I guess that's
as good a reason as any.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.690
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.460
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] reason to that
that he had carried the word,

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.600
covering the bodies
of their children

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.360
and some answers it like that.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.660
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yeah.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.790
&gt;&gt; Actually, what you said, what
you just said, I was thinking

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:54.590
about that very much that if
I don't have family members

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.370
who were in the military,
but you know, reading things

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:02.080
that one reads and watching
children get in wars,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.640
you can't get into a field
that and just start thinking

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.980
of how much it's, you know,

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.160
these other people
and their families.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.120
They have their back;
we have their back,

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.750
and are still are going

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:22.900
to be some individual source
get a real trade [phonetic].

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:30.540
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa:
Yes, of course, yes.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:39.870
&gt;&gt; But I think it's much more
likely because, like you say,

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:47.270
they're in the community
as well, you know.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.570
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa:
[Inaudible] Yes?

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:55.530
&gt;&gt; I'm very touched by the idea
of the generosity of the person

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.590
who just like support others.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:10.570
Do you think it has
anything to do with age?

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:11.870
You at times [inaudible]
that [inaudible]

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.170
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa:
That's right.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.240
&gt;&gt; But as you say, the
commanders are older

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.720
but the soldiers
themselves are young.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.730
I wonder if they're, that
conflict [inaudible].

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.490
And actually, it is a kind
of idealism [inaudible]

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:22.790
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:24.090
&gt;&gt; How [inaudible]

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:25.390
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yes.

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:26.690
They are very young, usually,
and it doesn't have --

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.530
well, in the case of the 14
or 15, throwing themselves

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:38.540
on grenades, from First
Lieutenant all the way

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.870
down to Private.

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:45.660
But yeah, they're all young.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.960
[Inaudible] Yes?

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.260
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] all of those?

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.560
&gt;&gt; But even in that calm, it
was, a sturdy mind was for those

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.860
who -- [inaudible] for those

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.750
who could walk away,
what is our blessing?

00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.470
Because I think that's
all of us.

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:59.770
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yeah.

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:01.250
&gt;&gt; And also possible
provocations whatever war our

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:04.190
country engages in.

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:05.490
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: Yeah.

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:06.790
What is that burden?

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:16.450
That is what I felt, and I'm
quite sure other veterans felt

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.750
some --

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.050
&gt;&gt; It's not that [inaudible].

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:22.210
&gt;&gt; Yusef Komunyakaa: As
well, yes, but it's a burden.

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:27.120
&gt;&gt; Well, I hate to
[inaudible] but these.

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.510
Okay, thank you so much Yusef.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:38.290
