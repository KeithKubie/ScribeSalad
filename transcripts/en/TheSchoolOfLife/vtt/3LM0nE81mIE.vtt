00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.920
Our deepest longing is to have stable, satisfying relationships,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.460
but the painful fact is that very large numbers of relationships have one painful episode after another,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.080
or seemingly intractable miserable conflicts running through them.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
It's one of the biggest questions there is: why is it so hard to be happy in love?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.080
The huge and not yet fully digested insight of psychoanalysis

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.300
is that the challenges of relationships always start when we were children.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.280
It was the contribution of a great English psychoanalyst called John Bowlby,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.180
to trace the tensions and conflicts we have with our partners

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.280
back to our earliest experiences of maternal care.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.480
His ideas are sound,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.020
in part because he drew so deeply and honestly on his own experiences in order to formulate them.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.620
Born in 1907, Bowlby had a quintessentially upper-class British childhood.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.820
Yet Bowlby hardly saw his parents and was looked after by a nanny, who was let go when he was just four,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.660
leaving young Bowlby bereft.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.400
At seven, he was sent off, and lying with the conventions of his class, to boarding school.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.560
He hated it, and later declared, "I wouldn't send a dog away to boarding school at the age of seven."

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.600
Bowlby became a brilliant medical student and an imaginative researcher.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.840
When he was a consultant to the World Health Association in the early 1950s, Bowlby wrote a report:

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.820
"Maternal Care and Mental Health."'

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.140
He attacked prevalent assumptions and argued that kindness doesn't smother and spoil children.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.760
"It's as if maternal care were as necessary for the proper development of personality

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
as vitamin D for the development of bones," he wrote.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000
This insight initiated a wave of reform.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.980
The visitation rules of many health institutions were reformed to allow parents to stay with their children,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.740
where they'd once been allowed only to visit and never to touch.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.360
It sounds like a dry, bureaucratic move,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.460
but it ended countless afternoons of quiet sorrow and evenings of solitary anguish.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.040
In a book published in 1959 called, "Separation Anxiety,"

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.120
Bowlby looks at happens when there isn't enough of this kind of parental care.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.460
He described the behavior of children he'd observed

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.720
who'd been separated from their parents.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.140
If the child is separated for too long, they still crave the attention, love, and interest of the parents,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.280
but feel that anything good may disappear at any moment.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.460
They look for a lot of reassurance, and get upset if it's not forthcoming.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.860
They become volatile,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.380
they take heart, and then they despair, and then they're filled with hope again.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.780
This is the pattern of what Bowlby called, "anxious attachment."

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.960
But the degree of separation from the parents may lead to another sort of problem.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.400
The child could feel so helpless, they become what Bowlby called, "detached."

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.000
They enter their own world to protect themselves,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940
and become remote and cold.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.200
They experience what Bowlby calls, "avoidant attachment."

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.120
That is, they seek tenderness, closeness, emotional investment as always dangerous and to be shunned.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.500
They may, in truth, be desperate for a cuddle over reassurance, but such things look far too treacherous.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.440
The focus of Bowlby's thinking

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.940
was about what happens to a child if there are too many difficulties in forming secure attachments.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.360
But the consequences don't magically get restricted only to the age of 8, or 12, or 17--

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.640
they're lifelong.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.960
Our attachment style is fed by our earliest experiences.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.820
It's a pre-existing script that gets written into our adult relationships,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.160
usually without us even realizing that this has happened.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.920
In lying with Bowlby's views about how children relate to their parents,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.360
there are three basic kinds of attachment we can have to other adults.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.020
Firstly: secure attachment.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.640
This is the rare ideal.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.440
When you are securely attached, if there's a problem, you'll work it out.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.000
You aren't appalled by the weakness of your partner.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.360
If your partner's a bit down, confused, or being a bit annoying,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.260
you don't react too wildly,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.700
because even if they can't be nice to you, you can take care of yourself and,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.440
have hopefully, a little time left over to meet some of the needs of your partner.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.340
You give the other the benefit of the doubt when interpreting behavior.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.200
You realize that maybe they had a tricky time at work; that's why they're not so interested in your day.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.700
The explanations are accommodating, generous, and usually more accurate.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.520
But there's another kind of attachment: anxious attachment--

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.840
and this is marked by clingyness.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.580
Texting and calling all the time just to check where the other is and keep tabs on what they're up to.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.980
You need to make sure they have a bus and haven't left you or the country.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.600
Anxiously attached people become coercive and demanding,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.140
and focus on their own needs, not their partner's.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.680
Anxious attachment involves a lot of anger;

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.780
because the stakes feel so high,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.140
a minor slight, a hasty word, a tiny oversight

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.760
could look, to the anxiously attached person, like huge threats.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.180
They seem to announce the imminent breakup of the whole relationship.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.060
One feels,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.720
"The reason you don't tell me that the minestrone soup I made is delicious is that you don't love me and are planning to leave me,"

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.160
when the true explanation may simply be that one's partner is mulling over

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.040
a very tricky bit of news about a contract at work.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.960
"Avoidant attachment" means that you would rather withdraw and go away

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.420
than compromise, get angry, or even just getting close to another person.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.480
If there's a problem, you don't talk.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.380
Your instinct is to say you don't mean to the other person, especially if you're lonely.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.360
Avoidant spouses often team up with anxious ones.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.320
It's a risky combination;

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.000
the avoidant one doesn't give the anxious one much support,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.780
and the anxious one is always invading the delicate privacy of the avoidant one.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.500
Bowlby helps us to feel more generous, and more constructive

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.960
about what these partners are doing when they upset or disappoint us.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.900
Almost no one, in truth, is purely anxious or purely avoidant--

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.840
we're just a bit like that some of the time.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.880
So, alerted by Bowlby, we can see that a partner's apparent coldness and indifference

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.040
is not caused by their loathing of us,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.180
but by the fact that a long time ago, they were probably rather badly hurt by intimacy.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.500
And it opens possibilities of self-knowledge,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.180
which can help one reform, if only a little, one's own mother's eccentric behavior.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920
[The latest research shows that in the UK population:

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.400
56 percent are securely attached;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.080
24 percent are avoidantly attached;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.140
20 percent are anxiously attached]
