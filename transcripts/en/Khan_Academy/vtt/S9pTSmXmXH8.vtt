00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.660
Which expressions are equivalent
to 2 times the quantity

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.810
4f plus 2g?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.430
Mark all that apply.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.190
So the first one
here is 8f plus 4g.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.100
So could I manipulate
this somehow,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.550
in a valid way, so
I get 8f plus 4g?

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.170
Well, the most obvious thing
is I just distribute the 2.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.050
So 2 times this
whole quantity is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.190
going to be 2 times 4f
plus 2 times 2g, which

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.660
is equal to 8f plus 4g.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.100
So this expression is indeed
equivalent to that expression

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.520
right over there.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.020
Now let's see what
they tried to do.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.210
2f times this thing
right over here.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.760
Is that equivalent
to that over there?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.620
Well, it doesn't look
like it's going to be.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.460
And you could even try to
distribute this right over

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.960
here.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.240
You're going to get--
if we distribute the 2f,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.720
you'll get 2f times 4 is 8f.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.410
And 2f times 2g
is plus 4fg, which

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.930
is very different
than 8f plus 4g.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.450
This is 8f plus 4fg.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.380
So this one is not an
equivalent expression.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.040
And here that you
have 8f plus 2g.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.740
Well, 8f plus 2g,
we already know,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.554
is different than 8f
plus 4g, And 8f plus 4g

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:21.720
is an equivalent expression.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.344
And these two things
aren't equivalent,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:25.670
so we can cross that out.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.210
Now they have a 4
times 2f plus g.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.870
Well, what happens if we
were to factor a 4 out

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.770
of 8f plus 4g, which
we already know

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.120
is equivalent to our
original expression?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.290
So if you try to factor
out a 4 right over here,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.450
so you divide 8
by 4, you get 2f.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.400
And you divide 4g
by 4, you get g.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.100
And you can't just
only divide by 4.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.960
Then you then have to
multiply by 4 in order

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.043
to not change the actual
value of the expressions.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.250
So all we did is we divided
by 4 and then multiplied

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.540
by 4, which doesn't
change the actual value.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.590
Or you could think of it
as we undistributed a 4.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.240
We factored out a 4.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.470
So 4 times 2f plus 4g
is indeed the same thing

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.620
as 8f plus 4g, which
is, we already know,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.050
is the same thing as
our original expression.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.080
And you can distribute
this to verify that.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.840
So this is also a
valid expression.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.280
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.560
Fill in the blank to
produce an expression

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.140
equivalent to mu
plus mu plus mu.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050
Well, I have 3 mus
right over here.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.770
So this is literally just
going to be 3 mu, 3 times

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.650
the variable mu.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.949
That's all that's going
on right over there.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.240
Let's do a couple more of this.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.760
That was pretty fast.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.740
Which expressions are equivalent
to 6l plus 5m minus 3n?

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.860
Mark all that apply.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.360
So let's look at this first one.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.310
If I were to distribute the 3,
I would get 6l minus 3n plus 5.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.470
And that and that
are equivalent.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.370
If you just change the
order-- oh, a plus 5m.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.800
Let me be very careful here.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.174
So if I were to
distribute the 3,

00:02:57.174 --> 00:03:02.507
6l minus 3n plus 5m-- and this
expression and this expression

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:04.090
are going to be
equivalent if you just

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.450
swap the negative 3m and the 5m,
which you could completely do.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.450
Addition is commutative.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.760
It doesn't matter which
order you actually add in.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.157
So this is legitimate.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:15.740
Now let's see.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.890
3n plus 6l.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.400
So already, something
goes shady here.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.879
Here you have a minus 3n, or you
could view it as a negative 3n.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.420
Here you have a
positive 3n, and they

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.670
don't fix it anywhere else.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.770
So this does not seem like
a legitimate expression.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.270
And they also have
a negative 5m,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.190
while it was a positive
5m right over there.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.290
So that's definitely
not the case.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.410
So here you have
5m, a positive 5m.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.160
Well, you have a positive
5m right over there.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.380
Then you have plus 6l minus 3n.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.390
Putting these parentheses,
these are essentially

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.110
reassociating what
operation I would do first.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.360
But you could actually
remove the parentheses here,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.424
and it won't change the value.

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:58.840
You could think about it as
distributing the positive sign

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.910
or distributing the
positive 1 here.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.490
It would just become 5m plus
6l minus 3n, which is just

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.190
a reordering of this
right over here.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.870
But it's completely legitimate.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.570
So let me write that
right over there.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.656
And then they have 5l.

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.530
And if you distribute
this, this would be 3m.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.209
So they mixed everything up.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.089
This is 6l.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.720
This is a 5l.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.070
So this one right
over here is no good.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.960
This is a lot of fun.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.470
Let's keep going.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.690
If we take the
expression 2 times

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.420
a plus 2b-- in parentheses--
and ignore the parentheses,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.100
we can write another
expression, 2a plus 2b,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.420
if you were to do that.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.445
Is 2a plus 2b equivalent to 2
times a plus 2b in parentheses?

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.570
So when they're saying all
of this thing over here,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.790
they're saying,
hey, look, I'm just

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.165
this irresponsible
mathematician.

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:49.250
And I like to just
ignore parentheses

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.480
without thinking about it fully.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.700
And if I did, I would
just get 2a plus 2b.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.210
Can I do this?

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.280
And you might
already be imagining,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.820
based on the tone of my
voice, what the answer is.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.740
And to think about it, you just
have to realize, well, look.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.535
You're multiplying 2
not just times the a.

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:07.350
You're multiplying 2 times
the entire quantity a plus 2b.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.460
You have to distribute that 2.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.800
This is going to be equal to 2
times a plus 2 times 2b, which

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.830
is equal to 2a plus 4b.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.550
So you can't just
ignore that there.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.560
2a plus 4b is very
different than 2a plus 2b.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.380
So are these two
things equivalent?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.840
No.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.790
No, this is seriously
irresponsible mathematics.
