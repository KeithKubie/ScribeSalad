00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you happen to drive a car with a manual transmission

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you've ever let the battery die, well, there's a good chance you've had to push your car.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's talk about the forces involve in pushing a car.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's say we're lucky enough to have 3 people pushing this car.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Our green- and purple-haired doctors and, oh I don't know, Albert Einstein.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's say we're looking at this car from above.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here's our bird's-eye view of the car--from above--and the mass of this car is 1000 kg.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's say Einstein is pushing from directly behind--here's the top of Einstein's head,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and there are his arms.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The green-haired doctor is pushing from the side at a small angle, you'll notice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The purple-haired doctor is pushing from the other side, also at a small angle.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's say an interesting fact about this group of friends

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is that they can all push with exactly the same force.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When they all push on this car at that same time with this exact same force,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the acceleration of the car is 0.5 m/s².

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The angle that the green- and purple-haired doctors are pushing at we'll call α.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For this problem α is 30 degrees, so they're pushing at a 30-degree angle.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Einstein here is pushing directly up on the back of the car,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but these guys are doing it at a 30-degree angle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I want you to tell me with what force is each person pushing.

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
