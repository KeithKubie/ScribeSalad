when people think of a Dark Horse I

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010
when people think of a Dark Horse I
 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.950
when people think of a Dark Horse I
think most people think of people who

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960
think most people think of people who
 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.350
think most people think of people who
were successful that nobody saw coming

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360
were successful that nobody saw coming
 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.140
were successful that nobody saw coming
right and that's technically true but in

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150
right and that's technically true but in
 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.090
right and that's technically true but in
our research we actually found that Dark

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100
our research we actually found that Dark
 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.600
our research we actually found that Dark
Horse's

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610
Horse's
 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.519
Horse's
are people who prioritize personal

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529
are people who prioritize personal
 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.679
are people who prioritize personal
fulfillment over conventional notions of

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689
fulfillment over conventional notions of
 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.310
fulfillment over conventional notions of
success and that priority is what

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320
success and that priority is what
 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.080
success and that priority is what
actually puts them on a very individual

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090
actually puts them on a very individual
 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.089
actually puts them on a very individual
path but it's also ultimately what

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099
path but it's also ultimately what
 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.710
path but it's also ultimately what
allows them to be both successful and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720
allows them to be both successful and
 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.920
allows them to be both successful and
happy and I think those lessons end up

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
happy and I think those lessons end up
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.330
happy and I think those lessons end up
being valuable to anybody who wants to

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340
being valuable to anybody who wants to
 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.100
being valuable to anybody who wants to
live a more fulfilling life the origins

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110
live a more fulfilling life the origins
 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.990
live a more fulfilling life the origins

personal right so I'm a Harvard
 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.030
personal right so I'm a Harvard
professor today but I also was a high

had two kids by the time I was 21 and we
 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.380
had two kids by the time I was 21 and we
ended up working a string of

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390
ended up working a string of
 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.720
ended up working a string of
minimum-wage jobs and was actually on

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730
minimum-wage jobs and was actually on
 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.340
minimum-wage jobs and was actually on
welfare for a little while

welfare for a little while
 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.110

so my future was sort of bleak and I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
so my future was sort of bleak and I
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.890
so my future was sort of bleak and I
felt a bit lost and it was actually my

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900
felt a bit lost and it was actually my
 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.719
felt a bit lost and it was actually my
dad who gave me this piece of advice

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729
dad who gave me this piece of advice
 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.529
dad who gave me this piece of advice
that changed everything so he said if I

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539
that changed everything so he said if I
 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.959
that changed everything so he said if I
wanted something better I needed to

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969
wanted something better I needed to
 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.940
wanted something better I needed to
figure out what truly motivated me and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950
figure out what truly motivated me and
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.190
figure out what truly motivated me and
stay really close to that the rest of my

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200
stay really close to that the rest of my
 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.419
stay really close to that the rest of my

life he felt like that was gonna be
 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.190
life he felt like that was gonna be
important for me being able to achieve

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
important for me being able to achieve
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.149
important for me being able to achieve
what I could what I could and that piece

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159
what I could what I could and that piece
 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.889
what I could what I could and that piece
of advice could put me on a completely

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899
of advice could put me on a completely
 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.609
of advice could put me on a completely
different path that led me to get a GED

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619
different path that led me to get a GED
 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.580
different path that led me to get a GED
then eventually to college and then

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
then eventually to college and then
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.499
then eventually to college and then
ultimately to Harvard where I've spent

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509
ultimately to Harvard where I've spent
 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.599
ultimately to Harvard where I've spent
the last decade getting to study what

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609
the last decade getting to study what
 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.450
the last decade getting to study what
makes people tick and so for me Dark

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460
makes people tick and so for me Dark
 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.980

Horse is kind of like the culmination of

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990
Horse is kind of like the culmination of
 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.330
Horse is kind of like the culmination of
a lot of things that I care about

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340
a lot of things that I care about
 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.510
a lot of things that I care about
because when I think about how we can

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520
because when I think about how we can
 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.879
because when I think about how we can
use these insights from the science that

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889
use these insights from the science that
 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.289
use these insights from the science that
are part of another things I think

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299
are part of another things I think
 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.609
are part of another things I think
helping people live more fulfilling

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619
helping people live more fulfilling
 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.989
helping people live more fulfilling
lives is probably right at the top of

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999
lives is probably right at the top of
 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.959
lives is probably right at the top of
the list I think most folks feel like

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969
the list I think most folks feel like
 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.099
the list I think most folks feel like
like they should know what motivates

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109
like they should know what motivates
 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.690
like they should know what motivates
them but like actually I think we're

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
them but like actually I think we're
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.010
them but like actually I think we're
constantly surprised right we make

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
constantly surprised right we make
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.270
constantly surprised right we make
choices there were like I don't really

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280
choices there were like I don't really
 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.859
choices there were like I don't really
like what I'm doing and like but you

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
like what I'm doing and like but you
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.330
like what I'm doing and like but you
thought you would so obviously you don't

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340
thought you would so obviously you don't
 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.010
thought you would so obviously you don't
you know know what motivates you but

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020
you know know what motivates you but
 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.260
you know know what motivates you but
like I think there's a there's kind of a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270
like I think there's a there's kind of a
 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.790
like I think there's a there's kind of a
for me there's almost like this

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
for me there's almost like this
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.830
for me there's almost like this
laddering of like how we get to this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840
laddering of like how we get to this
 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.450
laddering of like how we get to this
like how do you end up pursuing a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
like how do you end up pursuing a
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.820
like how do you end up pursuing a
fulfilling life right and I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
fulfilling life right and I
 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.700
fulfilling life right and I
knowing what motivates you is like core

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
knowing what motivates you is like core
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.560
knowing what motivates you is like core
to that right it's not everything but if

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570
to that right it's not everything but if
 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.750
to that right it's not everything but if
you don't truly know what matters most

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
you don't truly know what matters most
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.870
you don't truly know what matters most
to you and what really drives you is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880
to you and what really drives you is
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.670
to you and what really drives you is
really no chance of having a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
really no chance of having a
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.050
really no chance of having a
consistently fulfilling life you might

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
consistently fulfilling life you might
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820
consistently fulfilling life you might
be successful with some stuff but you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
be successful with some stuff but you
 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.430
be successful with some stuff but you
probably be successfully unhappy and so

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440
probably be successfully unhappy and so
 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800
probably be successfully unhappy and so
the the interesting thing about it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810
the the interesting thing about it
 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.150
the the interesting thing about it
there's two things that I think are

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
there's two things that I think are
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.410
there's two things that I think are
really fascinating the Dark Horse's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
really fascinating the Dark Horse's
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.360
really fascinating the Dark Horse's
taught us that are different than the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370
taught us that are different than the
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.740
taught us that are different than the
way most of us think about things

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
way most of us think about things
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.670
way most of us think about things
so first is even how we define who we

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680
so first is even how we define who we
 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.560
so first is even how we define who we
are right because I think self-knowledge

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570
are right because I think self-knowledge
 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.260
are right because I think self-knowledge
is this vital thing and most of us when

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270
is this vital thing and most of us when
 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.210
is this vital thing and most of us when
we talk about who we are we tend to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
we talk about who we are we tend to
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.590
we talk about who we are we tend to
think about things like what we're good

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600
think about things like what we're good
 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.650
think about things like what we're good
at or what job we do right Dark Horse is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
at or what job we do right Dark Horse is
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.930
at or what job we do right Dark Horse is
right off the bat they'll talk about the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940
right off the bat they'll talk about the
 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.370
right off the bat they'll talk about the
things that motivate them the things

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380
things that motivate them the things
 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.050
things that motivate them the things
that matter most to them and they build

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
that matter most to them and they build
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.450
that matter most to them and they build
their identity off of that so to the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460
their identity off of that so to the
 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.820
their identity off of that so to the
question of then of like if if knowing

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830
question of then of like if if knowing
 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.710
question of then of like if if knowing
what motivates you is so important like

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
what motivates you is so important like
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.170
what motivates you is so important like
like why do we struggle to figure that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
like why do we struggle to figure that
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.730
like why do we struggle to figure that
out and like how could we get better at

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740
out and like how could we get better at
 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.870
out and like how could we get better at
that so I think that the biggest

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880
that so I think that the biggest
 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.630
that so I think that the biggest
challenge with the motivation aspect is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640
challenge with the motivation aspect is
 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.580
challenge with the motivation aspect is
that when we tend to think about what

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
that when we tend to think about what
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.380
that when we tend to think about what
motivates us we tend to look at what
