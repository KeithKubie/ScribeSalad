00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.300
 From building dams rivers to changing the chemistry of the atmosphere, human beings were strong 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.711
 Impact on our planet. But what would happen if we suddenly disappeared? 

00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:13.960
 The first few weeks will be chaos. Within hours, power plants run out of fuel 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.470
 And off. As the lights went out and electricity fences lost a bite, more than one and a half 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.411
 Billion cows, nearly a billion pigs and more 20 billion chickens and out of 

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:27.880
 Its annexes, desperate for food. Without any humans to feed them, most of these cattle 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.001
 Will starve to death, or become food for more than half a billion dogs and an almost equal number of 

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.941
 Cats who now have to defend themselves. Of course, many of our fancy breeds are inappropriate 

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.631
 For life in the wild, it may be outcompeted by more solid boobies, not to mention 

00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:47.181
 Wolves, Wolves and Wild Cats. Other animals that depend on humans, from rats to cockroaches, 

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:52.781
 Will suffer a drastic decline in population. Some, such as body lice and head lice, will go extinct. 

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.791
 In the cities, many of our famous streets now have rivers. Without electric pumps 

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.961
 Keep them dry and subway underground tunnels will 

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.071
 Fill with water quickly. Other streets will disappear with herbs and vineyards, followed by 

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.701
 Of plants and large trees. 

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.530
 But before that happens, most cities will be wiped out by fire. Modern houses, especially 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.911
 In the suburbs, most of them are still made of wood. And with no firefighters around, one 

00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.610
 Thunderbolt is all it takes to start a fire that can burn all the divisions 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.621
 on the earth. In the countryside, many wood structures will be destroyed within a few 

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.720
 Contracts, if not for fire, then of termites and other analyzers. 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 After 100 years most of the wooden structures will have been finished, and anything made of steel - from 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.250
 Apartment buildings in cars and even bridges - are not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 So much. Steel is mostly iron, without static 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.311
 Apply paints and coatings, and will react quickly with oxygen in the atmosphere 

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:42.661
 Back to its original shape of iron oxide, or rust. 

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.310
 By that time human beings have gone for a few hundred years and most species of animals 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.271
 Around the world - at least, they do not have to go to extinction - will have bounced 

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:52.420
 To them they were the levels before they evolved. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.271
 But its distribution will forever change. 

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.860
 Camels are now scouring Australia, while in North America dozens of species of imported birds are imported 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.460
 Of Europe will continue to flourish. It's even possible that in some parts of the world, 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.201
 Park animals escape can form new wild species, leading to the possibility of black on the big 

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.171
 Plains, or hippos in rivers in South America. 

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.951
 Forever proliferating across space will be the electromagnetic radiation we created from 

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.171
 We have radios, satellites and telephones. 

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:22.201
 But if anything will last us on the ground, it may be our garbage. Chemical Links That 

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:26.561
 Holding together plastic or vulcanized rubber are safe from most digestive enzymes 

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:32.031
 Used by bacteria to break down natural polymers and unlike metals, plastics do not rust or 

00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:36.841
 Eat. These microplastics escape into the watercourses or drift along in the ocean and they end up 

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:41.521
 Deposited in sediments. Hundreds of millions of years from now, alien geologists from outer space 

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.041
 Space may be surprised to find sedimentary rocks full of small carbon particles 

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.801
 Which were once part of rubber tires or plastic bags. 

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.741
 Of course, whether something remains largely depends on the circumstances. It will be everything 

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:54.681
 Another much longer in the desert, where there is none 

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.431
 Moisture to accelerate rust or support decomposing organisms. And while the carbon cycle will 

00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:04.631
 Return CO2 levels to balance after a few thousand years, and long-term domestic deposits 

00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.731
 Organic chemicals or radioactive materials can last for a very, very long time. 

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.991
 It is hard to know what future foreign paleontologists will make of us. how will 

00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.241
 Explain our love of plastic or the fact that it is within 

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.131
 The geological eyeblink we exploded outside Africa to 

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:23.991
 Colonize almost all residential space on the ground. But they will certainly ask 

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.991
 Why, if we have been very successful for a long time, we disappeared 

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:28.251
 Quickly. 

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:32.641
