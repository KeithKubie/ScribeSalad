WILLIAM LI: Well, I
think the first thing

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.910
to say in terms of
tips for educators

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.480
is to really encourage you or
really encourage them to do it.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.370
It's a very
rewarding experience.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.000
I think that the opportunity
to engage with community

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.660
organizations and assistive
technology users--

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230
people with disabilities
in the wider community,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.140
beyond a college
campus-- is for us

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.110
as instructors a very rewarding
and exciting experience.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.060
And you also find within
the university itself

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.170
a lot of support and
interest-- people

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.760
who want to bring
their own experiences

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.700
or different aspects of the
university that maybe work

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.340
in assistive technology
or Student Disability

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.000
Services that really get
very excited-- or in design,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
or in engineering, and so on.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.179
And the students
themselves, I think

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.910
it's really a special
group of students who

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.130
are interested in this topic.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.490
I think that's really
probably the biggest

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.660
kind of joy of working
in a class like this--

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.030
the kind of experiences
that students

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.230
bring to the table,
the dedication

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.000
that they bring to the class.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.140
So there's sort of a
big need out there.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.130
There's sort of a big
interest from students.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.410
The other core part I would
say is, there's no doubt,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.870
I mean logistically it's
always a lot of work

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.720
to bring together--
different partners

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.550
or find people out
in the community,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.550
and find lab spaces and places
to build prototypes, and so on.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.310
And I wouldn't
even claim that we

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.770
tried to make it particularly
efficient this year.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.310
I think to us, particularly
given the circumstances

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.120
and given that we were doing
this for the first time,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.630
we tried a lot of
experiments that did

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.250
require more time to set up.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.310
That might be one
thing to say to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.920
that-- there might be more
sort of efficient ways

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.210
to put this all together.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.190
But the big thing
that I think comes

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.170
to mind is that it's
really the students working

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
with their client--
or it's really

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.810
the results of this interaction
between the students

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.430
and their client that
really motivates students

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.470
to learn, and to
develop new skills,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.280
and to put a lot of time and
effort into their projects.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.050
I really think that the way the
relationship between clients

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.760
and students is set up
really drives the course.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.280
It's really the clients that
work with the students who

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.980
do a really substantial part
of the teaching associated

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.660
with the class.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.590
So in terms of learning
outcomes or in terms

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.750
of the things that students
learn in the class is really

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:22.465
big gains, I guess, to be
gotten from a setup like this.

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:27.010
GRACE TEO: I have two
tips for other educators.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.870
I think the first one is,
before the semester starts do

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.290
all your homework
as to where all

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.780
the resources within
your school are

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.200
and within your community,
because you have no idea where

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.870
the projects are going to go
and what help your students are

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.830
going to need.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.280
There is no way
that you yourself

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.880
are going to possibly have
all the skills to teach them

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.130
how to do things.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.740
So just make as many friends as
possible, who are on your side

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.670
and who are willing to
help out the students

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.510
with their projects.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.810
The second tip is that
80%-- 70% to 80% of the work

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.290
is all about people management.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.610
At the end of the
day, you're trying

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.200
to facilitate students
working for a client.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.709
And the students are
usually novices at this.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.560
And most of the trouble that
the students have come down to,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.980
the client wants this, or
the client is doing this,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.010
and it's very
discouraging, or we don't

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.820
know how to do this for them.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.450
And so being able to
facilitate that relationship

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.216
becomes a big part of the work.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:40.980
WILLIAM LI: One other
tip I would share

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.215
is really in terms of
the setup of the class.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.850
I think we really do
believe that working

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.610
with the real clients
over the semester

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.130
is really at the core of this,
as opposed to maybe working

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.330
more theoretically in terms
of assistive technology design

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.770
or kind of a generalized
more abstract need.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.620
I think what I've seen
is that really sharpens

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.180
the particular
need that students

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.290
identify and try to fulfill.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.190
It certainly motivates
students to try

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.690
to get their project working.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.120
And it also just
ends up, I think,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.310
being just a stronger
learning experience

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.440
for everybody
involved-- just kind

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.600
of that human side of things.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.020
So I know there's a lot of
moving parts in the class

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.460
that we've put
together this semester.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.550
But from what I've seen, I
think working with a client,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.400
and I think that associated
with that is the efforts

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.230
to identify the right groups
of people to work with, I think

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.480
is really important.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.976
And I think there's some
question always about, well,

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:07.600
if you work with one
particular person,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.130
does that mean you
sort of overfit

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.350
to that particular person?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.040
Is this kind of
product only going

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.750
to be useful to that one
person in the world perhaps?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.900
And the answer might
be, yes, sometimes.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.040
I mean, it's very customized
and it works, hopefully,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.470
for that particular person.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.050
And intrinsically, I'd argue at
least that that's a good thing.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.960
But the other
aspect-- and I think

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.290
a student wrote about this
in one of the blog posts--

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.600
is that I think doing this
kind of design for one

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.890
and making it work
end to end really

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.650
can be a successful way of
teaching design or teaching

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.910
engineering and
could lead as well

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.580
to kind of successful ideas
or successful solutions

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.360
in assistive technology
that are applicable to more

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.244
than one person.
