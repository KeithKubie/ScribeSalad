Okay, here is our Array List of pictures. A bunch of pictures have already been

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:10.116
added and our job is to draw them all. Here is the loop that goes through all

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:15.720
of the valid index values. We get the i-th picture and we'll draw it. Let's see

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.832
what happens. Oh yuck. It drew them all on top of each other. I guess it makes

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:25.761
sense each picture has as its top left corner 00. So I'd like you to do a

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:32.420
better job with this. Draw the i-th picture so that its upper left corner is 100

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.073
times i for x, and leave y at 0.
