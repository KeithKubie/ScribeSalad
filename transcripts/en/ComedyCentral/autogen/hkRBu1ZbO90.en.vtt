look like that
 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.650 align:start position:0%
look like that
no<00:06:34.930><c> no</c><00:06:35.110><c> it's</c><00:06:35.320><c> pixelated</c><00:06:36.240><c> has</c><00:06:37.240><c> been</c><00:06:37.450><c> blurred</c>

no no it's pixelated has been blurred
 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.110 align:start position:0%
no no it's pixelated has been blurred
out<00:06:37.870><c> for</c><00:06:38.200><c> legal</c><00:06:38.470><c> reasons</c><00:06:38.650><c> yeah</c><00:06:39.130><c> okay</c><00:06:39.760><c> well</c><00:06:40.090><c> I</c>

guess<00:06:40.330><c> if</c><00:06:41.140><c> the</c><00:06:41.440><c> pixelation</c><00:06:41.950><c> were</c><00:06:42.220><c> gone</c><00:06:42.490><c> it</c>

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 align:start position:0%
guess if the pixelation were gone it
 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.410 align:start position:0%
guess if the pixelation were gone it
seems<00:06:43.180><c> like</c><00:06:43.600><c> it's</c><00:06:44.370><c> the</c><00:06:45.370><c> hair</c><00:06:45.700><c> of</c><00:06:45.910><c> President</c>
