after the decision was made he seemed

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:25.589
after the decision was made he seemed
 

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:29.800
after the decision was made he seemed
surprised the first thing is that was ah

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:29.810
 

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.040
I think he was actually not maybe

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.050
I think he was actually not maybe
 

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.410
I think he was actually not maybe
expecting this and and he was surprised

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420
expecting this and and he was surprised
 

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.439
expecting this and and he was surprised
but very pleased and asked if he was

00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:39.449
but very pleased and asked if he was
 

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:43.370
but very pleased and asked if he was
allowed to leave the building and of

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380
allowed to leave the building and of
 

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.710
allowed to leave the building and of
course I explained that he would expect

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720
course I explained that he would expect
 

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.620
course I explained that he would expect
a lot of phone calls and I think he was

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:48.630
a lot of phone calls and I think he was
 

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.840
a lot of phone calls and I think he was
very very pleased so it was very nice to

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:50.850
very very pleased so it was very nice to
 

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.650
very very pleased so it was very nice to
talk to him it is eight million Swedish

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:56.660
talk to him it is eight million Swedish
 

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.730
talk to him it is eight million Swedish
kronor

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:02.740
 

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.950
and the more question here we have a

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:04.960
and the more question here we have a
 

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.580
and the more question here we have a
question this is the journalist from

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:08.590
question this is the journalist from
 

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.160
question this is the journalist from
people's daily online we are very happy

that this year there is another Asian

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.290
that this year there is another Asian
 

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.780
that this year there is another Asian
Nobel laureates because last year was

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:15.790
Nobel laureates because last year was
 

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.020
Nobel laureates because last year was
the Chinese - yo-yo also got the Nobel

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.030
the Chinese - yo-yo also got the Nobel
 

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.170
the Chinese - yo-yo also got the Nobel
laureates so my question is what's your

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.180
laureates so my question is what's your
 

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.570
laureates so my question is what's your
comment on the research improvements in

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:24.580
comment on the research improvements in
 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:30.060
comment on the research improvements in
Asia in the Madison area yes I think of

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.070
Asia in the Madison area yes I think of
 

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.070
Asia in the Madison area yes I think of
course the Nobel prizes in international

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:32.080
course the Nobel prizes in international
 

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.760
course the Nobel prizes in international
prize and takes no consideration to

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:35.770
prize and takes no consideration to
 

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.730
prize and takes no consideration to
where and one is from and I think it is

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:38.740
where and one is from and I think it is
 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.570
where and one is from and I think it is
apparent to anyone in science that Asian

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:42.580
apparent to anyone in science that Asian
 

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.230
apparent to anyone in science that Asian
science is is growing enormously not

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240
science is is growing enormously not
 

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.550
science is is growing enormously not
least of course in China so I think

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560
least of course in China so I think
 

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.020
least of course in China so I think
maybe we're seeing the beginning of this

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.030
maybe we're seeing the beginning of this
 

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.360
maybe we're seeing the beginning of this
we should remember that the price we're

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.370
we should remember that the price we're
 

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.280
we should remember that the price we're
awarding today were for discoveries that

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.290
awarding today were for discoveries that
 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.660
awarding today were for discoveries that
were done in the 90s so I think we can

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:00.670
were done in the 90s so I think we can
 

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.910
were done in the 90s so I think we can
expect much more to come so it's going

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920
expect much more to come so it's going
 

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.160
expect much more to come so it's going
to be an Asian Nobel laureates next time

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.170
to be an Asian Nobel laureates next time
 

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:11.550

counteract at ofuji and that it's a very

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:12.629
counteract at ofuji and that it's a very
 

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:14.420
counteract at ofuji and that it's a very
complex biology but there's a lot of

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:14.430
complex biology but there's a lot of
 

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.929
complex biology but there's a lot of
activities and the specific ways of

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:17.939
activities and the specific ways of
 

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:20.809

we're not really there yet but it's it's

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220
we're not really there yet but it's it's
 

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.790
we're not really there yet but it's it's
really ongoing many many clinical trials

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
really ongoing many many clinical trials
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.069
really ongoing many many clinical trials
but no drugs on the market yet but there

00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079
but no drugs on the market yet but there
 

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:30.860
but no drugs on the market yet but there
are drugs that affect a tough OG and

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:30.870
are drugs that affect a tough OG and
 

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.009
are drugs that affect a tough OG and
also drugs where we didn't really know

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019
also drugs where we didn't really know
 

00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:35.990
also drugs where we didn't really know
the mechanism and still don't but it's

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
the mechanism and still don't but it's
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.179
the mechanism and still don't but it's
that they somehow affect us - Tata Fuji

00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:38.189
that they somehow affect us - Tata Fuji
 

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:41.119
that they somehow affect us - Tata Fuji
but how this specific specifically work

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:41.129
but how this specific specifically work
 

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:43.210
but how this specific specifically work
we don't really have those drugs yet

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.220
we don't really have those drugs yet
 

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.800
we don't really have those drugs yet
maybe one can mention that most of the

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:45.810
maybe one can mention that most of the
 

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:57.889
maybe one can mention that most of the
trials ongoing right now or for cancer

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899
 

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:01.370
did we see any one more who wanted to

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380
did we see any one more who wanted to
 

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:07.280
did we see any one more who wanted to
ask anything I know there are many eager

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:07.290
ask anything I know there are many eager
 

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.220
ask anything I know there are many eager
for interviews that are welcome

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.230
for interviews that are welcome
 

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.910
for interviews that are welcome
afterwards so I think we can then

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920
afterwards so I think we can then
 

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.410
afterwards so I think we can then
probably conclude this press conference

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420
probably conclude this press conference
 

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.780
probably conclude this press conference
thanks so much for coming to noble forum
