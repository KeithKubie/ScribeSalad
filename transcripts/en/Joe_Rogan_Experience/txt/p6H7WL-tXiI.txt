Years ago I got on Twitter. I don't know how long I've been on two. I'm not even good on, you can imagine being free of it, but I'm at a restaurant Bro. I have to like put, keep my shit together. Don't check the iPhone. Don't check the iPhone. Yeah, right. I'm sure it's fascinating and I might just want to know what's happening. Yeah, you never know. It could be some fucking revolt and I ran some shit. Could be don't going down right now. Wiki leaks as you speak. You up on the Wiki leaks, man. Do you know, I don't really know what's happening with the wikileaks. Is it one of those things that you would normally pay attention to and you just avoiding it or are you just not know? I really just don't know what's happening railing. You don't know anything about the story. I know that this guy don't leaks some like stuff, but I don't know what he's leaked. Have you ever been to

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       Wikipedia? I have been to Wikipedia, so at least you're half there and such. Don't trust Wikipedia cause you're can, yeah, I'll try and to anybody's information. Sure. Right. Wouldn't it be hilarious if someone was just sending over some bullshit documents and you know, he thought that this was all US military shit and it was actually just some fiction and somebody made up to see how much you can manipulate the press. That'd be a good spin for them. It's possible. You know, look immediately smart. They was immediately smart. Yeah. Well the media that can be calling him a rapist over and over and over again. Rape, rape, rape community right there. CNN. This is the thing he didn't, they're not even the women are not even calling it rape. But Sweden has some of the most liberal sexual offense laws. Like they have really crazy laws.

Speaker 4:          00:03:44       And in Sweden if you like, if you're like having sex with someone in the condom breaks and you don't tell the person, then it can be considered rape because you ruin. Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit man. If you know there's raped by coercion and there's like instead of pimp game, which is, you know what you'd call it in America, have some flavor, no how to kick it. So the girl gets confused and fucked you. What you ordinarily wouldn't in Sweden, that shit's like a crime. Like they're making being clever to get pussy a crime and that is hilarious. They want weak sauce. Have you ever seen watered down milk? Ever seen the pictures in the Ikea things in Dubai? Yes. They're all was very dumb looking at us. So it was a guy lifting would. Yeah. Do you the last thing you want as a culture like that, a non fucking flavorful culture, you know, anything, nothing clever comes out of their Abba.

Speaker 4:          00:04:33       People shouldn't be shame, ashamed of sex. If you shouldn't be ashamed of sex, then you know you shouldn't have somebody fucking crazy laws where people do dumb shit and fuck. A lot of times when people fuck, they feel bad afterwards. You know, they've, I shouldn't have done that. I have better morals in this. What's wrong with me? What if my family knew? Well, tough shit. You shouldn't be able to cry. Rape, you know, and a lot of people can, you can just cry. Rape. You know, there's a lot of feminists that absolutely believe that if a woman feels like after the sex is over, that somehow or another she was talked into this or manipulated, that she should be able to file charges for rape. It's like buyer's remorse. It's crazier than buyers. Rutgers, it's the most ridiculous shit ever. Real rape is terrible, but this is just as bad as real rape the other way, you know, cause they're raping the man.

Speaker 4:          00:05:21       Yeah, you're, you're, you're raping someone of freedom for doing something that's natural that you want it to. You fucking skank has you dirty bitch. You know you wanted that deck. They all want it. They want it. It's natural. If you're fucking heartbeats and you're young and your body moves right, your want some Dick. All right. I would get in so much trouble if I was involved in that country at l. I'm of course you would. We all would. Anybody who lives in America, anybody who lives in a land of where there's a fucking game going on. Okay. All right. This is a reason why comedians become comedians in the first place. Be Honest. There is a, there is a vaginal call, Goddamn game going on and there's a, there's a, there's a game going on, you know, as far as like a human interaction, you can't flavor down, watered down the game for sex.

Speaker 4:          00:06:05       You know, there's a Pr, the personality game is the reason why all art comes from, why do you think biggie smalls was such a fucking good rapper? Because he wanted to be the man so we can get some pussy. Okay? He wanted to be a pimp. He wanted to be a player who want to be a dude at the top of a pile of money. Why? Because that's how you're going to get the pussy when you're ugly. Fuck. It's the best in your face. The best shit you got bitch. And if the best shit you've got gets you locked up for coercion cause you were paying at two chicks at the same time, you're going to have a flavor list fucking country. You crazy. Cons and Sweden just cause you make good cheese. Don't get crazy. That's not the same country, right? It's social. In Sweden they hold beer very well in Sweden.

Speaker 4:          00:06:43       They hold beer, they can take it and they make cheap furniture. Oh those Paul Saint Pauli girl. There's going to get cheap furniture and strong by the way that does not a dis against Switzerland was just joking. Whatever. If you're from Switzerland, you get all uppity. He didn't know that. We don't make the cheese, bro. Come on. These are jokes, man, and make cheese and chocolate and not jokes. Just jokes man. But Sweden's got to lighten the fuck up, but it's weird that they can fucking Interpol warning and they're trying to export, export this guy back to Sweden from fucking London for having sex without a condom. That's ridiculous. It's amazing though. It's so wait rans parent, he had sex without a condom and that's one of the condom broke or some crazy shit. It's like they're not revealing all of the details, but no one is saying that.

Speaker 4:          00:07:24       It's like he took them, you know, into an alley and pull their pants down and punched him in the head and fucked up. [inaudible] I heard not even date raped and they be calling me during the whole thing is bullshit. Anyway, the whole thing was just a stupid thing that get him for something to, to do that this because of course it is, but it's amazing that it's this fucking transparent because here's the deal. Okay, one step removed. The New York Times has released all of the shit that he's released, so what are we going to say now? Are we going to say that while this stuff came out and you guys knew it was top secret so you shouldn't look at it and since the the journalists did look at it and then they published it, shouldn't, shouldn't in New York Times now have to go to jail to what?

Speaker 4:          00:08:02       Who the fuck goes to jail? If this guy was just someone who ran a site that says, hey, have you got some, I'm listening. Which is basically what he did and people start sending them shit. That's real journalists journalism. That's real journalists. That's the real shit. That's what we're supposed to get these fucking cunt that are heightened all this shit and talking to the government. You're not supposed to talk to the government. He's supposed to talk to us. What the fuck did you learn? Did you learn some crazy shit? What the fuck did you learn? What are they doing over there? Why are we really there? What the fuck is what's going on? Why are all these bees dying? Here's one of the things that came out. The EPA knew about this fucking toxic shit they've been spraying on corn that kills honeybees and they let them put it out anyway.

Speaker 4:          00:08:43       They let them put it out anyway because they wanted to be able to sell more fucking corn so they're killing off bees. And the EPA was aware of this. We would've never found this out if it wasn't for wikileaks. Wow. Dude. Pfizer is bribing people in Nigeria to stop lawsuits. There's like these lawsuits against them. So they're bribing people to go after like politicians and make them look bad. There's like these memos and shit. There's a lot of creepy shit. This is exposing. So you've been reading a lot of the stuff, obviously the fuck out. When I first heard that this guy was getting arrested for sex without a condom, I was like, what? What is in these fucking things? And you go in these things and it's like it's not all bad. Islam all terrible. It's a lot of, it's a fascinating shit. Like we're finding out that other countries like want us to do some shit about Iran.

Speaker 4:          00:09:31       Like there's a lot of people go, hey these mother fuckers, if they get bombs, we got problems like this. People in their next door, neighbors and shit who are Muslim countries like [inaudible] can you guys, can you hook this up? Yeah. What's up? What's going on here? Or are they, how close are they? What's going on? You know, there, I mean there's a lot of good shit that we're finding out about this stuff. But the point is that the government, the only reason they don't want you to know the secrets and what they're doing is because they fuck up a lot and they don't want to be responsible for their actions and they want to be able to hide shit and they want to be able to look up your fucking ass hole, the microscope, because it's easy because if I just want to be able to do it, I just want to know what the fucks up your asshole.

Speaker 4:          00:10:13       And so they want to make it that way so that their job is simpler and they can't get fired as easy cause they suck cock. They're terrible at their fucking job because almost every politician is terrible. Why? Because the reason why they got there in the first place, because again, all these fucking special interest groups paying for their multi, multi, multimillion dollar campaigns. They're talking about Barack Obama, Obama's reelection campaign. $1 billion. Where's that money coming from? You mother fucker. That's crazy. There's no way you should be able to spend $1 billion to get a job that pays 500,000 and not have everybody go, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Who's giving you this money? What happens when they give it to you? Now? What do you have to do for them? What do you do? You got to hire them. You gotta do we gotta do you gotta Change Laws?

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       You're going to make it easier to Trump shit into lakes. What the fuck is going on? They all suck and that's why they're scared of all this information. They're scared of all this information. It's not to protect you. That's nonsense to protect our citizens overseas. You don't give a fuck about them when you're sending them to an an illegal war zones or illegal war zones where we shouldn't even be there. It was based on a fucking lie. You don't care about them then. If you don't care about American soldiers, then you're telling me you care about them now because secrets are getting out really. Fuck you. That's not true. They're worried about the moon secret getting out. Yeah. Was there anything like that in these wiki leaks? Like I'm not actually going to the moon. You're not yet. Not yet. But who knows? Who knows what this guy's got. This guy's got some fascinating shit. It seems like most of it that's gotten out at least to the more public is the stuff like how

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       these kings have like they're sluts and stuff like that. I haven't heard too much really. I haven't heard that. Oh yeah. It's like that's what Saturday night live made fun of and the TMZs been focusing on is all like these secret lover relationships at all these princes and [inaudible] bars. Shit, keep alarm part of it

Speaker 4:          00:12:11       and the pallbearers do give a fuck. Do you not like the guy from Abu Dhabi, Prince Talk Moon. The guy who runs, he runs the Abu Dhabi submission combat championships, the world grappling championships and he also, um, like owns a piece of the UFC. This guy is like some super insane amount money millionaire type character, right? This guy, he's got this, this thing that they do the UFC, it's at, it's called Ferrari world. It's like a Ferrari fucking like Disneyland with Ferrari Ferrari theme park with like this crazy ass roller coaster that mother fucker could do anything he wants. You know the like those guys, like when you get to that level of money, man, that people would be surprised that you would find some guys a prince in Saudi Arabia and he's got some hookers. He's got some chicks living in his mansion and he wouldn't even know that it's still there.

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       Those guys are ballers. Dude, did you ever hear about that guy? The Sultan of Brunei? I've heard about him. Mother fucker. This mother fucker just goes to the limit. This is what he does. He sits around right? And he watches like Playboy magazine and it reads Playboy magazine, watches TV shows and goes, I look hurt. I like this one right here. And then he finds out what their agent is and he gives them insane amounts of money to come to wherever he is, you know, for like Brunei for just hang out for a couple months, see what's up, I'll give you a few million bucks. And so these chicks cannot help it. They have to go. And there was one of them who was a penthouse pad or something like that and she, uh, got, yeah. And she got a, she got caught with a laptop she was writing while she was over there.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       And uh, that's how the whole thing came out. You know, that all these chicks who had been saying they were going over there to do modeling, there's so many girls that were modeling in Brunei and they were really just going and getting gorilla fuck by this print and all his boys, the old assaulted and all his pals, they had like their own club. They had so much money. They have their own club. They have this gigantic insane ballroom that's like it did the, the, the ornate decorations are like incredible, like gold guild work. Let's just the top of the blind and the hottest bitches in magazines and on TV shows and they're all hanging out there dancing, waiting to him to come out in his gold underwear and just get his freak on with whoever the fuck he wants. How am I going into it? You can't hate that. You cannot hate that. You cannot hate that this guy's not doing anything, that he shouldn't be doing what he's offering them as a psalm. He's saying, listen, you know, we don't have to cop products, prostitution. I'm gonna hire you to just come hang out. Just come hang out in a hurry

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       to party. Eventually you're going to get horny. You cannot let me fuck you. You know, I got money son. You know, Super Mario Brothers is all about an Italian that just wanting to eat mushrooms with the princess, with a princess. Really Super, Super Mario brothers. No. Honestly, I don't think I've ever played it more than once or twice. Yeah, I never really got about this Italian plumber that just wanted eat mushrooms and with the trends says, but son David kept on taking the parenthesis away. Daymond, that's how you pimp these modifiers. Eat Mushrooms and hanging out with the printers. Hey, I heard you are, that'd be bad. I heard you are a DJ like you know how to Dj like mixed mixed tables and stuff like that. You could do anything. He wants his Russell Peters bed.

Speaker 5:          00:15:31       That's like a main hobby of yours. I started doing that in 85 really now I've always experiment, play around even and have the iPad app where you can try to mix and stuff he's into and beef make scratch my stores, something like that. It doesn't work that good but it is. Is there like a, is it easier nowadays to try to like match beats and stuff like that and easier way? He's written in a file right in front of you. You just hit a button now and it just, man, no, no. You'll have your bpms listed, right? Wow. Are you going to do is keep your, hear your pitch at the same level and you're good to go. So do you ever throw parties where you're just the Dj and you're having this huge Kyle and end up getting, I have turntables and every house, so yeah, I always make sure. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       Do you really like, so you throw parties at your house and you not even, I just do it for me. And then if people are there I'm like, what do you want to hear? And then I just started playing shit when Tommy Lee was doing that. What was that? That rock star show the dude was doing, what is that called? The rock star Supernova or something. He wanted to have a fight with kid rock. So this was like they were, they were really upset at each other. And so you want him to meet me. So yeah, because my friend is one of his bodyguards. Okay. And my friend is this fucking gorilla. Just mountain of a man. You've met John Rollo, right? So John Rollo takes me backstage. I meet them. And this is what a Tommy Lee does at the end of every show. He's got a DJ set up. Like he makes his own party and he just, he like, he just brings his friends over and he'd fucking plugs in some turntables and just starts to starts to mix it up. Like people who DJ, like even Michael Bisping the fighter. He's still djs being djs. Yeah. I didn't know that. People apparently people who DJ just fucking love Dj. I love comedies. My career. Yeah. Hello. You love Dj. And more than comedy.

Speaker 5:          00:17:11       I could sit there and do it all day. Why not? Amazing. See I want to, I've always wanted to get addicted to it cause it seems like something that's right down my, my, my

Speaker 3:          00:17:18       lane and explain it. Tell me what it is. Cause that's shocking coming from, you know, such a, a successful comedian and someone who, who's I love standup but deejaying is on another level from, makes me like want to try it.

Speaker 5:          00:17:32       Exactly. It's kind of like MMA for you. You know your job is comedy but you love MMA.

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       I look, I, you know what? I love both. Honestly. I love them both. I don't have a preference. Like I'm like, I'm never like when I'm doing the UFC, I'm always excited to be there. I'm never like, fuck, I wish I was doing comedy, you know? But what I'm doing comedy, I'm never thinking, I wish I was at the UFC. That's the same with me. Okay, so, so you just have an equal love for the it is, but, but you see one of those things you can do at anytime, anywhere. You don't need people around you to do it. You don't need to people to be totally focused on you either. Like either do it in the back requirements, you know, attention requirements for standup need people to be focused on you the entire time and not interacting, not talking to you. Whereas if you're teaching and man, everybody could be just doing their thing. You know, people just what? You need nobody to talk to you. Then you don't want people talking about it because you get in the zone and you're like,

Speaker 2:          00:18:24       can you play dancing queen?

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       And you're like, can you fuck off? You know, it'd be bad. What would be bad ass? Here's what be fuck your crossfader here. I'm going to describe to you guys the greatest show of all time. Russell Peters d chain while Joey Diaz talks on the microphone. Let's try it. Let's try this little gizmo out. What is this thing? It's Dj mixer for the iPhone.

Speaker 6:          00:18:49       Dj Mixer

Speaker 3:          00:18:51       to do all this stuff, man. Like yeah, if you go to youtube and type in my name, there's like videos of me scratching with like with Dj Kubert and stuff. Wow. That's awesome dude. I have a video. Me and Jazzy Jeff d together too. Damn. That's sweet. Jazzy Jeff.

Speaker 6:          00:19:09       That guy is

Speaker 3:          00:19:09       the uh, Art Garfunkel.

Speaker 6:          00:19:12       Oh, rap music.

Speaker 3:          00:19:13       Yeah. This doesn't work. Socks right a little bit. Jazzy Jeff was

Speaker 6:          00:19:19       paired up with will Smith,

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       man, I couldn't hate that more. Yeah, that's terrible. Don't do that again Brian. I throw that thing in the garbage. I'm going to have to hit your iPad with a hammer. Now I sound like an old man. These kids, what? They're scratching. That's me. How, how bad is Jazzy Jeff? He's pretty wished that he somehow or another hit that will Smith height. He's so far off. I mean, in the DJ world, he's highly, I don't, I don't mean, I don't mean in any bad way. I mean this, these weird must've been your billion dollar art, Art Garfunkel and pulse on where the most fuck his art Garfunkel. Most djs are introverts. So they, uh, when you have two people like that and one person, they're both involved in a team. You don't think there's some weird thing when one guy becomes, we'll fucking Smith. Well remember George Michael had that other guy in wham. Yeah. With that guys just getting steady cock. That's all he wanted originally. If you look at that guy, all that guy wanted was cock all day. That's what he wanted. And so George got him close enough to that. It's like, I'm good, I'm good. I've got a stockpile. He's not even thinking about money.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       I think one of the coolest things about Dj, one of my good friends is that his name is Keith. He's that main editor for South Park. And he, every time they have a party he'd always djs at their parties and stuff, but he is just like the point where that's all he, that's his favorite thing. He, that's all he wants to do is deejaying and stuff, but what's really cool is that him mixing, like I saw him mixed like golden girls the other day or something.

Speaker 3:          00:20:44       Yeah. I like doing crazy shit like that. Do you? Yeah. Do you do a lot of do and shops and we'll see you again now they're called Mash was back in the day. We just call them mixing like I took this record in this record and came up with this mix. Do you have one mass or mixed that's your favorite? Goto from back in the day I used to do a give it all you got by Afro Rican and I would mix moments in love with it because after Regan was like a really fast song in the moments in love was a slow song and I would actually have to pitch down moments and love to get it on beat. Wow, that's awesome. Wow. You put last time at the fights and I hear the Dj there and all they do is sit there going here for fucking murder.

Speaker 3:          00:21:21       This guy on the turntables, sometimes they have djs that uh, when, when you go to like the fights and stuff like that, we'll, they'll have like 15 seconds of a great song and just start getting into it. I've got an immediately transitions to another song. Like what are you even doing when he's trying to get an add motherfucker? He's trying to get as much music in, in his one minute that he's got the play. That's weird though, right? Well because he's like shit. Otherwise they could get anybody to just hit play. Right. So I want to show you what I can do in this short amount of time. He annoying being annoying to a drum beat. It's more just showing the skills that they DJ instead of actually playing a song. And every time I listen to my God, Oh my God, it's cuts or lays.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       I'm Dj Jazzy Jeff is, he's like, he's like the pimp DJ who's like the best Dj. That's a tough call. I think he's horrible. I would never put DJ in front of his name. Really? I want them to get the bag can take fucking success though. Right? Can terrible man. I think it's cock cancer. This dude that I know that's like some serious ball or character. He's like one of the friends of the Fertittas, he's like one of those yacht characters, you know, just fucking yacht and around the world and shit. And he was talking about going to see Dj ts two at new years that it was the thing to do. And I was like, well what's the second best? Those are people, the people that go to see him and know nothing about music or DJ this is that what it is? They just like, this is what the height thing is.

Speaker 3:          00:22:40       I should probably say, but we should state in advance that you don't do ecstasy. No, Si true. These fucking people that do actually maybe with Tsa is doing is hitting this frequency that only got two people who do ecstasy can feel. Who are you guys just talking about by the way? Which the project yesto okay. That's who you wouldn't even put gigantic Dj. He is. He makes like super huge famous. They were telling me, the guy was telling me that on a shelf in front of 50,000 people for new years. It was just insane. New Years. She couldn't let me tell you what he does. This is the worst part about it. Okay. He doesn't do shit live. It's all prerecorded. So it's basically you put on your, it's like you recorded a DVD, stand up, a video of you doing stand up and you put it on your stand in front of it and go and lip sync.

Speaker 3:          00:23:26       The fucking act. Oh Wow. That's, and you're not even lip. You're not even trying to pretend that you're good at it. You're just like this like when I get old and I just want to be so high all day that I can't think that's, what am I doing when a prerecord all my steps in advance, Ashley Simpson was a world they just go, go add. That might be one, a funny show and then people try to hacky throw you off the fucking things just play on the ground like you just keep motoring through. They don't even know. You have to stop. Hey, stop, stop, stop the stop the recording to fuck dude. Have you heard that Dj game for the x box or a hero? Yeah. What do you think about that? I've never played it. I just don't get it right. I guess it's like a guy really plays a guitar.

Speaker 3:          00:24:04       Does he really want to fucking play guitar? Do you play video games at all? No. So you don't, so you don't feel that that's like real DJ and even though it's like what he's doing is just crafting a party. Right. He's putting together in advance. He doesn't even have to think anymore though. It's just like, so once he gets to the live audience, he doesn't have to think. There's a lot of thinking that must go on to create it right now. No, no. Gives you really to, it's fucking like 150 bpms. This I have never listened to it. I can pull some of that shit up. Pulls from rash. Let's, I need to hear it. I need to know what the fuck I'm talking to. All of those big name Djs, people telling me shit about something like that and I, I've never heard about it before.

Speaker 3:          00:24:41       I always feel like, how did this happen, ma'am? Yep. Djt yesto t e V. E. S. T. O. R. E. S. Fuck. Oh, there's a big sign. I think it was in Vegas. Oh, about his, one of his appearances? Yeah. He's there in ears. Right? I don't know. I don't know. Um, you know who else is like that? Is that [inaudible] Guy? I don't, I've never heard of him. He's the guy that produced all that shit for black eyed peas that I got feeling shit. Oh really? Yeah, but now he like, they hire him to Dj parties and there's a video of him on youtube where his shit just canceled on him like he's playing in. The first one is the guys are playing cds, which is even more horrible to me. You're a final guns. Yeah. You can't blame school. Russell Peters, just old school. I like it. I like that idea of records and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:25:26       Fuck. She gotta bring crates and Shit. I still use Serato, which are the, uh, software. But I use the turntables with it because he can control it better. Oh, okay. So more like real djs. So you have turntables, but you don't have records? No, I have the two records in, that's it to rack. I have all my records in Canada. Okay. But I'm not bringing them all back to la. So when you Dj, you Dj there mp3s are some, you're cutting up MP three files. Wow. So you can, there's software, then there's a machine that lets you manipulate an MP three the same way you would manipulate a record, right. Sort of thing. And it takes MP three and converts it to the test to underrate it. So when you have your hands on the wheels, the MP three is playing. You have the same manipulations that you would as if it was when you touch it and it'll stop. If you move your hand slowly, it'll make the same slow record noise. Wow. Now there's one that best. There's one at best buy that I always look at. It's like $500 would you recommend something like that? There's a, there's a system called itch itch, which is good. Serrato makes that too. Okay. Is this Dj ts two that you're playing? Yeah. Let's hear. It reminds me of like beyond the mind's eyes soundtrack. Now, just thinking about yourself. Blasted on two hits of ecstasy right now.

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       This doesn't sound like, yes, Duh. Yeah. Yeah. This doesn't sound right, Brian. This sounds like seven k Swedish fucking pop music.

It's like they like everywhere out there, there's somebody like you and they might not be near you, but you can find these mother fuckers and if you could figure out how to put them together and put them all together in one group, you know, all of a sudden you've got something. And that's what happened with the insane clown posse. These, these fucking people are lost from all over the world, man. And they found the insane clown posse Zaga launch. No fucking way.

Look at all those. He's not doing a fucking thing that's not deejaying. No. Put your hands down and look at the fucking turntable all. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:28:27       It's like he says hello.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       It is a trick. Partying. It is a trick. You're there and you're on ecstasy. You don't want eight cars drive by. Okay? You want to be listening to shit like this. You don't want to be alone by yourself in that spot where there's nothing going on. You hear a dog barking or do you want this guy to hook up this wild, crazy fucking light and music show that is dope as fuck and there's a million other people, they're just all sweaty together and you're all got bottled waters, right? Everybody has a goddamn good time. You can't call that nothing, right? It could call him that. He's not a good Dj. Kresge lay. My argument for

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       him is that he's not a DJ. No, he's not. He's like a radio station Dj. But what is it? Because he's making this crazy ass music. Could everybody fucking diabolical genius who's mastered this? He's the carless of soulless people that have no luck and spines. Not with his music. It's more with how he does it. No, it's the fact that people call him a DJ and they're like, keep them [inaudible]. I'm like, he has, he's not a d, so it's like calling an actor a stand up or a comic comic that just steals other people's jokes. A comic, you know? Right. Okay. Well Eve or an actor that plays a comic and a move. Yeah. And then he's such a good comedian. Well, you hear that all the time about actors. You know that he's a comedian office, I guess, or the Canadian, sort of like a guy who studied a role to be a comedian.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       Yeah, man, we all know who the comedians are. I mean, everybody liked that. Isn't that one question that you'll always ask when you hear about a guy's funny? Like did he just stand up? Yeah, that's exactly what I asked. Right? Like Seth Rogen, the, one of the first things someone said to me when I said, God, that fucking dude is funny. I love his movies. This guy goes, you know, used to be stand up like immediately. Like comics want to tell you that like, he's like, he's like for real, he's a real comedian is not. So that's what bugs you. Yeah. That he's a fake Dj. This mother fucker. It's actually making that music. Then he, here's the thing, when you get that much success in that much money, all you gotta do is everybody's going to be handing you their fucking demo. Right? And you go, here's 10 bucks.

Speaker 5:          00:31:06       Oh my God. Testo bought my song and thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now I'll just compile it onto a disc and yeah, so he just takes other people's shit and puts it on. Why not? What's stopping him? He's actually, I don't know. I mean, is that really what he does? Or he just clearly he said Joe Rogan experience is not support these. Oh, like me if that's the case. Yeah. A Dj battles just called out for in Dj fight or a fight. Fight. Both. You don't, while you're deejaying, you have to fight. I am so passionate about it. Wow. Where's this testo fellow from? I don't know. It looks like the gay sweet and fucking hero. The case was over. We talked about earlier. That might be the name of a town gay swim. Now how was I DJ and you're walking, you're walking around pointing his finger in your fucking focused and your DJ that's walking around and clapping.

Speaker 5:          00:31:58       When did this become entertaining? It's not even entertain it. I liked the way he moves. I wish she never would have showed me this. This is the most awful thing. Punch them in the files that you guys are haters. I like the way that young man gyrates his hip. He said Michael that even knew about it that much. He's not. He's doing it like some stiff European move. It's like John Tesh of Dj. It's like a Saturday night live sketch. He's exactly the kind of guy that would that. Where's that a hardy and fucking worst or religion Saturday night live should do a sketch about a Dj like that. It's just fucking stands on stage. Impresses me with that funds. That should be just as impressive as watching them do it. That might be a funny sketch man. Why is he there? Well, let's just press play and get out of their fucking terrible, you know, dance with us.

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       You fuck when I know like some of the best djs in the world like that are my good friends and to me and not even just to me, they really are the most talented guys you'll ever see on turntables. You when you get onstage. Okay. And you know, you start your show. Do you have a planned out DJ set or do you just let the shit flow? Like no, like, like a real comic. You get on and you do what works for that room. Just moving around. We can do that, right? Yeah. And, and these other little fucking prepackaged, it's a performance thing. It's, yeah, it's kind of like, you know, it's a tuning in thing. So you got it with is on what they're into and then go with them with, from there. I mean obviously those people are there because they want to hear the horse shit that he's playing.

Speaker 5:          00:33:20       Right, right. But you know, he's not really fucking doing anything but that they couldn't do themselves. Right. They could've stayed with your iPhone. You could probably make those same songs on your iPhone. I used to work in factories and both arguments though. I used to work in factories and, and when the machines were going, it would sound exactly the same and, and, and, and, and worked in a printing press. The fucking same noise, dude. Dude. Dude, dude. Yeah. After every time it's due. It's cutting the paper. Yeah, that could, it's not good if you're trying to read something. Maybe we're too old for this shit. Maybe. Dude. I say that every day now. Every day I'm like my father or something. I'm some, some, I really am becoming that I am everything I thought I would never be what happens and you know, when you have kids that's, that's exactly how it goes down.

Speaker 5:          00:34:08       It's like, oh, I get why everybody's just grumpy and wants to be left alone. You know? That's what it is. You naturally just getting old. You're tired of this nonsense. Like if you want to hear like really talented Djs, go to Dj's, spin bad.com do you just spend bed? Phenomenal. Starting from scratch. Dj NSFS podcast. I've SFS podcast.com I appreciate that. When I'm, when I'm out or, uh, look, uh, you know, club in Vegas or something like that and one guy just hits the right songs over and over and over again. It just gets a good mood going. I know when to expect it. Like I know if I go to Vegas and I go to a club, I'm going to hear the shit that you hear on the radio that I don't like, but everybody's having a good time, so I don't mind that. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:34:47       I know I'm not there for me. I'm there because you know everybody else's. How does a DJ get to a point where he can sell concerts? That's where does that go down? I have no clue how that works. But that girl taught guys pretty popular and he just mashes up other people. He's the worst too because he has this program that he uses when he doesn't even have to do shit. Do that every now and then though. Some songs, like when they're mashed up it's like, oh, it's different. But every now and then there's one song. It's like, wow, this is better than the original and that he had the on and on with Biggie. Yeah. Dude, he's played that start. You start at the beginning. Do you ever get a blue eyes mates? Bedstuy no, that was Frank Sinatra mixed with biggie. I was it incredible. What's it called? What's best and on, on and on. Um, dude, I heard Frank Sinatra with a continent don't like them anymore.

Although the one where he's a Mugshot, mugshot, just read all this stuff about what an asshole used to be. I was like wow. It's Kinda, I kinda used to think it was kind of cool to like Frank Sinatra because he was like one of those cool old guy things. You know, he was in the rat pack but then you read about like his behavior, like how he used to treat people like this guy seems like a shithead. Right? He was a boy. He was kind of a thug, right? Yeah. I don't know what the mafia to people who were shifted was he mobbed up. I mean I know he was in with the motto. Was He mob this one? No. On and on girl. Talk on and on girl talk.

There's not enough time in the day for all the shit that I enjoy. Things out that gets you, hurts you and gets you know, diseases all the time. Yeah, I'm sick right now. I got a sick when I was in Montreal. I haven't been able to train all week.

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       Instead of watching eight documentaries a day, you take two out and take those four hours and put it towards you don't understand me. You don't understand me. I'm not a normal person. I'm an obsessive. I have issues. I okay, I'm managing my issues and my issues is I can't get into anything. What's that? Where are you training? Uh, I don't want to tell people this facade castle. I mean curves one of hug because the curve, take those fat bitches don't choke the shit out of him. Um, been sick all week, man. What's that? Oh Shit. I forgot to turn my phone off. Your phone's ringing. And Brian, really? This is like podcast number 750 and look at what kind of gay, I got mastermind hitting me and one of my, one of my good friends who was a phenomenal DJ back in any retired and he had, he hit me with a text saying, you're a traditional Dj.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       Hard to explain the passion in that nowadays. No, it's not hard. You explained it very well. I don't think it was hard at all. I get, I totally get what you're saying would that guy does is a different thing than when you do, but what I'm saying is that he's providing something that all these people enjoy the fuck up. Yeah. That I'm not mad at. I'm just mad at Paul with Dj. It's not even the people that are like, he's the best Dj. I'm like, it's not a fucking Dj. How dare someone called my mom is calling you now. [inaudible] dare you. Why is my mom calling you? My voicemail is not set up, unfortunately. It's fucking Susman. Chandra, Shandra, unfortunately ladies and gentlemen. So,

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:41:35       Have you ever Dj and underwater? You should do that. It wasn't a time I electrocuted myself. It's funny, my dad just got me one of these things for Christmas. He just sends me a box of miscellaneous things and it's always tools and stuff and it looks like a pin and it's to detect if there's any electricity in something. So like if you want to know, like you're changing an outlet, you want to know if there's a debt or if it's still hot or not. It goes and I'm like thinking, wow, that's kinda cool. But then I'm thinking, wait, I've never ever changed or needed this ever in my life. So now I'm just like Harry Potter walking around the house going, we don't want to look, dude, I've got a stud finder or want to hang things up. Right. And you move it along. And also know I w I did carpentry, I worked as a carpenter's assistant when I was, when I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       There are a lot of construction labor or construction sites, you know, and a lot of it was hammering nails and shit like that. But you used to have to tap on things and listen to the sound of where the studs were. You ready to try to figure it out? Then you would go away using your years. Yeah. And then you're find healing and then you'd find you'd, you'd measure off 16 inches really accurate. By the way, the, was there ever a need to go past just knocking? Yes. Because this thing is dope as fuck the sick as you make more off of the stud. Right. But usually, yeah, you can catch the center of the Stud now you get the center. I mean, look, I, I kind of get the idea that what way we're losing all this, you know, this, these skills that we used to have but kind of fucking skills or those, man, we've got better ways of making the houses now.

Speaker 2:          00:42:55       Crazy breaks. Those skills are now moving on to actual jobs. Like pretty soon, that person that used to check you in at Mcdonald's is going to be gone because it's the newest stuff going to be in your robot is a stud finder now for sure. But I can't reason with a robot though. So you need, you need human reasoning involves, yes, you need human. There's was certainly we're gonna run out of human jobs. It's going to be a weird thing. I mean people worried about jobs going overseas. You've got to worry about jobs going to robots, you know, that's the real fear for a lot of, they get a lot of dumb Jungian robots that's going to be terrible. Indian robots will kick your house. You know, I used to be, I used to work for a company that I was one of the only Americans of uh, 40 employees, all Indian right off the boat or an airplane, sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       You mean none of them? None of them spoke English. And my job was to teach them to be American. So all they had to do is just be around me. And like I would sometimes tell them to do something here and there, but mostly I felt it was right after nine, 11, two. And I was like, wow, why are all these people here? I, I don't they, I think they're Indian by Indians that didn't speak English. They're generally of highly educated. I, they, I mean they did, but very hard. And with, uh, the biggest problem was, is that a lot of them didn't wear deodorant. And unfortunately, unfortunately this room was like 40 of us in this room. And I was like [inaudible] that you dated a chick, ones that didn't wear deodorant. Oh yeah, yeah, no. Oh my God, I've done that. It's terrible. Awful little.

Speaker 2:          00:44:18       Yeah. Little Esther. But, uh, [inaudible] is too, I don't know if anybody's heard of the way I had to go cause it got so bad because this room was so packed with so many employees and it just smelled so bad. I had to go to like, uh, the, the president of the company. Like, sir, may I please speak to you for a second and be like, Hey, you know this one guy in general just really smells really bad. Like there's a fence. It was really fun. I know it was, but I, but I didn't know what to do. I couldn't work anymore when it was just smelled like a big bio armpit into everyday. It got bad. And so I finally had to break in and tell him and I felt so bad and he was very understanding. And the next day the guy comes in like a full suit and tie.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       Oh here comes and goes. How do I smell now? And I'm like, Oh, I'm sorry. You know, first of all that God, that guy's an idiot because he went right to him and told him that you said it. That guys sucks. Whether pregnant slide it in is a Wiki. Leaker the weirdest thing, the weirdest thing about this company is I never understood what that we were actually doing though. Cause like they, they didn't any of them, none of them had jobs. But yet it was like, I didn't know if we were like hiding people to like, you know, distribute Indians throughout the United States or something. But I had no idea the name of the company. You will work software, software, friends, uh, and or something like that. And they made weird things like instead of Ebay it was called like he buy, you know, and then, but you go to the website and knock off websites.

Speaker 2:          00:45:38       Yeah, it was just knock off tons of knockoff websites with fucking imported slave labor. There was no like work being made in every, I need information. They'd be like Goggle it and like, I was like, I was no work. There was no Google, there was no real good luck. I just source if there was no company to this thing, it was just like what? Whoa. It was like a fake software company and I was supposed to be like the lead programmer designer and I like made one website, interior mail for them, something software friends or something like that. Again, you wonder how many dudes or Bernie Madoff in it. So I'm like, I know Hoe. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I wonder how many people who run businesses or like Bernie Madoff in it. I wonder how many people are out there. Just fucking totally scamming people. It had to be a scam of some sort.

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       And it was funny because not too, wasn't saying terrorism. It was two months after nine 11 I got this job or something like that and I, I the whole time I'm thinking something's not right here with this United States, this, this company right here. There's something going on here and some of it's being edited or paranoid, you know, like America Go America, we've got to get these terrorists and stuff and this seemed like, like, like the weirdest thing ever told us to Alex Jones who have some fucking reason behind it. What state was this in? Columbus, Ohio. That'll do it. Henderson road. Wow. It's still there and actually changed the name of Scott software friends, but the home of [inaudible] crazy man. Hey, I'm by the way, since we're on it, right. I think you should punch up a biggie and Sinatra. Yeah, I think Joe would really likes, I think you guys are both like this. What was the name of the mix would you say? It was called. It's like you want to go into the off garden in the ghetto.

Speaker 11:         00:47:16       There you go. Try that one. You might like this.

Speaker 2:          00:47:20       Oh, that's what I wanted to talk about. This guy, we were talking about scams. There was a guy named, uh, you know what Gambola is the, the Porsche modification company. Okay. Have you heard of them before?

Speaker 12:         00:47:30       Yeah, they're like really famous because they take like these crazy cars. A Carrera gt is like a $400,000 car and they take it and they make this extreme moms when they make it like they make the body kit looked different, put like insane amounts of horsepower on it. This guy was crazy and he's like, did the wild shit, the cars, 1000 horsepower, 650 horsepower, twin turbos and shit. And apparently it was like ripping people off left and right. And uh, he went on a trip and someone picked him up. It was like a business trip. Someone picked him up at the airport and just jacked him. They just fucking handcuffed him and shot him in the back of the head. They made him call his wife and, and try to get them to uh, send money, send a million euros and the guy only spoke English so he made his, he called his wife in English and he's talking to his family in English so they knew something was wrong, you know, cause he speaks German so then the guy just disappears.

Speaker 12:         00:48:19       Nobody knows where the fuck you went. Nothing. No one knows what happened and then months later they find his bottle was dangerous to rob rich people cause they're always a little crazier about their money. Yeah. It's a crazy story though, man. This guy was just trying to fuck everybody. Just, you know, just like you had one car and three people that a paid for it, you know, it's sold it to three people who's making it the same card, you know, was just going to fuck them. You know, and I pay, I guess he did it to the wrong dude or something. Probably some Russian dude. Crazy man.

Speaker 5:          00:48:48       People get 90 when it comes to money. Man, I don't have to tell you that. Right? Yeah. I mean, I, I've never been money driven, so I'm kinda happy about that. That's the best way to things I do. The things I love to do. That's why I like, yeah, you're right.

Speaker 12:         00:49:01       Laid back dude man. You know, as for, especially for a guy who's successful as you are, as far as like, you know, you're the same with you. Stand up. Yeah. But there is, it's rare, right? There's not a lot of us.

Speaker 5:          00:49:10       Yeah. A lot of people you would think, oh, that person's going to be a little douchey buddy. Yeah. I mean it's the most disappointing thing when they are right. Yeah. You're always like, ah, but it's one of the coolest things when they aren't, you know, when someone has gone through some, I was situated, Saturday was the first time I met Dana. Oh really? And he was really fucking cool. He's so down to Earth, man. I thought he was going to be [inaudible]. No, not at all, man. I was like, wow. He didn't like, you know, just meet me and walk away was he was engaging. And it was very cool and I was like, fuck that. He's in the moment for real. Yeah. It's a real business, you know? Yeah. So I can't be running the business side. I was very pleasantly surprised by him. My nose is stuffy. I'm going to have to blow it too much through the Eritrea lights already, Joe. I like that

Speaker 10:         00:49:55       slurry buddy. Miles give a warm round of applause for the notorious sorry is God. See that was all a dream. I used to read [inaudible] my ball that we saw Mr Magic Marlin Mall. I'll let [inaudible] had the red and black lumberjack put the hat to match. We'll number freshman the hotdog and number four. The dit would take it this fall, that woman, the lime light because the trade [inaudible] number one, I used to eat sardines for Canada East. The broad Lucy be tick to free mass. The flex love bugs figures can best. I'm blowing homo special number. Same Bush. Not that many dudes that just had everything

Speaker 5:          00:50:55       fucking rhyme. Just had that certain beat that made your head move. Yep. There's a lot of guys and I liked their lyrics. It's good. I see what you're doing. I like it. Yeah, it's good. But see the only guy you can take as acapellas and put it over any beat. And it sounds like he knew that beat was playing. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. I like that. But I am sick of that song. So do you do shows where you Dj, do you let me now that you're a famous comedian, do you ever do that? Like should know, I have two djs on stage with me when I'm performing. Oh you do? Wow. Really? I have DJ Spinn bed and starting from scratch. That's, that's bad. And then they uh, they play on four turntables tables and one place instrumentals in one place. Acapella isn't there. Fucking incredible.

Speaker 5:          00:51:35       And how do you do that? Do you have them do it before? They do it before the show as the warm up. Right. And then I have a comment come out and then that is bad. And they play and then they played the audience out on the way out. Cause the big venues. Right, right. That's awesome man. What is the comedy Cnm Canada like right now? Is, is there a lot of come from Toronto? I'm from Toronto. I'm excited about April buddy. Yeah. It's going to be Craig common all over the place. What would you started off in Canada? Toronto was 89 was that hard to start off in Canada or in 19 and you don't know what you know, you have nothing to compare it to. Right, right. Or that there's a good scene in Canada. Right. As far as, especially Toronto. Right. Toronto was a real good comedy scene in Vancouver does as well, right?

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       Yeah. I think all of Canada, I mean, they're always a little gems come out of all these little pockets of Canada and we have to work harder because the audiences are a little more stiff out there. Really. They're very loving and they, and they, and they love you to death, but you still got to earn their laughs. Really? I find that in Canada it's almost more of a, look, we've paid money. You better be fucking good. Wow. Maybe charge it to me and they stare at, you know, I'm talking about back in the club days. That's funny. Yeah. When you start now out, man, it's a, when there's a huge difference between people that come out to see you when they know who you are. Yeah. And someone who's just coming to a comedy show, you get a little leeway then you know you can do a little jokes that you would never have done before.

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       Yeah. And you know that they liked your sense of humor too. You know, like when someone doesn't know your sense of humor and does know how you think and then they come to a show and it's like, you know, when you, when you first start out, they're just coming to see, looks like no one ever goes to a club that says live music and you know, your [inaudible] golf, hoping that that's what you get. You know what I mean? But with comedy man, you know, there's a lot of people that come to a comedy show, they don't know what the fuck they're getting. They can get Barry Manilow or guns and roses. They don't know what they're getting. It's true though. It's tricky. It's the surprise bag of comedy. Yeah, totally. That's why

Speaker 12:         00:53:25       when someone, you know, it's like, like this weird music on the Internet, you know, and it's like you got to find what you like and just there's one, I got this one, you know it's true. And then that's, that becomes a problem in some areas when one guy has one successful style of performing and then you see all the people around them sort of like mimic it and morph into it like a Dave Attell type thing like David tell has is so specific way of talking. So catchy. I love Dave fucking awesome. He's a great guy. He made like a billion babies. Billion clones. The Mitch Hedberg did that too, right? Yes. Mitch Hedberg. Mitch Hedberg came out with this fresh style and then you hear a lot of guys sounding like so like it because it was so fun to do. I'm cracking the coconut water. You mother fucker.

Speaker 12:         00:54:11       Oh c two oh coconut water sent me a bunch of this shit. I ain't never heard about us Taco. I gotta get you some Dank, so thank you very much. My friends, she to see two oh coconut waters, the shit. If you've never had it before. I become addicted to this stuff. Um, and people giving me shit about getting sick, like hit. Yo. What about your probiotics? Man, I haven't been sick in three years. The first time I've been sick, but coincidentally his, my fucking conspiracy theory, I slacked off on the acidophilus. That was my fault. But what I didn't slack off on was the Kombucha. I was drinking a lot of Kombucha, but gts, Kombucha, they got kicked off the shelves. They were in the shelves at whole foods. They got kicked off because they had more than one half of 1% alcohol because the mushroom ferments when it's inside those things.

Speaker 12:         00:54:51       And if you, you know, it stays in the crates for too long or if it doesn't get cold enough, they think continues to ferment and it gets stronger and stronger. So it gets over one half of 1% but whatever the fuck they did to keep it from fermenting when it's sitting in the cases, they watered down the flavor. It's like really watery. It's a totally different flavor and it doesn't feel the same. It doesn't feel like it has the same health benefits either. So I think I'm eating dead Kombucha. I'm think I'm drinking some funk Shit, mother fucker. That's why you're sick now after you've been licking toilet. Don't lick them, Bro. I don't like them, but I do sit on them and I really think twice. Figure what the fuck it's going to. You don't even put the paper down. Just wipe them off. Wow. I still have not broken that level of crazy psychological shit. Think he'd get home, he'd take a shower. You're going to be okay? I don't think so.

Speaker 7:          00:55:40       Hmm.

Speaker 12:         00:55:41       I always pee on the seat when I leave. Just piss all over it to leave my mark. Let them know you were there. Don't let him know. No, I don't do that. I always cleaned the seat. If I piss on it, don't you know I try to broaden that for a Fab Multivitamin, Pete, and I'm like, look, there's only so much of this multivitamin, peas, they give you away, man. When people know you're healthy and they see your page, they know it's yours. That fluorescent orange shit splattered all over the seat. Yeah. Like look at you. You healthy lazy. Looks like you're checking and fuck lava lamp when I piss. Yeah. Someone else paying on you is not good. Um, let's just as a general rule,

Speaker 7:          00:56:18       hmm.

Speaker 12:         00:56:18       I'm reading people's tweets while I'm talking to you. That's always a bad move. Is that cause those motherfuckers want attention.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       That's true. To start going off on you. They're saying props for me for calling out yesto on being a fake ass DJ. Wow. Well, when you start a fight with anybody, I've found in this world, when you start a fight with anybody, there's always going to be a bunch of people that want to join in. It doesn't matter. Even if you're right, it's like there's always a sa you could be totally wrong and there's no, he's going to be like, I got a million fucking people. You know that that were mad at me for the whole Carlsmith see a thing that didn't see it for the way I saw it. And there's always going to be people who are idiots. You know, there's always going to be people who don't agree with you, but there's always also going to be people that just want to fight about shit.

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       So if you know, if you're going after d JTS still, they'll look. You have fuck them. I hope fucking carful of AIDS runs into them like people. People just will start getting angry, man, if you, if you fucking hate somebody to get mad, they're like too, I got duped into liking him. So fuck you. And they're like bond with you, dude. Thank God you fucking said that. That guy could suck a fucking million ranted decks. Whoa, Bro. I don't think it's d. Jts so that's the problem. I think we need to sit down. You need to find out where your anger is coming from. I need to get a group hug.

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       So check this out. You know, you heard about Miley Cyrus doing Salvia and everything like that right? Now, imagine, uh, this something happened to me with you recently. I realized how easy this is. So this is a tip. If you have an iPhone. All right, everyone, tip iPhone. Um, if you have an iPhone and you plug it into somebody's laptop to charge it, and if it's not locked, meaning like if you're using it, checking your text messages while you're charging on somebody's laptop, they open I photo. They can take all your photos, all your videos off your computer. I know off your computer without you even knowing it. And so that is a perfect example. Like Miley Cyrus, oh, my friend took a photo or a video, you know, I'm going to use your laptop to charge Bam. You got all of Miley Cyrus's videos, Salvia. So that's a tip. If you're ever plugging in your iPod or iPhone into a laptop, just make sure you're checking them. They're still plugging in your phone that way to charge it. And you're a fucking retard. You're at somebody's house like, Hey, do you have a charger? Oh, you can plug it into my laptop. You know, I mean, that does charge it up. Right. Does it charge it up as fast though? He's a USB port.

Speaker 2:          00:58:40       Just

Speaker 3:          00:58:40       missed some calls. Right. Wow. In the car that's confident in old school. I don't need this. Yeah, I can put this down. Do you, do you ever get the sense if you leave your phone at home, you ever do that? And I got a little freaked out. Yeah. What's up with that? I have nothing to hide in that phone, but I get freaked out. Yeah. I don't want people answering my God damn calls. Absolutely. I don't want to be disconnected either. That's true. I will turn around and go home. Yeah. Most of the time. Less I, if I'm on my way out the door to a flight and I was halfway to the airport and I knew I would miss the flight. If I turned around, I might have to turn around. Well, if I'm leaving town, fucking I missing, what am I going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       I'm going to fucking not have my phone. I'm going to be in Cincinnati, no phone, no fuck. And then I go wait for somebody to Fedex it to me or I'm going to go to seven 11 and buy some phone there. You don't know anybody's phone numbers anymore. I don't know anybody's phone numbers. Well you do have, you have a mobile me service then you just go online and any have your contact phone. Yeah. Well that is a lot of one. You probably have an iPhone by now. No, no. What are you on? Well I use a blackberry from a main phone cause I liked the whole software better. I like, it's not as good for sure. It gets stuck sometimes. Sometimes we're, it gets weirded out. Sometimes it rock shows up. Yeah, I have one. Sometimes the reboots out of nowhere. But when you're using it, but when you're using it like, like what to answer emails or to answer phone calls or to forward texts.

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       Sort of doing anything for twittering to, yeah. I don't like it for twittering. I like iPhone is better. I think, what would I like? Iphone four I think it's a great internet device, but the phone is dog shit. The phone, like service in, in, in uh, America with 18 t is so fucking Dante's horrible. There's one can't do it. So I need Verizon and I need a phone that's going to work when I'm on the road and I'm in other countries too. So January I found most likely and then hopefully send them. Yeah. And pretty soon I don't think blackberries going to last much longer. I think they're just going to become an APP on an iPhone saying, yeah, you're going to have your blackberry app so you can get used to the way that blackberry operating system. You don't see your, sorry, lasting long apple friendly.

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       I mean I'm talking about android and fucking iPhones that that shit's destroying all the other guys. Look at pom poms. Thank you Riley. And I think blackberries still is a black percentage of the market. Yeah, blackberry owns the business world. Yeah. Until it's a windows. He would think that it would die off, but it never will. When you see the first, when you first got into Mac and I'm like, my God, this is so much better. Why would anybody have viruses and registry hacks and bullshit and fucking the pop up windows that eat all your computer up, but you know from using the blackberry how fucking annoying. So I no, no, it's a new, first of all, the new operating system. You haven't used it in a long time. I used the new one. What's her face? Is this the torch? The torch? I haven't used the tour.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       What's that for it, but I have a new curve. The one with the flat track pad there has never a ball has attracted. I like it man. I like torches like an iPhone and a blackberry combined, so it's like the touch. It's all touch screen. Like if I just had it, it's got one device. I might have to order the iPhone if I on one device. Bell Mobility in Canada gave it to me. If I could only have Canadian, that's why I don't know what this, if I had to use that as actually now that you don't know about the torch, that's the new one. No, I don't. Yeah. The last thing I saw that was a touch screen was the storm too, which was a piece of shit. Yeah, that was a piece of shit. If I had to use only one phone, I would pick the iPhone. But to use two is better because this way you don't eat up your battery on your main phone cause I like to fuck around with the eyes. Morphe packs, man. Those are gross. Someone that's carry some extra ass battery. Some girl, I had had it the other day, I saw

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       it and I played with it. It's not bad. You'd get used to it. Sure. It sucks.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       Giant brick that stuck on the mat as bad as it used to be on the new iPhone. The iPhone four piggyback battery. Yeah. Well it's kind of built into the case so it looks [inaudible]. No, it's this one's more features and going back to the old days when you had a suitcase for a fucking cell phone that's we're going to go back to, we're going to go back to you. You're going to need so much power to do what you need your cell phone to do because of cell phones. Processors are going to so far exceed battery life. You're going to be walking around with like a suitcase nuke, like a fucking a giant ass battery that's like a car battery on a handle. It's going to be attached to your phone and your phone's going to be able to time travel. That's what's going to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:02:59       Russell and my assistant has the evo. Oh yeah. That giant fucking phone. Super battery killer. Oh my God. We've been making fun of him for that one forever. Beard, Huh? Yeah. It looks like you're, uh, you're, you're my Mac Imac, but it's cool if you want to watch a movie on your phone. Yeah. But yeah, as a battery, the battery so horrible that he has this giant fucking battery. It looks like he's walking around with this thing. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what we're going to go into the retard gallery. That's actually, it's connected to the wall and it sends a wireless signal out to your phone and keeps it charged.

Speaker 2:          01:03:34       I think projectors are going to become a lot bigger in the future where they're going to be so bright and powerful coming from your little phone that you could actually just make your own screen anywhere. So we're going to have like a razor phone with like the Xbox connect style projection, wherever you want to

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       see Olivia, Nikola Tesla. If they had just listened to him and just let him let him work his magic, we would all have wireless electricity now and then we wouldn't have any of these battery issues. There'd be electricity in the air. Oh yeah, I know, but talk nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:04:03       You've seen that new application that was just released called something like, what was it called, Joe? The seaward applications words C or something like that where you just point your word. I'll check it out. You point your phone at any like say like you're overseas and there's like some writing on the wall that you can't understand it in a different language. Just point your phone at it and it looks like a camera, but it translates it and puts it into whatever you're looking at. It's almost like urban spoon. Yeah. What did you just point your phone? Oh yeah. Direction. And it tells you where a restaurant is, right? Right, exactly. Just this instant translates anything. That's pretty cool. Yeah. It detects the translation and change it clear. It is. It's called a word Lens. Word Lens. Really Pretty fucking crazy. It's a, you look at it like through the camera and the camera reads it and translates it on the screen.

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       It's ridiculous. It's a free APP. No, I think it's like, yeah, it's free as a free native language packs that costs like, like if you wanted a different language, it's like five bucks or so. That makes sense. That's smart. By the way, by the way, if you are playing video games on your iPad or iPhone right now, he a has all their games for 99 cents so a lot of these games are like $12 for your iPad or iPhone or 99 cents right now. So really for how long? Till through Christmas. And they have like sin city deluxe in like Madden, which is like $13 usually on the iPad. It's 99 cents. Right. So jump on it.

Speaker 5:          01:05:17       So what, what is this like a promotion? Yeah. Yay. Yay. Christmas sale. So wow. So a lot of these games, if I'm mad download like five games last night and it costs me $5 and they would normally cost me like 50 or something. What does a game cost? Like if you go to bio or call of duty or something like that, what are they called for? Like Xbox and stuff. It's like uh, anywhere from four 59 to 69 new. Are you shitting me? Yeah. God, they used to be what? Like 39. So yeah. But I'm thinking about back in the day when I was a kid and fucking Atari Games, I never was really an Atari kid. I never had it, but I remember them. Yeah. My parents bought me, the bootleg system was called the Cam on one from Sears and fucking Atari game. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:05:56       Even back then, like what? Like how many people, like you talk about teams that people get on, how many people were like Sony playstation or Xbox three and they'll like argue back and forth and a police station soaks and it's fucking, well, back in the day I was a tare versus colecovision. Yeah. Ended up versus Sega. There has to be a competition or it would suck. It's not just, it has to be competition. It says everyone has to pick a fucking side and stick with it, you know? Yeah. Nobody can go, this is better on yours, but this is better on mine. Yeah. Nobody's like that reasonable. No. Everybody wants to be with the right cell phone carrier to you ever noticed that? You know, if like you have Verizon rights, fucking Verizon's a shit, right? All these idiots out there in 18 to, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 5:          01:06:37       Like they're like, want to join you in on some fucking Verizon clan? You like sprint. Are you with sprint? Sprint's good. We're sprint were sprint bros creates cricket. You're going to get cricket. You're going to lie. There was a bunch of those little companies, right. You know what bugs me the most? Those metro pcs bucking commercials. Oh yeah, yeah. The commercial racist commercials in the history of prices. Commercials. You know what the fuck man. Somebody, if I ever meet those Indian boys, I'm slapping them in their face trying to wake him up. Wake him up. What the fuck are you doing to, they sold us a commercial play it or you've never seen the metro pcs? I haven't seen it, but I think people should know metro pieces. There are hard here. They are horrible people in Canada. Don't know them. I don't think mobile ones are brutal to you. Remember the boost mobile ones were dudes would be like, where are you at? Oh yeah, yeah. That was the question.

Speaker 5:          01:07:29       Let me give you the down low on the no, whoa, sweet. Totally money. ECS is offering unlimited talk text in bed. Just trying to be crazy. If this can be through Chad maybe. Okay. But this is obviously on pure common, unlimited nationwide to authors. There's like a couple of them that are okay little. This drives you nuts. Yeah. But, but if you made those characters on stage, it wouldn't drive anybody nuts because they're saying it's a parody. They're not actually used to sell any. This is like one time, it's fine. You know what I mean? Like I understand that they're selling something, but there's selling something with comedy, right. They're trying to be funny there. That's, that's not, it's such a poor, it bothers me. Get that. And the fact that like, these guys don't ever win the, uh, like I'm always about the underdog.

Speaker 5:          01:08:23       This, so those would be the underdogs in the commercial. I think it would be funnier if they won. Like whatever it is, they're, the joke is, you know, okay, I see what you're saying. So they, they end up being the brunt and then they end up being the fucking brunt again. And they keep on being the brand over and over and over. Like when they have like this big fat chicken, one of the other commercials to show 90% coverage. This guy's looking at her like, Ooh. And I'm like, seriously, dude, are you fucking kidding me? I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying, that it's not clever and it's kind of mean spirited. Yeah. It's just like, Huh, look what we've done. Yeah. How obvious. Right? Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 9:          01:09:03       My cell phone calls, keep dropping if you had handy is into it and you will find a problem. A sneaked out among all of these glimpses. Snake like an ice lollies. I just laughed. I assume you're on the [inaudible] network. Get Metro pcs and you'll be talking smack on three g but nationwide coverage in over 11,000 cities and towns $40 I'm sorry man. Let Shit's funny. I don't give a fuck what you say, but you know it's not funny. It's the value yet

Speaker 5:          01:09:29       metro pcs is giving us too. We just had that nonsequitor with the fucking snake charmer. That made me laugh, man. Well, there you go. It's fart jokes for Indian people soon. It's not brilliant because they're just trying to sell some bullshit. I think they just made them look so fucking stereotypical. What would you do though differently? How would you make it different if you, if you had that scenario, give them the Mexican accents.

Speaker 9:          01:09:54       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       I would've picked really area looking people and then giving them an idea. You can always make it

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       Nazi's. There's no one around to stand up for Nazis. Nazis will be on the shit list for a hundred years until the next group of fucking psychopaths comes along. You know, it's like, I bet for the longest time Nazi jokes were Roman jokes. You know, I'd be shitting on the Romans. Right. But you try a Roman joke today and nobody, you know, what? Are you a fucking Roman? Yeah. No. Like what are you saying? There's nothing, but you hit them with, what are you a fucking Nazi? It's like, oh, that shit's still valid. That's a good one. You zinged me. You know, I mentioned one time they used to say that. What are you a fucking Roman kind of Roman are you? What do you have? That was actually an insult from the movie. The Hustler, the movie, the Hustler Piper. Laurie says to a Bert, fuck, what is his name?

Speaker 3:          01:10:45       The very famous actor that died a long time. The hustler that Paul wasn't Paul Newman, but it was, uh, the guy who played birth, fuck, I can't remember his name. Anyway, she goes, y'all realm, but it's maybe in the 70s, Nazi. He was in the, as it was in the 60s, so it was 1963. I believe that all of that movie, you know, 60 or 63. I don't remember. I should, I should look it up so I don't give anybody any misinformation and I should look it up just cause I should need to know the name of the, uh,

Speaker 12:         01:11:14       the dude was an amazing actor. It was it.

Speaker 2:          01:11:16       So somebody like, can you guys talk about something worthwhile? Wikileaks, perhaps you missed it already. Stupid know about you. Twats I like, I like, I read the trade, the twitters now because people are like sound looking into it. Like we're going to be the fucking reason that there's a change in the world. George, see Scott, ah, George T. Scott Patton and she and he played pattern, right?

Speaker 12:         01:11:40       Yes. Yes. Piper. Laurie says he already Roman Burt. You know it's her way of saying you're a Nazi, like you piece of shit. He was pimping her. I think he bone or two as well.

Speaker 2:          01:11:51       It's pretty disappointing with these early reviews of Ciaran. Oh man, no one's gonna see it tonight. And somebody made a great point though. It's like if Disney was going to have a rave, would you go to it? What'd you think? It was good. I would go to it. Hi Izzy. Right. But Jesus, if Disney Henry. Oh, come on man. Ray would be fun. Even if you were, if it was a Disney rate, it'll be fun. I don't know. Disney rave. If you were super baked it. One thing to note though is I don't think I was a huge fan of tron growing up. I think I was fan of the video game. I don't think I'd like the movie was, I didn't know what the video game did. You didn't, you can just like the way it looked. Yeah. I'd go into the arcade, look at the game, and I go, cool. Yeah, the fuck does it do. How do you play this game? And that's kind of like the movie kind of was a trick back then. It was like computers were mysterious and weird and that's why I think I remember like that movie. But if you really try to watch that movie, it's suck. Yeah. I ever wanted to see trial. I'm not a shy guy, so I never wanted to see tron now or then.

Speaker 12:         01:12:47       Altered states is one of the most influential movies on my life because of the fact that it got me in a sensory deprivation tanks and I started, you know, tripping in those things. But I tried watching it a few years back. Right. It's terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       Yeah. I remember the commercial for that. It was the guy with the movie things on them. Yeah. Well he's uh, he was looking at the, what happened

Speaker 12:         01:13:08       was he went to like Peru or South America or something. He takes this Iowasca, he drinks it and then he gets in his isolation tank and he starts tripping and having these fucking incredible experiences and it starts turning them back into a cave man, turning them back into some wild monkey man. And he wants up, you know, running around killing people. It looks so stupid. Oh my God. It's like unbearably thumb. You know, you just, you just forget, you know, you forget. Yeah. Or the also like he start realizing special effects and and dom were a lot smarter now back then. It's still the total evidence of evolution really. I mean, no one wants to think about it that way, but it, it, it shows there's, there's an ethic. The ethic in the world is things become evermore complicated always. And if you look at old television shows or old music, that stuff is bunk.

Speaker 12:         01:13:57       You know, old comedy, it doesn't work. You know, old comedy is broken. Go back and listen to some old comedy. It very rarely do you laugh. You appreciate the craft. You appreciate. Well in this time period, this was material and this was, you know, it was amazing what this guy is saying and wow, listen to them. They're really enjoying it. I get it, but it's not going to get you. Yeah. That's why out of all the old old stand up, maybe like three albums will stand up still prior. Still does. But you know it doesn't like it did when I was a kid. Delirious still holds up real well does it? Yeah. I watched it again recently and I was like, fuck me, this shit is still laugh out loud. Funny. That was a powerful performance ground. Someone Carlin's old stuff still makes me laugh. Some kinisons old stuff's still makes me laugh too.

Speaker 12:         01:14:42       It's a, but that's only 80 years you go back. I mean in 1980 rather go back like 1950 go back to that stuff. Well Marx Brothers makes me laugh. Still really does. Yeah. Groucho still makes me laugh. Oh Groucho was brilliant guy. Man. Always had some funny shit when he used to do you bet your life. It was a talk show game show. Some guy, you know had like 10 kids or something like that and he goes, he goes, Whoa, 10 kids. And the guy goes, yeah, I love my wife. He goes, I love my cigar too, but I take it out of my mouth every now and then. He did always come up with those kinds of lines. It Bill Maher actually kind of hack that. He did something about loving his bong, but I'd taken out of my mouth every now and now when he was talking about the people who are the, uh, the, the families that have joking kids tribute.

Speaker 12:         01:15:26       Yeah. Yeah. Attribute. You would say that. Yeah. He would say that it was a tribute. You shouldn't, everybody knows that line that maybe it is a tribute, but it's still like, or maybe just someone wrote it for him, but you know, Groucho Marx was a, a guy like that was like to say that back then he was sharp than his, his sharpness still holds up. Yeah. That's, that's like some 2010 standup shit. You know? I mean, this is just to say that Bill Maher has said that, you know, look, it works. It works. Now, you know, there's not a lot of jokes that work now that would work back then. You know, I wonder how, how, how much

Speaker 2:          01:16:02       business like trench coats sales have gone down since the invention of the Webcam. [inaudible] no, kids are getting better. Thrill though is to see it's not the real thrill isn't, you know those, what is that called? Chat Chat Roulette where you just, you know, stand in front of a Webcam hoping someone looks at your Dick. All right. The real thrill is being right in front of them and pulling your dick out and like jerking off on them most if though, is it that or you could do it to like a hundred people at once. Like man, I'm doing a hundred like I'm, I'm really down to earth science. It's just more accurate this way. I guess that would work, but I don't even have to run away. Right. To potentially take a sidestep. What level of perversity he was here and then he sidestepped yeah, you don't have to do much to get away. Just pull your head out of the Webcam. That's right. But then who do you throw your piss on or you're here. Come on. Yeah, that's a problem. You just have like this big wall of like a picture of a woman that you to trick yourself. You

Speaker 12:         01:17:10       take, you take, you take a picture of your screen, put it on the wall. For a lot of dudes that's like what they really liked. You take a picture of your screen, you take us

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       screenshot, take a screenshot, print it out. Once you're jerking off and as you're about to cum, you grab it. Fuckers.

Speaker 12:         01:17:29       That's hilarious. You have to, how much do you, just enough for a hundred people. Who was the guy that got busted? Oh, it was Christie Brinkley's husband. He was in debate and Billy Joel. No, no, no, no. The Guy who uh, took over on that guy, there was more than one guy. There was a few guys, there was one guy who was a, uh, a guy that she got in a helicopter crash with. Oh yeah, that guy died or by, oh hey. They both survived. No, they both survived. But because of the fact that it got through this thing, then they had this like crazy romance. It really didn't make any sense. And then wound up, the guy was a loser and she got rid of him. But then there was another guy afterwards who was, uh, it was a crazy beat off guy and he would spend thousands every month just fucking whacking off online.

Speaker 12:         01:18:19       Just joined every fucking thing that you can join. It was it 25 a month and I just beat off on people and they had like video this guy and it was, there was an interview. It was a fucking fascinating interview where they're bringing up whether or not he had masturbated in front of a Webcam. There's been allegations, have you mastered this? And he was like, there was this one time he admits to tried the Abby tried to play it off this one time and it was a completely consensual thing and it was not that he's just getting on the webcams consensual, don't you just have to look away like, well, it's literally unconsensual that you get the initial image in the first place. I mean, if someone, if you're just having a little iPhone chat with somebody a little facetime, they pull their deck and start beating off. Yeah, man, you should ask me first. That's fucking hot, man. Not Man. I think just the shock they loan is worth it.

Speaker 2:          01:19:08       Like, well Joe, why are you wiping out your tick, Joe? What are you getting so mad at worth it to you? You got one too. That would be better. You know how uncomfortable that be? If Brian and my pull out my Dick and start masturbating, that would be more uncomfortable than you. Just like, hey look Brian, about, oh, come on and be like, please don't, don't do that. Why are you doing that? Why do don't do it? No, don't do too much buildup, you know? That makes it worse. Come on, don't, don't come. Come on. I have had friends that have told me, come off. You know, if you touch your focus.

Speaker 12:         01:19:36       I had a friend that told me crazy story about his friend getting a hooker and he stayed in the room and beat off all his friend. Fuck the hooker. I'm like, Yo, I'm not willing to go that far. I am not willing to go that far. You're gonna beat off in the room with your friend having sex. Oh yeah. What? That's the same people that, that didn't care in the locker rooms in high school. They were just walking around with their Dick Everywhere. Same people either die. I was hiding in the bathroom, shower. I don't think I started not caring until I was in my twenties yeah. Lean your 20s you're like, you want to look at my, you fucking Weirdo.

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       Go ahead. Yeah. But when you're, you know, I did go to hedonism and get naked though. Really? What's hedonism in Jamaica in Jamaica just went around naked. Yeah. There was the prude side in the nude side and everybody was having way more fun on the nude side. Wow. And then they were like, come on over. And I go, I go over in my town. No one's got a fucking iPhone on them. Oh No, this is, you know, like a five, six years ago. Do they still do it now? Yeah. I'm going to make sure that camera's there though. Really? But nowadays you can get fucking spy cams and crazy. Right. There's all sorts of shit. He can get hats that have video cameras on them. It's pretty nutty. What they can do now there's the glasses member, Stan [inaudible], Stan Opeb, that show he was doing for Fox was a hidden camera show and he had glasses that were like a little camera on them.

Speaker 5:          01:20:49       There's a button you can buy. It looks like a shirt. Yeah, that's all my video camera. I'm always checking up on like, like just recently, the guy that's small enough HD that goes into a button I saw. Yup. Shit about getting a couple of those. You know when you're going to need it. You never know. Just stayed at the right girls. Get the right button, cameras hang your shirt the right way. It's eventually wearing your shirt. It's I'm cold. Weird button. Nothing. Yeah, your buttons white and that one's black. Here's a question that wasn't glass. The bigger button. I have a question for you gentlemen. When you have sex, do you guys make a lot of noises? Like do you, are you loud? Yes. You will still make some noise. Really? Yeah man. If I can, cause I'm not, I'm very quiet, very quiet. And it's not like I'm not like sad man.

Speaker 5:          01:21:40       I don't know why. But now I'm being told that I need to be louder. Oh, I like how old are you, Brad? 36 you're told. Now listen man, we're not within the last year or so. Lately. Lately people have been telling me, let me give you some more very, very strong advice. Fake it and just be, we'll switch you up to do, if a girl ever gets to a point where she's saying you need to make some noise. All right, this is what you need to do. You need to make some noise. Cause if you don't, she's going to find someone who makes noise. Right? So do you understand that? I know, but when I make, then I make the noise and I, I to think I about it. I know, but it's like, it's not me and my personality. So when I go, you take that can, you know, I think that's a shyness because it took me a long time to come out of my show with that stuff too.

Speaker 5:          01:22:27       So yeah. Listen, dude tried choking myself and masturbating everything. No, I know. I got to learn how to take the potion. How are you going to catch the combined? If you don't learn how to take the pussy, there's, there's girls that need that. They need you to take the poster. They need you to fuck the shit out of him. Dude, I get it. I need you to talk to them or I need you to grab them. You need to fucking start pulling their hair. Choke them bit. You gotta start doing squats. I liked the live smack and squats and eat a lot of buffalo. If you can get some bison in you, maybe some ostrich, some meaty red shit. Steady. Right? If you could find on elk Cyrex, sorry, I should go to fid. Rutgers. Kill a deer with your fucking hands is what you need to do. You need to go on one of those Indian

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       vision quests where you go running down a a d or until it dies of exhaustion and then you eat it's heart while it's still beating. And then then he'd go back and fuck the shit out of her with the blood all over your chest but not at night until you finish fucking the deer. Yeah. Fuck the deer first just for a warmup just to get your kinks worked out of your Dick and then you'd go back home. No sense in going in gold. Yeah. How do you make noises when you're making love? I can understand chick open the fucking door. Knowing the background you're making brother dead animal on the ground and youth howl through a conch shell.

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       That's what you do. Do. You step in and you fucking take care of business so that, but when you do that, that kills the making love aspect of your fighting. Here's the deal. Only fosters a deal buddy. Here's the deal. Fucking the last thing you would ever want, right is a girl who is like, like acting like a dude and talking shit to you. And you know, and being all manly with you and you know, you don't want to be the sub aggressive with you or getting weird with you rank that would be grossed. Right. Well, with some girls, some girls are very girly, they're very sexual, they're very bright. And with those girls they want a lot of man. They want a lot of shit happening. Right. They don't want you to just be like whimpering on top of them and shooting loads. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:18       They don't want you cuddling up. They don't want you and twitching every now and then. You've got to give them what their DNA needs, cut, talked, and you don't want to lean and go to them. I'm sorry. That hurt. Yeah. Just when date after, after it's done and you're gonna apologize. Exactly. Sorry about calling you. They make a crazy moment as it normal also, that girls always say that they must be like starting their period again. But you think it's because you, you rip them what's going on in your life. It's like every time I have sex with a girl, they're like, oh my God, it started again. Or, ah, but I think I'm ripping them. What would be a huge, I didn't think so many girls at this happened to it. Like they're always saying that it hurts them. I'm going too deep and it's hurting.

Speaker 3:          01:24:59       I've never had a problem with her. You measure your deck or you had, do you have some crazy dick? All right, and here's an, here's another truth. How big is your do not that big. Like six, seven inches. That's terrible, right? That's a sad deck. I gotta say it like, but it's, it's girthy. Normal's like six inches, right? This isn't that normal. I don't know. Oh, look and think that that might, you're being a dick that's making me, I don't even want to look at your fingers right now. I just see a dick for some reasons. Get your finger Dixon. Well, maybe you're just, you're just lucky and you dated a bunch of shallow vagina girls. That's what I'm thinking. I think that's a shallow vagina. Goes. Now here's another question. Do you get, have you ever had sex in the shower? Is it, does it make you dizzy? No reason. No, but this always makes me like the other day I you pass out in the shower while you're fucking two months ago I'm having sex and I'm like, like, like within like a minute. I'm like, all right, I'm getting lightheaded. And I had to go lay down. I had to go lay down on the bathroom floor. And then the substitute nick walked in the talk. Was this after she had told you she wanted you to talk to her? No, this is somebody else's,

Speaker 12:         01:26:04       uh, Asian, black girl and said, but, but like, like, like within a minute like that happens. But if like it was outside of the shower. Oh no problem at all. Good as long as you want. But, but immediately when I'm in a shower, it's like, what is that about? Take it back to the same standard can kill an elk with a Bowie knife. You need to jump on his fucking back and hold on to his horns and cut his throat as you, you get your, your guard wrapped around his neck and trips to the ground as he runs out of blood. That's what you need to do. You need to fucking kill something. Sign when you get them from behind, stretch the body so your DNA is getting watered down by technology in the universe. You need to take a log and run up a hill with it. Okay? You're losing your fucking cells. They're going away. And why did fading? Is it normal for them? Put the phone next to the pill and they have their parents listen to you have sex on her wedding night. Just kidding. I forgot to get coconut water.

I don't think you're an agricultural knowledge is disappointing.

Speaker 12:         01:27:55       Joe Soc. Sprout socks. I don't even know what a silo is for. I think they keep grain in it. Yes. They keep grain. And if you ever hear about people dying in silos, like they fall off and they just drowned by going right down the middle of the silos. Grain drown. Yeah. Grain drown captain that corn so much. Oh my God. How do they get you out? Uh, I don't know. I did. They asked. They start from the bottom. So somebody has a lot of starch in the Diet. You can't swim either. Right? Right. You're just fucking corn everywhere in your mind. God, that must be horrifying. I'm always, I'm, I was always fearful of those, uh, those ball things that you throw kids in the little balls. Yeah. Yeah. There's one thing that my, uh, my two year old has this gymnastics class she goes to and there's a pit they jump into and it's all filled with these little spongy foam things. And I jumped into it. I'm like, I don't like this at all. Like this feels like you can't get outta here. Like it might be fun if you're 25 pounds, you know, if you're a two year old, but when you're a grown man and you fall all these balls, like this is stupid. Like why would anybody think this is fun? And they're dirty, dirty mother fuckers. I do miss like laser tag though. Do you guys ever

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       played laser tag but at once was pretty dope. I should say the bomb. They need to bring that back. Yeah. Well they stopped it. Yeah. Well I don't know the place. There's a place out here, man fog and everything. There's a place yet. It's not out here. It's about 45 minutes away north. But, uh, I'll take you, we can go something like, yeah, that's you and me and Ari and Julie to watch on the sidelines and then we'll wait in line for a cabbage patch. Kid Joel, join into man. What the fuck are you asking me? Don't you know what my real name is? If he goes to the couple laser tag champion has for you bro. Uh, you know my wife's last name is Diaz.

Speaker 12:         01:29:36       Really? If you're related a wonderful wonder, he is holy Shit. But you could also be related to Nick Diaz if you had to choose between being related to Nick Diaz and being related to Joey Diaz, Nate Diaz, you'd go names that the neck. But Nate and nick are the same. That's the same lineage to saint brothers. What the fuck? Cock sucker stopped doing. My voice shitty. He's Puerto Rican, right? Joey? Joey is Cuban always a Cuban. Does your wife Puerto Rican? No, she's Ecuadorian. Oh Damn. She Ran Honduran. Cause you've got yourself a job. I got myself on as I watched this crazy fucking, yeah. I don't like those ancient ancient aliens show. You know, you've watched those. A lot of them were kind of Hokey, but I watched one last night that was dope. Which one? The one all about unexplained structures.

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       Yeah, but this, uh, about the masons and the Menotti and everything and the,

Speaker 12:         01:30:28       Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It wasn't about that. It was about structures like a, in Peru, these gigantic stone walls that they built, these are like hundred ton stones and they were carved into place. So they fit like a puzzle and they fit perfectly and they fit to the point where you can't even get a piece of paper in between the rocks and they have no idea how they did this, how they quarried them, how they moved them thousands and thousands of years ago. These just massive walls. I've been watching a lot of lately. Incredible Shit, man.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       Big Alien. Shitted out Joe. Well, that's what these guys are. Everyone's always claiming it's aliens. You know that the Lizard Aliens, right? Yes. The reptilian aliens.

Speaker 12:         01:31:09       It's really silly thinking, but it's sexy thinking. You know, people love the idea of everything being aliens. Man. There was aliens. Aliens did this, don't you see? But we're aliens. If you look at the regular primates and you look at us, we are fucking aliens. We know that. We come up with crazy shit now, isn't it a much more likely scenario that we have been us, we have been this thing for a long ass time and that we have been this thing for maybe hundreds of thousands of years and then we've been wiped out a few times. That's much more likely.

Speaker 2:          01:31:42       We had to, yeah, the much, much more like there's no way that we were around for this long and then all of a sudden in 100 years made fucking strides letter.

Speaker 12:         01:31:49       Well, there's so much evidence that we, that things get wiped out all the time on earth. We know that there was at least two mass extinctions, one to 50 million years ago, one 65 million years ago where everything's dead except like a couple of, you know, some bugs and some rats and shit and they figured out how to become everything there is now. If you believe in all that, you take God. It's got, have happened in smaller ways and just fucked up everyone. It's must've happened. This shit that killed off the dinosaurs. It doesn't mean that it just kills everybody. It doesn't mean that they're the mass extinctions. That's the only way they happen. It also could mean they killed almost everybody and there weren't as bad as the dinosaur one, but a lot of people fucking died and they left behind a lot of crazy shit that they had already accomplished.

Speaker 12:         01:32:33       And then everybody else basically started with scratch. We started with whatever knowledge we had been passed on to by our forefathers. Whatever was in our head. That's what we got. And then we figured out how to rebuild houses and hunt for food and we go through the whole thing all over again. That's more likely. That's more likely. Where are you with 2012? I am about a year and a half away, man. Come on buddy. It was, you fucking left yourself that not even a year and a half year. Two years a day. Well two December 21st. Yeah. Um, I think here they a miscalculated the date though. That's a lot of, they don't know. The speculation is one scarred like a hundred years off. Wow. I've heard it's more safe than I've heard. It's not, there's a lot of problems with um, interpreting what the Mayans said and what they really meant.

Speaker 12:         01:33:20       You know, what a, a myon, Myon, alphabet. The way it works is each image, uh, depicts a sound or a word and like a word, you know, like the, like the way like things were like they would show you like a heard someone describe it this way. Um, it would say, uh, I saw aunt rose would be an eyeball, uh, saw an aunt and a rose. That's how you would say I saw at rose. You'd have to say it like that though. That's the other language. I think Mckenna said that or explain that that way. Um, and um, so when they tried to like decipher a lot of the old Maya and shit, like it's really tricky. I watched this documentary on breaking the mind code. Like their language was so different than ours. Like so alien. It's so hard to say like in English what these guys wrote down in these images and drawings.

Speaker 12:         01:34:13       It's like, man, there's a lot of like filling in the blanks and guesswork and just just in the translation, you know, just, just trying to translate it. It's like you might be getting the same feeling and what they're, they're saying but might not. So there's so much speculation of what does it mean? What is the end of the count, what is this? And then what a lot of people believe is all it is is there's a procession of the equinoxes and it's a 26,000 something year cycle. And what it is is that the earth wobbles on its access, doesn't spin perfectly and it create a completes this wobble every in 26,000 years or something like that. I think it's that much, isn't it? Um, whatever the number is, but that, this is what it was all based. And this is, these are these cycles based on, but it doesn't necessarily mean that anything happens, you know, I mean in, in just because they wrote it down and made a cycle and a calendar and there's counts in the calendar and that this is the end of the long count.

Speaker 12:         01:35:08       December 21st, 2012 unit. That is the day. It doesn't mean that anything happens, you know, there's all these people like there's going to be a great awakening and we are all going to come join in one consciousness and experience mother Gaia. She will speak to us again as she has not in thousands of years since the Mayans last saw her, her, her society in our lights, in our electricity, in our sis sis prescription medicine is a ruined our connection to the great mother maybe or maybe you're a crazy con and you believe in palm reading and you just need your life to be more interesting. That being some fat fucking cheese doodle, Eaton Weirdo that sitting at home, you know, watching ancient aliens on TV. Maybe. Maybe that's not the answer. Maybe 2012 nothing happens. Most likely it's likely, but maybe it's some sort of a technological thing. Maybe it's nothing.

Speaker 12:         01:35:59       Maybe. Maybe it is what mostly singularity. I mean like seriously like what are the odds are hundreds that other planet, they said he was going to hit us and can't Brian, but you can't say that we are, we aren't on a very clear path. Yeah, but do you really think that this day is going to happen and then like everything's going to, something crazy is going to happen for real. Look, if something crazy happens, okay, and if it happens a a decade from now or if it happens tomorrow, what's going to happen is going to be so fucking nuts. You are going to completely be over the fact that someone called the day that he nailed it December 21st he was right. What are the odds? You're not going to care what the odds were because what's going to happen is going to be so fucking world blowing or what's going to happen is something like a time machine or a portal to another dimension or some sort of experience interdimensional experiences that people be able to go through or wormholes or it's something fucking completely crazy that we can't even wrap our heads around now because it's beyond our comprehension.

Speaker 12:         01:36:59       That's what's going to happen and when that does happen, you're not going to give a fuck if it was in December or July, I was there. They're going to say, look man, we've connected all time together in one grouping. You can dive in but you can't dive out who's with me. If you go and you have to realize that your identity dissolves, you no longer exist and you become one of the great mind, do you do it or do not do it? I called the day. I knew it was going to be July 13th look, I wrote it down. No one's going to give a fuck if you wrote it down. You dumped con you in, are you not in? Yeah, but that simple. So you're thinking that that's gonna happen in your lifetime though. Something crazy, you know, dig it that absolutely. Absolutely. The singularity will happen within our lifetime.

Speaker 12:         01:37:38       There's, it's inevitable unless some sort of a natural disaster occurs before that. If something occurs before then and knocks us back, you know, to, who knows? Man, maybe that's the earth's and knock culation system. Maybe the earth is like, listen bitch, we're not ready for you to make the black hole machine yet. So the Earth fucking an asteroid our way. Boom. I mean maybe the, we don't think of the sky being a natural system, but maybe it isn't natural system. You know, maybe just like, you know, bacteria is here to kill off the old people, you know, and, and strong colds in one of those. Therefore, what does that, that battle with the, these invisible forces that kill our loved ones. What is that about? Well, that's a system, man. It's a whole system in place. I mean, you can call it, you know, you could call it bacteria, you can call it germs.

Speaker 12:         01:38:19       You can call it, there's a system. Okay? The system is when you get weak, someone gets you. Okay. And it might be a the flu and might be leukemia, whatever the fuck it might be. There's some crazy biological system. Well, the main that might exist in the software system as well. The dinosaurs might've just got to fucking crazy. It might've just been too nuts and the hole geological system was so fucking off balance like no one's ever going to invent anything. Okay? Here's why. Every time you go outside a 90 foot lizard eats your asshole, okay? No one is going to ever invent shit. We've got to kill these motherfuckers. And progress comes to a screeching halt because there's these super predators. I mean they are the epitome of Super Predator. Look at the t rex giant fucking thick skin lizard monster with huge teeth at each all day.

Speaker 12:         01:39:06       Nothing ever gets done like that. So you've got to come up with a child and 500 mile wide chunk of iron from space go and 45,000 miles and hour slamming into the cross and just fucking everything up. Just fucks the whole Party man, and when that happens, then everything gets to start again and maybe we're just going to, they've rebooted. Yeah. Maybe we're going to get to some point where we're just so retarded and out of control and overpopulated that were piled on top of each other and then maybe the universe reboots us. I think people were waiting 20s thought the same thing probably though. Yeah, but they were right. They were just wrong by the day. The, but the difference between 1920 2010 in your life is a long time in the life of the universe. That ain't shit. Okay. They recognize an ethic and they sought an advance.

Speaker 12:         01:39:56       That's what it is. They just were wrong about the date when they thought the apocalypse was coming 10,000 years ago. They were right. Okay. They were just off by 10,000 years and 10,000 years isn't shit, but everybody was paying attention. If you look at the direction that human beings are going, we all recognize it's going to some crazy point. That's not a fucking bright future. There's no way. There's no way. If population keeps increasing and increasing and increasing, and we keep polluting and polluting and fighting and war in Iran gets nuclear weapons, we got issues, some shit's going to go down. It's inevitable. And everybody recognized that back in the biblical days. They recognize that 500 years ago they recognized that in the 1920s and they were right. They were right. It's just, that's the way it's moving. It just takes time. So that's what all this 2012 shit is, you know, whether it's 2012 or when Jesus comes back, I've got these fucking videos that are awesome.

Speaker 12:         01:40:49       Okay? They are all, it's Kirk Cameron series, their VHS. You gotta get, I gotta buy them on Vhs, man. That's awesome. They are. And it's uh, it's, I forget what they're fucking calls like a crazy Christian though. Right beyond, he believes the rapture that is going to happen when Jesus is going to come back. All the beautiful people that love Jesus is going to disappear and they're going to leave us stranded in hell. The hell of earth, the God like God is going to come and take away. He believes basically that God is like an alien who's going to take all his, his brother's back to the mothership. He's fucked. How nutty is that concept? And people who know it's not an alien moon. It's the rupture. It's going to take us to heaven. We're going to live forever with love. It's not like aliens. You're going to heaven.

Speaker 12:         01:41:36       You're going to space. You're leaving this planet. You're going to disappear. We're not. No little God is going to remove us from no you dude, you might as well be beaming a board. Okay, you're, you're using magic and you're going to go to some special place and you don't think that's nuts. These videos are awesome. They're awesome, and he really sells them in the videos. Oh yeah, man, these people are believe in this man. It's a window into madness and it's all based. Like there's a, there's a, um, there's a whole book series that's written by these two dudes that right, these apocalyptic, you know, rapture books and they sell like crazy. God, I'm going to have to Google this now because I don't remember the name of this guy. It's kind of important. Um, because uh, the whole idea is pretty fucking interesting. What's your religion man?

Speaker 12:         01:42:23       Are you religious or nonreligious? Left behind. That's what it's about. These are the books that I was raised Catholic though, where I was two. That's good enough. Right? Catholic like inoculates you, cause it's so silly, you know? Ridiculous. Yeah. And everybody's fucking everybody and hitting their money and shit. You know, you don't really such a ridiculous, when I look at it now, I'm like, really? You're going to believe some of this shit, any of this shit. Really? Yeah. It's like, it's so ridiculous. Who wrote this book? Yeah, the left behind series. You've got to check it out. They may, I think they made two videos. I'm pretty sure how both of them, if I don't, I'm going to buy them. If they come out with new ones, I'm buying them to Blu ray there. Awesome. Ingredia Unintentional Kirk Cameron on Ray, three day can occur. Came as curly hair will come.

Speaker 12:         01:43:09       So if you, if you were raised Catholic, you know, I have all this Indian art around my house and you were very aware of what all this shit is and you are very aware of, you know, what the names for them and everything like that. How do you know all that stuff? That's still, my parents are from India. Right? So you used to know things you go when you go to visit family and stuff you would see not in their houses, but like you would see it around India. And I'd ask what is that? What does that, it needs a pretty fascinating fucking country when you think about the history of all these weird fucking really thoughtful things have come out of India. You know, just uh, the, the, the history of Yoga, you know, in the Yogis and the sod dues and you know, all those dudes sitting around smoking chillums and trying to figure out the universe and you know, the hot vogue Eda and, or Mahabharata

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and um, you know, what is, um, what is the fucking, there was another one, another ancient texts. It's really fascinating. She stayed in my hot Parada's. What are those like little breads, their breads, little Paratas and mom would make them, when was the first time you saw a chicken that wasn't red? Huh? Chicken. It wasn't reg. Reg Chicken. Red Chicken. The Indian chicken. Yeah. Oh, turn dirty red chicken. The BHAGAVAD Gita, right. That's what it's called. The new book. The ancient Hindu book. What Oppenheimer quoted after you fucking blew up the atomic bomb, which is very nice. So you got fucking wild. That was never a religion though. You know, it was just a way of life. Really. Yeah. And then somebody wrote it down and became a religion. It's almost like if somebody said, uh, wrote down the rules to yoga and then people started following it, like a religious will.

Speaker 3:          01:44:42       They do. Yeah. Right. So look, I know people that are younger people, you know, they classify themselves as yoga people. They might as well be in a cult. I mean they really might as well be. I mean it's very beneficial and it's helping them a lot. Certainly helps. Like, they all, they all have great energy and they're all like really friendly people. But it's, um, it's, it's, might as well be a cult, you know, it's like sort of the same sort of thing. They start talking and there's one chick, you fucking ring your phone again, dude. No, that's wrong with you. What was that? Zoom and sound like a song. Huh? This one. Any religion though, the minute it gets written down, it becomes a religion I guess. But I mean the yoga thing is a fascinating thing because it really, but it really is, is some sort of a body maintenance thing, you know, they figured out how to maintain your body in maintaining like your health and maintain like a certain certain sense of clarity.

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       And a lot of that shit came out of India. Man. A lot of that shit, you know, came out of the, uh, you know, the, the, like a lot of the ancient India way of way of life, like with, with the saw do's and with these, uh, these yogis. And I always wonder like, why this one area, you know, if you look at all these different areas of Europe, all these different areas like India especially has a lot of like really trippy shit that came from India. Like all your artwork, the Indian artwork and not your artwork. I'll yet people, you know, you people, the Canadian Indian artwork is all so fascinating, man. It's all really trippy. Like, you know, she Eva's with, you know, they're fucking six arms and shit and like, it's all really, really bizarre. Like psychedelic heady stuff I talked about.

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       It's a, it's a very state of mind country. Yeah. When you go there, I talk about it and funny enough in my act, but um, no, I'm good. Thanks. Did you happen to see that Yogi bear parody where Yogi kills a booboo? No. Did you see that? So talk about nonsequitors. You mother fucker ever talking about India? Well, trippy MD. We're talking about yoga. Yoga. This is yoga. That is not what we're talking about. I'm not talking about Yogi bear. I, he's brought that up because no one was saying anything. So, oh, I see. Oh, why was

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       it saved us clever things to say about those index. Good. Safe. Why don't you try yoga, Brian? Maybe that'll bring it job fucking hard, dude. I done it a few times. It's great. Especially if you're single. It's the best place ever to go to meet girls and see they're buttholes and stuff. See their bottles. Just see him move around. They're barely wearing anything. Especially you get the hot sweaty one. They're like, it's, it's just amazing. It's just naked chicks pretty much. And it's naked chicks that looking out for their health. Yeah. Right. So they're healthy, naked, good bronze. Yeah. Especially the eat like good stuff. Eat good food. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       You know what? Some chicken hot dogs all the time with that stinky as beer pussy. Yeah, totally. But too much vegetables, micro farts thing. So yeah. Really? Yeah. More than meat. I don't know. I find vegetarian Scully, vegetarians have the worst far too ever. Oh my God. Oh Man. I guess eve you think about it until like one vegetables rot. Yeah. Shit is terrible. Meet Roddick smells worse. It's got to smell worse, man. You know, it's really gross. It's not meet Rod. I challenged. I was challenged by a, I was defining it in my head by thickness. You've never smelled my friend Tate Fletcher's farts. Now I'm kind of great shit. Really do that. Sometimes you don't even know what you're talking about son. You think you do you think you know, smelling farts like when you get like one of these UFC motherfuckers farts on, you rotate dudes who are digging pro tubs, the synthesix all day and I try to stay a maintain it about two 39, 239 pounds of muscle and they fought and just clear out buildings.

Speaker 3:          01:48:20       Yep. Yep. Yo our friend Tate. I always find the better, uh, the shape. The persons in the worst. Their farts are really, it's cause the protein man, they a lot of protein that should cakes up inside you and formed pockets. Just stews and then finally comes out in a gaseous form. I've been having some pretty bad ones lately. I don't know why. And I keep reviewing my diet and my head and go, what the fuck is causing this dead animal in my body to come out? I love Indian food man. And if you eat Indian food, you know there's a place down the street from me. You know the reason why you know your farts smell that way. Like when you smell Indian food, Indian food farts are very specific to, because they're very normal to me. See for me in our house it'd be like somebody with a partner would smell. My Dad boy who ate macaroni and

Speaker 2:          01:49:08       somebody's been eating shit in this house in fifth grade they let a hamburger in fifth grade. Our teachers actually had to pull the whole class aside cause our one Indian guy named Omar for sure they had they, I guess everyone made fun of his farts cause they smelled different than owners and so they had to like explain to our class when he was out in the hallway that do not make fun of him. He eats, he has a special diet and they have, that's hilarious. I remember that clear as day Port Omar, if you're out there religious special diets or the other

Speaker 3:          01:49:35       shit man, I have a buddy of mine that was, makes me lucky and he was a fighter. He was a taekwondo fighter and he used to on Ramadan, you know, you're not allowed to, I don't know exactly what the masses, you fast until sun down down. You think you're allowed to drink

Speaker 12:         01:49:49       water, right? Nothing. Yeah. I don't even think you could do shit. And so, you know, he would still compete even though he had to do this, you know, but it would just just wreck him physically. He was just useless, you know, like it didn't, one of them was there a basketball player that did that as well. There was like a famous basketball player, Chemo Xuan I believe it was, was it him? I don't remember what it was cause I'm not really a basketball fan, but it was one shut up man. There was one famous basketball player who used to do this. He's to the Robin Don thing and he couldn't eat. Then he would go play basketball suck. They're like, whenever the fucking, you know, people would get pissed off and over Ramadan would come around. I don't remember who it was, but uh, it's, it's weird when people stick so fucking rigidly to like weird little rules.

Speaker 12:         01:50:31       Like that about eating. You know, like, yeah, I don't get that. That's a luxury of people that have too much food. If that's what you're coming up with, you should be just eating to stay healthy. All right. Stop. Stop with the, you know, if you're going to fucking love God, go love God. You don't have to love God with your food. You fucking freak. Yeah. You have to deny yourself a food when you have it. Jesus Christ who put the food there. If you believe in God, don't you think he'd put the food in your life? He wants you to eat it. You fuck it doesn't want you to starving yourself all day for his love. He made the whole universe. He you think he's impressed with you starving yourself all day,

Speaker 3:          01:51:04       dear God, I did not eat that pig today. Yeah, it gave me the eye. I'm addicted to Crock pots right now. Really? Tell me what's so nice. You just throw chicken in there. Put some lemons in there. Wait, six hours later you have like our real hardcore meal, you know, hardcore chicken and lemon in a crockpot. Yeah, the old south. Delightful. I'm staking some vegetables in there. Bam. You got these steps a difference in you and I right there in a nutshell. I like cooking over fire when it's cold outside. Outside. Yeah. Like, and I like real wood, but what you're talking about Goldie three here, it's been 83 here in la. 40. I used to like do it in Colorado, but I did it with a gun in my pocket. But I lived in Colorado because I was cooking meat outside, you know, with fucking wild animals.

Speaker 3:          01:51:53       I lived in the woods. Dude. I know. I remember when you left. Yeah, I lived there for a few months. If it wasn't for the wife, I'd still be out there. I remember you, uh, listened to our one podcast when we were talking about third base. Remember he was texting at the time. It's right, right. What was it? What was the issue that came out and I can't remember. You guys were looking for the name of pace that that leads to search [inaudible] Minister Pete. Nice Prime Minister Pete. Nice. And there was in search and Richie rich, I believe was their Dj. Yeah, those guys were good dude. Why? What happened to them? How come they disparage started a clothing company and why did he stop rapping? I don't know. You can't wrap forever. Why can't you? Why not to stand up? There's only so many and do stand up forever. You can't be too successful and just keep wrapping. You know? Why not babies? I don't know. Why can't you? I

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       know. It's a young man's sport. This rapping. It's like a, it's almost like an a a sport. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:52:52       Why is it is because the young man are, we appreciate a certain amount of swagger and cockiness and confidence in young men when we see it. An old man. It's stupid. Especially men that aren't too old yet. Yeah. We'll accept it again once you hit 90

Speaker 5:          01:53:06       yeah, exactly. You know, it's like watching old fighters. You're like, man, I remember when you were good. He slowed down. Yeah. You're not going to, reflexes aren't the same.

Speaker 3:          01:53:14       What was that her days? Oh, that's one of the weirdest things ever is watching a fighter deteriorate. Very, very strange thing. God dammit. Jeff, you mother fuckers is m yes it is. I'm doing a podcast, I'll tell you about pop goes. Yeah, that was a good one. That was a, they were, see this is like one of the first hater songs. They were upset at a vanilla ice getting paid. Oh, that's right. Yeah. For turning this out. Turn this up.

Speaker 5:          01:53:45       That's right. He's dressed up as vanilla ice. The complaint is, I should have started when was against phony phony entertainers like what they're doing is valid bulletin veil. Isis doing was not paid. It's 91 so something's got to change 10 years ago. Pick the music and makes sense. This mom around my mom and met Milli Vanilli one week before they got caught in the elevator, they, they showed an hour later go legally linked to go with the ways of the week. No Angelo surface. No. Who's that friend of mine, comedian. Him and him and Joey. I was end up going out for the same roles because they same size. Right. So Angela was flying to South Africa. Whoa. And he gets on the plane and this guy sits beside him up in business class and he's like, and the guy says, send again, it looks into this, hey man, I, I recognize you were a comedian, right?

Speaker 5:          01:54:43       And he goes, oh yeah, hey, it goes and then you go, it looks enemy. And he goes, Holy Fuck, it's K Fed, right? It's like, okay, that's cool. Kevin Federline, the guy used to be married to a British man. So he's like, oh, they're talking the whole flight. And he's like, what are you going here for? I'm shooting a commercial for something and cause yeah, I'm doing the show. You should come to my show and blah blah blah. All right Kev. All right. In the guys k fed was doing a commercial was the story here. So they invite them to the show and he shows up to the show and he's backstage with all his friends and he's like, hey guys, this is a k fed and just cut me rob. And he's like, all right, that's k fed. And then I'm at a med was with him and he, I met him and polls goes, hey, that's not kayfabe. That's vanilla ice. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:55:33       wow. You know what son of a bitch. It's like you had to be painful for Vanilla ice cause then he realizes that he's in that category of town famous who you make fun of, but they're right here so you don't make fun of them. I have a slight possibility to sleep with Britney spears zone. Well he definitely did that. You know, in the right category still vanilla ice was like legit superstar performer for a short period of time. Had a few big hits. Scott that do it yourself. Sean has come up. Do you remember what Vanilla I, he does. He's a renovation show on like the HGTV. Really understand. That's hilarious. Do you remember when a vanilla ice boxed Todd, what did he do? Did he bought Todd bridges? Todd bridges beat the fuck out of Vanilla ice horse. Of course. Sort of bridges is black. That and the other guys trying to be black and now he's doing [inaudible]. It's always any kind of trying to be blind. For instance, I have a real black blacks, always real black. Oh Dude, that's, there is some logic and science

Speaker 12:         01:56:37       to what you just said. Yes, of course. A guy who's trying to be black, talking to a guy who's black fighting. So true. So true. There's no way he could win. Never. He should have known going into that contest, still

Speaker 3:          01:56:51       can deliberately newsy. Maybe thought that Todd bridges was a fake black because he was a child celebrity and he was on different strokes, raised by a white, but he was only raised by a white on TV and not collated from that. All that Hollywood shit crack cleaned them out of that crack, cleaned that out, and brought him back to his roots ghetto, back to his inner ghetto tide had Dana on this side too. Not White either.

Speaker 12:         01:57:19       Plato. Mm. That was a, that's a disturbed show, man. When you look at all the things that happened to those people on that show, you got to go, Whoa, what the fuck,

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       Tom? He's the last man standing.

Speaker 12:         01:57:30       Yeah, and and Dana Plato all fucked up.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       Huge celebrities on TV. Everybody's had them and now he's doing ICDC commercials. What does that mean? I is it ICDC? Yeah, the College Community College,

Speaker 12:         01:57:46       we had them on the fear factor who was, um, it was a very angry guy. Man. There's some dudes where you, you like you're hanging out with them and you're talking to them or whatever and you go, oh, okay, I can, I can tell you in 10 minutes, 90% of what's wrong with your life. It's the way you're fucking acting man. Who's like a spoiled child. Like when he lost and he got eliminated from the shell, he goes, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       Oh, I see what's up. I see what's up. You guys don't want me to win. Like he was like, like a child and he was like a man in his thirties. I went to shake his hand and need the cockroaches. I wanted to shake his hand. Yeah, exactly. He wouldn't shake hands

Speaker 12:         01:58:18       me. And I'm like, okay, good, good. I'm glad. I'm glad to get out of here.

Speaker 3:          01:58:22       Who Was it? That one episode where the guy wanted to, we had to slap down. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:58:26       Oh yeah, there was a couple, there was a couple. And they've, they've, they've fought with each other all the time and screamed and yell at each other like one, one time on a, on a show. He had thrown her to the ground. I'm one of the shows and another reality show they were on. So we had been told that this guy was like violent and they could be dangerous. And so, um, we, uh, we did the show and the girl had been taunted the whole time the show is going on. It was the guy, the guy's name was, um, Jonathan and I forget what his wife's, Victoria was, his wife. And there was another kid, the dude who got fucked up by Danny Bonaduce once he was on survivor, Johnny, fuck, I can't remember his name. Anyway, Johnny. Anyway, what happens was this kid is an awesome shit talker.

Speaker 12:         01:59:09       And while they were off, they're doing their stunts. He was like screaming at them, Jonathan, you can do better. She's dead weight. She's dead weight man. And she's holding you back. And it was really funny, man, because they were frustrated and yelling and screaming at each other and he was like dumper, and she was like, Yo, shop. And he's like, you see this man, this is bad energy, dude. You don't need this. And so he's like totally torturing them while they're don't go into their stunting, they're fucking up and they can't find their flashlight. It's a disaster. Right? So when, when they come back, after they got eliminated, the girl walks up to this Johnny kid, Johnny fucking forget his name and punches him. Just straight up hits him. And I go, Whoa, Whoa, what the fuck? You can't assault people trying to fairplay thank you.

Speaker 12:         01:59:53       That's him. And I'm like, just because you, you fucking hit your husband doesn't mean you can hit other people. And then the husband goes, hey. And he gets in my face and all I could think to say was, no, hey, hey, hey. He says, hey, hey, hey. So I said, no. All I can think of is this guy's going to hit me. Like for sure. He was a total loose cannon and he was screaming and yelling at his wife just seconds ago, and now he's like in my face and I'm like, this guy easily could hit me. So I shoved him away from me. I said, get the fuck out of my face. Don't touch me, don't come close to me. And then he came back again and he goes, touch me again. And then I just pushed him again and then I grabbed his head. Then I grabbed the back of his head and I just held onto them.

Speaker 12:         02:00:34       I was like, if he hits me, I'm going to nee is fucking brain into another part of the universe, but I'm not going to do anything until he tries to hit me. So I just held onto him, but I was convinced that he was going to hit me. It was like, you just go straight. Held him down on, anyway, I just grabbed the back of his head. I got him in a Thai clinch, has grabbed the back of his head. I just, it was right there, just grab it. I was like, I wasn't gonna choke him. I thought about choking him, but I'm like, if I choke them, then I've done something to them. Right now I'm just holding onto him. Oh, sorry. I just grabbed a hold of his head and I just handled them until they pulled us apart. But no, nothing ever happened.

Speaker 12:         02:01:06       But it was, uh, it's, it's weird when there's someone that's that dangerous at someone's, that, that has that little control over their, their physicality and their emotions. Those are usually the guys that I've never been punched in their face usually. Yes. Usually guys that I was run off with, the lips never been punched in the mouth. Usually he completely panicked. Once I grabbed him, he went like a child. He didn't know what to do. He didn't know to hit me or push me away. So he didn't do anything. He kind of just flailed his arms in this weird, like panicky moving thing. You know, most people are not used to conflict like conflict. When you do Jujitsu, you know, you used to physical conflict all the time. It's like a normal thing. Just, it's not, it doesn't seem unnatural. But for a lot of people don't fucking hyperventilate. Like I've seen people in the street street fights just straight hyperventilate, freak out and not know what to do, not know how to handle themselves. It's not cool. It's not good to be around fucking crazy creepy people, but if you're going to be around crazy creepy people, it's way better. If you know how to fight, the last thing you want is them knowing how to fight and they're crazy and creepy and you're the last fucking this fucking drowning in this ocean of panic. What are you doing? Reading

Speaker 5:          02:02:15       tests? I'm reading, I'm reading these walks your talk. One sided conversation where him, I'm listening and I'm reading these and maybe we should end this. Maybe it's time has come. This is what I did is what happens when every, every show comes to an end. Eventually after a while. Brian, so do it. We're going, what are we going to keep talking about? Carlos Newton at the fight when I was there. Did you I, I trained with him a couple of times. How long have you done Jujitsu? I just used to roll around with the, there's a comedian named Ron Jostle. Leta a Canada. Oh yeah, back in [inaudible] 97 I used to bark. I stopped boxing in 94 but he wanted to learn how to strike in [inaudible] 97 and he was doing Jujitsu and I was like you will never get past the boxer. Oh that's fun. And in seconds I was screaming like a bitch cause he had me in an arm bar.

Speaker 5:          02:02:57       And so then you learned it? Yeah, I try trained with them for a little bit. That's cool. Do you do anything now? No. That's why I was asking because I want to go somewhere and do something. Cause where do you spend the majority of your time? While on the road. But I'm gonna be here now for a while. Okay. Well with the new developments. Yeah. Where? Well you don't want to tell me where you live on the air. Just fucking people are creepy man. Angeles. Whoa. That's very savvy. They want to know where you are. They, where are you Russell? I need to talk to you. I tried to look in the bag and have given you scripts and shit. Yeah, it didn't have a TV show coming out. I have, I have a deal with NBC, but we don't, you know, waiting on that script. Right. I don't get any scripts. No. You don't get any scripts? What do you mean how? I mean the agency sends them to me, but it's not like here they want you for this film. It's like, see if you like anything in the here and then I'll try and get you an audition. I'm like, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm not going to start fucking reading things. Guess it just for the sake of you.

Speaker 12:         02:03:51       Well, I think that with your popularity is a comedian. Doing a sitcom would be a natural thing. It would just get somebody really good and write something for you. Totally. The fuck is wrong with them. Cooking or writing more time shutting up. Brian,

Speaker 5:          02:04:04       fuck is wrong with you, Brian. How about a news radio type of thing? That was, that was so high. Can my brother, my brother has every season on DVD.

Speaker 12:         02:04:13       It's hard to do one of those though. You got to get the most important things. You have to have a powerful writer and a powerful producer. The guy's got to be good. They have to good with good sensibilities. There's just not a lot of them. There's a lot of them are hand. You had a lot of good people and you, yeah. Yeah. You can get good people though. There's a lot of good people. You could do three, four, five, six, seven casts of good people in La. You can find a lot of talented comedic actors, you know, that could put it into TV shows and if you figured out how to write specifically for them, you could have it really good. It's, you know, a lot of that is luck. It's really hard as finding the right writing and find, cause look, look after news radio, how many of us went off and did and did successful sitcoms on our own?

Speaker 12:         02:04:52       None. None of us did. You know, everyone tried. I had a couple of pilots. I had a couple of things that I was writing and things that I did or things that I went up for. It's just, it's too hard to find something good. You know? I would get these things and I would read them and I'd be like, fuck man, I couldn't do this. Like this is clunky, dumb, hacky horseshit and once you do like a really good show, it's hard man. So terrible feeling for a stand up to be doing shitty comedy and might even be able to change it. That's a terrible feeling that I get to. I get that story edit once it's written, so that's good. Yeah. You get to the story on it. Oh that's great man. If you write your own shit, if you had your own idea and sat down and came up with your own shit, that would be the move, man. That would be the move because you're the only guy that really can write for you and you can't get some fucking dude who's not really even a standup. It was like some sort of a, you've got to find like a really powerful fucking really bright guy

Speaker 5:          02:05:47       to news radio but haven't podcasting. I'm listening and it's our life, Brian. It's 24 hours a day. Right. And just because, I mean if you think about it like the news, radio things good like radios are pretty much dead. Dad seen on the new things, podcasting have a sitcom around podcasting and mixed. It was mixed up with friends. Maybe have like a little black child, like different strokes. That's not a bet. No, you don't want to go different strokes. You're on Fox right back then. No. NBC News Radio.

Speaker 12:         02:06:13       You see I was on a show on Fox before that they'll call hardball. That was full. There was only like seven episodes, I think aired maybe six [inaudible] seven shot, terrible show. And there was a yours? No, it was, I was the star of it, but it was a baseball show on was one of the stars. There's a bunch of other people in it. But uh, it was, uh, it was one of those shows that was really funny at one point. And then you got butchered. The guys who wrote it as guys, Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran, they wrote for um, uh, they wrote for a married with children. They wrote for the Simpsons. Really, really funny guys. But the network didn't think that they could produce a show. They didn't think that they could, like, they were hard enough to run a show. So what they wanted to do was give it to a producer and that producer took over and just started rewriting everything and turned it into their show runner. Jack that up. Shit, it became dog shit. Just total hackneyed obvious dog shed. And um, that's not fun, you know, and that's what a lot of happen. A lot of that happens in Hollywood. You know, there's a lot of weird nepotism where they know that a guy worked on a successful show. It's like he must have the magic. He worked on coach. Yep. You know, so they, they bring the coach man in. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:07:22       The system, the from called. They always do that with 10 coach. They always do that with me. Yeah. You know, Russell, this is, this is, this is, this is what we've done before and it's worked, and I go, well, clearly everything I've done in my career is not been the regular. Right,

Speaker 12:         02:07:36       right. I didn't get to this level because I fall on the same path that you think is the, the, the, the key to success here. The key to humor too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The key to humor is like, man, it's so hard to gauge one person's humor. Like, I don't know if I could do it as, as a comic and a comedian and a writer. I don't know if I could take someone else's comedy, I would have to be so intimate with that person's comedy till I try to write a, a plot or an idea for them, like you're going to get, you know, your idea of what their ideas would be. I think Louie CK did it the best thing I did it, I'm, so, that's probably the best example of how to do it. Perfect. Is that a new show on Fx, right? Yeah. The new show. Yeah. Yeah. He totally got it right. I watched a couple episodes. He, he's, I love Louie. Yeah, he's perfect. He's doing exactly the right way. Why don't you marry him? You married him. You guys aren't gonna marry him, ginger babies. Um, no, we're not going to marry him. I am Brian. I think you died 10 minutes ago.

Speaker 12:         02:08:40       Your body's being run by bacteria. Coconut water, your body. Yes. Your body is being run by bacteria that was living in the coconut water and I die. It's going to be like aliens where that robot dyes and all that milk starts coming out of them. Let me ask you a question that you already asked me. What do you think about all this? 2012 Shit? Um, I dunno. I keep watching all these things and uh, what's that? Uh, no. Bureau, that planet, they said it's going to hit us. Well, yeah. Well there they did discover a large object they believe exists way outside of Pluto, some large Jupiter sized object. Have you ever had meat, you Kako on your show? No, but I got a chance to talk to him once on the opiod Anthony show and ask them a bunch of questions. He was on the phone.

Speaker 12:         02:09:21       It's fucking great man. That guy's awesome. I do love that guy. He's, he's really smart. God there's people like him out there. Yeah. Cause I don't have that kind of patients, you know, like these theoretical planes. Well he's so educated and intelligent and his whole life has been, you know, in this pursuit of wisdom. I don't know if that kind of devotion to shit, you know, it's like my, my thing about so many things is like how much time would it really take to kind of understand what the fuck this guy really knows. Like when you hear about string theory, you know, and you hear about like you just the idea behind it, how long would you really have to study it before you truly understood what the fuck they're talking about? I've watched documentaries on string theory a bunch of times and I never really know what I'm taking away.

Speaker 12:         02:10:05       But I know I'm fascinated with the whole time. Fascinating the whole time. But just like what you know, there could be, I watched one with c w with Michio Kaku where he's talking about there could be another you and another dimension that took a left when you took a right and he went out on a totally different life journey is happening right now, Simon, talking about parallel universes and that there might be an infinite number of used doing the same life and going in an infinite number of different directions all at once. And then there's the other thought that you, your, you are traveling and transgressing through different parallel dimensions all the time. And the one you exist in right now is the one you exist and because of your choices and literally is not the same one as the one you started off in, that you have been with every decision you make in your life. You're moving into a new dimension. You're moving into some new universe, some new parallel existence. What the fuck are we talking about? Folks were talking crazy shit.

Speaker 5:          02:11:03       Um, I was in Houston. I'm, I'm almost, I'm so fascinated by the moon landing thing. Oh, are you? Yeah. You may as well because I was, so, I was in Houston recently and there was this Indian girl waiting by the bus for an autograph and a picture. Very nice, very innocent. And she was like, I just wanted to take a picture. She's from India to write. I was like, cool, no problems. She goes, you know, my whole class at the university is all big fans. I'm like, that's great. Thank you very much, didn't you? I go, what are you guys studying? And she said, uh, um, astrophysicist. I'm like, are you kidding me? I go so well, like, what do you mean you designing spacecrafts who were studying it and we're, you know, we, yes, we are. That's ultimately what we're doing. And I said, so let me ask you a question.

Speaker 5:          02:11:50       Have we gone to the moon? And she goes, they say, we've gone to the moon. I go, I go, what does that mean? Well, they said, we went to the moon. I go, so is it possible that we went to the moon? No, it's not possible that we went to the moon, but they've said, we went to the moon. It's physically impossible to go to the moon in this day and age. She said, that is not possible then how would it be possible now? What was her reasoning for saying that it's possible? She said the van Allen Radiation Belt, she said it would peel off your skin. She said, it's not like, you know, it's not like it would affect your later. She said it would literally your skin would fall off. We can't

Speaker 12:         02:12:28       devil's advocate though. There are readings of the Van Allen Radiation Belt they've released online that you could find where they show the levels that are out there and the amount of exposure to the astronauts would have gone through if they did what they said they did. And there's a bunch of people that have said that they would survive it. That's all just on paper though. My problem with it is they never sent a fucking chicken in the space and have that motherfucker come back alive and they did it with astronauts. They did it with American civilian or American, uh, you know, astronauts during the apex of a 20 year solar cycle. Really, you went all the way out there? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:13:03       Yeah. She said it's just too far to, it would take too long. There's no way they got up there and then send a transmission back that quick either. Yeah. That's kind of trippy to, she's like, there's no way. Like there's just, it's not physically possible.

Speaker 12:         02:13:16       What's really trippy is that only did they do that. They actually timed the, the, the, the panning of the camera from, from Houston to catch the lunar module as it separates from the moon surface and they follow it up. The time the Pan, like they timed all that on a delay from, from Houston. Like maybe they did it, maybe they did it. She knew I wasn't there. She literally pointed at my iPhone and said, you have more technology in this, true than you did. And all of that. It's not just about technology, it's about calculations. It's about thrust, it's about speed. It's about catching the, the, you know, the, the, the rotation of the movement coming back along with it. It's the slingshot effect. And, but I'm not saying that they, I'm not saying that. I think they did do it cause I'm not convinced they went.

Speaker 12:         02:14:01       But you got to make sure that when you argue about things like this, like that the science, the science is really tricky. Like you have to know way too much to really know what the fuck you talking about. I don't, I don't, but what I do know is I know bullshit. Okay. And I'm real good at bullshit. I'm Mama if you lie to me, man, I can tell. I can see twitches in your eyes. I can smell bullshit a mile away. I've been around so many creeps my whole life I just fucking, and just being a comedian and being a student of the human animal, when you watch the Apollo 11 press conference when they, the post flight press conference, that to me was one of the biggest pieces of evidence that something's really wrong because they're clearly bullshitting. There's no doubt about it. If you watch the Apollo 11 press conference, the post five plus post flight press conference, they are, they're talking about this like, like they're just like making shit up.

Speaker 12:         02:14:58       It's like, it doesn't seem like they have any connection to what they're talking about. It doesn't seem remotely like it was a part of their life that you're describing. It seems like Horse Shit and it seems like horse shit and they're nervous and they're answering questions. You know, it's, we've never gone back. We've never even come close. The only time human beings I've ever been more than 400 miles above the earth's surface was them. The all the, uh, the moon missions, all the ones when they flew over it and didn't land and the ones that they did land between 1969 in 1972, they went and landed and supposedly and came back. It's far, it's 250 million or 250,000 miles, which is, think about that. Think about the fact they did that in 69. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. Moving into 2011. Yeah, we should have had some sort of a that's so revisit.

Speaker 12:         02:15:48       Let's check and see what's that. If anything's changed up there, but people look at it, man, it's like a technological Jesus. You're not supposed to question it. It's a deity. It's a technological day day. Well, yeah, I mean, but at the same time we're also in, in the space race with Russia. We had to beat them at something. Yeah, but did we even are where we even, you know, at the highest levels, and I wonder if, what if we're going to find out a shit and wikileaks at the highest levels. I wonder how much corroboration there is between governments and I wonder how much of the fucking Cold War it's just to keep everybody in line. You know? Who knows, who knows how much at the highest level there was actual real communication and exchanging of information. You know, I don't, I don't fucking know, man. I don't know. I would not pretend to know. I know exactly what's going on because then, you know, people say, well, if the Russians were weren't in on it, why didn't they write America out? I don't know. You know that doesn't mean they didn't fake it. You know there's, there's a lot of fucking shit. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:16:40       Cause they never come out. Because if the government can lie about that, they can. What else can they learn? Right.

Speaker 12:         02:16:45       Everything from 1969 is cheaper, easier and faster to do today except go to the mode and it's like there's nothing else that jets are faster. The weapons are better, the technology is better for communication. Everything's better except space travel and everybody's will Dutch cause it's a lot of money. Maybe. Maybe it's possible that that's all it is. It's possible that everybody just looks for a conspiracy and everything and it's like you're just looking too hard. And it shows, it seems crazy, but it's just because there's an atmosphere list object and it's out in space. Maybe. Or maybe they faked it. That's possible too. There's a lot of weird shit to it. There's a lot of weird shit. But the fact that Neil Armstrong becomes some sort of a recluse and stops talking to people and Buzz Aldrin goes insane. Fossil Algebra became like a serious alcoholic after the moon landings. It's a weird fucking, there's a lot of weird

Speaker 5:          02:17:34       something has to get into your head to make you turn this.

Speaker 12:         02:17:36       Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit with the fucking lunar orbiter, the lunar module he ever, he ever watched like them try to do that thing on earth and what, there's a famous video footage of Neil Armstrong in that thing and he objects and it falls to the ground explodes and blows up in flames. But Dan, that bitch worked like a charm when they were up there on the moon though. They got that off the whole re engineered and figured out perfectly. So it worked flawlessly on every mission. Maybe. Then there's the prime minister of Holland was given a moon rock by Neil Armstrong and buzz Aldrin and they fucking recently, like within the last couple of years they found out that it's not a moon rockets, petrified wood. This is in a plaque given to them by the astronauts. Like here we've brought you back a souvenir from the moon, sir. Why? I picked this one myself. I chipped it off and we brought it to you because we value the relationship that America has with your country. Emails. A piece of petrified wood.

Speaker 5:          02:18:30       Yeah. I got duped into buying a watch that, so I'll let you watch allegedly made from the face of a moon surface of the Moon from the moon rock. Really? I saw one of those, I saw it was in one of those super rich guy magazines like a, it's got Ferrari's on the cover, the dupont registry, you know, is that, where'd you got it from? No, I was in a store that sold high end watches. Tell me, I'm a watch nerd. So I was like this company Ro ro Manger Jerome. How could they possibly get moon rocks? I don't know that that's going to be listening. What does it mean? You know, it's a federal crime to be in possession of a moon rock. Uh, allegedly. There was one point in time where they had auctioned off a piece of moon rock and they'd just grounded down to mid company. This company may took it and made the inside face of the watch. Oh really? Just like a little thin layer of it. And then they made it to shape like the moon. And then I, and that same company got a piece of the titanic was auctioned off

Speaker 12:         02:19:28       and uh, and uh, they made the Bezel of the watch with a piece of the iron from the titanic. Wow. That one's going to believable for me. That's totally believable. Well, I mean, I guess they did bring back, no matter what, even with unmanned spacecrafts, the Russians brought back a bunch of moon dust, you know, not a bunch like enough to make 100,000 fucking watches, but you know, there's enough to study, you know, the, um, the whole subject is such a controversial subject because it's one of one of the very few subjects where people immediately think you are fucking crazy if you even think about it. Yeah. And that's a weird thing. Whenever you get a subject that's like that, where if you, if you even consider it, if you don't even take a stand, if you consider it, you're a quack and a crazy person, it's like, I, there are things like that, like the hollow earth.

Speaker 12:         02:20:14       Yeah, there are things like that, but even the hollow earth, I'll listen to what they have to say. It sounds completely insane, but I'll listen to it. When I listened to my Brian, I just, that hurts him. What'd you hear? Sound like a Dork. Fucking see I in or knocking or sounds to fucking see NASA. They're coming, they're coming for Ya. You know, and it's, it's one of those things where you use, a lot of people don't want to talk about the subject because if you pick a position or if you do agree that there's some anomalies and there's some weird shit to the photography, the photography, it looks like they're in spotlights and you know, there's all, there's all these discussions about Pr, you know, intersecting shadows, shadows coming from different light sources, that kind of stuff. I find a little corny, but it is a little corny, but the spotlight shit's not corny.

Speaker 12:         02:20:58       It's like, yeah, this guy is very clearly under a light source. And there's also photos where it looks like a guy's very clearly filled in. Like the, the idea the moon is that it's supposed to be, you know, in, you know, it's like a zoo, really extreme contrast. A lot of the photographs of, of dark and light, except when there's astronauts involved when they want a nice clear shot of a guy coming out of the lunar module. Meanwhile the sun is behind him. He should be in darkness. It's a lot of tricky shit and a lot of people will come up with excuses. They'll say, whoa, we could be this, the contour of the surface of the moon and reflects like, yes, it could be that. Or it could be. There was a dude standing there with a big fucking piece of aluminum foil and it was making sure the light fills in that photograph because they were doing it in the Goddamn movie studio.

Speaker 12:         02:21:42       That's possible too, man. When I think area 51 is for, it's all for developing weapons. That's what I think. I think all those things that people keep seeing in the sky that to Ufo man, those are easily to be drones. You know, that to me is more likely than aliens wanted us so badly. They wanted human fetal tissue so badly that they were willing to give us fucking flying saucers. Yeah. Like, come on man. I don't believe there has been over 11 flying saucers have crashed. So we have possession of really, okay. Really Matt Etsy, one crashing. I could see, I could see a bunch of crashing over the course of human history, but I think there'd be some evidence. I don't think you'd be able to hold that back. People have stories about shit, but I don't know if I believe I need to talk to him about a lot of other shit.

Speaker 12:         02:22:25       You know, you start talking to me about Ufos. I need to know what you think about ghosts. You know, I need to sit you down and you know, do you think that you can read minds? Do you believe in palm reading what he bought? What about Tarot cards? You know, I'm not into that stuff. Yeah. But you know what I'm saying when I'm talking to dude who believes in Ufos, I need to know if you believe in chem trails, motherfucker, I need to. But if you believe in a lot of weird shit, you know, are you one of those weird shit, believe and dude's, cause there's a lot of people that just love to believe in crazy shit. They just, they look forward to be more interesting. Yes. It's sexy. Aliens are sexy. So, so hot right now. So Bro, I mean, isn't it 2012 or sexy?

Speaker 12:         02:23:01       You know, any, anything crazy and unknown, bigfoot, sexy, loch ness monster, sexy killer. Whales aren't sexy there at fucking seaworld, right? It's easy to get to there, see them all the time, but they're just as fascinating. If you didn't know, you know, the, if you didn't know that an animal existed, that's almost as intelligent as a man that has this incredibly varied language. Speaks with sound. It actually breeds a hair, but it lives in the middle of the ocean and it kills fish and fucks up sharks. He'd be like, Whoa, this is real. That's would be way crazier than a lot of animals that are mythical. I can like the loch ness monster was that fucking pussy do that piece of shit. I don't even know what that was. I've never boughten into the button. I've never bought into the Loch ness monster tells you ologies a weird field because there are things that we have not discovered.

Speaker 12:         02:23:45       Definitely there's that fucking gorilla that they've, or the chimpanzee they've recently discovered in the Congo. It's a giant Bondo. Ape is huge. Chimpanzee is over the last couple of decades they've figured out there really is this giant subspecies of chimpanzee cause they can't, yeah. So now it's like six feet tall, but they can find things. There's a few things that are out there. Like in New Guinea, they found like some crazy fucking frog and some weird psychedelic looking animals. And if they find weird shit and like rainforests and in places there stuff that we still probably haven't seen yet. But there's not a lot, you know, there's not a lot of stuff. It's not, it's not like the old days. Some of the old days when they discovered gorillas. I'm like, what the fuck is that? You know that happened, man. It was like not that long ago where they discovered gorillas like, you gotta be fucking checkmate.

Speaker 12:         02:24:33       Nobody knew this. Europeans man, when they went to Africa for the first time, do you know how fucking crazy it must have been the first time they discovered a gorilla? You know they're walking into, what else is here, John Welders and the size of your hand, Fred, give me the machete. What's hacked through some, what the fuck is that? Just a big giant silver back comes running at you and they have to shoot it and then they fucking kill it and put it up on ropes and shit and carry a big log to the village and w what the fuck is this? And they're like, that is our fantasy cover. That shit dude. People back then, that will lived around gorillas. They weren't writing books. They're in the right shit. They didn't even, you know, they didn't have any paper to do. They were just had a religion.

Speaker 12:         02:25:18       Oh, did they? I don't think they even did the people that live in the Congo, what kind of religions do they have in the Congo? I Dunno. People that like those people that like you ever see the people that like hang off of trees and catch fish from the river with nuts. It's fucking nuts. Hang upside down. They just hang with their hands and feet there barefoot. These people are living like they lived a hundred thousand years ago and they do that still to this day. There's all this video of him too that people have gone there and even video in black and white like way back in the forties and the 50s and these people climb out on these trees that, that, that hang over the Congo over the river and they're, they're literally, they fall in your dead man. You're fucked. And there's all these people and loved ones and they're catching fish with nets and they're just so good at it.

Speaker 12:         02:26:01       They've been doing it for so long. It's like they grew up climbing on these trees, hanging over the, hanging over this raging fucking river and scooping fish out of it. That video you tweeted the other day where the guy was climbing that tower, by the way. That was fucking scary. I hate that shit. Which one? There's a video or do tribes? It's like well over a thousand feet. It's one of those, uh, electrical towers was, it was a radio tower. It's like a radio towers. Yeah, same. Same as that. The empire state building. Is that what it was saying? It was the same time. Something along those lines is insane. How tall it was. And this guy was free climbing it. You know, the elevator takes you up to a certain point, but once you get to a certain point, then you have to free climb. And he was free climbing.

Speaker 12:         02:26:42       Fuck, walk carrying this bag. That's like 30 pounds, 30 pounds. It's tools, tools cause he's got to fix this fucking thing. Oh this is a real, I think it wasn't doing it for fun too, but there's a whole a part where he's climbing where he's outside. There's some part of it. It's the freak out is he's inside this thing, you know, inside the structure. This. Eventually he gets outside the structure and he has to climb all the way to the top because it gets thinner and thinner and thinner, so it's just a pole with some things that stick off the side that you have to grab a hold of them, handles and climb. It's such a freak out dude. You could see 50 miles in either way from up there. I had to turn that shit off to to freak you out. I started freaking myself out.

Speaker 12:         02:27:24       When it gets to a certain part of heights, I'm just like, all right, that's, that's crazy heights or scary as fuck man heights or scary as fuck. There's something about it, man. It just makes your toes curl and your butthole clench his shit and an honesty. If it was the opposite, like extreme depth, I'd probably be the same way. Like if I was like, you know the same distance like underneath the water. Did you see that video? The guy free diving. There's a video that's online. Then I'll tweet it later on today. There's a video of a guy free dive diving. Any free dive. Some insane amount, like a hundred meters. [inaudible] yeah, I guess that's what we can do. He can do 124 meters. I was like the most he's ever done. You know how, how do they engage? That is watched with a stop. They hair.

Speaker 12:         02:28:06       I don't know. Got a world. No, they can hold their breath for like five minutes, man. Some of these free divers and more five minutes, six minutes, seven minutes underwater. I think about that shit. Fuck that. Yeah. Why do you want to do that man? That's just doesn't seem like a smart thing to do. All right. People are home. They're making noise right here, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you Mr. Russell Peters. You're a scholar and a gentleman and a fantastic standup comedian. And if people want to get in contact with you, uh, what is the best way? The Real Russell pee on Twitter? That is correct.

Thank you to Brian Red van for his technical expertise and his human roadblocks skills.

Speaker 12:         02:29:03       Thank you to uh, to everyone, ladies and gentlemen, to all you. Freaky bitches. February 4th, Mandalay Bay theater. Me, Joe Diaz, Ari Shaffir Superbowl weekend. Friday night. It's going down. Get on in. We're going to have a crazy party. Russell Peters. What are you doing on February 4th weekend? I'll be in Toronto on February 2nd or third. Are you going to be in a corporate gig? You're going to be in Vegas for the UFC weekend? That weekend? Yes. If I, uh, if I can be, I will be if my gigs not on the same night. Yeah, I can tell you right. Saturday night. Tell me cause it's the fifth. The fifth is UFC. The fifth is the UFC and Russell Peters is a big UFC fan. Did you see Anthony Pettis is fucking kick last night. Did you see what happened last night? Oh, what am I missing? You know who Anthony passes? Showtime Pettis. He's now the new WEC lightweight champion.

Speaker 12:         02:29:56       He fought Ben Henderson and there was a crazy back and forth fight until the fifth round. He jumps off the size of the case side of the cage with his foot kicks off the cage and flying through the air kicks Ben Henderson in the face and knocks him down. It was the nuttiest shit in my life. No, no, no. I went to a decision, but looking at that and fucking kick. Ben Henderson's a bad motherfucker. It was a great scrap. Up until that point, there was a lot of back and forth action. He had a Henderson's back. Henderson had his back. He had Henderson's back standing up. It was real back and forth for a while until like the last round man pedis really came on strong. The last round was pedis. You know, he, he, he heard him a couple times with punches, but even then he, in that last round, Henderson had Pettis on his back.

Speaker 12:         02:30:43       It was a really enter any, I believe you had Pettis is back to, it was a really interesting fight, man. It was a wild scrap. Anthony Pettis is a bad mother fucker, but the fact that he pulled that off was just insane. The fight was a really closely matched fight. You know, I think pedis. Who did I definitely one the decision. Ben Henderson's a bad mother fucker too. Didn't he fight for cowboys? Serone no, he's bigger. He's won 55 Henderson fought a cowboy Cerrone. That was a great fight to great fights. And the last one he caught him with a Kia guillotine and he's Kinda Taichii and team. It's got a good submission game, good standup game, pedis, just better puncher. That was one of big things in it. And Pedis is wilder and you know the, the pet or pedis had better success at the ground too.

Speaker 12:         02:31:24       He was able to hold onto Henderson a little bit better than Henderson was able to hold on to him. But it was close. It was good. It was a fucking, you know, it was one of those matches where even though, you know, yes, the decision was the correct decision. Like man, while it was happening was so suspenseful because both guys were so good and so much action was going on and both guys knew that you couldn't fuck up even for a second. Cause if you did, you'd get jacked. Like for one guy would make a mistake, the other guy would have his back. You know, one guy made a sec, the other guy would be on the top, you know, it was a, it was a really high paced, you know, really exciting fight until that last kick and that that was the nuttiest shit I have ever seen in my life is pretty crazy.

Speaker 12:         02:31:59       It's just a few seconds to go in the last round per minute to judge kicks. It's not major extent that guys, he's a, on another level, this is the new level. This is back. You know when hoists Gracie was around and you know he, you angled triangle Dan Severn off his back and I was like, this is crazy. He's on another level. This is the next level. The next level is dudes are jumping off the cage and fucking kicking you in. You've got all these kids that just studied MMA their whole life. They didn't study one or the other. Well, he actually started out a taekwondo black belt though. Taekwondo guys. Just think there's a couple of the new guy named John Mack. Jesse to fought in Toronto or in a Montreal rather. And uh, he's a, another taekwondo guy. Two's got these wild ass fucking kicks, these taekwondo class chances.

Speaker 12:         02:32:43       Well, most of it sucks. Yeah. Most of it is like, probably the problem with tag window is you got to keep your hands down. Everybody keeps her hands down. That's what they fight. And it's mostly, you can only kick to the face. You can't punch to the face. So it's a really unrealistic style. I mean, that's what I started out as like, that's why I did a long period in my life. But what's good about that is you've developed crazy leg dexterity and you develop the ability to do God's shit. No, he never tried any kick. My legs are terrible. You know, the only, the best, most effective kicks or tool legs. Yeah. You know, like more time. Yes. I decided the knee, if you want to, you want to take some shit, right? You know, I'll hook you don't want to go after we get off line, I'll, I'll tell you exactly where to go. We'll hook it up after he tells you where he lives because you can't know you fucking dirty freaks. Alright. That's the end of the show. It Shit. It had to end eventually and now it does. I love you bitches. I love everybody. I love Brian. I love Russell Peters. I'm glad to have, I'm very fortunate.
