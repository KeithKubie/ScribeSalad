00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.900
So there's an
amazing philosopher

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.310
called Eliade, who wrote a
book about shamanism, where

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.050
he spoke of psychedelic drugs
as technologies of ecstasy.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.790
Notice that he uses the
term "technologies" here.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.040
He talks about them as
mankind's cognitive toolkit,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.229
agents of psychic
transformation.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.240
We've been engaging for
tens of thousands of years

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.940
to transform the perceptions
of the body, mind.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.390
Hacking our awareness
and our perceptions,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.930
you know that effervescent flux
of sensation and perception

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.830
that is in a way of
all we have and all

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.720
we are, as Erik Davis says.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.320
The voice in your head that
lets you know you exist.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.780
These psychedelic agents,
these "meme" mutagens

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.890
essentially cause mutation
and ideation in our ideas.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.990
And I think that term
"technologies of ecstasy"

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.740
points to the fact
that there is something

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.760
that happens in that ecstatic
place of ego death that resets

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.660
the self, that gives us
temporarily access, that makes

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.590
us privy to a whole host
of new, wild visions

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.640
that transform the
way we see the world.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.540
And I think today, these modern
digital shamans, these ecstatic

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.330
technicians of the sacred,
these doctors of the word,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.390
are the scientists and
philosophers and writers

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.556
that are there making us
question our current belief

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:29.190
systems and decoditioning
our thinking,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.148
and that has always been
the role of the shaman

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:34.340
to unplug us and show us
the bigger, wider, more

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.060
far reaching universe that goes
beyond what the eye can see.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.460
Or something like that.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:58.745
