00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.219
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: All right good afternoon
everyone. Today Pawnee's finest comes to our

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.590
Los Angeles office for a Talks at Google presentation.
We've rolled out the Tom Haverfoods in our

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.890
cafÃ©, including waffles, all the bacon and
eggs we could have. Unfortunately, we're still

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.800
working on a way to integrate the Ron Swanson
Turkey Burger into our nutritional guidelines.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.789
But research is still ongoing there. But now
we're really ready to treat yourself. We have

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.149
four amazing members of the Parks and Rec
crew here today to talk about their new season,

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.149
season 5, which starts on September 20 on
NBC Thursdays. We have Amy Poehler, Adam Scott,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.550
Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza in essence the
cutest couples from the show.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.590
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Presenter Please join me in welcoming Parks

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.079
and Rec to Google.
[applause and cheering]

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:15.050
&gt;&gt; Amy Poehler: Hi, everybody how you doing?
Thank you for having us. My name is Amy Poehler

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.590
I'm with Adam Scott, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt.
We make up part of the cast of Parks and Recreation.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.560
We're so happy we could join you here today.
We should say welcome to the the Parks and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.380
Recreation's Google talk and it's going to
last about an hour and then we will participate

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.289
in a Google hangout after that.
&gt;&gt; Adam Scott: Is that just where we just

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.200
hang out? [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, we're just going to hang out.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560
&gt;&gt; Adam: Like super cas- stuff?
&gt;&gt; Amy: Right, if it all goes well it may

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.250
turn into a Google make out. [laughter] Where
we let people come up and make out with us.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.750
[laughter] And then, then there's going to
be Google sex, [laughter] which is self-explanatory

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.369
and then a Google walk of shame.
[laughter]

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.539
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: And then a Google morning after
pill?

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.489
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's right. A morning after pill.
[laughter] That's right.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:09.569
&gt;&gt; Adam: But if that doesn't work
&gt;&gt; Amy: Then it'll be a Google, Google 'why

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.810
isn't the audience calling me back?' [laughter]
I would like to say that Michael Schur the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.370
creator of Parks and Recreation was supposed
to be here, and unfortunately he could not

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.971
make it. He was working really hard on our
next script. It's very, very complicated and

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.080
he's sorry he can't be here, but he wants
you to know that he's working very hard and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.550
it's tough work because we are entering into
season 5, the Rise of the Dragons. [laughter]

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.320
Which is what we're working on now. OK, so
we are gonna, I am going ask you guys questions

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.060
like I don't really know you, I guess.
&gt;&gt; Adam: OK, Hi I'm Adam.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.020
&gt;&gt; Amy: Hey, nice to meet you. [laughter]
Those kind of stuff those kind of cool handshakes

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:07.200
we do on set. First of all, you all look very
young and nice. This is being broadcast on

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.170
the internet.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I was going to ask what the hell

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.710
this was.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah this is a thing that's on the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.140
internet and then people all over the world
will be able to download it. That's exciting.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.780
You guys are drinking beer.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah, my sponsor doesn't even know

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.319
how to use the internet, so. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Adam: I'm his sponsor.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:38.590
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK, so lets get started and then we'll
go into questions from the audience and then

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.900
I guess eventually from the internet at some
point.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.480
&gt;&gt; Chris: Oh great! Because we are at Google
and this is where the internet was invented,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.530
technically. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's right. Technically. And I don't

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.290
really know how it works but I think people
at home get to just yell their question into

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.970
their computer and then it pops up into our
brains.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.181
&gt;&gt; Chris: Whoa!
&gt;&gt; Adam: So if you yell loud enough, it just

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:58.450
goes straight to our brains?
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.130
&gt;&gt; Adam: That's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Amy: I know, it's amazing. I mean guys

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.610
the information highway is just.
&gt;&gt; Adam: It's straight to our brains.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.760
&gt;&gt; Chris: This is the future. No hover boards,
but they got this.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.000
&gt;&gt; Adam: Actually I saw they're not making
hover boards here.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.759
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: Just backpedaled on that. OK, guys!

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm hoping that most of the people here have
watched Parks and Recreation or have seen

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.090
it.
[Applause and cheering]

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.850
&gt;&gt; Amy: Thank you. And the writers have done
an amazing job of creating real characters,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.070
seemingly real crazy characters. So one of
the things that people like about Parks is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.060
how much characters grow, the characters grow
over time. Where do you see your characters

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.440
in 10 years?
[Laughter]

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.840
&gt;&gt; Amy: There's no one else on the end, Pratt.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Is it my, is it for me?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.730
&gt;&gt; Amy: Sure for all of us, for all of us.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Ten years from now?

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.080
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Adam: From ten years ago.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.730
&gt;&gt; Chris: OK, I was going to say. I don't
know if that meant. Well, I'm pretty sure

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.650
I just don't want any spoilers, spoiler alerts
because ten years from now there will still

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.280
be Parks and Recreation on the air and you'll
just have to tune in.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.800
&gt;&gt; Amy: Alright, good. I would do this job
for another ten years.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.550
&gt;&gt; Chris: Oh my God. Please let us do it for
ten more years. [laughter]

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.889
&gt;&gt; Amy: Please let the show for 15 years.
15 seasons. [laughing] I want to be like the

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.860
Simpsons of mockumentary comedy.
&gt;&gt; Adam: By the way, in ten years, television

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.570
shows will be beamed directly in your brain.
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's right, you won't even need

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.410
a screen.
&gt;&gt; Adam: We won't even need to act them out.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.849
We'll just, notions of what we want to do
will go to the brains of the audience.

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.440
&gt;&gt; Amy: Ooh, I like that.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah so we can do it from our houses.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.440
Because we'll be so sick of each other anyway,
it'll be great. We can just sit in our houses

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.920
and think about our characters.
&gt;&gt; Amy: [giggling] And then theater will just

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.460
be that you stick you hand in like a jelly
and you're like "Broadway"! [laughter]

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.160
&gt;&gt; Amy: Does anyone else want to talk about
their character in ten years or should I move

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.570
on? Plaza?
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: I think, that April and Andy will

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.639
still be married.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Assuming we survive the zombie apocalypse.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.950
[Amy cracks up}
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Right. I think we'll have five

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.310
kids and
&gt;&gt; Amy: Five in ten years?

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.480
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amy: I like that.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.300
&gt;&gt; Chris: Quintuplets. They'll all be nine
years old, in ten years. She's pregnant with

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.139
five kids right now. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: I want that. I think April should

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.300
be pregnant soon and have multiple fetuses.
[laughter]

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.290
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's a question, that's actually
a question that some, coming down, I don't

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.020
know if we could do it during the talk, I
think, I don't know if we could only do it

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.789
during the hangout.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah.

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:04.800
&gt;&gt; Amy: But there's a question about April
getting pregnant in the hangout, so if you're

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.790
curious about that question hangout in the
hangout. OK, which, yes, go ahead Adam, sorry.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.009
&gt;&gt; Adam: I would hope Leslie and Ben are still
dating in ten years, don't you?

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:21.139
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah I would think so.
&gt;&gt; Adam: And I would hope that they're still

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.000
very busy.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yes.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.180
&gt;&gt; Adam: Whether living in Washington, DC,
together, or in Pawnee together.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.900
&gt;&gt; Amy: Right.
&gt;&gt; Adam: That's all I have to say. Sorry.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:37.410
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: I liked your intense eye contact during

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.860
that. It was good.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I did.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.550
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK, speaking of intense eye contact
and intensity, which actor on our cast would

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.039
win in an no holds barred fight? And which
character would win?

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:53.070
&gt;&gt; Chris: Nick Offerman and Ron Swanson.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:59.570
&gt;&gt; Chris: Without question.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Nick has a really good sense of fighting.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.480
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amy: And this low center of gravity. I

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.449
do think that maybe Jerry would kill everyone
though. [laughter]

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:13.860
&gt;&gt; Chris: But that'd be more like a office
machine gun type.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.710
&gt;&gt; Amy: With like a machine gun? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I feel like Jerry is one season away

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.479
from walking in there with a submachine gun
[Amy cracks up] and just taking everybody

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:26.430
out. Not Jim, but Jerry.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Not Jim, very different.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:34.229
&gt;&gt; Adam: Jim is two seasons away. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK guys! Leslie's person that's like

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:43.009
her, you know, her like dream person to have
sex with is obviously Joe Biden. Who would

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:47.819
your characters, who was your, do you think
is your character's person?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:55.720
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Bill Pullman!
&gt;&gt;Amy: Bill Pullman! [laughs] Sure, yes

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.949
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: I think April was a really big
fan of his work in Casper when he played Devon

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:10.249
Sawa's dad. [laughter] All of her friends
like Devon Sawa but she liked Bill Pullman.

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:13.990
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: I see that.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.860
&gt;&gt; Chris: Boy that's, I would say for a long
time it was the lead singer of Rush until

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:33.180
Andy found out it was a man. [laughter] He's
still high on the list [Amy cracks up] but

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:41.310
probably the Tracy Chapman. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Adam: Absolutely!

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.089
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Because their singing voices are

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:50.360
so similar.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Andy's and Tracy Chapman's?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.540
&gt;&gt; Chris: My personal singing voice
&gt;&gt; Adam: And Tracy Chapman's

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.360
&gt;&gt; Chris: And Tracy Chapman's. Every time
I really actually, this is true, just sing,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.320
you know? Sometimes you just throw the gloves
off when you sing. Exactly like Tracy Chapman.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.240
&gt;&gt;Amy: Real singing.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I wonder if we could hear a little

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.549
of that like right now?
[Cheers and applause]

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:14.149
&gt;&gt; Chris: Man, I'll do it. But here's the
thing. It's going to be, I'm going to be vulnerable

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:20.089
because because I'm not doing a bit, I'm really
singing my heart out. And I sound like Tracy

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:21.089
Chapman.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Of course. Of course. Yeah, no, well

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:23.680
look Google talks about being vulnerable,
number one. [laughter]

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.820
&gt;&gt; Chris: OK. True.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Number two real singing is a real

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.439
thing and when you have to really sing and
you don't do a jokey sing, it's very, very

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:31.450
scary.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.570
&gt;&gt; Amy: It's where you learn a lot about yourself.
&gt;&gt; Chris: True. I have to take some courage.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.649
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK, everybody close their eyes.

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:49.660
&gt;&gt; Chris: [Singing] I drove a fast car, sounds
like Tracy Chapman when I sing.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.209
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Thanks, Thanks guys.

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:58.519
&gt;&gt; Amy: What about Ben? What's his, who's
his fantasy?

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:04.320
&gt;&gt; Adam: Janel Moloney from the West Wing.
[Laughing]

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:12.250
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's so specific and so true. OK.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: What about?

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.029
&gt;&gt; Amy: Oh Leslie's is Joe Biden.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Oh right.

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:20.069
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, yeah. But I think she has a
thing for Daniel Craig a little bit

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:22.629
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Amy: We've said she has a Daniel Craig

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:34.379
shaped body pillow. [laughter] And who else?
She probably wouldn't kick Sam Waterson out

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:40.541
of bed or something like that. [laughs] I'm
trying to think who she likes. OK, what's

00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:49.170
the most surprising line or a story that you've
been given yet in the season. Like, or is

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.699
there, is there a surprising moment you got
that you were like, without spoiling anything

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:57.529
that you you're nodding your head that you're
of something.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.820
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: This season?
&gt;&gt; Amy: Well, we don't want to spoil anything

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.199
this season, I guess, I don't' know. But if
there's a way you could say it without spoiling

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:16.009
it, yes. Or like, I'll offer this in season,
I forget which one it was, Leslie, you find

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:20.399
out Leslie's like kind of a hoarder, like
you go to her house and her stuff, her house

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:26.889
was filled to the capacity with books and
papers and I thought that was interesting

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:33.661
character trait. And I was like "OK! OK! This
is who she is. This is the love setting, but

00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:37.990
nobody's perfect." Anybody else have anything
like that that they were given.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.199
&gt;&gt; Chris: There's so many things like that,
I mean, I think Mike and all the writers make

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:47.199
it a point to surprise the audience and that
will, often times, surprises us. I remember

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:55.069
I was surprised in the wedding episode, where
when Andy was like the smallest sibling among

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:59.139
all of his brothers. Like, he'd been picked
on and pushed around like a little twerp his

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:04.579
whole life by these dudes who are like 6'8â
and 6'10â. That was surprising.

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:07.860
&gt;&gt; Amy: That was really, that was great detail.
Didn't really make the show, a lot got cut

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.661
out, but when you were getting married to
April, your brothers were there and the whole

00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:14.939
time they were just pushing you. And punching
you in the balls while you were getting married.

00:13:14.939 --> 00:13:17.720
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Adam: I couldn't get enough of watching

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.399
you guys just like horsing around during the
wedding ceremony. It was really funny.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.689
&gt;&gt; Chris: [laughs] It was fun.
&gt;&gt; Amy: [laughing] Really funny.

00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:29.319
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's right, you sometimes forget,
being on this show, because we shoot so much

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:34.079
stuff, a lot of which doesn't make it to air,
because our episodes, half hour comedy, 21

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:40.089
and a half minutes, you know, with commercials.
We shoot maybe sometimes 38, 40 pages and

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:45.670
that should make for about 40 minutes episode.
So a lot of really great stuff ends up not

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:51.740
being shown on TV and so we have this idea
of all this stuff, but you forget that the

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.820
audience members might not know all that stuff.
I was really surprised that they actually

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.119
went, that we actually went to the Grand Canyon
to shoot the Grand Canyon rather than just

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:06.869
shoot it in front of a blue screen.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Plazie?

00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:12.329
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: I don't know. I think for April
it's always surprising when she cares about

00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:20.790
anything. [laughter] Or anyone. Which I like
those moments because you, I kind of, I feel

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:27.189
like I have two or three episodes where I'm
kind of, where she kind of just wreaks havoc

00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:31.220
and doesn't care and then all of a sudden
there's like an episode where all of a sudden

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:40.350
she's being really nice to Chris Traeger and,
like, little, little glimpses of warm mushy

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.600
stuff comes through and I like that. And she
really likes animals.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.079
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's right, she does like animals.
She loves them, she's good with them.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:53.579
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: She's really good with the animals.
&gt;&gt; Amy: What about you Adam, what about Ben?

00:14:53.579 --> 00:15:05.379
&gt;&gt; Adam: I don't know maybe his, the, his
love of Claymation was a big [laughter] is

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:10.089
really great. Like when you read these things
you have no idea what's coming down the pike

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:13.739
and so you get this script and you read these
hilarious things they write for you [chuckles]

00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:18.849
and it kind of opens up this whole other world
to the character. It's really funny.

00:15:18.849 --> 00:15:21.619
&gt;&gt; Amy: You have a proclivity for depression.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:23.149
&gt;&gt; Amy: Ben, Ben does, Ben can go kind of
dark.

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:27.879
&gt;&gt; Adam: He's spins out if things just kind
of change a little bit and so it's really

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:32.369
fun, it's really funny.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Adam was dressed on set one time in

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:36.269
Ben's depressed clothes and I was like "hey!"
And he was like "Hey." Like I didn't even

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.729
know he was wearing depressing clothes as
his character.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:41.459
&gt;&gt; Adam: It wasn't until later that you realized
it was my wardrobe.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:46.819
&gt;&gt; Amy: I was like "Oh you are wearing Doc
Martins and a Letters to Cleo t-shirt. Those

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:53.540
aren't your clothes from home?â
OK, and why don't we explain, some people

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.619
want to know what a typical day is like on
set. Like a typical week or a typical day.

00:15:57.619 --> 00:16:02.889
Can you guys explain that at all for people
who want to know what it's like working on

00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:06.639
Parks?
&gt;&gt; Chris: Well it depends on who you talk

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:19.230
to, but for us, at least for me, it's real
easy. [laughter] Fucking awesome. It's great.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.860
Typical day, 11 o clock rolls around I'm like,
"Oh God, I got to go to work in two hours."

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:32.559
[laughter] Walk down the hill, seven minutes
to get to work. Show up, park in a spot right

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:38.019
next to, like, a trailer, kind of like the
one I grew up in, but a little bigger. [laughter]

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:43.241
Go in there, hang out for a while, someone
will knock on the door "Hey Chris, they're

00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:47.309
ready for you in hair and makeup." That usually
means in about 20 minutes I'm going to come

00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:51.769
out. Go get my hair done. [Amy cracks up]
No, it's really fun. Our crew works really

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:57.259
hard, so it really depends on who you ask.
Because the people who, on the crew, will

00:16:57.259 --> 00:17:02.850
work 60 hours a week and so for them a typical
day is rolling in around 7, working their

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:08.209
tails off getting all this stuff set up and
being there until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:15.870
So it's a machine. I'm really lucky in that
I'm number 5 or 6, I'm down on the call sheet,

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:22.980
I might be in 8, 9 scenes in the whole episode,
so I get maybe two days off a week and not

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:28.209
even, don't even work full days when I work.
So for me it's, like I said it's super easy.

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:33.110
&gt;&gt; Amy: And you guys, everyone here has done
a lot of projects during the season and in

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.500
between the seasons, so everybody gets to
do a lot of different projects. Like, I think

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.919
you've all did about 5 movies over the break,
all of you. Various ways.

00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:45.830
&gt;&gt; Adam: I think you did the most.
&gt;&gt; Amy: We all worked a lot.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.980
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah, it gives you time because
it's a big, because we have an ensemble cast

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.730
it gives us time and there, our show runner,
the network, they're really, they really let

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:02.950
us go do other things and work around our,
allow our schedules to be flexible in that

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.770
way. And every time, don't you think? Every
time you go on and do something else do a

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:11.630
movie or work on something else, you come
back, their crews, they're never as tight

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.190
as Parks' crews.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, I got to, maybe we're being

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:22.020
we're well whatever, it's true. Which is that
we shoot really fast and because it's mockumentary

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.370
style, we never really know where the cameras
are and there's not a lot of waiting around

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:32.860
for cameras and lighting and stuff. And everybody's
on, on, on screen most of the time. So like

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.230
you never know when you're going to be talking
or someone's going to improvise, so you never

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.659
have that thing that you see in films where
I'm off camera giving Adam lines, like that

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:48.600
never happens. If we're doing a scene, we
just do it together over and over again which

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.320
you get kind of used to and it's really great,
I think, for comedy.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.659
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah, I remember I came in late to
the show and they were already up and running

00:18:55.659 --> 00:19:00.260
when I started and I remember my first day.
I came and did a scene with you and Nick [chuckles]

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:06.429
and we just did the scene, like, five times
and then we were done with the scene rather

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:12.360
than doing it 20 times and taking a break
and doing it another 20. There's cameras all

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.971
over and they just capture everything and
I couldn't believe how quick it was. It's

00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:20.970
really fun that way, I think.
&gt;&gt; Amy: It was also sometimes the cameras

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.990
that they have the spy shots and so you don't
actually know even know where the cameras

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:31.050
are. That can be, we joke around that we like
spy shots because it just makes your acting

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.299
look better. [giggles] But because it's this
long lens and it just, but it is cool to do

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:43.170
scenes in rooms where nobody's in there but
you. It feels, like, real sexy. OK.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.039
&gt;&gt; Adam: There's a real intimacy to it, you
know what I mean?

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.000
&gt;&gt; Amy: Shut up.
&gt;&gt; Adam: No, it's like a connection with like.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.519
I'll talk about it at the hangout. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: But I'm like Chris, I feel like

00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:02.890
a normal day for Amy is probably a lot different.
Because normally, I feel like the girls have

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:11.750
to come, you know, especially on Monday's
like 5:30 in the morning, really early and

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.509
usually I walk in and I see you and you're
there and you're never late and I'm always

00:20:15.509 --> 00:20:16.980
late.
&gt;&gt; Amy: I'm always a little; I'm a little

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.940
bit late sometimes.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Really?

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.977
&gt;&gt; Amy: I'm like ten minutes late, it's a
problem.

00:20:21.977 --> 00:20:27.349
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Well, I'm always early and I
&gt;&gt; Adam: Wait I just thought you said.

00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:33.360
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Well, whatever. [laughter] Sometimes
I get in really early and I don't talk to

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.759
anyone for as long as I can. And I usually
go in my trailer and stare at myself in the

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:46.970
mirror and think about my choices and my regrets.
[laughter] I just, yeah, that's how a day

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.760
starts.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, I'll see Aubrey in the morning

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:58.429
and I'll say "Hi ,Aubrey." And she'll be like
"Aubrey's dead. April's here now."

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:01.390
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amy: It's really cool stuff; we'll talk

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.669
about it in the hangout.
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's hangout stuff.

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:11.159
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's hangout stuff. This is Google
talk. We want to open up this part of the

00:21:11.159 --> 00:21:15.360
Google talk to let you talk to see if anybody
has any questions that they would like to

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.140
ask us before we go into the hangout, which
is when things are really going get down and

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.940
dirty.
&gt;&gt; Adam: We are so hyping up this hangout.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.210
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: We should change into pajamas for

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.240
the hangout. OK, so yes.
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah, I'll start off with a

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.980
question and then you can approach the mic
as you have questions as well.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.240
&gt;&gt; Amy: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Announcer: So I wanted, one of the real

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.679
highlights of Parks and Rec, are the behind
scenes characters, the birds, the murals on

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:44.240
the wall, like, how did those go about, how
have they developed, any interesting anecdotes

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.040
about that.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, that is such a credit to Mike

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.610
Schur and Greg Daniels and the writers that
all that world that Pawnee world exists and

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:58.040
that we bring people back, like Joan Callamezzo,
who is our kind of TV personality, and Perd

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.610
Hapley who is our hapless television news
reporter. People kind of come in and out of

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:11.149
the world and they come back a lot. One of
the new characters that I just particularly

00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:17.830
like that came back, that is back again this
season, is Ethel Beavers is like the court,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:23.230
kind of, stenographer and she's the one that
last season told Leslie that Ben loved her

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.180
because she just read back the transcript.
And she's the, and those are the kind of the

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.610
people that when they show up everyone's like
"Ethel Beavers is here!" And we like to think

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:38.160
that the audience thinks that too, so. That
those kind of, there's so many characters

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.909
like that. Like who are people.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Like Kyle

00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:44.399
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Kyle's a funny one because I feel

00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:52.970
like he's the guy at the shoe shine stand
that, that is only character that is below

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:58.409
Jerry, I think, [laughter] that is in the
social hierarchy of it all. But he was funny

00:22:58.409 --> 00:23:03.139
because he, we I didn't know he was coming
back and he just said like one line and they

00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:07.210
kept bringing him back and back and how he's
got like this whole thing with Jerry. And

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.570
he's, so it's kind of fun when you see someone
over and over again.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.309
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, we haven't seen Kyle for a while.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I ran into him at Sharky's the other

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.869
day. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Did you smack him?

00:23:14.869 --> 00:23:21.090
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah, I ignored him.
&gt;&gt; Chris: And it's really, what's great about

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.779
episodic, especially a show like this, Dean
Hall and I don't know if we've ever given

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:29.260
him a shout out but he deserves a lot of credit.
He's a head editor and also directs a lot

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:37.480
of the episodes and his voice is really a
large part of Parks and Rec's comedy. And,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.060
I think, because it's always evolving you
go from one episode to the next and as one,

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.600
episodes play, writers are still in the room
creating things, so a lot of the guys that

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.600
you see come back they come back because they
made Dean laugh in the editing room. And so

00:23:51.600 --> 00:24:00.650
that Kyle stuff makes them laugh, or the,
oh who, who recently just played, she's like

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:08.650
the super straight-laced Christian conservative.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Darlene Hunt who plays Marcia Langman,

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:15.620
who's kind of the uptight society for parents
and social people and people together and

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.970
whatever and she's always protesting the sexy
stuff and she comes back in an episode we

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.580
just did and it's great to see her back. And
all the crazy talents people we use a lot

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:29.919
of them because they show up at the meeting
a lot. And we had great, you know, we always,

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:37.710
we've been really lucky to have such great
people come join our show, cast-wise and guest

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:44.140
cast-wise and last season we had Louis C.
K. come back and Kathryn Hahn and Paul Rudd.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.810
And this season, we just did, you saw on the
clip, Jon Glaser comes and plays a really

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:56.049
uptight councilman named Councilman Jan, who
gets gets jams things up. And we have a lot

00:24:56.049 --> 00:25:02.950
of other good people coming down. Lucy Lawless
is with us now, playing a possible love interested

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.289
for Ron. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Lucy Lawless was Xena warrior princess

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:10.121
if you don't know, she's
&gt;&gt; Adam: And still is to my mind.

00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:12.179
&gt;&gt; Amy: Still is.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:18.330
&gt;&gt; Adam: One of our writers, Harris Wittels,
comes back as animal control a lot which is,

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.409
always super funny.
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's right, that's right.

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:24.840
&gt;&gt; Chris: so those guys earn it, they get
laughs and that's why they come back.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.690
&gt;&gt; Amy: Question?
&gt;&gt; Male #1: On the same note, as far as guest

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.350
stars go, is there any actor you would love
to come onto the show? Jason Statham, maybe,

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.019
someone like that, just come on there.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Do you know Jason Statham? [laughter]

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:40.519
&gt;&gt; Male #1: I wish.
&gt;&gt; Amy: That'd be sweet. Only if he's, if

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:46.929
we call him the Transporter. Well I've been
very vocal about my dream would be to have

00:25:46.929 --> 00:25:52.210
Bill Murray, be on in any way, just because
I think he would, well, because he's my comedic

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:57.480
hero and because I think he would fit in Pawnee
some how. We have a mayor on our show that

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.120
we talk about a lot that we've never seen
that would be my dream to have him play that.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.399
Anybody else that you guys?
&gt;&gt; Chris: I really want Dave Matthews to be

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:09.980
on just so that I could, so that Andy could
meet him and cry. [laughter] I don't know

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.270
how it happens.
&gt;&gt; Adam: That would be great.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.150
&gt;&gt; Amy: That would be great.
&gt;&gt; Adam: If he gets on and plays with Mouse

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.590
Rat. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Oh God, that would be Andy's dream,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.299
can you imagine? Or maybe like Darius Rucker,
or like Eddie Vedder, or just someone like

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:28.679
that who's just like was a big 90s iconic
rocker, that would be sweet.

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:32.889
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: I really like, like Rosie Perez
to be like my aunt.

00:26:32.889 --> 00:26:34.649
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yessss!
&gt;&gt; Chris: That would be sweet.

00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:39.289
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Or like someone really likes spicy
and Latina to come and be one of my family

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:42.399
members.
&gt;&gt; Amy: To be your Tia?

00:26:42.399 --> 00:26:50.010
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Yeah. That's right. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: Oh my God, I love you. And Adam, what

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.830
about you?
&gt;&gt; Adam: I don't know. We've had some great

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.029
ones, so far this year; we've had some senators
come in when we're in DC which was really

00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:59.029
great.
&gt;&gt; Amy: That right.

00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:04.710
&gt;&gt; Adam: That was a real experience. The four
of us were in DC together and it was a real

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.760
amazing experience working with them.
&gt;&gt; Amy: If you are watching the Google talk

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:16.169
and you are at minute 40 and you don't know
this, our show premiers on September 20 and

00:27:16.169 --> 00:27:23.850
we go to visit April and Ben in DC. I have
a feeling if you've watched this long then

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.850
you know that.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.600
&gt;&gt; Amy: Because if you don't know of the show,
why the [whispers]fuck would be watching this.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.559
But anyway we go and visit we visit Ben's
character and we have some senators come visit

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:37.730
us, too. OK question over here.
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Oh yes, in the first seasons The

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.370
Pit was a really big part of the show and
I was just curious like do you guys miss it,

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.840
or are you glad you don't have to go to The
Pit anymore anything like that? [Amy and Aubrey

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.980
laugh]
&gt;&gt; Amy: The Pit is was emblematic of Leslie's

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:57.519
futile attempts to try to make change, so
it's changed slowly. Now, it's not actually

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:03.929
a pit, now it's a grassy field that we go
to. And we have events on this field. But,

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:08.470
yes, in the beginning, the first, the first
thing I ever shot for the show was a promo

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:15.679
in the pit with trash swirling around me and
Aziz Ansari was like "Hey, I found a bra!"

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:20.280
like in the Pit and it was like "We're going
build a park." It was just dusty and it was

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.820
super hot and I remember thinking "Oh my God,
I hate the pit." So and a lot of us fell into

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.799
the Pit many times, too. You fell into the
Pit you used to live in the Pit. [laughter]

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:36.450
&gt;&gt; Chris: I lived in the pit. That was the
worst. [Adam laughs] It's out in the valley,

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:41.820
it got really hot out there and I'd come home
and have like dirt in my eyes from the Pit.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:48.440
I was like "Fuck the Pit!" But it's really,
it was a great, a mine for comedy which is

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.979
great, but, boy, it was just not comfortable
to be in it. It was super gross.

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:55.759
&gt;&gt; Amy: I think you may find some stuff happening
this season at the Pit. The Pit's not gone

00:28:55.759 --> 00:29:03.380
away. It's like our hatch. [laughter] Oh my
God, I finally got some reaction out of this.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.349
[laughter] Now I know what Google likes.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Smoke monster

00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:14.080
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Obviously all you guys are very
funny, but who on the cast would you say is

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.879
the funniest and, on the flip side, who is
the most serious about their craft?

00:29:19.879 --> 00:29:25.320
&gt;&gt; Amy: Well, that's hard to say. I'm going
to say Pratt's the funniest.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.900
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Yeah, I agree.
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yeah

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.010
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'm going to say I'm the most serious
about my craft. It's kind of both.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.130
[Inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Amy: So there you go.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.250
&gt;&gt; Chris: Next question
&gt;&gt; Amy: Next question

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.580
&gt;&gt; Male #4: I know he wasn't able to make
it today but Michael Schur actually went to

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.340
my high school and graduated with my sister,
so if he was here, do you think he'd remember

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:53.879
her? [laughter] And give her a shout out?
&gt;&gt; Amy: What's your sister's name?

00:29:53.879 --> 00:29:57.769
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Robin Dinowitz, of course
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK, I'm going to ask ask him about

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:01.440
her, I'm sure he would, he's a very very
&gt;&gt; Chris: He just yelled into the computer.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.960
[laughter] No, he doesn't. Sorry, so sorry.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I I'm wondering,Sir, if graduated

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:17.230
with your sister is a euphemism?
&gt;&gt; Male #4: I hope it is, yes. [laughter]

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:24.080
&gt;&gt; Amy: Magna cum laude doing on your sister
&gt;&gt; Chris: Magna cum louder

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.149
&gt;&gt; Amy: [laughs] OK, yeah, I don't need groans
from you.

00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:30.430
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Thank you guys so much for coming
love the show. Just wondering what is the

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.120
biggest way in which each of you differs from
your character?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.779
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Maybe we could answer for each

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:41.159
other.
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK.

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:44.369
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's really good. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Why?

00:30:44.369 --> 00:30:50.039
&gt;&gt; Adam: That sounds fun and super personal.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Or not.

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:52.519
&gt;&gt; Adam: No.
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK

00:30:52.519 --> 00:31:00.830
&gt;&gt; Adam: Amy, how does Chris differ from Andy?
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK. Well, I think Chris is a better

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:07.909
listener than Andy, because Andy doesn't listen
at all. And Chris is a better listener and

00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:15.140
he's just much more put together than Andy
is. I think Andy is a little bit more handsome

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.950
than Chris.
[Laughter]

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:30.360
&gt;&gt; Amy: And that's something that Chris has
to kind of work through. But I would say that.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:40.789
I would say that, I would say that Chris is
not as, like as, as checked out as Andy is.

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:46.460
Well, let's hope so. [laughs] OK, Plaza you
answer for Adam.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:56.129
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: OK I think that Amy is funnier
and 

00:31:56.129 --> 00:32:01.850
sexier than Leslie, you know, could ever imagine
being, ever.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:07.029
&gt;&gt; Amy: Thank you, all I heard was sexier
so I'll take it. [laughter]

00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:15.929
&gt;&gt; Amy: OK, Adam, I'm going to answer for
you. I think, you are, you, oh my God, this

00:32:15.929 --> 00:32:21.590
is going to so dirty and I just gotta stop
myself. No, no, no! I saw your reaction to

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:30.590
magna cum loudy. [laughter] I'm not going
there again. OK, no, what I think, [laughs]

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:39.029
no I think, you know Adam likes to drive barefoot
and he's from Santa Cruz so he's a lot more,

00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:46.340
you're much more like, you're less tightly
wound, I think, than Ben is.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:53.619
&gt;&gt; Adam: Bro, listen, if you're wearing flip
flops and you're driving a car it's unsafe

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:57.999
to keep the flip flop on am I right? [audience
responds] [applause]

00:32:57.999 --> 00:33:03.320
&gt;&gt; Amy: No, OK, but why do you think it's
OK to drive barefoot?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.460
&gt;&gt; Adam: Who, how do you think people drove
before there were shoes?

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.020
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's a good point. No that's a good

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.980
point. OK.
&gt;&gt; Adam: I'm going to say Aubrey and April,

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:25.330
for the first year that I was on the show
I didn't think there was a difference. [laughter]

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:34.759
But now I, there really is two completely
different people. In what ways? I don't know.

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:41.610
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: It's, I mentioned, I said this earlier

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:47.970
to someone, it was, I don't remember where,
some interview. [chuckles] No, I was talking

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:52.509
about Aubrey and obviously Andy and April
are married and we work very closely with

00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:57.720
one another and I said that it's a shame for
people like David Letterman and Jay Leno and

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.909
Conan O'Brien that they'll never actually
get to meet Aubrey. And I think that's the

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:09.330
case with a lot of people. Especially in this
kind of environment where it's a press type,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:15.600
this isn't press, but you know it's a situation
where you're where you're on. I think Aubrey's

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.820
on a lot, a lot of the time and that and its,
she's like Andy Kaufman or something you know.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.650
She's kind of, she would meet the president
and take it as an opportunity to do a bit,

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:31.450
you know. She would be like, I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Amy: We went, well, yeah

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:36.310
&gt;&gt; Chris: I think she would you know she would
meet the president and see it as an opportunity

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:42.170
to do a bit. But for the lucky few people
who get a chance to know her, she's totally

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.570
different than April. April's a character
that's sort of like, that likes to mess with

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:51.600
people and those are similarities obviously
because they are sort of, they are born out

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.680
of who Aubrey is. She likes to fuck with people
and get a rise out of people and make people

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:05.160
uncomfortable. And it's amusing to her. [laughter]
And but apart from all that she's very, very

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:12.341
caring and sweet and a good listener and would
be there for her friends in a heartbeat. And

00:35:12.341 --> 00:35:13.660
that's a really nice.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yes, hear, hear,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:20.830
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: And also I have to say, Chris is
one of even though Andy is very stupid, Chris

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.050
is one of the smartest actors I've ever worked
with ever.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:28.031
&gt;&gt; Amy: We said he was the funniest.
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Right, but I'm saying he's the

00:35:28.031 --> 00:35:29.730
smartest.
&gt;&gt; Adam: And now he's also the smartest.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.820
&gt;&gt; Amy: Smartest.
[Applause]

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.980
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yes, question.
&gt;&gt; Male #6: I was wondering how often do you

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.070
improvise and go off script during filming
and how often does that actually make it onto

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:45.310
the air?
&gt;&gt; Amy: We are lucky in our process, where

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:49.160
first of all our scripts are always great
and what you see 99% of it is what was written

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.320
in the script and then maybe 1 or 2% an episode
is stuff that we improvise. But we get to

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.400
improvise which sometimes is just enough.
Because you get to be like "Can I do my stupid

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.010
idea?" [giggles] And then you get to do it
and you're like "Oh you're right that idea,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.250
my idea's stupid." But we do, we get to do
what we call on set we call it a fun run which

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:12.600
is we do the scene until we have it and then
we get to do a version after we know it where

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.490
we kind of fool around. And every once in
a while, bits of it get on the show, or but

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:24.700
usually it's longer and less funny than what
was written in the script. [laughter]

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.940
&gt;&gt; Chris: And it's only fun for us, it's not
fun for like the camera operator who's like

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.369
"OK great 7 minutes, this is all going to
make it."

00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:38.090
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Amy, is your husband ever going

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.420
to be a guest star on the show. I love watching
you two together.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.110
&gt;&gt; Amy: He was on season two.
&gt;&gt; Female 1: Oh he was! I missed it.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:50.790
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, he played a, people who gave
MRIs or EKGs, MRIs he was an MRI technician.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.610
&gt;&gt; Female #1: What about Hillary Clinton?
&gt;&gt; Amy: Hillary Clinton is not my husband.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.260
Yet. But my God, I would love for Hillary
Clinton to be on.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.460
&gt;&gt; Female #1: That would be cool.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Oh, wouldn't it be cool?

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.690
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amy: I just saw a cool picture of her that

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.680
reminded, I sent it to Adam today there's
a really cool picture of Hillary watching

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.500
Bill's speech. Did anyone see it today? I'm
sure you all saw, you guys are like "Yeah,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.850
I see everything, I work at Google." You're
like "Yeah, the thing that was on the internet,

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.700
I saw it."
&gt;&gt; Chris: "The thing that we put on the internet

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.220
that you saw, yeah."
&gt;&gt; Amy: Yeah, the one I created.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.520
&gt;&gt; Adam: "You saw it, thanks to us."
&gt;&gt; Amy: And it was just a cool picture of

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:35.050
her on the computer watching him and Leslie
and Ben Skype a lot in the first couple of

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:40.020
episodes of Parks because they're, you know,
away, they're separated, so I thought that

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:47.470
was a cool image. I mean that would be amazing
if she would do it. She would be great.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:53.800
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Great question, I had a kind
of follow up thing, is there any chance that

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.700
the Pawnee folk might take a roadtrip through
O.C. for Arrested Development or vice versa,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.830
the Arrested Development crew visit Pawnee?
How would that play out?

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.410
&gt;&gt; Amy: Oh God, no! Well, let me ask you guys
this, what do you think we should do a crossover

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.330
with? What show?
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Party down?

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.480
&gt;&gt;Amy: Party down, well we are, we are. Arrested,
yeah.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.522
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Gossip Girl
&gt;&gt;Amy: Gossip, [laughter] we should go, we

00:38:17.522 --> 00:38:18.990
should just be like
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Go to New York?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:24.380
&gt;&gt; Amy: We'd go to New York and well we would
be just horrible, like poorly dressed extras

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.550
in the back of a Gossip Girl scene.
&gt;&gt; Adam: We should do a crossover with Vampire

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:35.700
Diaries.
&gt;&gt; Amy: Well, Ian Somerhalder, he looks like

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.740
Rob Lowe's younger, he looks like Rob Lowe's
son or brother.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.870
&gt;&gt; Adam: He does. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Amy: Wait a minute, Adam.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:48.310
&gt;&gt; Adam: I think I've stumbled onto something.
&gt;&gt; Amy: So we'll get that going.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:52.670
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So I wanted to close with one
final question then. So for people who watch

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:57.340
this show, ordinary viewers, is there any
one thing that most people overlook that you'd

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.060
like to point out to them, whether it's like
an Easter egg, something subtle.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.580
&gt;&gt; Amy and Adam: That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Chris: Is there something that people were

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.080
overlook?
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That they may not see, like

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.890
some you know caricature in the background
is really a writer in the mural.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:23.900
&gt;&gt; Adam: Well the the photos of all the councilmen
over the years in the hallway have some of

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:31.090
our writer producers up there. And
&gt;&gt; Amy: That's a good one, yeah. We

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:37.380
&gt;&gt; Adam: Morgan Sackett is up there, so is
Norm Hiscock who is a writer.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.350
&gt;&gt; Amy: Dan Gore
&gt;&gt; Adam: Dan Gore, Mike Schur, they're all

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.320
up on this wall, which is-- Who else is up
there?

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.340
&gt;&gt; Amy: There's a lot of things in in the
Parks department, like when you walk by there

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.240
will be like this, like a beautiful statute
of like the founder of the town and his name

00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.170
is Greg Daniels, stuff like that. But I don't
know how much of it's actually made it on

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.940
the air, those kind of things.
&gt;&gt; Adam: It's a great set to come and give

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:10.090
a tour to to people on because there's so
much, do you, open up a drawer and it's filled

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:15.112
with things that have been on the show and
just little bits of history all over it. It's

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:18.300
very, kind of, it's very real; it's like a
real office.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.820
&gt;&gt; Aubrey: Also if you ever see anything at
with April at her desk and you notice her

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:30.340
the many notebooks or papers, there's usually
plenty of drawings of penises on, [laughter]

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.680
because usually when I'm at the desk and I'm
just writing or working in the background

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.860
I'm just drawing penises over and over.
&gt;&gt; Amy: There you go. That would be considered

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.910
an Easter egg right? [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I think so. So with that, Pawnee,

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.040
greatest town in America. Thank you for stopping
by at Google!

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.000
&gt;&gt; All: Thank you!
[Applause and cheering]
