by other people a very important factor

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
by other people a very important factor
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.549
by other people a very important factor
is that there's an evolution happening

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
is that there's an evolution happening
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.520
is that there's an evolution happening
of ideas lots of ideas are tried lots of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
of ideas lots of ideas are tried lots of
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770
of ideas lots of ideas are tried lots of
ideas are proposed many of them don't

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
ideas are proposed many of them don't
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029

work out whatever reason they're not

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
work out whatever reason they're not
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.380

true or they're not a good innovation

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
true or they're not a good innovation
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.349
true or they're not a good innovation
but then ideas pop up that do pass sort

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
but then ideas pop up that do pass sort
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570

will and they go on to thrive and they

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
will and they go on to thrive and they
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710
will and they go on to thrive and they
spread and then they meet other ideas

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
spread and then they meet other ideas
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.620
spread and then they meet other ideas
and those ideas combine Matt Ridley

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
and those ideas combine Matt Ridley
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.140

talks about that as idea sex when two

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
talks about that as idea sex when two
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.230
talks about that as idea sex when two
ideas meet and then they can give birth

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
ideas meet and then they can give birth
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.050
ideas meet and then they can give birth
to new ideas any technique that develops

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
to new ideas any technique that develops
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020
to new ideas any technique that develops
new diversity of ideas helps that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
new diversity of ideas helps that
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.070
new diversity of ideas helps that
Darwinian evolution

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
Darwinian evolution
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.800
Darwinian evolution
so Thomas Edison for example

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810
so Thomas Edison for example
 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.890
so Thomas Edison for example
experimented with thousands of different

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
experimented with thousands of different
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.660
experimented with thousands of different
filaments for the light bulb before he

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
filaments for the light bulb before he
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219
filaments for the light bulb before he
got to one that worked that's another

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
got to one that worked that's another
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050
got to one that worked that's another
way that Darwinian evolution can happen

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
way that Darwinian evolution can happen
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359
way that Darwinian evolution can happen
lots of creation of diversity and then a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
lots of creation of diversity and then a
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819
lots of creation of diversity and then a
filter that picks just the ones that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
filter that picks just the ones that
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.499
filter that picks just the ones that
people want to pass on for whatever

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
people want to pass on for whatever
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080
people want to pass on for whatever
reason so this process of innovation of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
reason so this process of innovation of
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330
reason so this process of innovation of
spreading ideas from person to person

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
spreading ideas from person to person
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490
spreading ideas from person to person
one of the things we've been doing some

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
one of the things we've been doing some
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.190
one of the things we've been doing some
of the ideas we've been creating are

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
of the ideas we've been creating are
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
of the ideas we've been creating are
accelerators of that process when we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
accelerators of that process when we
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380
accelerators of that process when we
invented a writing maybe five to seven

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
invented a writing maybe five to seven
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.389
invented a writing maybe five to seven
thousand years ago that accelerated the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
thousand years ago that accelerated the
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459
thousand years ago that accelerated the
spread of ideas when we went from

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
spread of ideas when we went from
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.709
spread of ideas when we went from
writing on Scrolls to the printing press

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
writing on Scrolls to the printing press
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719
writing on Scrolls to the printing press
that could print things thousands of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
that could print things thousands of
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609
that could print things thousands of
times faster than monks could transcribe

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
times faster than monks could transcribe
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770

them by hand that accelerated the spread

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
them by hand that accelerated the spread
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630
them by hand that accelerated the spread
of ideas and helped launch the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
of ideas and helped launch the
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920
of ideas and helped launch the
Scientific Revolution and helped

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
Scientific Revolution and helped
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.170
Scientific Revolution and helped
accelerate the Renaissance and now with

utilize that but so do scientific papers

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
utilize that but so do scientific papers
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.220
utilize that but so do scientific papers
so do dialogue between researchers or

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
so do dialogue between researchers or
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.170
