00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.553
Let's use Google Calculator
to find this out.

00:00:02.553 --> 00:00:07.006
7.95 times 8.5

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:11.698
equals 67.575.

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:14.896
So $67.575,

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:19.520
that's not quite right is it?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.990
It seems like having three
decimal places here is too many.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.150
How can we figure out what your
paycheck should actually say?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.110
We need rounding to do this.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.100
For now it's okay if you
included the entire answer,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.770
so all three decimal places, but

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.800
let's figure out what we need to do to
make this make a little more sense.
