00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:13.040
If you’ve ever driven a car – legally, that is – you
know before you taste that sweet, sweet vehicular
freedom you had totake a really fun test.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.820
No, not the practical one where you parallel park
between two cones like your life depends on it.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.920
The learner’s permit exam, the test of all
tests.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.060
You probably studied for it with a real snooze-worthy
booklet or some informational government website.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.359
You had to learn all the rules of the road
before getting to touch the road.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.660
Well, in a car at least.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.860
Whenever you’re learning a new skill, there’s a
certain amount of theoretical knowledge you need
before you’re ready to sit in “the driver’s seat.”

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.790
It’s the same for media literacy.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.540
These days we’re so inundated with media it’s
impossible to teach someone all the skills they need.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.740
It’s like we skipped the driving exam and
woke up behind the wheel of a moving racecar!

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.360
Luckily, it’s never too late to dust off
the ol’ driver’s manual.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.220
So far on Crash Course Media Literacy, we’ve
covered everything from how literacy was born
to how our brains handle messages.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.440
We’ve talked about theories and principles,
but now it’s time to really get behind the wheel.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:13.420
[Theme Music]

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.860
In our first episode we discussed the
National Association of Media Literacy
Educators’ definition:

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.420
“The ability to access, analyze, evaluate,
create, and act using all forms of communication.”

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.259
These five skills are your toolbox encountering
media in the wild.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.779
If you’re watching this video, you may take
the first skill, access, for granted.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.300
To play this YouTube video you need a device
that can connect to the internet – a smartphone,
computer, or a tablet.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.819
Plus, that device needs software for video
and audio playback.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.880
Then of course you need an internet connection,
one fast enough to stream this video.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.300
To some of us, being constantly connected
to the internet is an everyday thing.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.660
But these things cost money, and in the U.S.,
many people can’t access the internet.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.940
At least 5 million kids don’t have internet
access at home

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.960
and for many poor families, places like the
local library or a McDonald’s with free wifi are
the only places they can get online.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.020
Think about how often you use the internet,
and for what.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.780
You have probably used it to complete homework
or apply for a job or file taxes.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.960
All of these things seem essential and easy
to do – if you have the means.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.760
Practice makes perfect, right?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.560
A kid who grows up without regular internet
access will have lower digital skill levels than
their peers who access it easily.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.340
And, as I’m sure you know, digital skills are
crucial to functioning in our high-tech world.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.200
That means many people who don’t have this
access are behind before they even start school.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.700
In July 2016, the United Nations declared
internet access a basic human right.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
They said, “Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.160
this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.440
and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and regardless
of frontiers.”

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.959
The internet may seem like it makes everything
way more accessible.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.740
You can just Google what you need rather than
lug around a set of encyclopedias.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.120
But access remains unevenly distributed.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.780
The other side of the coin is our second skill,
analyze.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.640
If and when you do have access, you’re
flooded with way too much information and way
too many sources of entertainment.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.840
Locating the highest quality content –

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.640
whether you’re looking for a reliable source of
news or a TV show you like, or a series of charming
and educational YouTube videos –

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.360
this requires you to analyze what
you’re looking at.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.480
The foundation of media analysis is
acknowledging that all media is constructed with
a purpose and a particular point of view.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.460
Media literacy scholar Renee Hobbs
recommends answering five questions when
you make a media choice,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.840
Number 1: Who created this message and what
is the purpose?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.540
Is it a movie made by Disney for entertainment?

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.680
Is it an ad made by Apple to sell phones and
computers?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.050
Number 2: What techniques does it use to attract
and hold attention?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.300
Does the message include persuasive elements
to convince you its story is true?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.980
Is it flashy and loud like a pop-up ad, or
have a cliffhanger-y headline to suck you in?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.480
Number 3: What lifestyles, values and points
of view does it depict?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.880
Is it representing a single point of view,
like an autobiography?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.060
Is it an Instagram feed that’s all about
that hashtag beach life or a blog that’s all
about working hard and playing hard?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.800
Number 4: How might different people interpret
this message?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.080
Would your parents or grandparents or best
friend feel the same way about this?

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.440
How would they react?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.820
Number 5: What is omitted, or left out?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.080
Is this article about politics talking about
every party or just one?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.940
Did that break-up song mention the good times,
too?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.300
Why or why not?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.940
Once you’ve established answers to these
questions, it’s time to evaluate the quality and
credibility of the media you’re consuming.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.860
Media literacy scholar Julie Coiro says
there are four key things to look out for:
relevance, accuracy, bias, and reliability.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.520
The first is relevance.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.190
Does the info or media serve its purpose,
and to what degree?

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.420
If you Googled “recipes for chow mein”
and recipe for peach muffins comes up instead,
that content is not relevant.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.580
This one can be a pretty low bar to clear.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.480
As we know, our mind loves to accept the
easiest to understand info as the right info,
because it’s convenient.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.980
Which is why we move on to…accuracy.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.480
Evaluating something for accuracy can be difficult
when you’re just learning about it yourself.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.140
The first step is to check how factual it is.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.400
Are its claims backed up by empirical evidence
or is it just someone’s opinion?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.360
You should be able to double check those facts
with other sources.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.200
Of course, just because multiple outlets tell
the same story doesn’t mean it’s true.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.860
Like how every time there’s a hurricane,
someone photoshops a shark into the waters
and local news stations run the story.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.600
In cases like these, take that info and double
check with their source.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.760
Next, you look for bias, or someone’s perspective.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:51.300
Be sure to distinguish whether the author of the media you’re evaluating is slanting the facts towards a particular point of view, and ask how that reflects on the publisher.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.160
Biased media can obscure reality by presenting
only the evidence that supports one opinion.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.380
To ward this off, it’s always great to seek out
diverse perspectives on a topic and look for
evidence to support any stance that you take.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.520
Finally, determining reliability can help
you find sources of information that you trust.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.820
Reliability is how trustworthy a publisher
or author is based on the entirety of their work.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.360
Yes, it’s complicated.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.700
As you know, some respected publishers
who are reliable sources publish native ads
that look like news.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.860
Some even promote those sketchy click-bait
tabloid ads about celebrities dying or losing weight.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.860
By consistently evaluating for relevance,
accuracy, and bias, you can determine whether
a publisher’s work is reliable on the whole.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.080
Let’s take this four-part evaluation for
a spin in the Thought Bubble!

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.240
Consider this article from The Washington
Post, from November 2017.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.840
The headline reads: FCC net neutrality process
‘corrupted’ by fake comments and vanishing
consumer complaints, officials say.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.460
It’s about a new rule the Federal Communications
Commission was set to vote on the next month.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.280
The FCC put out a call for citizens to
comment on the decision to roll back
net neutrality protections.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.320
Some said the comment process wasn’t fair
and that bad actors manipulated it to get their way.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.840
So, is this relevant?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.100
Well if you came across this article because you
were searching for Titanic fanfic, you’d say no.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.780
But if you came across it on social media and
were interested in this net neutrality battle, you’d
certainly find its information relevant. Check.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.040
Is it accurate?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.500
The Washington Post’s reporter explains
the net neutrality comments process and
the allegations against it.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.840
They cite credible sources along the way,
like the New York Attorney General, an FCC
spokesperson, and a data scientist.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.319
They also link to other stories that back
up their claims throughout.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.300
It looks pretty accurate.
Check.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.580
Is it biased?

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.920
This article doesn’t just quote the FCC
in this story about the FCC.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.140
They also gave space to the New York Attorney
General and the leader of an advocacy group that
are against the FCC’s net neutrality decision.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.460
They present both sides of this fight, and
include a third party, the data scientist, to
offer a neutral opinion.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.860
That’s a good way to fight off bias.
Check.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.100
Is it reliable?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.960
The Washington Post is well-known for a
history of quality journalism and has won dozens
of Pulitzer Prizes (the Oscars for journalism).

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.480
The article was written by Brian Fung, their
technology writer who has written about internet
access quite a bit before.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.100
He’s also written for the National Journal
and The Atlantic, two other reliable publications.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.660
This checks out for reliability.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.680
See, it only takes a minute to go through
this four-step check with a bit of news.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.060
You can use this whenever you come across
media you find questionable.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.960
It’s an important skill to have.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.180
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.200
Maybe the most fun media literacy skill is
to create media yourself.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:40.660
Taking your knowledge of how media are produced and
producing some of your own is actually a great way to
develop skills in analyzing and evaluating media, too.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.960
It’s like media literacy inception.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.360
But you don’t have to be some music producer
or artist to create media.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.980
Posting to social networks is creating media.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.940
Writing a blog is creating media.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.300
Making a funny GIF from your favorite TV show
is creating media.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.000
Finally, the most important part of media
literacy is being able to act on all of the
skills you’ve acquired.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.960
Acting on media literacy could mean looking
up local candidates for government and using
that info when you vote.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.320
It could mean going vegan after reading about
animal farms.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.960
It could even mean deleting Twitter from your
phone after realizing you’re addicted to social media.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:21.820
You may be wondering: do everyday people
really access, analyze, evaluate, create and act on
all the media they consume each day?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.900
Of course not.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.640
It’s impossible to apply each of these principles
to everything we absorb all the time.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.820
But little by little as you start to apply
them to different media it will become a habit.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.930
Like building a muscle, you’ll find yourself
doing it reflexively as you scroll through
your phone or listen to the radio.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:43.240
And as a key tenet of media literacy, you
should be able to accomplish this across all
of your devices and types of media.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.300
Not just the news and advertisements, but
movies and music and books, too.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.520
You might use multiple devices in the span
of one day and,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.460
in that one day see videos, photos, news articles,
ads, short stories, quizzes, sponsored content –
you name it.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:05.740
As long as you know how to access what you
want, what to trust, and who you can rely on for it, you’ll
thrive within the fast-paced media environment.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.060
But we’re not done yet.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:13.660
Next time on Crash Course Media Literacy we’re
going to talk about how media literacy itself is
going to change in the future.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.380
How will we respond to virtual and augmented
reality media?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.800
How does artificial intelligence factor into
our news diet?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.020
Should we even let corporations sell us “smart
home” devices that listen to us all the time?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.680
There’s a lot to cover, and I can’t wait
to dive in.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.320
For Crash Course, I’m Jay Smooth.
See you next time!

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.560
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.380
It’s made with the help of all of these
nice people, and our animation team is
Thought Cafe.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.240
