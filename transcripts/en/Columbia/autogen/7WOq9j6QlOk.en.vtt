01:35:18.619 --> 01:35:20.800
is it is quite a hard message to get
across but i think even just trying to

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:20.810
across but i think even just trying to
 

01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:23.560
across but i think even just trying to

very useful indeed and just finally on

01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:57.070
very useful indeed and just finally on
 

01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:59.430
very useful indeed and just finally on
that point i mean really i think one

01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440
that point i mean really i think one
 

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.500
