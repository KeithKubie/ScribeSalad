00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.763
- [Voiceover] So I have an
interesting equation here.

00:00:01.763 --> 00:00:04.874
It says V to the negative six fifths power

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:08.160
times the fifth root of V

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.728
is equal to V to the K power,

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:14.110
for V being greater than/equal to zero.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.579
And what I wanna do

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.236
is try to figure out what K needs to be.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:19.972
So what is...

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:22.857
what is K going to be equal to?

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.113
So pause the video and see
if you can figure out K,

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.419
and I'll give you a hint,
you just have to leverage

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.352
some of your exponent properties.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.057
Alright, let's work this out together.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:33.702
So the first thing I'd want to do is

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.342
being a little bit consistent in

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:36.881
how I write my exponents.

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.081
So here I've written it as
negative six fifths power,

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:41.095
and here I've written it as a fifth root,

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.050
but we know that the
fifth root of something...

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.272
we know that the fifth root...

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:48.814
the fifth root of V,

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.173
that's the same way,

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:53.690
that's the same thing as saying
V to the one fifth power,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.422
and the reason I want
to say that is because

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.158
then I'm multiplying two
different powers of the same base,

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.861
two different powers of V.

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.029
And so we can use our
exponent properties there.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.441
So, this is gonna be the same thing as

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.486
V to the negative six fifths

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.651
times, instead of saying
the fifth root of V

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:14.894
I can say times V to the one fifth power

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:17.756
is going to be equal to V to the K.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.606
It's gonna be equal to V to the K power.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.909
Now, if I'm multiplying V to some power

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.682
times V to some other power,

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.105
we know what the exponent
properties would tell us,

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.346
and I could remind us.

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:31.166
I'll do it over here.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.289
If I have X to the A

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.993
times X to the B,

00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:40.626
that's going to be X
to the A plus B power.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.806
So here, I have the same base, V.

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:46.407
So this is going to be V to the,

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:47.789
and I could just add the exponents.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.631
V to the negative six fifths power

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.534
plus one fifth power,

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:57.911
or V to the negative six
fifths plus one fifth power

00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:00.024
is going to be equal to V to the K.

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:03.727
Is equal to V to the K.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.503
I think you might see where
this is all going now.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:09.834
So this is going to be equal to V.

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:12.585
So negative six fifths plus one fifth

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:16.311
is going to be negative
five fifths or negative one.

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.527
So all of this

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:22.592
is going to be equal to negative one,

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.447
and that's going to be
equal to V to the K.

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:31.538
So K must be equal to
negative one, and we're done.

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:36.581
K is equal to negative one.
