00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:02.533
- [Voiceover] Let's Scream for Ice Cream

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.100
serves three scoops of ice cream

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.381
in its signature cone.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.818
And they draw a picture
of it here over here.

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:13.818
Each scoop is sphere with
a radius four centimeters.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.478
Or, with a radius of four centimeters.

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:21.009
What is the total volume of
ice cream served per cone,

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.036
to the nearest cubic centimeter?

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:28.628
And they want us to use pi
as being approximately 3.14.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.639
We know that it's not exactly 3.14,

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.732
it's 3.14159 and just keeps going

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.228
on and on and on and on and on forever.

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:36.050
Some people memorize thousands of digits,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.476
thousands of digits of pi,
and even that's just a,

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.088
there's an infinite
number of digits to pi.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:42.734
But anyway, let's see
if we can tackle this.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.035
So there's three scoops of ice cream.

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:45.357
Each of them is a sphere,

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:47.163
so this bottom one you can't fully see,

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:48.932
'cause it's into the cone.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:51.389
And they each have a
radius of four centimeters.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.461
So, if you go from the
center of the sphere,

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.422
to the surface of the sphere,

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.266
that is four centimeters.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.582
So, what we really just
need to do is figure out

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:03.041
the volume of one of these spheres,

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.215
one of these scoops,

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.632
and then multiply by three,
because we have three scoops,

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:09.542
and they all have a radius
of four centimeters.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:11.188
They all have the same volume.

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:12.610
And to do that, we have to remember

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.511
the formula for the volume of a sphere.

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.172
The formula for the volume of a sphere is

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:21.992
volume is equal to four-thirds

00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:25.212
pi r cubed.

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:29.879
Where r is the radius of the sphere.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:31.752
In this case, it's gonna
be four centimeters.

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:34.168
And pi is pi, the famous number.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.712
The ratio between the circumference

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:36.992
and the diameter of a circle.

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:39.247
And we're gonna say, for
the sake of this exercise,

00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.665
we're gonna say it's 3.14.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:43.983
With a lot of calculators,
you can get a much more

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:46.175
precise representation of pi.

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:47.638
But we're just gonna use 3.14

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:49.243
'cause that's what they told us to do.

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:53.470
So the volume of one,
the volume of one sphere

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.883
is going to be four-thirds times,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.353
we're gonna use 3.14.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:03.344
3.14 for pi, times the radius cubed.

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:08.036
The radius is four centimeters,
and we are going to cube it.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:10.657
And if you do four centimeters,
and then you cube it,

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:13.014
you're gonna get the
unit centimeters cubed,

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:13.830
Or cubic centimeters.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.066
Actually, let me just do that.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.113
Four centimeters cubed.

00:02:18.113 --> 00:02:21.486
So this is going to be the
volume of one of our spheres.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:22.949
And then we have three of them.

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.513
So, let's multiply to get the volume

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:25.977
of all of them combined.

00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:27.622
Let's multiply this times three.

00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:29.552
And actually makes our
calculation a little bit simpler.

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:31.727
Because we have three divided by three,

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:33.756
and so we are left with,

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:38.756
we are left with four times 3.14.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.025
If we were more precise we
would just say this is pi

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.501
right over here, this is
just an approximation for pi.

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:45.553
And then four centimeters
cubed, let's see,

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:49.262
four cubed is 16 times four, it's 64.

00:02:49.262 --> 00:02:52.168
So this is going to be times 64..

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:55.537
And you could also think of
us as cubing the dimensions.

00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:57.935
So, centimeters cubed,
that's gonna be cubic,

00:02:57.935 --> 00:02:58.890
cubic centimeters.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.526
So, it's gonna be this
many cubic centimeters.

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:03.847
So, let's think about it.

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:06.610
So, it's going to be, we
could do this by hand.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.107
See, four times 64, that is 256.

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.992
So, it's gonna be 3.14

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:17.022
times 256 cubic centimeters.

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:18.600
But we're allowed to use
a calculator for this one.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.550
So let's just take a calculator out,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.399
and let's just multiply it out.

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.936
3.14 times 256

00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:29.113
is equal to 803.84.

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:33.624
And they tell us to round to
the nearest cubic centimeter.

00:03:33.624 --> 00:03:37.037
So, 803.84 cubic centimeters,

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.155
if we round to the nearest centimeter,

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.572
we're gonna round, or round to
the nearest cubic centimeter,

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:42.381
we'll round up because we
have an eight right here.

00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:45.715
So, it's gonna be 804 cubic centimeters.

00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:49.817
So this is approximately 804 cubic,

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:52.763
804 cubic centimeters.

00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:57.068
That is the volume of these
three spheres combined.
