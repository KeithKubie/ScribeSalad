nonconformity within these groups often

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310
nonconformity within these groups often
 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.610
nonconformity within these groups often
tends to be very dangerous so

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
tends to be very dangerous so
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.500
tends to be very dangerous so
individuals that stand out within the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510
individuals that stand out within the
 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.720
individuals that stand out within the
group are often those that are taken by

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
group are often those that are taken by
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.370
group are often those that are taken by
the predator so there's a strong

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
the predator so there's a strong
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800
the predator so there's a strong
selection pressure not only to look like

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
selection pressure not only to look like
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.240
selection pressure not only to look like
the other individuals in the group but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
the other individuals in the group but
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250
the other individuals in the group but
also to behave like other individuals in

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
also to behave like other individuals in
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.350
also to behave like other individuals in
the group and also if one were to

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360
the group and also if one were to
 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.270
the group and also if one were to
consider a predator sort of attacking a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280
consider a predator sort of attacking a
 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.250
consider a predator sort of attacking a
fish school or a bird flock you know the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
fish school or a bird flock you know the
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.680
fish school or a bird flock you know the
reason that the concerted motion these

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
reason that the concerted motion these
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750
reason that the concerted motion these
waves work so effectively is because

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
waves work so effectively is because
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.369
waves work so effectively is because
everyone is essentially following a

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379
everyone is essentially following a
 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.380
everyone is essentially following a
similar type of rule if you try to do

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
similar type of rule if you try to do
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119
similar type of rule if you try to do
something completely different you could

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
something completely different you could
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.649
something completely different you could
of course cause congestion you could

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659
of course cause congestion you could
 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.509
of course cause congestion you could
cause a pileup within these groups and

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519
cause a pileup within these groups and
 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.490
cause a pileup within these groups and
that would of course be selected out of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
that would of course be selected out of
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.710
that would of course be selected out of
the out of the population and so

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720
the out of the population and so
 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.719
the out of the population and so
individuals that follow such rules tend

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729
individuals that follow such rules tend
 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:56.200
individuals that follow such rules tend
not to last very long

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.030
so in you know in a wide range of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040
so in you know in a wide range of
 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.430
so in you know in a wide range of
scenarios there is a a risk that animals

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
scenarios there is a a risk that animals
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.830
scenarios there is a a risk that animals
face by copying the behavior of each

other they risk a sort of a cascade of
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250
other they risk a sort of a cascade of
of misinformation and this is actually a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
of misinformation and this is actually a
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.110

depends on on that made by a few

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

then everyone then joins in and decides

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
then everyone then joins in and decides
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.490
then everyone then joins in and decides
that they agree with that without

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
that they agree with that without
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710
that they agree with that without
actually having assessed the information

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
actually having assessed the information
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600
actually having assessed the information
directly themselves then this can lead

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
directly themselves then this can lead
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280
directly themselves then this can lead
to the sort of auto catalysis in the

to the sort of auto catalysis in the
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.190
to the sort of auto catalysis in the
spread of maladaptive information now

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

what we find in animals is that they're

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
what we find in animals is that they're
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030
what we find in animals is that they're

other is tuned to minimize this risk but

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
other is tuned to minimize this risk but
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.609
other is tuned to minimize this risk but
you know there's a compromise as well

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
you know there's a compromise as well
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.560
you know there's a compromise as well
because it does sometimes happen that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
because it does sometimes happen that
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410
because it does sometimes happen that
they do make mistakes of course because

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
they do make mistakes of course because
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870
they do make mistakes of course because
if you really were to sort of look at

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
if you really were to sort of look at
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300
if you really were to sort of look at
all of the information and assess it it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
all of the information and assess it it
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.790
all of the information and assess it it
that takes time and time is precious and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800
that takes time and time is precious and
 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.460
that takes time and time is precious and
so just like you know a human when

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470
so just like you know a human when
 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.749
so just like you know a human when

what google tells you or perhaps you ask

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
what google tells you or perhaps you ask
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120
what google tells you or perhaps you ask
a few friends who you trust and then you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130
a few friends who you trust and then you
 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.580
a few friends who you trust and then you
rely on that information and so we know

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
rely on that information and so we know
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110
rely on that information and so we know
we also have this type of positive

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
we also have this type of positive
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720
we also have this type of positive
feedback so our decision-making as well

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
feedback so our decision-making as well
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250

as is influenced by these social
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.210
as is influenced by these social
processes

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.120
it is of course a myth the lemmings

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
it is of course a myth the lemmings
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.890
it is of course a myth the lemmings
don't actually hurl themselves off off

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
don't actually hurl themselves off off
 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.920
don't actually hurl themselves off off
cliffs you know these animals are highly

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
cliffs you know these animals are highly
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.010
cliffs you know these animals are highly
susceptible to population fluctuations

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020
susceptible to population fluctuations
 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.420
susceptible to population fluctuations
and so the predators tend to sort of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
and so the predators tend to sort of
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.120
and so the predators tend to sort of
increase in number and then the rodents

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
increase in number and then the rodents
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.250
increase in number and then the rodents
can increase in number and so on and so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
can increase in number and so on and so
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.840
can increase in number and so on and so
you this can actually lead to vast

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850
you this can actually lead to vast
 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.280
you this can actually lead to vast
fluctuations so one year there may be

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
fluctuations so one year there may be
 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.440
fluctuations so one year there may be
many many individuals are the years very

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
many many individuals are the years very
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.720
many many individuals are the years very
few and also I can't remember the exact

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730
few and also I can't remember the exact
 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.580

example the lemmings but there's huge

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590
example the lemmings but there's huge
 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.260

migration for individuals to migrate on
mass and you know even in north america

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
mass and you know even in north america
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.490

the the squirrel that we see everywhere

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
the the squirrel that we see everywhere
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.160
the the squirrel that we see everywhere
the grey squirrel used to once upon a

ago used to form mass migrations as far

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040
ago used to form mass migrations as far
 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.350
ago used to form mass migrations as far
as you could see there are descriptions

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360
as you could see there are descriptions
 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.240
as you could see there are descriptions
of squirrels and they when they come to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
of squirrels and they when they come to
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.980
of squirrels and they when they come to
rivers they all swim across the rivers

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990
rivers they all swim across the rivers
 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.630

and people would go out with you know

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
and people would go out with you know
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.540
and people would go out with you know
guns and dogs and you know I just it was

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550
guns and dogs and you know I just it was
 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.210
guns and dogs and you know I just it was
a phenomenon and you know also there's

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
a phenomenon and you know also there's
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.790
a phenomenon and you know also there's
an extinct birds now called the the

passenger pigeon which also used to live

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450
passenger pigeon which also used to live
 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.360
passenger pigeon which also used to live
in the United States and when these

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
in the United States and when these
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.070
in the United States and when these
flocks were so dense during their

flocks were so dense during their
 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.229
flocks were so dense during their
migrations that the sky would go black

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239
migrations that the sky would go black
 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.330
migrations that the sky would go black
you know and and these of course have

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340
you know and and these of course have
 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.640
you know and and these of course have
been the passenger pigeons have been

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650
been the passenger pigeons have been
