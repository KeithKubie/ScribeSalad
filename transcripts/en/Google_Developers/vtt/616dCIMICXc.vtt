[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:03.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi everybody.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.690
I'm Laurence Moroney for
"The Developer Show,"

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.481
and I'm at the TensorFlow
Developer Summit.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.130
And it's my honor
to have Anitha here.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.250
Anitha, you gave a
wonderful keynote today.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.030
Thank you so much.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.380
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: Thanks
a lot for having me here.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.040
It's awesome.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
was a great keynote.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.830
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
Oh, thank you.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.020
Thank you.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
you actually kicked off

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.960
the day, right?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.959
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: Yes.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.420
This time I had the opportunity
to kick off the day.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.310
And yeah, it was very exciting
to see so many people.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.710
And they're growing,
so it's awesome.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: You got
us off to a great start.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.546
And I really love
that you were starting

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:33.570
by talking about a revolution
in machine learning.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.480
So can you tell us a
little more about that?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.320
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
So I don't know

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.720
if you've heard Sundar
or other people who've

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.102
compared this to as big a
discovery as electricity.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:43.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.360
And the industrial
revolution, right?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.110
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
Industrial revolution.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020
So it's really
fascinating for us

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.940
to be a part of this revolution.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.850
And Google is at the forefront,
building things ground up--

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.040
the hardware, software,
the whole stack--

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.320
and making it
accessible to everyone.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.650
And that's our main thing.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.380
So we want to see what
people can do with this.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.340
We want to see what new
applications they come up with.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.384
And it's really exciting.

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:06.550
It is a revolution for sure.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: Definitely.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.140
Now, you showed some
really cool things,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.527
like planet discovery
and health care.

00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:14.735
Do you have any favorites
that you've been working on

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:16.240
or your team has
been working on?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.656
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
Health care is

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.970
one of the area that's
really a favorite of mine.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.740
My mother-in-law is
an ophthalmologist.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.510
And so when I tell
her that machines

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.030
can do some part of her
job, she doesn't believe me.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: No, no, no.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.760
No they can't.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.150
No, no, no.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.360
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: And I
really want to prove her wrong.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.260
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You're getting closer.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.690
Have you proven it yet?

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.856
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: Yeah,
we you are getting closer.

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:38.100
And diabetic retinopathy, like
what Jeff said, is awesome.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.060
We're able to cure causes
for that, especially if it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.990
a preventable, treatable cause.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.240
And you don't have this many
trained ophthalmologists,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.245
so this is going to make a
huge impact to a lot of people.

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:51.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
part of the tragedy,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.980
that this is preventable, but
there just aren't enough people

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.120
out there to prevent it.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.870
So if we can scale out
through machine learning--

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.870
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: Yes.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.737
And you have so
many mobile devices.

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:01.570
They are ubiquitous.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.960
They are everywhere.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.632
And they have the power
today which is probably

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:08.090
much more than what
people had when

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.339
they landed a man on the moon.

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.057
So you could do amazing
things with these devices.

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.640
And machine learning
will enable that.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
you started your keynote

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.000
talking about revolution
in machine learning,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.430
and then ended your keynote
with saying TensorFlow

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.689
makes all this possible.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.980
And it really does, doesn't it?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.980
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: Yes.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.775
Each one of those examples
were powered by TensorFlow.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:30.830
And our goal is to make
it open, transparent,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.230
accept contribution
from everybody,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.165
and help solve challenging and
real problems for all of us.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:39.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.665
And so if I'm a developer and I
want to get my arms around this

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:44.219
and get started with it, what
advice would you give me?

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.760
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
So I didn't start

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.100
in machine learning as well.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.330
I did other things and now
came to machine learning.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.510
So I think there are a
lot of opportunities here.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.020
We just launched the Machine
Learning Crash Course.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.600
LAURENCE MORONEY:
The crash course.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.920
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR: The MLCC.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.647
That's a really nice
one to play with.

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.730
And we have something
called TensorFlow for Poets.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.670
So even if you're a poet, you
can go program in TensorFlow.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.430
That's the logic.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.550
So you should check those out.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.200
There are lots of
courses online.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.810
YouTube has so many videos.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.810
I think those should--
if you want to do it,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.170
there are enough and more.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we have
a great new YouTube channel,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.790
YouTube.com/TensorFlow.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.130
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've
got to plug it, sorry.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.640
So thank you so much, Anitha.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.840
And thanks everybody.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.090
This is "The Developer Show"
at the TensorFlow Summit.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.086
If you've got any
questions for me

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.400
or if you have any
questions for Anitha,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.810
just please leave them
in the comments below.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.230
And thanks for watching.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.063
ANITHA VIJAYAKUMAR:
Thank you for having me.

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:34.480
