00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:03.373
- [Sal] An object is
launched from a platform.

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:07.102
Its height in meters, x
seconds after the launch,

00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:10.888
is modeled by: h of x is
equal to negative five

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:14.138
times x minus four squared plus 180.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.198
Normally, when they talk
about seconds or time,

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:19.610
they usually would use the variable t,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.334
but we can roll with x being that.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.579
Let's think about what's
going to happen here.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.323
Lemme just visualize it.

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.323
Lemme draw an h axis for our height.

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.411
Let me draw an x axis.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:36.494
An x axis.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.216
At time x is equal to zero.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:41.239
We're on a platform,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.852
so we're already gonna have some height.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.933
At time x is equal to zero.

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.689
I'm used to saying time t equals zero,

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:49.675
but at time x is equal to zero,

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:50.805
we're already gonna have some height

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.614
'cause we're on some platform.

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:55.743
And then we're gonna
launch this projectile.

00:00:55.743 --> 00:01:00.006
And, it's gonna go in
the shape of a parabola,

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:01.750
and it's gonna be a
downward-opening parabola.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.069
You might say: "Sal, how do you know

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.834
"it's gonna be a
downward-opening parabola?"

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.963
Gonna look something like that.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.734
I didn't draw it exactly perfectly,

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.133
but you get, hopefully, the point.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.470
The reason why I knew it was a parabola,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.505
in particular a downward-opening parabola,

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.267
is when you look at what's going on here.

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.316
This is written in vertex
form but it's a quadratic.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:24.851
In vertex form, you have an
expression with x squared,

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.973
and then you're multiplying by

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:28.630
negative five right over here.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.879
This tells us that it's
gonna be downward-opening.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.589
If you were to multiply this out,

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.824
x minus four squared is gonna be x squared

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.124
plus something else plus something else,

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:37.957
then you're gonna have to multiply

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:39.738
all those terms by negative five,

00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:43.681
your leading term is gonna
be negative five x squared.

00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.266
Once again, it's gonna be
a downward-opening parabola

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.826
that looks something like that.

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:52.522
So, given this visual
intuition that we have,

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:55.244
let's see if we can answer
some questions about it.

00:01:55.244 --> 00:01:56.545
The first one I'd like to answer

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.737
is how high is the platform.

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:00.820
How high is the platform?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.435
How high is the platform?

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.267
I encourage you to pause the video,

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.441
and try to figure that out.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.701
What is that value right over there?

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:14.504
Well, as you can see,

00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:17.844
we are at that value
at time x equals zero.

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:20.441
So to figure out how high is the platform,

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:24.380
we essentially just have
to evaluate h of zero.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.619
That's going to be negative five

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.702
times negative four squared plus 180.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.261
I just substituted x with zero.

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:36.886
Negative four squared is 16.

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:40.053
Negative five times 16 is negative 80.

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:42.292
Plus 180.

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:45.620
So this is going to be equal to 100.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.537
So the platform is 100 meters tall.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:53.097
Remember, the height is given in meters.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.592
Now, the next question I have is,

00:02:56.592 --> 00:03:00.759
how many seconds after launch
do we hit our maximum height?

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.902
So our maximum height,
if we're talking about

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:07.191
a downward-opening parabola,
it's going to be our vertex,

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:09.307
is going to be our maximum height.

00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:12.974
And so, the x value of that would tell us

00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:18.469
how long after takeoff,
how long after, or launch,

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.230
do we hit the maximum height.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.058
Trying to use a color you can see.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:28.991
What is this x value right over here?

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.783
Once again, pause the video,

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.475
and see if you can figure it out.

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:36.879
We're trying to answer how long

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.712
after

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:39.644
launch

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.167
is the maximum height.

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:51.668
Well, it's going to be the
x coordinate of our vertex.

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:53.577
How do we figure that out?

00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:56.304
Well, this quadratic has
actually been written

00:03:56.304 --> 00:04:00.287
already in vertex form, which
makes it sound like it should

00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:04.229
be relatively easy to figure
out the vertex over here.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.864
To appreciate that, we
have to see the structure

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:10.345
in the expression, is one
way to think about it.

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:11.402
Let's think about what's going on.

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.188
You have this 180.

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:14.896
And then you this other
term right over here.

00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:16.764
Anything squared is gonna be nonnegative.

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:19.694
So x minus four squared is
always gonna be nonnegative.

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.965
But then you always multiply
that times a negative five,

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:25.715
so this whole thing is
gonna be non-positive.

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.746
So, it will never add to the 180.

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:34.622
Your maximum value is when
this term right over here

00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.531
is going to be equal to zero.

00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:38.849
And when is this term
going to be equal to zero?

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.596
In order to make this term equal to zero,

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:43.519
then x minus four needs
to be equal to zero.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.037
The only way to get x minus
four to be equal to zero

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:48.632
is if x is equal to four.

00:04:48.632 --> 00:04:49.892
Just by looking at this, you say:

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:50.855
"Hey, what makes this zero?"

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:51.688
Four.

00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:53.685
X equals four will make this zero.

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.862
This is right over there.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:05:00.029
If I were to write h of
four, this is going to be,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:02.819
this term is gonna go to zero,

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.560
and you're gonna be left with the 180.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.831
There you go, this right over here.

00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:10.942
The maximum height is 180.

00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:14.760
It happens four seconds after launch.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.060
Now, the last question I'll ask you is,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.455
how long after launch do
we get to a height of zero?

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:25.788
So, for what x makes our height zero?

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.684
To do that, we have to solve
h of x is equal to zero.

00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:34.685
Or, we can write h of x as negative five

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:38.852
times x minus four squared
plus 180 is equal to zero.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.618
And, once again, pause the video,

00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:45.149
and see if you can solve this.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:46.912
Could subtract 180 from both sides.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:50.441
You get negative five
times x minus four squared,

00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.469
is equal to negative 180.

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.830
We can divide both sides by negative five.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.663
We get x minus four
squared is equal to 36.

00:06:02.142 --> 00:06:04.784
Scroll down a little bit.

00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:05.617
Then,

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.079
we could take the plus
and minus square root,

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.153
I guess you could say.

00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:15.036
And so, that will give us x minus four

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:17.311
could be equal to six.

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:21.295
Or, x minus four is equal to negative six.

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:23.693
In this first situation,
add four to both sides,

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:25.874
you get x is equal to 10.

00:06:25.874 --> 00:06:27.905
Or, you add four to both sides here,

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:31.277
you get x is equal to negative two.

00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:32.858
Now, we're dealing with time here,

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:34.481
so negative two would've been in the past

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:35.985
if it wasn't sitting on the platform

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:37.869
and if it was just
continuing its trajectory,

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:39.274
I guess you could say, backwards in time.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:42.833
But that's not the x that we
wanna take into consideration.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:46.239
We want the positive time value,
and that's right over here.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.271
That is when x is equal to 10.

00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:50.181
10 seconds after takeoff,

00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:53.062
our height is going to be equal to zero.

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:54.971
If the ground is at height of zero,

00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:57.287
if it's at sea level, I guess, then,

00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:01.454
that's when our projectile
is going to hit the ground.
