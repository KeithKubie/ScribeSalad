00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.780
No matter how long a writer might take to
craft the perfect story, unforgettable characters,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.719
or crazy twist ending, a good fan theory can
blow it out of the water.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.570
Most of the time, they're only meant to give
fans a bit of fun, or a wild idea to debate.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.980
But sometimes, they actually can answer questions
left unresolved, or get fans to love heroes

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.720
and villains more than they ever thought possible.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.720
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Theories That
Completely Change Amazing Films.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.359
E.T. the Extraterrestrial

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.190
Steven Spielberg's adorable alien movie had
every kid wishing they had their own E.T.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.190
to look after.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.720
But George Lucas took his friend's reference
to Star Wars - when E.T. seems to recognize

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.879
a Yoda Halloween costume - and raised him
a shared universe, including members of his

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.470
species in the Senate of his Star Wars prequels.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.930
But if E.T. exists in the Star Wars mythology,
his adorable abilities start to look different.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.300
The fact that he can raise Elliott's bike
into the air, or heal his finger fit with

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.540
the Jedi's use of The Force.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.690
But only one kind of Force user can bring
the dead back to life, or resurrect themselves.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.420
How the movie changes when you consider the
odds of E.T. being a Sith lord... well, that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.800
up to fans to decide.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Harry Potter

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.580
There's no way around it: Willy Wonka had
to rely on some magic to make his famous candy.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.350
But one fan theory claims that the troublemaking,
red-haired Wonka is no random wizard: he's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.860
actually George Weasley from the Harry Potter
series in disguise.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.090
It's a wild theory, but the evidence is shocking.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.540
For starters, George and his twin Fred invented
similar kinds of candy in their own store,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.000
before Fred was killed by Death Eaters.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.770
There's even George's missing ear, blown off
in The Deathly Hallows, with Wonka alluding

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.550
to the same injury.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.590
It's the opposite ear, but that actually fits
the Weasley's sense of humor.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.080
Finally, there's the elf-like Oompa Loompas
who do all his work, and the evidence that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.670
George took his twin's death harder than fans
realized.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.920
How else do you explain Wonka's office, with
every single item sliced perfectly in half?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.620
At least he found a friend in Charlie.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.620
Fight Club

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.510
Even though the story of Fight Club and Project
Mayhem is packed with twists, fans can't help

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.610
but look for even more mysteries hidden within
it.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.770
Or, in the case of one of the funnier fan
theories, outside of it.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.520
The narrator of the story is never actually
named, so fans have come up with one of their

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.590
own: Calvin, as in "Calvin and Hobbes," the
popular comic strip following a young boy

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.350
and his troublemaking imaginary tiger.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.140
The theory says that Calvin eventually had
to give up his imaginary friend, bottling

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.579
up his rebel spirit and joining the working
masses.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.849
Until he reaches a breaking point, and his
fun-loving, occasionally destructive and subversive

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.890
friend returns - this time, in the form of
a man, but every bit as wild.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.209
Is it true?

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.209
Probably not.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.859
But it shows why fan theories can go even
further than a movie's own script.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.930
Batman

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.359
Fans of the Dark Knight weren't just outraged
when Michael Keaton was cast as Tim Burton's

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.709
Batman, but at the new twist on his origin
story.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.340
In the comics, it was a random mugger named
Joe Chill who killed Bruce Wayne's parents,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.340
but in the big screen version, it was Jack
Nicholson's Joker, decades before he would

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.329
become his green-haired alter ego.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.090
Taking down his parents' killer is a major
plot point, but some fans have wondered if

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.689
the change is more than it seems.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.010
According to their theory, The Joker never
actually killed Bruce's parents - that's just

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.569
a lie he tells himself, blaming each new supervillain
for the same crime.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.939
It shows Bruce is more damaged and tortured
than fans realized, giving the movie an even

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.319
darker tone.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.319
Suicide Squad

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.189
Who says a fan theory has to be perfectly
believable?

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.010
Sometimes, it's better if it's just fun to
consider.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.709
Before movie fans even knew Jared Leto by
name, he was cracking ribs as a member of

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.510
- you guessed it - Fight Club.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.889
In fact, he was Tyler Durden's favorite pupil,
which was why the narrator had to leave him

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.849
brutally beaten, with only a handful of teeth.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.540
Fast forward over a decade and a half, and
the first image of Leto's Joker in the Suicide

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.469
Squad movie had fans suspicious.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.409
A crazed student of chaos and crime, just
like Durden, with false metal teeth, played

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.409
by the same actor?

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.340
The studio may not have ever intended to imply
their Joker could be Fight Club's Angel Face

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.949
all grown up, but for the fans, the similarities
were too perfect to ignore.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:46.949
Jaws

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.120
When a young girl's body shows up bearing
signs of a shark attack, the small town's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.609
mayor goes into damage control, trying to
keep the new police chief from closing the

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.779
beaches, chalking the girl's death up to a
boating accident.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.889
But what if Brody just stopped a cover-up
that had run for years?

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.110
The city's leaders claim the girl isn't the
first to die while swimming, and it's only

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.640
when an outside expert is brought in that
the "boating accident" excuse is blown to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
pieces.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.769
It's easy to believe the mayor is evil enough
to plant a tiger shark to take the blame,

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.370
but we'll never know how many citizens wound
up in a shark's belly, just to be covered

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.709
up by the town authorities.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.709
Kill Bill

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.489
Quentin Tarantino's two-part martial arts
manhunt says all it needs to in the title:

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.550
Uma Thurman's Bride is out to kill Bill, her
former mentor.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.639
And in the second film, she finally finishes
the job... or does she?

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.081
In the end credits, the characters on The
Bride's hit list all are crossed out, a sign

00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.740
that she killed them along the way.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.270
All Except Daryl Hannah, who wasn't killed,
just left for dead in the desert, minus her

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.270
eyes.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.520
But David Carradine's name isn't marked at
all, implying that The Bride DIDN'T kill Bill

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.729
after all.

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.889
Was he faking his death?

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.509
The added detail in the credits wouldn't make
sense if he wasn't, but the director isn't

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.830
giving an official answer any time soon.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.830
Avatar

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.870
Once the hero Jake Sully is accepted by the
natives of Pandora, he learns that the tribe's

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.610
power over other animals lies in their ponytails.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.590
When they link with the rest of the planet's
wildlife, a bond is formed, permanently linking

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.590
them together.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.580
The most important link comes when Jake bonds
directly with the life force behind the entire

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.580
moon.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.280
When he wakes up, he leaves his human allies
behind, and leads the natives to victory.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.150
So some have asked: did Jake really decide
to do the right thing, or did the life force

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.110
he bonded with command him to do it, just
like he controlled animals before?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.360
It all worked out in the end, but it makes
you see the hero in a completely different

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.620
light.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.620
Star Wars

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.940
The prequel trilogy caused plenty of plot
problems with the original Star Wars story,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.819
with these two characters chief among them.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:31.819
The problem?

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.541
Why would Chewbacca have kept quiet about
knowing the Jedi Yoda this entire time, and

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:39.729
why would R2D2 keep his knowledge of Darth
Vader's true identity all to himself?

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.909
Some fans have offered a fun solution, claiming
Han Solo's co-pilot and the droid were secret

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.210
agents of the Rebellion the entire time.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.060
It may have seemed like coincidence, but what
if R2D2 knew exactly where to look for Luke

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.060
Skywalker?

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.259
And what if the meeting between Obi-Wan and
Chewie was more than just a job interview,

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.760
but an order given to lead Han Solo into the
Rebel Alliance?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.930
There's no way to ever prove it, but that
doesn't mean it isn't worth considering.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.930
Indiana Jones

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.580
Fans of the galaxy far, far away know just
how many Star Wars easter eggs wound up in

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.409
the Indiana Jones series, as a tribute by
director Steven Spielberg to his producer

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.639
and friend, George Lucas.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.199
But fans have come up with an even funnier
explanation.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.070
Since Han Solo was frozen in carbonite in
The Empire Strikes Back, and the first Indiana

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.150
Jones movie was released a year later, fans
claim Indy is nothing but the dream of a frozen

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.150
Han in all 3 movies.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.360
He imagines himself as the archaeologist adventurer,
but hints of C-3PO, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2D2 and

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.030
even carbonite all trickle in.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.590
By the same theory, Return of the Jedi never
happened - which makes sense.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.689
Han saving the day, and getting the girl always
did seem like too happy an ending...&nbsp;

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.560
Those are some of the funnier or mindblowing
theories we've found among fans, but which

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
ones are your favorites?
