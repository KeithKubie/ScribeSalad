00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.950
JEFF CLEARY: All right,
welcome everyone.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.210
My name is Jeff Cleary.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.980
And I want to give a quick
introduction to Sasha.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.880
I wish I could say that I've
known Sasha since preschool.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.320
But that's not quite true.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.110
We met when our kids went
to the same preschool.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.340
And I got to know Sasha first
as a great dad and friend

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.060
long before I came to learn that
he was, as my wife calls him,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.156
a real-life superhero.

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:40.530
Sasha is the
founder and director

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.430
of RefugePoint, a
humanitarian organization that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.450
finds lasting
solutions for refugees

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.366
in life-threatening situations.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.740
He's also the
author of the book,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.364
"From Crisis to
Calling" that he's here

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:54.200
today to tell us about.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.810
When I read this book, I was
struck by how big of a story

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.020
this is and how desperate
the circumstances are

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.600
for the refugees in the Congo
and all around the world,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.570
especially as compared
to my comparatively

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.262
safe and comfortable life.

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:12.220
But it would be a mistake
to only think of this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.230
as someone else's story.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.350
For one, we're all
guaranteed a certain number

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.044
of personal crises in life.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.710
And there are lessons
from the book that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.660
can serve as guideposts
for when we're

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.510
confronted by the
unexpected or the unfair.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.150
And second, Sasha's work is
an inspiration for anyone

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.370
who wants to help
and do something

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.560
that's bigger than yourself.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.150
SASHA CHANOFF: Hi, everybody.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.780
Jeff, thank you for
inviting me here

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.740
and for that lovely
introduction.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.360
It is a real
pleasure to be here,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.400
to be able to talk
about the book

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.290
that I coauthored with
my dad, David Chanoff,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.940
"From Crisis to Calling."

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
Thanks to [INAUDIBLE] for being
here, Ryan, and everybody else.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.710
Right now, there are
about 65 million people

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.280
displaced because of war
and conflict in the world.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.130
And the average
amount of time someone

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.330
lives as a refugee
is nearing 20 years.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.000
Congo is one of the places
that has been in conflict

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.290
for about 20 years now.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.950
And many years ago, in
1998, when the conflict

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.730
re-emerged there,
the US government--

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.750
I think out of guilt over
not acting during the Rwandan

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.200
genocide-- engaged
the organization

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.890
that I was working for at
the time, the International

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.020
Organization for Migration,
to send small rescue

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.560
teams into the Congo
and evacuate people

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.190
from that country who
were being attacked.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.170
And those people all
eventually came to the US

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830
through our government's
resettlement program.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.010
My boss, David, handed me
a list with 112 names on it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.680
and sent me in on the
last rescue mission.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.730
And he told me that, your goal
is to get these 112 people out.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.590
They're in a safe,
protected center

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.440
with armed guards around it
near the capital of Congo.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.590
You'll go in there.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.200
You'll get them to the airport.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.270
And you'll fly them out.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.910
You'll need armed guards to do
this because Congo is at war,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180
and people who look
like Tutsis are

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.700
being attacked in the streets.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.050
So you'll have to protect
them getting to the airport.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.100
But we've managed to get
over 1,000 people out,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.380
almost 1,500 people out.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.530
And these are the last 112
that the Congolese government

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.260
has given us permission
to go and get.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.460
And he said, I'm sending my
right-hand person in with you.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.270
She's been on every
previous evacuation with me.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.620
But she sometimes tries
to take additional people,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.340
so you have to stop her.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.170
So he put that
responsibility on me

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.760
to make sure that we only
got those 112 people out.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.630
And then, when we got
into that safe haven,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.830
we registered those 112 people.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.710
But we were pointed to a tent.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.380
And I remember stepping
into that tent.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.110
And we saw all of these
32 widows and orphans

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.680
in that tent.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.480
When Sheikha leaned over to
a little girl holding a doll

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.980
and said, what's
your doll's name,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.540
and the doll's eyes popped
open, and all of a sudden,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.970
we realized that it
was a tiny infant that

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.890
looked more dead than
alive, it was clear

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.980
the hardship and horror that
these people had gone through.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.110
Mammy was a 15-year-old girl
in there who had watched many

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.170
of her relatives pass away in
the past year-and-a-half that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.120
she'd been in prison
and in danger.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.510
And she was one of the other
people in that safe haven.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.340
So Sheikha and I left.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.960
And she said, we
have to take them.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.410
And I said, we can't.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.480
And I tried to make
sure that I was

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.420
doing what my boss
wanted me to do

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.430
and what I had been
told I had to do.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.890
But I wanted to take them.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.020
And Sheikha finally said to
me, Sasha, we're humanitarians.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.060
If we don't do
this, nobody will.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.210
This decision is up to us.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.610
And what she really did
was she connected me

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.110
with my own deepest
sense of who I felt I was

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.450
and what I wanted
to do, my own sense

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.720
of compassion and empathy.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.220
And so we called our
boss and told him

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.680
that we wanted to
try to take them.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.150
And he got very upset with us.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.330
And he explained that
we would probably fail

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.470
and that everybody
would lose their lives.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.230
But I said, I understand
this, when he said that.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.710
And I said, we
have to try anyway.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.300
So we managed, after
a lot of complexity,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.320
to get everybody to the
airport with our armed guards

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.330
on the morning of
the last evacuation.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.530
And then the Congolese
officials stopped us

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.840
from getting on the plane.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.450
And my heart stopped.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.410
And I thought, everything that
my boss, David, has warned

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.670
us about is coming true now.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.220
But Sheikha went
over and started

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.480
talking to the head of
Congolese immigration.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.520
And about a minute later, they
let us all board the plane.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.620
And we flew out
to a refugee camp

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.560
in a neighboring
country, Cameroon.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.440
And from there,
those people went

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.760
through the US
resettlement process

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.660
and then came to the US.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.250
And I've watched them all
rebuild their lives here.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.020
I've known Mammy now
for almost 20 years.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.520
So that experience
opened my eyes

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.800
to people who are in the most
life-threatening situations

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.350
and off the radar.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.730
Everywhere I went
working across Africa,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.490
I found people who were
unseen and in danger.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.320
When I went to
Kakuma Refugee Camp,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.290
I worked with a group called
the Sudanese Lost Boys.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.460
They have become kind of
famous here in the US.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.492
There was a movie
called "The Good Lie"

00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:41.450
that Warner Brothers did
with Reese Witherspoon

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.150
about their story.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.250
And "60 Minutes" did
a piece about them.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.040
But I saw that while all
these young children who

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.280
had survived horrors in
Sudan were all these boys

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.810
and young men were
coming to the US,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.940
girls were overlooked
in that camp.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.520
And everywhere I went, I saw
people who were overlooked.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.670
I also saw that the US
Resettlement Program

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.660
is one of about 30
countries worldwide

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.950
that actively brings
refugees here.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.140
And they have a
pathway to citizenship.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.080
And this is one of the
three solutions for refugees

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.420
right now in the world.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.790
Essentially, what happens
is when you flee your home,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.700
you're either going
to go back home,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.260
or you're going to stay in
the country to which you fled,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.490
or you're going to resettle
to another country.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.430
So those are the three
different options.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.527
The problem is that people
don't go home anymore.

00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:30.110
The average amount
of time, as I said,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.240
is 20 years before
people return home.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.460
The other problem is
that a lot of people

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.500
are just stuck in refugee camps
in neighboring countries, where

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.360
they get food year
after year after year.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.040
But there is no hope for
anything better than that.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.310
And so actually,
one of the reasons

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.210
we've heard so much about
the global refugee crisis

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.990
right now is because so
many Syrians and others

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.040
were trying to get into Europe.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.790
And what happened there was that
the international community has

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.980
simply run out of
humanitarian aid money.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.460
Food was cut off to
about 800,000 Syrians

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.410
about a year ago.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.400
So people were faced
with the prospect

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.790
of watching their
children starve

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.680
and having no
access to education.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.750
And they were forced into
dangerous onward journeys.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.380
People are forced to
risk their lives to try

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.740
to get to someplace better.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.670
So I saw that there could
be more opportunities

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.550
for resettlement and that there
could be more opportunities

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.110
to figure out how to help
people become self-reliant

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.440
if they can't resettle.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.730
And that's why I started this
organization, RefugePoint.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.309
So I started about 10 years ago.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:43.299
And it was exciting because
I met a lot of people

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.292
just like you here
in this audience, who

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.000
are interested in
these issues, but maybe

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.430
didn't know a ton about them.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.550
And I said, you know,
I know a lot of people

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.780
right now are in
life-threatening danger.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.670
And if you can
support what I'm doing

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.530
starting this organization,
we can get them

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.220
to the US or Canada
or Australia,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.150
where they can
rebuild their lives.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.950
And for those
people who might be

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.720
able to stay in the
neighboring country,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.840
we can try to help them
become self-reliant

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.410
there so that they
can stay there

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.420
and have a normal life there
and get their kids into school.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.310
So RefugePoint now
is an organization

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.100
that looks for solutions
to refugee problems, which

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.100
is very different than the
whole international aid

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.200
community, which is primarily
focused on giving aid

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.030
year after year after year
with food and other services

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.100
while they wait for refugees
to be able to go home.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.300
So what we want to do, and
what we've tried to do,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.430
is help reshape how people
think about refugees.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.480
They're not just victims.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.330
They're people who
can contribute,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.030
who, when they
have opportunities,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.796
can actually support
themselves, contribute

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:45.670
to their communities.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.280
And what I've found
personally is that they

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.450
inspire those who know them.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.280
I have been incredibly
inspired by the people

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.980
I have met who have come through
the worst horror and hardship

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.860
and then go on to
rebuild their lives.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.450
Mammy, whom you met, works
at a foundation in Phoenix,

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.460
where she's helping
other people.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.050
And I've met so many refugees
who go on to contribute,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.350
when they just have
an opportunity.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.820
So RefugePoint is focused
on making sure that refugees

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.620
have opportunities.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.140
And it's been really exciting
to build this organization

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.740
over the past 10 years.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.630
But ever since that
experience in the Congo

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.440
that really changed how
I thought about my life

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.260
and what I wanted to
do-- so in the Congo,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.860
I was communicating
with my parents.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.640
I was worried that they would
be worried about me because this

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.112
was a new experience for me.

00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:39.820
But it was also a new
experience for them

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.870
having a son who
was in a place where

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.220
there was a lot of danger.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.940
And so my mom is from Finland.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.550
And the Congolese government
actually had bugged our room

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.960
and was trying to listen
in on what we were doing

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.840
and understand more
about what we were doing.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.231
And I was worried that they
had bugged my email too.

00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:00.980
But I wanted to send
emails to my parents.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.770
So I sent them some emails in
my mom's native language, which

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.310
is Finnish, which I
also learned growing up,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.790
thinking that even if
they're bugging my emails,

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.580
they're not going read Finnish.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.720
But from that point, I started
talking to my mom and dad

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.640
about this experience.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.556
And I started talking
to my dad, specifically,

00:11:16.556 --> 00:11:18.370
over many years about
what it meant to me.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.060
And that led to thinking about
what critical decision points

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.000
can mean for other people.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.674
And that led to this book.

00:11:25.674 --> 00:11:27.090
So the book is
called "From Crisis

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.010
to Calling, Finding Your
Moral Center in the Toughest

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:30.900
Decisions."

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.440
And it uses the story
of this rescue operation

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.640
to talk about moral decision
points that people face.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.910
But what I realized, and what
the publisher, Berrett-Koehler,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.490
saw was that while my
situation was unique,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.197
the fact is that we
will all be confronted

00:11:46.197 --> 00:11:48.530
at one time or another with
some kind of decision that's

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.820
going to impact other
people in some way.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.650
It might not be, obviously, as
specific and dramatic as what

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.030
I went through,
but that we're all

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.714
at times, either in our
families or in our work lives

00:12:00.714 --> 00:12:02.630
or with what we're doing
or what we're seeing,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.620
we might be confronted
with a decision that's

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.840
hard and might take us
out of our comfort zone.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.080
But these kind of decision
points, I have seen

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.960
and others have seen, are
opportunities to actually

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.710
understand yourself more.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.690
And they're
opportunities to move

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.870
in a direction of your
life that is more in line

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.580
with your own
sense of compassion

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.310
and your own sense of empathy.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.770
And when you do that,
I think you connect

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.190
more with who you really are.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.500
So in the book, we lay out
five ideas or principles

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.090
that help people to
think about this.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.380
The first one is to be prepared,
to know that, at some point,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.720
you're going to face some sort
of decision that might impact

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.860
other people in some way.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.151
And know that that will happen.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:51.350
And the second point
is to open your eyes.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.900
Open your eyes to
what that decision is.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.600
For me, opening my
eyes was actually

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.280
stepping into that tent.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.320
When I stepped into that tent,
I saw those people face-to-face.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.510
And when I saw
them face-to-face,

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.590
that was when it really struck
me that this is not just

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.090
about them.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.780
It's about me and my decision.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.404
So I think that it's
really easy to stay--

00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:16.570
we're all busy in our lives.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.070
Right?

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.670
Everyone here is-- yeah, I
mean, you're doing amazing--

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.460
a million things, and probably
multitasking all the time.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.890
But we're busy with our work.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.450
We're busy with our families.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.930
We're busy with all
the things in our life.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.920
It's easy to keep
your focus on that

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.390
and not look up and open your
eyes to some hard decision

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.730
that's around you.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.310
The third principle
that we lay out

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:45.780
is to confront yourself, or
have somebody argue with you,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.530
or understand what you're
looking at and think about it.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.990
For me, even though I opened
my eyes to those people,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.020
I still didn't want
to help them because I

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.350
had orders from my boss.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.640
There was a lot at risk.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.810
I knew that we were potentially
risking other people's lives.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.420
I was really lucky to
have Sheikha there,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.420
whom you saw in the
video and is just

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.910
this extraordinary human
being with incredible passion.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.920
But she was the one
who argued with me.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.490
And I realized that
having that confrontation

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.300
made me think about who I was.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.660
My own family came
here to the US

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.900
as refugees 100 years ago
fleeing Anti-Semitism.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.880
And I thought about my
great-grandmother, who

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.640
raised four kids on her own.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.760
But arguing with Sheikha
helped me figure out who I was

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.200
and what I wanted to do.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.330
So the fourth principle
is to know yourself.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.130
Figure out what's in
your family background.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.620
What experiences have you had?

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.740
What is your heart and
your sense of empathy

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.940
telling you what to do?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.180
But even with all those things,
I was still really scared.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.100
And so the fifth principle that
we lay out is to take courage.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.660
I was really lucky,
again, because I

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.060
had this extraordinary
person with me.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.670
But I would say, it
was a courageous thing

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.270
to try to decide to take them.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.760
And Sheikha lead the
way on that because we

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.160
were going against our orders.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.604
We'd been told not to do that.

00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:12.770
And there was a lot of risk.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.160
We had to double our armed guard
to try to get those people out

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.130
because Congo was at war,
and it was complicated.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.717
But not all those principles
will necessarily come into play

00:15:23.717 --> 00:15:24.550
with every decision.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.060
But we find that
that's a good framework

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.590
to help think
about these things.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.670
And we bring in a
lot of other stories

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.590
in the book about
other people who

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.490
have faced critical
decision points, people

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.630
from the military, people
who've worked in health care

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.960
and in many different
areas of life

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.470
to show that this is not a
unique situation, that this

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.056
is actually common to
face decision points.

00:15:44.056 --> 00:15:45.430
But some of these
decision points

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.303
can actually help us
define who we are.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.120
But the fact is that we have
a lot of different influences

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.980
in our lives that are
shaping us and telling

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.720
us to do different things.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.970
And so there's this
great quote that we

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.380
found from the sociologist,
James Q. Wilson.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.060
And it's about the sense of
empathy and the moral sense.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.020
And the quote is that
"Humankind's moral sense is not

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.960
a strong beacon light.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.520
It is rather a
small candle flame,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.000
flickering and sputtering
in the strong winds

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.590
of power and passion,
greed and ideology.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.240
But brought close to the heart
and cupped in one's hands,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.490
it dispels the darkness
and warms the soul."

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.270
And so the book has
gotten some good attention

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.740
because I think that
it can help people

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.050
to think about decisions that
you might have in front of you,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.370
or things that you want to
do which might orient you

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.410
in a way that will connect with
your own sense of compassion

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.500
and empathy, and that
those things are really

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.920
core human characteristics,
and that when we do that,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.205
we feel more fulfilled
in our lives.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.460
The guy who was Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s spiritual mentor it

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.690
is a guy named Benjamin Mays.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.569
And he was also at
Morehouse College.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.810
And he challenged his
students, saying, each of us

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.710
is born to do something unique.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.569
What is it that you
were born to do?

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.730
And I think that confronting
hard decision points

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.540
is one way to try to help figure
out what we are each here,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.900
uniquely suited to do because
I think everybody has things

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.100
to contribute to the world that
can improve the world in one

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.500
way or another.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.510
And so I hope that this book,
"From Crisis to Calling"

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.070
can help in some way to shape
people and get people thinking

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.860
about the fact that we each
have unique contributions

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.560
to make in the world.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.890
I also hope that it can
help shed light on the work

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.990
that I do and RefugePoint
does because right now,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.060
more than ever, we have
an unprecedented crisis--

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.040
it's a human crisis-- of people
who are displaced in the world.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.700
And we not only have to
think about how to respond

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.720
to that as individuals.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.740
But I think right
now, we need to think

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.920
about how to respond
to that as a country

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.980
and as a global community.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.050
So thank you so, so
much for being here.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.070
It's such a pleasure.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:24.280
And I want to pause or
stop there and invite

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.860
you to ask any questions
that you might want to ask.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.460
I find the questions can help
to stimulate other thoughts

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.350
and discussion.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.280
And there microphones
there if you're

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.774
interested in
asking any question.

00:18:33.774 --> 00:18:36.190
Or you can just raise your
hand and ask from the audience,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.390
and I can repeat it.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.558
So thank you very, very much.

00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:41.998
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.220
AUDIENCE: So I'm going to ask
the question that you probably

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.450
get asked a lot.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.540
We're all sitting here in
a comfortable, safe place.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.310
What can we do?

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.340
SASHA CHANOFF: What can you do?

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.630
Well, there's a lot of
different things you can do.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.980
I mean, one is that
RefugePoint, this organization,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.620
we actually have our country
director, Jacob from Kenya,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.520
who oversees our
programs in Kenya.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.120
And we have staff across Africa.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.620
He's here.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.020
He's sitting right over there.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.660
But we have our
offices-- Jacob, welcome.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.630
We have our offices in
Cambridge, really close to you,

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.450
in Central Square, and in Kenya.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.180
And we have staff
right now across Africa

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.971
and starting to expand
across the world.

00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:24.970
I mean, so one really
simple thing I think we've

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.324
talked a little about
potentially at the end of this

00:19:27.324 --> 00:19:29.490
year, if there are opportunities
to give, to support

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.630
what RefugePoint does.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.910
That's, I think, in terms of
if you want to contribute.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.810
I think another thing is that
there's a lot of misinformation

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.420
right now about refugees
out there in the world.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.790
I just wrote an Op Ed for
"Th Boston Globe," talking

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.170
about the US refugee
process and how

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.720
it's the most secure process
out of any immigration channel

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.360
of people coming to the US.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.610
But I think if you want
to spread some information

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:02.620
on the internet or through
your own personal connections

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.750
about refugees and who
they are-- this morning,

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.500
I saw a great article
in "The New York

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.620
Times" about Syrian refugees
coming to the US and about,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.470
actually, conservative
Republicans who

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.920
are reaching out to help them.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.580
But regardless of your
political orientation,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.750
when we come face-to-face.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.505
with these issues,
they're human issues.

00:20:22.505 --> 00:20:24.380
And that's a thing that
I think people really

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.730
overlook is that when
you come face-to-face.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.850
with this, it's about
you and somebody else.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.300
And in that face-to-face
interaction,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.350
it feels to me like some sort
of moral responsibility to act.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.420
But we don't all
have the opportunity

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.410
to come face-to-face
with people all the time.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.490
So I think spreading
information, supporting us.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.460
There are a lot of other
good organizations.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.980
If people are really interested
in engaging and actually

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.050
volunteering, there
are some organizations

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.220
here in the Boston area
and also around the world

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.760
that help refugees
to integrate here.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.990
And I got my start
working here in Boston

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.950
with the Jewish
Vocational Service

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.940
and the International
Rescue Committee, which

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.060
were two organizations at
that time in the 90s who

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.480
were actually helping
refugees to integrate here.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.184
I hope that answers--

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.600
AUDIENCE: I have one specific
question just for this venue

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.642
and for this setting.

00:21:11.642 --> 00:21:13.600
And again, not take
anything away from you just

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.490
said, which I think we should
all do, which is help out,

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.200
both with money and with effort.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.410
But one thing is what we
actually do technically

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.830
for a living, which is
communication technology,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.810
access, the fact that the
whole world, everybody can now

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.380
communicate with everybody.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.730
Is there some way we
could focus some of that

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.130
to help out the problem?

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.760
Can you think of some ways
that we could use either

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.260
being able to
provide connectivity

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.530
or access to
information or access

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.996
to distance education
over technology?

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.370
Is there some
angle that we could

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.320
use to take some of the
stuff that Google is good at

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.903
and that we're all
good at technically

00:21:46.903 --> 00:21:48.870
to help the problem?

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.240
SASHA CHANOFF: It's
a great question.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.900
So there are some new online,
more global learning platforms.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.160
There's a new effort
based out of Rwanda,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.150
which started with an
organization and university

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.470
called Kepler that is trying
to democratize education

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.600
for refugees.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.430
And it's higher
education for people who

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.070
are ready to study in college.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.110
But that is certainly an
area of greatest need.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.850
So President Obama,
in a couple of weeks,

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.230
is going to hold a refugee
summit in New York.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.850
And at that refugee
summit, he's going to say,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.050
among others, three things.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.410
He's going to say that we
have to increase resettlement

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.699
globally so that more
refugees have opportunities

00:22:34.699 --> 00:22:36.990
to get to countries where
they can rebuild their lives.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.860
We have to expand education
opportunities because UNICEF

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.650
just came out with a report that
was mentioned in "The New York

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.060
Times" this morning
and yesterday how

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.950
there are 50
million kids who are

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.880
impacted by war and conflict.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.560
And so many of these children
have their educations

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.880
cut short for years and years.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:02.120
And that is morally impossible
as a global community

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.060
to look at and not
do something about.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.230
And President Obama is
going to talk about the need

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.590
to increase work and
self-reliance opportunities

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.050
for a million refugees
around the world.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.020
So what can you
do here at Google?

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.080
I need to think more about that.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.060
But I think if there are ways
to connect in with education

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.380
opportunities that
are online, I think

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.670
if there are ways to
connect in with employment

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.370
and self-reliance opportunities
that are more online.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.320
There are a lot of very
innovative, tech-oriented

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.430
solutions that are starting to
emerge that are intersecting

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.460
with refugees.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.790
There is one right now that is
about helping refugee children.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.940
And it's creating an
online platform to do that

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.750
and to make sure that there are
appropriate services available.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.771
So I will get back with
maybe more specifics.

00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:50.270
But I think that's
a great question.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.710
And it's something
that, I think,

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.820
the whole Google community is
so interestingly and perhaps

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.810
uniquely poised to do
something to engage.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.860
I know Google also has engaged
in different ways with refugees

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.665
over the past year
or two as well.

00:24:05.665 --> 00:24:06.540
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:06.940
SASHA CHANOFF: Thanks.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.700
AUDIENCE: We'll continue
the conversation.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.533
SASHA CHANOFF: Yeah.

00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:14.745
Any other questions?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.540
Well, great.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.000
I will just say a couple
of closing words then.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.580
First, thank you again, Jeff.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.420
And thank you, Google,
for having me here.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.420
It has been such a
pleasure to be here.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:33.150
And I guess my primary thought,
again, that I wanted to share

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.850
is that we are facing an
unprecedented global crisis

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.610
with 65 million people
who have been displaced

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.732
by violence and conflict.

00:24:40.732 --> 00:24:42.440
That's more than at
any point since we've

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.120
been counting in history.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.710
And the average amount of
time that someone is a refugee

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.200
is close to 20 years.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.880
So we need to think,
as a community,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.620
about new ways of doing
things, not just giving

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.050
aid year after year
after year because

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.000
the international community has
run out of money to do that.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.980
So how do we get
people to places

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.880
where they don't
need aid anymore

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.900
and they can become
contributors?

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.750
And we have such
a moral obligation

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.990
to do this for all those
people that are in danger,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.780
but in particular,
for children who

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.660
are impacted by these
crises and just need

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.530
to have normal lives
with access to education

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.260
and other opportunities.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.200
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.100
It's a real pleasure.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.817
And thank you.

00:25:25.817 --> 00:25:29.610
[APPLAUSE]
