00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
 

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.330
In this problem, Romeo and
Juliet are to meet up for a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.530
date, where Romeo arrives at
time x and Juliet at time y,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.490
where x and y are independent
exponential random variables,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.750
with parameters lambda.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.340
And we're interested in knowing
the difference between

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.450
the two times of arrivals,
we'll call it z,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.940
written as x minus y.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.180
And we'll like to know what
the distribution of z is,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.400
expressed by the probability
density function, f of z.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.430
Now, we'll do so by using the
so-called convolution formula

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220
that we learn in the lecture.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.130
Recall that if we have a random
variable w that is the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.160
sum of two independent random
variables, x plus y, now, if

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.400
that's the case, we can write
the probability [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.320
function, fw, [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.360
as the following integration--

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:01.130
negative infinity to infinity
fx little x times f of y w

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.540
minus x, integrated over x.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.800
And to use this expression to
calculate f of z, we need to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.490
do a bit more work.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.170
Notice w is expressed as a sum
of two random variables,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.120
whereas z is expressed as the
subtraction of y from x.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.370
But that's fairly easy to fix.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.090
Now, we can write z.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.820
Instead of a subtraction, write
it as addition of x plus

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.250
negative y.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.120
So in the expression of the
convolution formula, we'll

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.225
simply replace y by negative
y, as it will

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:38.640
show on the next slide.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.600
Using the convolution formula,
we can write f of z little z

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.090
as the integration of f of x
little x and f of negative y z

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.210
minus x dx.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.900
Now, we will use the fact that
f of negative y, evaluated z

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.450
minus x, is simply equal to f
of y evaluated at x minus z.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.530
To see why this is true, let's
consider, let's say, a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.759
discreet random variable, y.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.830
And now, the probability that
negative y is equal to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.440
negative 1 is simply the same
as probability that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.400
y is equal to 1.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.930
And the same is true for
probability density functions.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.590
With this fact in mind, we can
further write equality as the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.900
integration of x times
f of y x minus z dx.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.120
We're now ready to compute.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.310
We'll first look at the case
where z is less than 0.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.490
On the right, I'm writing out
the distribution of an

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.710
exponential random variable
with a parameter lambda.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.520
In this case, using the
integration above, we could

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.130
write it as 0 to infinity,
lambda e to the negative

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.130
lambda x times lambda e to the
negative lambda x minus z dx.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.530
Now, the reason we chose a
region to integrate from 0 to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.880
positive infinity is because
anywhere else, as we can

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.910
verify from the expression of
fx right here, that the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.300
product of fx times
fy here is 0.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.560
Follow this through.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.080
We'll pull out the constant.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.430
Lambda e to the lambda z, the
integral from 0 to infinity,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.660
lambda e to the negative
2 lambda x dx.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.610
This will give us lambda e to
the lambda z minus 1/2 e to

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.970
the negative 2 lambda x infinity
minus this expression

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.900
value at 0.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.250
And this will give us lamdba
over 2 e to the lambda z.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.640
So now, we have an expression
for f of z evaluated at little

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.660
z when little z is
less than 0.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.870
Now that have the distribution
of f of z when z is less than

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.340
0, we'd like to know what
happens when z is greater or

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.620
equal to 0.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.820
In principle, we can go through
the same procedure of

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.450
integration and calculate
that value.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.250
But it turns out, there's
something much simpler.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.470
z is the difference between x
and y, at negative z, simply

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.850
the difference between
y and x.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.710
Now, x and y are independent and
identically distributed.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.270
And therefore, x minus
y has the same

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.760
distribution as y minus x.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.350
So that tells us z and negative
z have the same

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.300
distribution.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.650
What that means is, is the
distribution of z now must be

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.610
symmetric around 0.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.530
In other words, if we know that
the shape of f of z below

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.910
0 is something like that, then
the shape of it above 0 must

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.190
be symmetric.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.570
So here's the origin.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.750
For example, if we were to
evaluate f of z at 1, well,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.140
this will be equal to the value
of f of z at negative 1.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.880
So this will equal to f
of z at negative 1.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.490
Well, with this information in
mind, we know that in general,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.310
f of z little z is equal to
f of z negative little z.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.750
So what this allows us to do is
to get all the information

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.290
for z less than 0 and generalize
it to the case

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.250
where z is greater
or equal to 0.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.150
In particular, by the symmetry
here, we can write, for the

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.960
case z greater or equal to 0,
as lambda over 2 e to the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.410
negative lambda z.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.350
So the negative sign comes
from the fact that the

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.650
distribution of f of z is
symmetric around 0.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.080
And simply, we can go back
to the expression

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.370
here to get the value.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.220
And all in all, this implies
that f of z little z is equal

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.780
to lambda over 2 e to
the negative lambda

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.820
absolute value of z.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.070
This completes our problem.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.150
