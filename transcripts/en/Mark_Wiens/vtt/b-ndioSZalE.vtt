00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.216
- Hey everyone, I hope you're having

00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:02.990
an amazing day or night,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.655
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:06.778
and I have a very special dinner tonight.

00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:08.991
I'm eating at Suhring,
which is one of the best

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:11.430
fine dining restaurants in Bangkok.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.756
It's a Michelin star restaurant,

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:15.992
they are at the top of the list of

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:19.133
Asia's 50 Best Restaurants and they serve

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.643
contemporary, modern German food.

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.073
And so it has a very interesting story,

00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:26.305
it's a restaurant that
I've really been looking

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:28.239
forward to eating at and so I'm very happy

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.961
to try it, I'm also gonna
be eating with Ying,

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.067
thanks for holding the light, by the way.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.928
I'm excited for dinner tonight.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:37.428
(light music)

00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:42.451
You walk into the
entrance of the restaurant

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.582
and it's a house, it's
a compound, but it's a

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.840
beautiful compound, the tropical gardens.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.341
We're gonna step inside.

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:49.363
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:50.196
- Mister Mark!

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.029
How are you tonight?

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:53.034
- [Mark] Thank you, very
good, thank you very much.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.110
- [Hostess] Welcome to Suhring.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.515
- Hey Mark, nice to meet you, how are you?

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.038
Let me show you to the table.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:00.121
- Thank you.

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.999
We're gonna be sitting in
the kitchen area, right?

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:02.832
- Yes.

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:03.665
- Awesome!

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.832
Okay, to the kitchen room.

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:09.771
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:10.669
- Yeah.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.502
- [Mark] Hi!

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:12.714
- Oh hey, how are you doing?

00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:14.495
- [Mark] Very good, thank you very much.

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:15.328
Thank you.

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:18.653
- I look the same, but not him.

00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:20.502
- [Mark] Nice to meet you!

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:21.335
- How are you doing?

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:22.168
Good.

00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:23.001
Nice to have you tonight.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.386
(laughing)

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:26.303
- Yeah different, okay.

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:28.099
- [Mark] Yes.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.043
(laughing)

00:01:29.043 --> 00:01:30.251
(mumbling)

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.172
They are twins.

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:33.055
I mean, not only are they brothers

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:37.276
that are passionate about food,
but they're actually twins.

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:40.643
So that's amazing, they are
both extremely friendly.

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:44.273
And they opened Suhring
to really feature some of

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:47.847
their home flavors, German flavors.

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:50.681
Modern, contemporary German
restaurant using lots of

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.264
local and seasonal ingredients.

00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:57.442
Ah, oh yeah.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:01:59.904
Really, really crisp.

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:01.447
So we're gonna be having the 12 course,

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:03.288
well, maybe even more
than that, tasting menu.

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:06.732
Plus some extra dishes,
special dishes from the twins.

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:09.883
First chapter is just the one-biters.

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:14.106
- [Waiter] We will start the
experience with Storhappen.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:14.939
- [Mark] Whoa.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.323
- We are using the sturgeon,
coming from the canal

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:19.196
in the north of Thailand.

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:21.302
It's smoked with apple wood and served

00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:23.002
together with our own
(speaks foreign language),

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.374
which is the German for bread.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:27.592
- [Mark] Just that tiny,
just the micro detail,

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:31.259
that tiny, tiny little
herb or green on top.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:37.558
Wow.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:40.427
Mmm.

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:44.531
It's so smokey.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.614
It just like,

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:49.138
it's like smokey and creamy and

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:52.371
has a little tiny

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.057
almost horseradish kind of taste to it

00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:58.909
and then that caviar
is just so silky smooth

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.242
and just so perfectly briny.

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:05.398
- All right, yeah?

00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:06.231
- Awesome

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:07.889
- So, we are originally from Berlin.

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.205
- [Mark] Okay, the next
bite is the Berliner

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:10.809
This is the next one-biter.

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.642
It's a little like a savory donut.

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:24.336
The mushroominess of that.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:27.737
And so delicate with the umami mushroom,

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:29.847
with that truffle on the inside,

00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:31.766
kinda creamy on the inside.

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:33.539
- Now we're serving you a Huehnchen Salat

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:34.372
as we call it, yeah.

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:37.140
Which is actually a very
ordinary kind of chicken salad.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.187
The chicken leg is cooked first and after

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.052
it is marinated we add
a bit of mushroom also.

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:45.307
Then we have a little
bit of mayonnaise also.

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:47.557
(mumbling)

00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:52.032
(light music)

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.383
Then it's ready to serve,

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:57.769
it's going right to your table now.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.602
- [Mark] Cool.

00:03:58.602 --> 00:03:59.435
- [Chef] Are you ready?

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:00.413
- [Mark] I'm ready.

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:02.222
- Perfect, let's do this.

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:03.222
- Thank you.

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:07.779
And that one is going
straight to our table.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:11.898
- All right, so this is our
variation of a chicken salad.

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:14.651
[Mark] The twins' version
of a chicken salad.

00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.547
It's like a little driplet.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:19.235
But that's made, actually,
from romaine lettuce

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.601
as well as the dressing, so
that's the old combination.

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:24.351
It's like a little water balloon.

00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:30.987
Whoa.

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:34.394
That is an explosion in your mouth!

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:37.094
And all the components of
a chicken salad are there

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.936
in your mouth, just in
different form and shape.

00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:41.954
Ying was too curious, she had to press it.

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:44.204
(laughing)

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.953
- Mmm.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.199
- Next course is salmon, cured salmon.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.911
And then it's in a little egg basket there

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:52.786
some salmon roe, and again,

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.703
just the tiny, tiny pieces of dill.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:04.125
Oh man.

00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.016
Mmm.

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:07.849
Mmm.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.905
That just purely melts in your mouth.

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:11.517
I gotta taste it with that
cucumber water, I almost forgot.

00:05:11.517 --> 00:05:14.017
(light music)

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:17.295
- So we are from Berlin, of course,

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:19.423
of these street food,
actually, in Berlin, yeah.

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:21.039
It's a pork sausage
actually, which is served

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.864
with ketchup and curry powder.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.628
Currywurst you have to drink with the beer

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.626
and then you will fall in love, of course.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.398
It comes actually from
the time after the war

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:30.831
when British soldiers came to Berlin

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.749
and they bring the
curry powder from India,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.677
and then one lady mixed it up with ketchup

00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:36.899
and then the currywurst.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:38.394
We also give you a small beer

00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:40.527
and usually you get it with french fries

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:41.849
so you're having a little bit of potato,

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.077
dried potato with a
little bit of curry powder

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:44.999
and a little salt.

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.188
- [Mark] We're only getting
through chapter one right now,

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:50.688
which is just the appetizers,
just the small bites.

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:54.518
But part of the reason why Suhring is so,

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:56.376
such an amazing restaurant is because

00:05:56.376 --> 00:05:57.682
it's so much fun, you know?

00:05:57.682 --> 00:06:01.257
And you can tell that Thomas and Mathias

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:03.423
are having so much fun with what they do.

00:06:03.423 --> 00:06:05.090
They're so creative,

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.371
and it's just happy.

00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:12.704
Wow, yeah, that has an
amazing bouncy texture to it.

00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:19.685
Oh, that's delicious.

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:22.226
Mmm, the ketchup.

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:24.893
- [Ying] One, two, three, chink!

00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:27.799
- Oh!

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:30.049
That's more like a lemon...

00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:34.123
That's like a lemony freshness.

00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:34.956
Mmm.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:38.516
- But they say Entenleber in German.

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.472
It's a duck beaver,
little foie gras, which we

00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:44.225
marinate together with
riesling Spatlese, so that

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:45.469
would be this one here.

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.470
Riesling Spatlese, it's a
off-dry kind of riesling.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.495
This one coming from the
Mosel, so not too sweet,

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.735
just to cut right through the foie gras.

00:06:53.735 --> 00:06:56.130
On top, you have a
little bit of lemon gel.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.758
Underneath is the (speaks
foreign language),

00:06:57.758 --> 00:06:59.585
which is a kind of German sweet toast,

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:03.835
and then in the glass you
will find the wine again.

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:13.859
- Oh, almost forgot.

00:07:18.408 --> 00:07:19.241
Wow!

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080
That is just

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.235
like one of the creamiest
things you could ever taste.

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:27.831
It's so creamy.

00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.343
You taste the foie gras,
but then it has this like

00:07:30.343 --> 00:07:32.343
citrusy component to it.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.687
- How's everything so far?

00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:36.520
- [Mark] Very good.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.761
- Appetizer we're having a frankfurter

00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:40.913
grune sobe, which is an
herb sauce originated

00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:42.534
from the original Frankfurt,
like the name says.

00:07:42.534 --> 00:07:44.048
It's very traditionally
done with seven different

00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.335
kinds of herbs, and it's
mixed with sour cream,

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:47.833
a little bit of mustard, salt, and pepper.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.058
- [Mark] I don't even know how they piled

00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:52.396
those up on there, that is construction.

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:54.651
And then it's the
frankfurter with some kind

00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:56.885
of a cream cheese and then the side is

00:07:56.885 --> 00:08:00.218
a piece of eel which is smoked in house.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:07.133
Oh, that is just, like,
purely kinda squishy.

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:12.926
Mmm.

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:17.597
The eel has kind of a jelly texture to it.

00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:21.104
Mmm.

00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:25.271
Mashed potato and eel,
just on a whole next level.

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:28.373
- Next is called (speaks
foreign language),

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:30.539
which in German means bread time.

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.272
We also call it (speaks foreign language),

00:08:32.272 --> 00:08:34.147
which means dinner bread.

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:34.980
Because.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.000
For the bread we are also using our own

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.101
sourdough fermentation to bake the breads,

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:41.943
and the fermentation is
over three years old.

00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:44.126
It's actually only rice flour and water,

00:08:44.126 --> 00:08:45.547
so we let it ferment outside

00:08:45.547 --> 00:08:46.984
and then so it's three years old

00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:49.641
we feed it every day with
some flour and some water

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:52.058
and use it to bake the bread.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.988
- It almost has like a hint
of an onion taste to it.

00:08:56.988 --> 00:09:00.669
I cannot resist that
pork lard pate, though.

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.986
Oh, the pate is underneath there.

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:04.604
Okay, awesome.

00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:06.333
Oh, look at that.

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:08.500
A nice thick, thick layer.

00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:16.005
Oh, that spread is insane!

00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.965
Oh, I love that black peppercorn in there.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:28.465
That pate, though.

00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:33.532
- This one you have what we call

00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:36.172
the (speaks foreign language),
it's a very famous dish

00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:39.609
from the city of Leipzig that
was created in the 1800s.

00:09:39.609 --> 00:09:42.204
- There's asparagus and crayfish
and then some morel powder.

00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:45.586
When it's served, he sprinkled on

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.126
some of the crayfish butter.

00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:48.843
What a gorgeous bouquet.

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:50.203
I'll just go in.

00:09:50.203 --> 00:09:51.977
There are lots of ingredients in this.

00:09:51.977 --> 00:09:52.984
Lots of different herbs.

00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:53.817
I love that.

00:09:53.817 --> 00:09:56.160
Oh, you can see kind of, is that a carrot?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.164
I want to get, I think
I'm gonna try to get

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:00.273
a little bit of everything.

00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:02.034
Aww, there's the crayfish.

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:05.221
There's little herbs,
there's all sorts of things.

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:09.804
Cut the crayfish in half, oh
you can see the beautiful,

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:14.832
you can just see how creamy that is.

00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:17.465
Get some of the asparagus too, of course.

00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:20.715
The tip of the asparagus, the crayfish,

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:25.298
and then some of those
herbs and the morel.

00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:29.297
Oh, that crayfish.

00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:31.120
So creamy and muscular.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.067
Lightly sweet, kind of
almost like a dressing,

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.813
which is the crayfish butter.

00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:39.764
- Let me show you the main
course before the main course.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.612
(laughing)

00:10:41.612 --> 00:10:43.362
So you have the duck.

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:47.740
It's a Hungarian duck which
we age for seven days,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.924
then it's roasted on the, the whole duck.

00:10:49.924 --> 00:10:52.575
- So aromatic, the entire heads of garlic.

00:10:52.575 --> 00:10:55.900
You can see the thyme,
which is like charred,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.997
it smells incredible, we're
going to be eating this later.

00:10:57.997 --> 00:11:01.581
Next course is Seabream,
which is cooked German style.

00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:03.660
There's lemon and there's parsley,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.985
which is German preparation.

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.565
Dollop of caviar on
top and then that sauce

00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:11.667
with some little squares
of potato in there.

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.334
The juiciness of it.

00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:17.780
This one is impressive.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.721
I think it's kind of
foamy from that sauce.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.304
It almost has like a mushroom taste to it.

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:26.273
And then that fish is just so juicy.

00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:27.478
You've got that little bit of caviar

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:30.395
to give it that punch of saltiness.

00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:34.679
- Doing now a German pasta.

00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:36.473
- [Mark] All right.

00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:39.217
- We call it Spatzle, which
comes from Salz for Germany,

00:11:39.217 --> 00:11:44.217
traditionally, and the Spatzle
dough or the pasta dough

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:48.861
looks like that, so you see
it's very sticky, actually.

00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:51.802
In order to do a pasta out of it,

00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:56.564
you put it on a cutting
board and then we scrape it

00:11:56.564 --> 00:12:01.064
into boiling water, so you
get the shape of the pasta.

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:08.978
Frying some mushrooms.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.145
Champignon mushrooms, locally sourced.

00:12:14.063 --> 00:12:15.479
Put them in ice.

00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:17.400
So you cook them a little bit

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.126
so it looks like that now, see?

00:12:19.126 --> 00:12:22.626
It's all hand-shaped, so different shapes.

00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:33.580
Then we put cheese, so we
also have cheese from Germany,

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.497
from Salz, which goes on like this.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.440
Little bit more sauce with it.

00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:48.683
(light music)

00:12:48.683 --> 00:12:51.359
It's eaten with crispy onion,
so we will put it there

00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:53.901
and we have some truffle from Australia,

00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:55.984
which is the final touch.

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:04.945
- Rushing back for the pasta and then

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:06.903
just sprinkled it with
that beautiful truffle.

00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:09.217
That smells unbelievably good.

00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:12.494
Okay, and I will kind of
do the swirling method.

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:13.889
Oh yeah, but the noodles are kind of short

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:15.543
because they're hand cut so
it's kinda hard to swirl,

00:13:15.543 --> 00:13:18.710
you kinda gotta stab at the same time.

00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:25.955
Oh, man.

00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:26.788
Yeah.

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:28.872
It's so rich.

00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:33.062
And that sauce is so
fragrant with that truffle

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.843
and that mushroominess.

00:13:34.843 --> 00:13:38.498
And then the noodles, they
have this wonderful gummy,

00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:39.915
yet firm texture.

00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:42.678
The freshness shines.

00:13:47.968 --> 00:13:48.801
So rich.

00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:50.633
So good.

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:52.084
- You can choose your own knife.

00:13:52.084 --> 00:13:56.011
Here I have a collaboration
between Nesmuk and Suhring.

00:13:56.011 --> 00:13:57.219
Ready?

00:13:57.219 --> 00:13:59.763
Right then, so basically all the blades

00:13:59.763 --> 00:14:02.364
are made in Germany, so
they're technically the same.

00:14:02.364 --> 00:14:04.955
But, the handles come
from different continents.

00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:06.018
- [Mark] I'll go with this one.

00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:09.435
This looks like a perfect one right here.

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:11.705
That's a really nice touch.

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:14.392
Being able to choose your own duck knife.

00:14:14.392 --> 00:14:16.550
- [Waiter] We have a
Blaufrankisch from Burgenland

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.933
in Austria, so it Austria,

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:21.350
the same region as for the arranged wine.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.635
- Of the main courses, this
is the Hungarian duck breast.

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:32.718
So juicy and so beautiful,
it's so pink in color,

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:37.384
served with assorted broccoli,
there's broccoli flower

00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:39.544
and then also a duck confit deep fried.

00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:42.889
Oh wow, and just look at that skin.

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:44.184
Oh man.

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:45.500
Oh, that knife.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.307
It's just balanced to perfection.

00:14:48.307 --> 00:14:51.224
That knife just slides like butter.

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.059
Dip in that sauce a little bit.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:57.559
So pink, it's almost like ham.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.130
Completely infused with smoke.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.818
That's a duck breast, but it's so juicy,

00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:09.985
I mean it has the flavor of dark meat.

00:15:11.053 --> 00:15:13.553
(light music)

00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:17.678
You just wanna savor it.

00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.011
Broccoli flower.

00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:26.043
Deep fried little duck.

00:15:29.086 --> 00:15:30.689
Mmm.

00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:33.027
One more main course, oh.

00:15:33.027 --> 00:15:34.486
Awesome.

00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:37.158
We've already been
eating for like 3 hours.

00:15:37.158 --> 00:15:40.573
But they brought their signature,

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:43.957
which is German roast pork knuckle.

00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:45.109
And this.

00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:46.449
That aroma.

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:48.229
- You have to eat the whole one, right?

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:49.460
- We're gonna try, we're gonna try.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.710
(laughing)

00:15:53.793 --> 00:15:54.626
Yes.

00:15:56.907 --> 00:15:59.157
(laughing)

00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.918
- Big one for Ying and small one for Mark.

00:16:04.918 --> 00:16:08.251
- [Mark] Oh, you can hear the crackling.

00:16:10.207 --> 00:16:11.954
So do you eat this every day?

00:16:11.954 --> 00:16:13.207
- [Chef] I do!

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:15.317
(laughing)

00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:16.567
I do, actually!

00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:19.967
- This is a dream come true,

00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:23.745
a crispy fried pork leg at midnight!

00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:25.328
The haminess of it.

00:16:28.081 --> 00:16:29.241
What?

00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:30.948
Can you hear the, yeah,
you gotta kinda pick it up

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:31.925
with your finger, right?

00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:33.441
Because it's so crispy.

00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:35.645
It's almost uncuttable with a knife.

00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:38.228
Yeah, let me just pick that up.

00:16:42.448 --> 00:16:43.281
Whoa.

00:16:49.303 --> 00:16:51.994
They're just like two
completely different sections.

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:55.189
The meat is tender, and
actually parts of the meat

00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:56.628
are not that fatty.

00:16:56.628 --> 00:17:00.378
But just embedded with
smoke and just tender.

00:17:01.905 --> 00:17:04.196
And then you've got that
ridiculously crunchy,

00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:08.779
creamy, almost gummy, like
sticky from fattiness, skin.

00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.989
Ooh.

00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:14.299
- [Ying] Very good.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:16.070
- [Mark] The dessert expert.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.873
- It's very good.

00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:20.123
- [Mark] Okay, take a bite.

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:24.555
- It's a mix of berries and then, yeah,

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:26.940
it's beautiful, it just looks so,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.690
it looks like a patch of berries.

00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:36.228
It's so berry-fresh and
just the creaminess.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:39.954
- This is the last dessert, basically,

00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:42.182
so you're having a peach
in different textures,

00:17:42.182 --> 00:17:45.304
which we serve on top with a little bit

00:17:45.304 --> 00:17:47.137
of cheese as a mousse.

00:17:53.576 --> 00:17:57.409
- Oh, the peach just
melts into the ice cream.

00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:00.554
- [Waiter] A little, Sussigkeitenbox.

00:18:00.554 --> 00:18:03.669
The passion fruit, here you go.

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:04.605
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:05.604
- [Waiter] Would you like something else?

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:08.750
This is what they call Eierlikor.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.607
So that is a recipe that the grandmother

00:18:10.607 --> 00:18:12.940
gave to the mother of the twins,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.237
and then the mother gave
it to the twins directly.

00:18:15.237 --> 00:18:18.287
So older recipes are handwritten here.

00:18:18.287 --> 00:18:22.319
And if we turn the pages, you can find,

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:24.402
just here, the Eierlikor.

00:18:26.296 --> 00:18:29.308
So that's the exact recipe for
what you are drinking here.

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:32.558
- [Mark] White chocolate passion fruit.

00:18:33.554 --> 00:18:36.818
(light music)

00:18:36.818 --> 00:18:38.294
Oh yeah.

00:18:38.294 --> 00:18:40.727
You crunch through the white chocolate

00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:42.281
and then you've got that waxiness

00:18:42.281 --> 00:18:45.269
and then you've got almost
like a passion fruit jam

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:46.224
on the inside.

00:18:46.224 --> 00:18:48.454
A recipe from their grandmother,

00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:51.204
it's a digestive type of egg nog.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.098
Mmm.

00:18:57.098 --> 00:18:58.752
It's really thick.

00:18:58.752 --> 00:19:01.316
And then a little bit
sticky, but you just taste

00:19:01.316 --> 00:19:03.470
that slight burn of the alcohol

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.213
just at the back of your throat.

00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:06.581
And then it's sweet.

00:19:06.581 --> 00:19:09.164
It's very creamy and very rich.

00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:13.724
Mmm.

00:19:13.724 --> 00:19:15.165
What an incredible way to end this

00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.915
modern German Suhring experience.

00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:21.268
We finished with dinner.

00:19:21.268 --> 00:19:24.052
That was an incredible meal.

00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:26.506
And after we finished, we hung out

00:19:26.506 --> 00:19:28.402
and laughed and joked for a little while

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:31.209
with Thomas and Mathias
Suhring and the staff.

00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:34.752
They're all really friendly,
but the Suhring twins,

00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:38.335
they are as creative
and as fun and playful

00:19:39.403 --> 00:19:40.873
as their food is.

00:19:40.873 --> 00:19:44.582
I mean it comes, the food
is a direct representation

00:19:44.582 --> 00:19:46.237
of their personalities.

00:19:46.237 --> 00:19:49.608
They're so much fun, they're
so nice, they're so friendly.

00:19:49.608 --> 00:19:52.482
And they love to joke around, they're just

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.236
great, great chefs.

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:58.486
And again, just, it's
incredibly unique that twins,

00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:01.939
I mean not only brothers, but twins

00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:04.472
have the same passion, they love to cook.

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:06.016
They love to serve.

00:20:06.016 --> 00:20:07.994
Yeah, they're just awesome and that was

00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:09.825
an incredible experience.

00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:12.304
So I want to say a huge
thank you to the twins

00:20:12.304 --> 00:20:14.239
and all the staff.

00:20:14.239 --> 00:20:17.847
We were taken such good care
of, that was a huge meal,

00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:21.092
you should see my stomach
bulging right now.

00:20:21.092 --> 00:20:24.310
It is, what time is it right now?

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.643
Almost one a.m..

00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:29.006
We dined for like five hours.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.760
Ying is almost half asleep.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.593
(laughing)

00:20:32.593 --> 00:20:36.138
Partly from the food,
partly because it's so late.

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:37.496
Thank you very much for
