00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:02.856
- [Sal] Which of the
following is the graph of a

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:07.344
function F such that F
of X is equal to zero

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:12.312
for exactly two values of X
between negative five and five?

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:15.192
So let's see, in all
of them they've plotted

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:18.716
where X equals negative
five and X equals five.

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.002
F of X needs to be equal
to zero for two values of X

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.544
between negative five and five.

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:27.503
So this function right over
here, this never gets to zero.

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:29.861
In order to get to zero
it needs to intersect,

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.821
it needs to touch on the
x-axis at some point.

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.224
This one stays positive the whole time.

00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:38.254
Notice all the values for
this X right over here,

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:40.472
F of X, it's a positive value.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:42.422
For this value of X right over here,

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:46.060
F of X is a positive value,
so rule that one out.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.017
This one equals zero here, here and here.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:55.138
So it equals zero three
times, for exactly three

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.017
values of X between
negative five and five,

00:00:58.017 --> 00:00:59.828
but they said exactly two values,

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:01.651
so we'll rule that one out.

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.598
This one is right at
positive five, you could say

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.145
it's at one value if we
include the two boundary points

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:10.504
right over here, but we said exactly two.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.408
This is kind of the other
side of it where we're

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:15.984
only at negative five,
we need to be two times,

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:17.586
so rule that one out.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:21.649
This one, we intersect the
x-axis exactly two times.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.563
F of X is equal to zero
for this value of X,

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.570
F of X is equal to zero and F
of X is zero right over there.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.847
So that's...

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:30.600
This is our choice.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.202
Another thing that could
have looked like that,

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:33.804
maybe if it looked something like that.

00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:36.288
We would've had F of X
equal zero there and there.

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:39.149
Either way, we pick D.
