Hi, I'm James.

00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:03.833
Welcome to this course on Canvas 2D.

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:07.266
We're going to teach you how to use the canvas API using memes with my

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.836
co-instructor, Cameron.

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:09.772
Cameron.

00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:10.425
Cameron.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:11.508
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:12.229
Hey, sorry.

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.674
Am I late?

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:14.496
My bad.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.539
&gt;&gt; So much for coordinating what we're going to wear beforehand.

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.774
Let's fix that.

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.961
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:22.220
Doge.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.220
I like it.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.700
&gt;&gt; So, what's with the box?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.840
&gt;&gt; Well, you said we'd be painting with canvas, right?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.320
So, I brought some acrylics, I brought some brushes, I brought a palette.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.250
&gt;&gt; Hold, hold up.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm going to give you an A for

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.440
effort, but I actually was talking about the canvas API inside the browser.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.500
So, we're going to do all our painting with JavaScript code.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh, that kind of Canvas.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.210
My bad.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.990
Well, anyways, the Canvas is a powerful API which you can use to edit,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.550
resize and otherwise change images, animations, and interactions.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.470
&gt;&gt; Though we won't cover it any detail,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.630
you can even use the Canvas to create games that run inside the browser.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.310
Okay.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.020
Let's get started.
