00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.417
- [Voiceover] So what I
want to talk about now

00:00:01.417 --> 00:00:04.155
are shapes of distributions
and different words

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.431
we might use to describe those shapes.

00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:08.149
So right over here, let's see,

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.658
we're talking about Matt's Cafe,

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:11.237
and we have different age buckets,

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.874
so this is a histogram here.

00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:14.255
In each bucket, it tells us the number

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:16.856
of guests that are in that age bucket.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:18.632
So we don't have any guests that are

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:20.861
under the age of 20, we
have a reasonable number

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.009
between 20 and 30, we have a lot of guests

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.645
at 30, in that bucket between 30 and 40,

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.479
reasonable number between 40 and 50,

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:28.235
and then as we get older,

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.217
we have fewer and fewer guests.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.821
So just when you look
at something like this,

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:32.680
a distribution like this,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.981
something might pop out at you.

00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:35.525
It kind of looks like
if you were to imagine

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.486
this were an armadillo, this would be

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:39.065
the body of the armadillo,

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:40.122
and then what we see to the right

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:42.571
kind of looks like the
tail of the armadillo.

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.679
We actually use those types of words

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.467
to describe distributions.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.940
So this distribution right over here,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.787
it looks like it has a tail to the right.

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:51.064
It doesn't have a tail to the left.

00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.862
In fact, we have no one
under the age of 20.

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:55.684
But here when we have a few people

00:00:55.684 --> 00:00:58.451
between 60 and 70, even
fewer between 70 and 80,

00:00:58.451 --> 00:00:59.590
even fewer between 80 and 90,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.891
and you know, if it just kind of keeps

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:02.794
going like this, this is a tail

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:03.932
and it's on the right side,

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:05.779
it's a right-tailed distribution.

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:07.468
So I'd call this
distribution right-tailed.

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:09.441
I'm using Khan Academy exercises

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.531
because it's a good way
to see a lot of examples,

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:13.690
and frankly, you should too because it'll

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.409
help you test your knowledge.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.302
But it's not left-tailed.

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:18.567
Left-tailed we would see
a tail going like that.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.748
Frankly, if you're
left-tailed and right-tailed,

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.700
you're likely to be
approximately symmetrical.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.173
Remember symmetry, you
define a line of symmetry,

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:28.817
and one type of symmetry
is one where both sides

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.558
of that line of symmetry are mirror images

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:31.347
of each other.

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:32.950
You could fold over the line of symmetry,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.847
and they'll roughly meet.

00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:36.508
This one does not meet
that because if you were

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:38.784
to say, hey, maybe there's
a line of symmetry here

00:01:38.784 --> 00:01:40.234
and you tried to fold this over,

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:41.187
it wouldn't match up,

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:43.149
the two sides would not match up.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.946
So I feel good saying
that it is right-tailed.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:47.090
So let's see.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.087
Retirement of age of each guest.

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:52.014
Well yeah, these names aren't that great,

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:53.313
but let's actually see
what they're saying.

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.554
They're saying by age, they're telling us

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:57.722
the number of guests.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.739
So this is the number of guests

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.171
at Logan Assisted Living.

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.642
So we have a lot of guests that are

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:05.279
between 60 and 70 years old,

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.079
or reasonable that are between 50 and 60,

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.309
or 70 or 80, and this distribution

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.501
actually looks pretty symmetrical.

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.220
If I were to draw a line of symmetry

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.285
right down here, right
at around an age of,

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:17.829
you know, the line would be right at

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.262
an age of 65, I guess you could say

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:22.038
all this is a bucket for ages 60 to 70,

00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:23.175
then you could flip it over

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.668
and it looks pretty symmetrical.

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:27.338
Not exactly, this bucket
doesn't quite match

00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:28.940
up to this one, but it's pretty close.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.635
These roughly match each other.

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:32.807
These roughly match each other.

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:33.991
So I feel good about saying

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.264
it is approximately symmetrical.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.205
Now just to know what
these other words mean,

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:41.885
skewed to the left, or
skewed to the right.

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:43.893
These actually have fairly
technical definitions

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:46.297
when you get further in statistics,

00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:51.091
but a, I guess, easier to
process version of them

00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:56.091
are when you're left tailed,

00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:58.847
you also tend to be skewed to the left,

00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:00.112
and when you are right-tailed,

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.271
you tend to be skewed to the right.

00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:04.790
Another way to think
about skewed to the left

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.113
is that your mean is to the left

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:09.132
of your median and mode.

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.292
That might not make any sense to you.

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:11.483
You might just want to off of the tail.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.967
If you're left-tailed,
you're probably left skewed.

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.493
If you're right-tailed,
you're probably right skewed.

00:03:16.493 --> 00:03:17.269
So let's keep going.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:19.866
Let's see another example.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.948
So this interesting.

00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:23.506
We're not given a histogram here.

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:24.680
We're not given a bar graph.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.479
We're given a box and whiskers plot,

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.524
which is really just telling us

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:28.848
the different quartiles.

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:30.647
So just to remind ourselves,

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:33.480
this tells us the minimum of our data set,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.884
the bottom of our range,

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:36.661
so the minimum value in our data set.

00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:39.621
We have at least one 11,

00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.281
and then the maximum
value of our data set,

00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:43.986
we have at least one 25.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.006
Now this line right
over here is the median.

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:48.746
The middle number is 21.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.903
Then the box defines the middle 50%

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:53.679
of our numbers.

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:58.108
So it's kind of the meat
of our distribution.

00:03:58.108 --> 00:03:59.654
So if we were to try to visualize

00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:01.586
what this would look like
as maybe a histogram,

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:02.991
and we don't know for
sure because we might

00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:05.218
have a whole bunch of 11s,

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:06.945
not so much that it skews this,

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.605
but we could have more than one.

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:10.764
But a distribution that this could match

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:12.313
up with is something that looks like

00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:14.249
having a tail down here,

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.524
and then you kind of bump up here.

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:16.889
This is the meat of the distribution.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.967
It kind of looks something like that,

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.499
and I can't draw because I'm doing this

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.666
on the exercises right now.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.125
But for something like that,

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:25.611
well something like that would have a tail

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.430
to the left, would have
a tail to the left.

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:33.221
It's range goes fairly low to the left,

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.858
but it might not have
a lot of value there.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.402
If I had more values on the left side,

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:38.201
this box would have been shifted over

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.056
because a larger
percentage would have been

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.122
on the left, so to speak.

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:46.258
So this one, I feel
pretty good about saying

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:48.313
this is skewed to the left.

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:49.579
It's definitely not symmetrical.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:52.459
If it was symmetrical, the median would be

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.947
pretty close to the center,

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:56.513
the box would be pretty centered.

00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:57.707
It's not skewed to the right.

00:04:57.707 --> 00:04:58.707
If it was skewed to the right,

00:04:58.707 --> 00:05:00.227
you would have a tail to the right,

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:01.934
you would have, this whisker would likely

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.030
be much, much, much longer.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.085
And we're done.
