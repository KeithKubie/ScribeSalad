00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the Library

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.920
of Congress and to this event,
Latvian Literature on the Verge.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.220
I am Grant Harris.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.910
I am head of this reading room,
the European reading room,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.370
and the Library is very pleased
to sponsor this event today

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.340
in partnership with
the Embassy of Latvia.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.570
I'm very pleased to have here
today a good friend of the library,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.450
that would be Ambassador Razans

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.540
and in a few minutes I will
have him speak up here as well

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.260
but I have a few more
things to say before that.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.340
Very briefly let me say that
the Library of Congress is proud

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.160
of its more than 20,000 printed
volumes from or about Latvia.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.280
We believe this is one of the
largest collections outside

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.270
of Latvia of Latvian materials.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.560
In addition to printed volumes we
have lots of music, lots of maps,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.420
photographs and other materials.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.450
Each year we're getting
over 250 volumes from Latvia

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.890
of the best research materials
and the best literature.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.540
I'm also proud that we have in the
library works by all of the writers

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.190
who will be up here on
the podium today as well

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.130
as by the moderator
today, Andrew Springer.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.760
We have his work as well.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.980
Regina Frackowiak is our
reference specialist for Latvia.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.170
She has compiled a
handout that tells us

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.370
about the library's
Latvian collections.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.320
It includes Regina's
contact information.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.370
If you want a copy of
that, Regina has them.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.090
There's Regina, and the handout
is in blue so if you want

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.990
that you have her contact
information.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.360
If you want to use the collections
she can help you with that.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.400
You're always welcome,
anyone is welcome

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.360
to come use the library's
collections.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.270
We hope you enjoy the Latvian
readings and discussion today.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.520
We're really pleased to have these
fine poets and authors with us.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.910
We hope you'll come back.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.120
I think all of you have
made this event possible,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.050
especially the Latvian
Embassy and the Ambassador.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.770
So I would now like to invite

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.440
to the podium His Excellency,
Ambassador Razans.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.820
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Andris Razans:
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.210
it's very honored to be
among all of you today here.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.880
It's one of the most magnificent
libraries in the world,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.070
perhaps the most significant these
days and it's always great pleasure

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.970
and enjoyment to return, to the
library, not only to read the books

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.790
but to make very good
friends and people

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.110
that are working here at library.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.000
It's a very special day
for me and for our Embassy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.510
It's first time, as far as I know,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.320
that we have put together
an event totally dedicated

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.330
to Latvian contemporary
literature, poetry, prose,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.150
translation into English.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.940
And I'm very glad that we put
this event together and I hope

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.010
that we'll have nice and
very enjoyable afternoon,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.200
or beginning of the afternoon.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.790
My very warm thanks and all
my gratitude really goes

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.240 position:56%
to Mr. Grant Harris and his
wonderful staff here at the library,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.240
European division at the
library, with whom we have managed

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.600 position:56%
to develop very close and good ties.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.480
And I think these ties
definitely are here to stay

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.650
and they will not evaporate.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.950
I'm very pleased for that.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.410
As Ambassador of Latvia to
United States I would like to say

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:45.350
that usually relations between
countries, between two countries,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.290
between United States and Latvia,
are translated or interpreted

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.080
by means of interests,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.490
either political interests
or economical interests.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.990
But I should say that these
interests, they are not eternal.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.610
Political economic interest
are changing from time to time

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.210
as we know that, because
of our very tense,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.770
sometimes very difficult history
of our century, but culture,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.200
literature, art, these
are the values that stay

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.240
and without these values, without
culture, without literature,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.280
I think the relations between
states, between everything as well

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.270
between U.S. and Latvia,
would be less, less meaningful

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.630
and I'm very pleased really that
we put together today's reading

00:05:50.630 --> 00:06:00.260
of Latvian literature here
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:09.010
Relations between both states very
soon will enter its centenary.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.510 position:56%
It's not only about Latvia as
independent state in two year's time

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.710
as 100 years old country
but our relations

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.400
with United States
a little bit later

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.880
as well will enter its
very, very serious age.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.790
Quantity, it's important.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:38.140 position:56%
It's really something we can really
focus, we can really try to analyze.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:46.510
And I should say that these
relations have been mostly very

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.500
dynamic, very active.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.270
Of course we have had as well more
silent periods in our relations

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.850
because of well-known dramas in
our history, the Soviet occupation,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.780
but U.S. never recognized
the Baltic Occupation.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:13.950
The Baltic States always were
legally in very existence

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.430
and I think that creates a
very, very positive background

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.180
for what we are doing in
our relations these days.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.850 position:56%
And when we discuss literature,
when we bring more singers, artists,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.020 position:56%
writers to United States, and I hope
that more American writers, singers

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.110
and artists will be visiting
Latvia as well, I think we send

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:50.170
up a different message about Latvia
as a state, especially these days

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.080
when Europe, we are
so much preoccupied

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.560
with geopolitical tensions, with
changing security environment

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.650
in Europe, I think it
would be wrong to assume

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.160
that that's the only thing
people on earth are living

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.970
and breathing and thinking of.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.080
We still are living in
decent democratic societies,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.090
vibrant societies where it's
bright and good future respectfully

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:26.050
of changes in Europe these days
and I'm glad we are able to,

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.550
by means of literature, by means of
art, to send this message of Latvia

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:44.550 position:56%
as European, state as progressive
and state that has very good future.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.450
And here I'd like to end.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:54.360
And once more thank you
so much Harris and Library

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.990
of Congress for the event.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:05.650
And I would like to
invite the moderator

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.800 position:56%
and your singer to open the reading.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.100
Thanks so much.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.030
&gt;&gt; Andrew Springer: Thanks
to the Library of Congress

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.080
and to the staff here
for setting this up.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.770
It's a great privilege and
a great pleasure to be here.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.220
And thank you to Mr. Ambassador
as well for those remarks.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:37.290
But I have a literary foundation,
that's what I'm doing here.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.920
And for me everyone that's

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.940
on the program today is
a kind of Ambassador.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.700
I got to know Latvian culture not
through the politics initially

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.880
but through the literature
and that was also great joy

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.400
and great privilege.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.030
So the three people that are
assembled here on this program

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.750 position:56%
to me really stand out as tremendous
representatives of the culture

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.040
which is something very special.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.770
And perhaps most of you, many
of you, already know this,

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.580
it's my great joy to discover
this last year and mostly

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.820
through the people that
will be on the stage today.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.860 position:56%
The first performer is Nora Ikstena.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.040
And like all of the performers,
all of the writers here today,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.460
they are much more than a writer.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.940 position:56%
They have such varied roles and have
had such diverse and exciting lives

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.810
but are also very representative
of the very best

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.720
of Latvian literature today.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.330
Nora has written poetry,
novels, short stories.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.970
She has studied many
different things.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.720
She was here in the
U.S. for a while.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.730
She studied, I believe, at
Columbia University for a while.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.940
She has studied 20th century
literature and philosophy.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.740
She's worked in different
capacities.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.310
She's a cofounder of the Latvian
Literature Center and has been

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.910
at times a Seminole figure in
Latvia, not only on the culture

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.120
but even in the way on
the political landscape.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.220
But today we're here to enjoy some
of her latest novel, Mother's Milk,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.030
and I think we'll just
ask her up here

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.260
and she can introduce that to you.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.060
Nora.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:26.390
[ Applause ]

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.230
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: So
ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.030
I think it's a historical
moment for all of us

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.600
and you can't believe how pleased
and how honored we all feel

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.740
to be here in Library of Congress.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.080
Today me and my translator,
Margita Gailitis,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.020 position:56%
will be reading a short excerpt
from my latest novel, Mother's Milk.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:56.760
And it's kind of symbolical
because it's historical novel

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.530
from a very personal point of view.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:08.500
And this is a first book in series
of books 20th century published

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:16.770
in Latvia and very unique way
how to tell about history.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:22.980
These are 12 Latvian well known
contemporary prose writers

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.920
who are writing books each about
one period of Latvian history.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:37.120 position:56%
My book is about time period between
1969 to 1989 which is actually very,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.750
very hard period for Soviet
Latvia, stigmatic times.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:51.350
But I tried to tell that story
from a very personal point of view

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.480
from mother and daughter.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.270
There are two narrators in first
person, mother and daughter,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.960
and that's how they are
living through this hard time.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:13.990
And Mother's Milk, it's not only
Mother's Milk, it's homelands milk

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.220
which we all lost in those times.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:25.950 position:56%
And so also for giving life for
Latvian language here in the Library

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.220
of Congress I will read a
small excerpt in Latvian

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.750
and then Margita will read
the rest excerpt in English.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:14:43.260
[ Foreign language ]

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:48.590
And now you will hear the
rest of the excerpt in English

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.890
by my translator Margita Gailitis.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.230
Thank you.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.120
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: I'm
very happy to be here

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.730
and to read Nora's book in English.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:07.210 position:56%
Let me say that the book in a couple
of months has become a bestseller

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.680
in Latvia and we've just had
wonderful news from London,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.370
England that a publisher
has accepted the book.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:20.230
So we will be again in the world.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:27.770
I'll read the segment, a big
length here, segment in English.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.500
Sometimes after school I headed
for my mother's ambulatory center

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.760
and waited for her workday to end.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.600
There was a narrow long
corridor there in which

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.600
on benches tightly squished
together always sat many women.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.890
Some of them were pregnant.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.590
My mother tried to devolve as much
time as was necessary to each one

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:00.310
and often meant that she finished
work very late in the evening.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.260
After school I used to prepare some
food and we would then head home

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.910
and my mother would eat more
out of politeness than hunger.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.590
Exhausted she often still
dressed fell into bed.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:19.990
I took off her shoes or boots and
covered her with a heavy blanket.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.640
The door to the round
belly stove was opened.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.490
I had to wait for the wood
to burn down to cinders

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.280
to be able to close the damper.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.720
The dog and I thought ourselves
settled not far from the mouth

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.030
of the stove, the coals
smolder then glowed.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.800
They looked like a sparkly
carpet which would take us

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.380
to some far away happy land
where there would be no longing

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.910
or separation, where
life and joy would reign.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.190
Where no one would take away
but would only give love.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:59.300
Every couple of evenings or so I'd
bake two potatoes in the coals,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.480
one for me, one for the dog.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.910
When they were ready we
shared this tasty treat

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.470
and life didn't seem
so bad after all.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.270
The New Year school
break was drawing near

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.450 position:56%
and my release was also drawing near
because I could head for the city

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:24.300
for two weeks to my grandmamma
and my grand-step-papa.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.160 position:56%
My half year of exile with my mother
had finished and at school a couple

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.130
of schoolmates had
become friendly with me.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:39.000 position:56%
After the passing of the year report
cards we got ready for a carnival.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.810
Totally uncharacteristically my
mother got involved in this event.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.800
In a pail she mixed up petite
colors, tied up the corner

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.590
of a sheet and soaked
them in the pail.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:58.680
She folded the sheet in half, sewed
up the sides, cut out the whole

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:05.110
at the top and the result was an
unusual and splendid sack dress.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.760
Then she sat me down near
the kitchen window in light

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.420
and having pulled out some things

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.590
from her lean cosmetics bag
she began to make me up.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.430
We rarely touched each other

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.330
yet now mother's fingers
slid over my forehead.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.630
She powdered down my
nose and cheeks,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:29.560
touched up my eyelids,
chin and eyebrows.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.940
Her hands and her clothes
smelled of medicine,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.380
which was my mother's
usual fragrance in which

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.880
through her touch awakened in me a
love that I had not known before,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.910
love for my mother,
a daughter's love.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.350
When she handed me the mirror,
back at me stared a child's face

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.610
that was divided into
the good and the evil.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.350
The grimace on one
side was frightening

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.230
but the black furrow drawn
from my nose to my chin

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.810
and with a yet blacker eyebrow.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.350
The other side was a thick
covered with old powder,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.580
bright with a happy mouth,
its corners drawn up.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.250
Who am I, I asked my mother?

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.610
A split personality, she replied.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.830
In school getting lost in a crowd
of elves, rabbits, squirrels,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:30.000
Snow Whites and gingerbread,
I felt myself admired.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.270
I wasn't awarded the prize for
the best costume, of course,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.420
but I felt that the split
personality had won.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.040
Joyfully I ran home
in the late evening.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.150
Maybe my mother was waiting
with a dinner prepared for me.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.960
Already tomorrow I would
be leaving for two weeks.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.920
I wanted to put my arms around my
mother's neck and kiss her again

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.550
and again in thanks for
this beautiful carnival.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:03.170
For the split personality which
she conjured up like a good fairy,

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.230
like a miracle worker, my
dear, different mother.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:14.280
At the house outside a
frenzied dog was waiting for me.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.800
Inside it was dark and cold.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:26.170
Momma hadn't fired up the round
bellied stove nor the cook stove,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.700
although today was
a holiday for her.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.870
Having entered the corridor
I heard odd wheezes.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.830
My momma was lying in her bed,
beside her discarded a bottle

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.460
of alcohol and some
sort of white tablets.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.190
Around her neck was
an old man's necktie

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.240
with which she had tried
to strangle herself.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.160
I rushed to her, tore
off that damn necktie

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.670
and brought her up to sit up.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.990
She choked and coughed until
she vomited up a liquid

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.570
in which the small
white tablets floated.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.800
All night I brewed tea for her.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.760
She obeyed and drank it
and now and then vomited.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.460
When she fell asleep I
crawled in beside her.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.980
I slept almost not breathing, my
head pressed to her left breast

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.920
to hear if her heart was still
beating and hadn't stopped.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.770
Thank you.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:35.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Springer: If Razans is our
Ambassador then translators are the

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.220
embassy, I would say.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.890
There is no cultural interchange
without the work of translators.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.680
And so the translator we just
heard was Margita Gailitis,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.880
also iconic in her own way

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.980
in Latvian literature a
tremendous range of styles.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.850
She's translated many
great Latvian poets

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.270
and fiction writers and others.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:06.680
And also an iconic story of
hardship maybe deep in the tunnel

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.880
of the previous century and quite
some redemption, I would say,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.150
with her magnificent body of work.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.010
She will also be assisting
with translation

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.840 position:56%
for our next literary talent up here

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.500
who is Liana Langa,
primarily a poet.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:31.180 position:56%
And if I might say, a true poet, a
true Latvian poet, just magnificent.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.110
And Liana also had some
experience studying in New York.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.590
She was at the new school for
a while and many other things.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.830
She's worked in film aesthetic.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.870
I believe she currently
runs a publishing house

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.240
in Latvia, Apostrofs.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.710
And was involved with the Latvian
Literature Center and so on.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.540
She has a book, which
I admire greatly,

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.590
called The Deadly Nighshade, which
has been translated into English

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.920
and quite a lot of
other poetry besides.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.370
So why don't we invite
Liana Langa up here

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.800 position:56%
and Margita Gailitis also back here.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.180
Thank you.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.090
&gt;&gt; Liana Langa: Good
afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:19.280
Before we start our reading let
me express my gratefulness to each

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.890
and everybody who has
made this night come true,

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.930
especially Mr. Razans, Mr. Harris,

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:31.910
to start all this fantastic
institution and everybody

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:38.370
who has come and paid respect to
Latvian literature and authors.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.600
And I will be reading a
little bit from my cycle

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.150
of poems whose title is
Those Who Don't Belong.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:54.100
A couple of poems in Latvian and
then little cycle will be read

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.300
by my dear translator
Margita Gailitis.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:04.830
Those Who Don't Belong,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:25:35.120
[ Foreign language ]

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:42.140
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: "The
Ones Who Don't Belong",

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.410
I awake suddenly from deep sleep.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.970
In the forest undergrowth
my shadow roams.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.020
Hundred thousand year greedy
muzzles suck moisture clinging

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.660
to a vessel of mist.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.650
Like a large, wet, green tea
leaf the sky swims into my eyes.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.070
The narrows don't frighten it.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:09.440
Starships nestle close
to me, the wreck.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.050
I don't know what the
beasts will tell me,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.480
don't understand why
my visitors are silent.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.950
I was your key, the new wine

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.670
that the devout locked
away in dark barrels.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.280
In a trance the dark
breathes, dissolves,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.250
casts in my features other
reflections of other bygones,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:38.170
other lives and then inside
a large part of me dies.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.250
I suddenly wake from a
deep sleep as the grains

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.630
of your hail erode my face.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:56.100
Someone in an owl's voice says:
God, but your hand is empty, empty.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:28:54.750
[ Foreign language ]

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.970
&gt;&gt; Margita Gailitis: I'll
read several verses now,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.990
now that you have had the
opportunity to hear our ancient,

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.640
Indo-European source Latvian books.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:17.510
Leaves frost bitten by a harsh
night rustle between my fingers.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.490 position:56%
[inaudible] A white paintball thrown

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:26.730
against a cheap granite slab
summons an echo of your voice.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.450
Here, fired by the passion
and politics of lovers,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.350
all transactions take place
more swiftly than in a market.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.800
An echo is like the
sound of salmons spawning

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.890
as they rub their dull
backs, just more audible.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.780
But one pigeon cock
thrusts a beak straight

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.910
into the heart of another
pigeon cock.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:56.010
The grave digger, Valerie,
keeper Valerie smells of vodka

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:00.630
and paranormal life
under piles of leaves.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:07.050 position:56%
Although she grasps many with purple
hands, it seems more likely she does

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.940
so with yellow chalk lips.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.310
In the sky the clouds
congeal into lumps just

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.770
like synthetic pillows
in cheap hotels.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.200
They hung in chapel key
jumbles in the Baltic named

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.280 position:56%
like the mummy bag of a wealthy man.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.300
Now we'll [inaudible]
among the process.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.220
The mother land where one's
face is shown by the pointing

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:42.400
of a shallow symbol, a handful
of sand and a sob time takes

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.710
down to the bone of bones and
rejects whatever was once kissed

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.850
and offered up to the angels.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.640
At the foot black handle
cedars now have fossilized.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.480
Breathing accidentally
one grows vigilant.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.240
Suddenly too tangible
is non-existence

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.000 position:56%
which can be so easily approximated.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.070 position:56%
My mouth is full of soft pebbles
when I try to remind you of my name.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:22.970
You say to me, summer, stop,
too much of glowing flesh,

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:28.760
classy grey light on the eyelids,
the odor of decaying mans.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:35.890
Maybe a movie [inaudible]
perhaps through the Antarctic.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.530
Don't be angry.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:45.410 position:56%
Escape heals but only for a space of
time just until the blood blackens

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.350
and the [inaudible] layer
the hourglass [inaudible].

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.710
Afterward, as you know,
the sand returns

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.600
in us so we may slave further.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.810
Who shall say where we should head.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:06.330
The streets shall lead further
than our own seemingly sure steps.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.000
The grainy asphalt drugs will
weed into themselves the code

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.030
of arms of cast down glances.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.580
The tense life of a
walker's muscles.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.740
The Indian ink shed by shadows.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.550
A city will wallow fever,

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.220
it will beg its inhabitants
to call a doctor.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.840
In the hair lock shed around
the hairdressers high heels,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.170
recently bought a baby
carriage glances

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.810
which meets suddenly
and swell like an edema.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.230
This is where time lives.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.830
Who will instruct us
where we should head?

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.340
On a sultry afternoon in the market

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.360
from butchers counter a snow
white elbow accidentally knocks

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.840
down an hourglass.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.920
Fine glass slivers slash
summer's juicy veins.

Now you see how new rhymes are born.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.510
A shortsighted uncle holds
the world by a thread.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.750
Five year old [inaudible]
conducts a pollen ballet,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:17.310
Ukraine feed their crane
links, ore becomes ore.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.970
Come, life's winter.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.550
In a corner window ledge
a mouse bites on a bit

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.930
of bacon larger than the city snow.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.950 position:56%
Lemon yellow sunbeam bagpipes tangle

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:36.220 position:56%
in the tree branches sounding
funeral marches, racing clouds stick

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.180
to the sky like cookie crumbs
through a sick man's mouth.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.670
The crunchy bumps of love
slack crawl over a letter

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.620
that possibly was written by God.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.580
Over the A4 format page
forces ideal handwriting,

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.820
chains of words without memory.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.250
They slowly are warmed

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.400
by the letters readers are
captive, his body warmth.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.630
He involved follows
letter by letter,

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.210
understanding not a word
just listening and listening

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.590
to the soundless rattle of chains.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.350
Come, life's winter when the
thick mouse will flutter away

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:23.100
from homing glances and the cold
will be such that words will freeze

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:28.850
into icicles and all the sweet
demanding mulch shall grow larger

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.220
for the word mama.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.630
And the letter will be
blizzard into infinite snow

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:40.450 position:56%
and will sleet exploded and naked in
the midst of the sands cave as part

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:44.140
of the handwriting, as the
letters from which days and nights

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.770
and the big mouse bake
in our [inaudible].

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:51.290
Then winter will come
to save the captive

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:56.540
and one more time awkwardly
gurgling will create food,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:03.830
smoke from crematory and chimneys,
plows, motors, tenderness, alcohol,

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:08.530
dirty streets, a puppy
breath, Christmas time colors,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:36:11.000
this year's first ice snow crust.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:37:10.690
[ Foreign language ]

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:18.700
The ones who don't belong
love non-belongers love more.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.620
Awkward city noise wake
sleeping monsters in beds

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.010
of threatening sighs in which
through barred windows dark

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.820
and light flows in
tingling beastly passion.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:38.910
But the ones who don't belong love
the non-belongers, love them war.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:45.020
In the corner behind the four door
wardrobe forgetfulness hums turning

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:50.340
over greasy pages in the family
calendar with 50 recipes,

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:56.240
descriptions of insects,
photos, down to earth advice,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.640
perhaps how not to
die before ones time.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:07.410
The ones who don't belong
love non-belongers, love more.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.490
Forgetfulness has a
werewolf's confidence.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.180
With a dark blue tongue it examines

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.490
and examines once more
all the facts,

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.110
especially numbered
year 1,960 on the cover

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:27.100

Those who don't belong love
non-belongers love more.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:39.810
In late autumn they love when slimy
leaves cover front windows of cars,

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.770
muddy floors, raising
of sweat on palms.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:48.040
They love by the sound that
grates the nerves of silence.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.460 position:56%
They love with the plumb [inaudible]

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.810
which when pressed forcefully
draws squiggly features

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.400
on the [inaudible] golden skin.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.750
Hello werewolf.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:05.100
The holidays behind the barred
windows do not belong to us.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.870
Keep your pain to yourself.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.940
Those who don't belong love more.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.240
Thank you.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:19.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your
attention and now the last one.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.990
It's about an elderly
lady she sees a dream.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:29.010
Naturally I wrote this
poem in dream.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.520
I just had to wake
up and write it down.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:41:34.830
[ Foreign language ]

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:43.280
She sleeps.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.170
She'll soon be 67.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:51.770
She dreams that he has come
unshaven in a white shirt reserved,

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.970
slightly tanned and smiling.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:58.890
He'll ask if she's still
separated from him.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.190
She sleeps.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.130
She'll soon be 67.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.120
She dreams.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.670
But as it is in a dream the
spaces curve and another.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.390
He in a white shirt is on the
other side of the room but she is

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:19.390
in the same room yet in another,
in a room in a rose hued dress,

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.400
very young, at a time before
they met, before they wed.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.820
As it is in a dream there
are many rooms and times

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.540
and right beside her there
is another shape, nude.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.840
She sleeps.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.210
She'll soon be 67.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:40.580
She dreams that she has
suddenly split in two.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.820
One is a rose colored
dress like snail shell,

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:49.330
the other the snail
which has slithered out.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:54.650 position:56%
She sees herself nude in a dream
mirror but how to put the space back

00:42:54.650 --> 00:43:00.620
in space and herself in the
dress while he reserved, unshaven

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:06.610
and smiling asks how he
managed to get into her dream.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.630
He asks why she doesn't
put on her dress.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.140
Is she not cold?

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.480
And if he and she, could
they not try once more?

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.020
Then like a stroke of lightening
she recalls in her dream

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:27.510
that he's been dead now
for more than 20 years.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.730
A black butterfly gigantic
like a plane,

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.800
flapping wings can
suck out sweet nectar.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.670
The small [inaudible]
doll can manage on her own

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.540
to step out of the big one.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.840
She sleeps.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.770
She'll soon be 67.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.730
She dreams.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.030
Thank you.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.590
&gt;&gt; Andrew Springer: A
starship settled near me.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.730
I believe that was one of the lines
from the poems that we just heard.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.490
It's a little bit how I feel today.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:09.230
It's a wonderful glimpse into a
very exotic language and culture.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.740
Latvian language comes
from originally deep

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.170
in our prehistory of
world civilization.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:20.360
And for those of you who
can't enjoy the Latvian

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.130
in original we do have these
wonderful translations.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:27.920
And so I can encourage you to check

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.450
out Liana Langa's English language
collection, the Deadly Nightshades,

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:37.360
which is available from Guernica
Editions in Canada, I believe.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:44.060
It's just impossible to get the
residences of poems such as these

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.330 position:56%
in a first reading and the
residences I believe are the closest

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:53.290
to that poor spirit of true
Latvian history and culture

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.600
of anything I've heard,
just beautiful.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:03.910 position:56%
I'll make one more plug before I
introduce our final reader for today

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:08.230
because my initiation into
Latvian literature, if you will,

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.870 position:56%
comes from these people and it is my
great privilege to publish several

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.820
of them in Trafika Europe.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.270
And this is a project which
is dedicated to principles

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.750
that people here are
also dedicated to,

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:26.360
that we need just a little more
openness in European cultures,

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.150 position:56%
we need a little more mutual regard,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.910
we need a little more
working together and a sense

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.310
of belonging together
more in Europe.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.550
And that's not difficult
to do but it does take

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.040
that little bit extra effort

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.480
and I think all European
cultures can benefit from doing

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.970
that a little bit, especially in
this time that we're navigating.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:56.090
So Trafika in Europe is a project
which is dedicated to that.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:00.500
We did a focus on Latvian
literature last year

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.690
and we are also just coming
out with our first volume.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.520
It's a collection called
Central New European Literature.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.710
Latvians are represented in here
more than any other culture.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.260
So if you feel like picking up
a copy of this today that's fine

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:21.090
or you can certainly find it via
our website, trafikaEurope.org.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.730
And it's been quite a journey
and quite an education for us

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.030
at Trafika Europe to learn

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:31.790
about these incredible European
cultures and really incredible.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:36.540
It's really just an embarrassment
of riches, such mine of gems.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.170
So I encourage you to check
out other neighboring cultures

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.440 position:56%
and other European cultures as well.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:49.120
Our last reader for
today is Juris Kronbergs

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.720
and in his own way
also iconic of some

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.930
of the best Latvian
literature and culture can be.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:02.460
Among his many studies in
Stockholm where he was born

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:09.360
into a Latvian family in Sweden
as well as in Cambridge in England

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.800
where he studied two
topics, which I also teach

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.430
at university it turns out,
theory of literary translation

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.960
and 20th century poets,
two topics very dear to me.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.030
He has made an illustrious career
not only as a writer but also

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.790
as a representative for writers.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:30.520
He was president of the
Latvian Branch of Pen,

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.820
the Writer's Organization.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:36.680
He has won all sorts of awards
for his many collections of poetry

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.970
and his many translations,
too numerous to mention,

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:47.840
awards with words like star
and order in the title as well

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.100
as a career as a diplomate.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.150
He was the culture for Latvia for
about 10 years from the beginning

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.690
of the 90's thereabouts
to the early 2000's,

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:01.080
at the time Latvia
joined the European Union.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.620
So he has witnessed firsthand
a lot of this current history

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:10.090
of what we're living through
and he's reflected it in books

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.020
of great sensitivity and depth.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.910
His poetry has been
translated into more

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:17.250
than 20 languages including
some very exotic ones

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.960
like Welsh and Catalan and so on.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.650
And his collection Wolf One-Eye
has been translated into English

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.880
in full, which I believe
he'll be reading from today.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.140
And this one also awarded
best Latvian Poetry

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.480
or something like this.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.700
It's a great pleasure to
welcome Juris Kronbergs.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.710
&gt;&gt; Juris Kronbergs:
Thank you, Andrew,

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:46.580
for those kind words, partly true.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:57.100 position:56%
And thank you, the organizers, for
this event, library and the embassy.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:03.340
I will read mainly in
English but two poems

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.810
in both Latvian and English.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.280
I will read five poems from
the collection Wolf One-Eye

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.930
and some other poems.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:20.940
So first five poems
from Wolf One-Eye.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:27.390
Out of the Blue, it was day
but he saw the moon as well

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.910
and a black beetle on a slack
rope that jigged over his field

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:39.950 position:56%
of vision, past cloud drifts of fog,
past blistered wisps of nothing.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:44.360
Not a word had been said
about an aquarium in the head.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:50.590
The slow and resolute curtain of
opaque and gritty water rose up.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:57.200 position:56%
Darkness fell on all roads, all
meadows and forests and [inaudible],

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:03.360
pastures and rivers, creek
beds and hillsides and snows.

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.730
In the aquarium black beetles
darted to and fro, seeds of death

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:13.760
that stalked their
beginning, the end.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.510
The same poem in Latvian.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:51:09.120
[ Foreign language ]

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.980
Wolf One-Eye has changed,
he felt he had changed.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.620
He wasn't sure how.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.830
He could hardly remember
how it all once had been.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.390
Someone had slammed
a door in his face.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:30.090 position:56%
Perhaps it was a shock of the impact
that changed his opinion of change

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:33.940
and as a consequence
or else as well.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.200
Snow did not fall down.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.720
It snowed up.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.930
In spring the birds brought
trees to the budding leaves,

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:45.840
nothing was as it had been.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.450
And the cloud cried
when raindrops left

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.040
and the sky cried when
the cloud left.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.090
Wolf One-Eye cried because he knew,

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.280
he knew nothing save what he had
lost because he looked on the world

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.430
with eyes of unknowing
and one of them was mute.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.560
Wolf One-Eye believes that from
this moment there will be only half

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.480
of everything.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:20.070 position:56%
I will long for, half long, the life
before, half-life, to see everything

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.640
as it really is, half seen.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.680
Each sentence will be
split in half, each leaf

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.980
or every stream will stop halfway.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.010
But then a half will
just be half of a half,

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:38.280
half of which half
I only half of them.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:44.310
All will be half days, half hours,
half baked, half done, halfhearted,

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:49.060
halfway understood, half empty
not half full, half drunk.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:54.600
As I enter a newly built
house, half will collapse

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.150
but half will remain, which half?

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.540
The better half or the worst.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.030
As I prowl the forest,
half will disappear.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:07.920
Every other spurts, every other
mushroom, every other passion.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.330
As I go across the
rapids how will I know

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:14.090
on which half of the bridge to go?

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.950
And the rapids beneath me
will be gone, half gone.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:29.000
Wolf One-Eye in spring,
leafing trees drip from the sky.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.640
Black and white keys
sprout from the earth.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:38.100
A piano that no one plays,
still the tones sound.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.400
They are wings.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.920
They fly away.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.090
But Wolf One-Eye think in
a blink, how will I sound

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.180
when spring plays me like a piano?

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:53.480
White but not only white,
black but not only black.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:59.510
The sky drifts from the trees
and earth sprouts from the keys.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:09.550 position:56%
Out of the dark, it was night but
he saw the sun as well in a cold way

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.890
where nothing danced
beyond his field

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:16.380
of vision a long transparent
wisps of nothing.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.790
And someone mentioned the
aquarium that had been in his head.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:25.540
The gritty water had left
drifting shrouds of mist.

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:31.390
A slow dawning of old roads, old
meadows and forests and snows,

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:37.040
pastures and rivers or weed
beds and hillsides and snows.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.560
Spots of dark danced
with shrouds of mist.

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:47.330
The fruits of life had found
their ending, the beginning.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:57.080
So on the next poem I wrote

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.750
when Russia began the
occupation of Crimea.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.520
Spurred on by my colleagues,
Liana Langa

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.070
and the Swedish writer,
[foreign name] Erickson.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.890
It was published in
Sweden's largest newspaper,

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:17.140 position:56%
Dagens Nyheter, in Swedish language.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:26.350
Gravitational Waves, these days
when I think about Ukraine I think

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:32.560
of the allied conference of
Yalta at the end of World War II.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.530
I think of my own life as well.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:42.610
Like in 1975 when I wanted to do
something that might sound ordinary

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:47.750
but was for me quite exceptional,
to visit for the first time

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:53.440
in my life a home on my mother's
side and her daughter, my cousin.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.360
They lived in my father's
childhood home

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.650
in the Latvian harbor
town of [foreign name].

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:05.470 position:56%
In those days the Soviet Naval Base
of [foreign name] was a closed city.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.520
That's how it all began in 1939.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.350
To safeguard its interests
Russia only needed access

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.210
to the Latvian [foreign language]
harbor on the Baltic Sea.

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.440
That's why we met somewhere
else, in the capital, Riga,

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.830
the only place unrestricted
for a tourist like me.

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:29.800
An added computation
was citizenship.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.610
I was a citizen of nowhere.

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:34.310
I was stateless.

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:38.680
My only document was a
Swedish alien's passport issued

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.080
by the Swedish imitation agency.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.660
A note in tiny handwriting
declared that the holder

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.930
of this document is a citizen

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:53.420
of the Soviet Union though
I was born 1946 in Sweden.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.940
When I applied for a Visa at the
Soviet Embassy in Stockholm I had

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:03.170
to list all my relatives and
their places of residence.

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.570
My only measure of protection

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:09.570
for the trip was membership
of PEN International.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:13.310
And so I came to meet my relatives,

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:19.200
the only ones who had survived the
war, the deportations, in Riga.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.190
At customs a translation
of [foreign name] published

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:25.880
in Sweden had been confiscated.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:30.180
The officer's scrupulously
examined my suitcase.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.050
He spoke only Russian.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.600
The staff on the night train from
Poland to Riga, I was not allowed

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.760
to travel by day, spoke
only Russian.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:44.010
All street signs in Riga
were only in Russian.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:50.060
And now a few days ago there
were plaques in the city center

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:55.960
with the slogan Russian from
[foreign name] to Riga in the hands

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.140
of those for whom Russian state
controlled television is the sole

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.430
decoder of our times.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:09.980
You know, these are probably the
reasons these days when I think

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:15.670
of Ukraine I also think back
to my first visit to Riga

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:21.230
to the conference of Yalta and
why I feel, like many others,

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:24.240
in the land where I wasn't born,

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:29.420
unease about the future,
unease about today.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:42.320
The next poem is in memory
of the great Swedish poet,

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:48.480
Nobel Prize Laureate and a great
friend of Latvian literature

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:55.600
and a very good friend to
some of our best poets.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:01.110
And the title, TT Sees Me,

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:09.170
is because Transtromer has
an autobiographical book

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.970
that is called Memory Sees Me.

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:24.530 position:56%
TT Sees Me, death is a truth barrier
and a parachute to jump from life.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:29.050
I want to take its
measure, to tailor its suits

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:32.610
but it never comes while I wait.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:37.920
Down a slope I see stones
flying, stones rolling right

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.090
through a glass house but
each pane stays intact.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:49.580
For the glass is comprised of
tones and words, TT someone says,

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:59.050
that's a Swedish news agency.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:02.260
No, I say, I mean the
poet, Tomas Transtromer.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.520
His words are news flashes that
pierce the wall of oblivion

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.430
and there as wall after wall
opens up, slowly straight

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:14.770
into space the great enigma.

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.510
Same poem in Latvian.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:01:09.330
[ Foreign language ]

01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:19.550
The next poem is called
Strata of Time.

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:29.420
And it is written in the
restaurant [foreign name] in Riga.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:36.720
My former unofficial Riga
office during my diplomat years.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.870
Day sneaks off with the
smell of tobacco, rain.

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:49.190
Old film music drifts
from a loudspeaker.

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.200
It's Nostalgia's birthday today.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.480
Days of the past turn up
like uninvited guests.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.220
Time leafs through your old
as yet unwritten diaries.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.140
You turn time like the
pages of a newspaper

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.270
when the print refuses to stick.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:13.470
Empty streets, empty windows
fill up your old ghosts of old.

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:14.890
A flash of thought.

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.860
A flash of proximity.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.690
A flash of what may be, maybe was.

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.790
May as well have been.

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:24.610
Rain all day.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.770
Fatigue up to your neck.

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:32.900
A wonder the houses haven't been
worn down by all these writings.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:39.810 position:56%
A wonder the words haven't been worn
away by all these prints of fingers.

01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:44.710
A wonder the bridges
haven't been ground to dust.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:49.930
Night. Houses of parliament
and government sleep.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:56.480
Democracy has surrendered to
the dictatorship of dreams.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:05.390
And the last poem and very
autobiographical poem is called

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.570
Never Time to Write Poetry.

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.470 position:56%
Sometimes I work on the underground.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.840
Sometimes I work as a diplomat.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.670
Sometimes I deliver
lectures in diverse places.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.780
Sometimes I translate
novels or poems.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.200
Sometimes I'll go and
buy groceries or browse

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.890
in bookshops in diverse places.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.720
Sometimes I'll cook a meal.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.740
Sometimes I watch a show.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.370
Sometimes I take a walk or a
glass or two of wine or beer

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:40.780
with colleagues from diverse places
or alone in airports or planes.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.070
Never time to write poetry.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.150
It happens in the time that isn't.

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:48.650
I steal some hours from sleep.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:51.370
Shut the book I'm translating now.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.380
Shorten cooking times.

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.780
Prepare spaghetti al dente,
supposed to be healthier.

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.780
Get the kids to prefer
very rare meat.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.530
Chop the veg with a meat
cleaver, all to save time.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:09.970
I write on buses, trains and
planes for there's never time

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:15.060
to write poetry so
it isn't really work.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.200
It's just a way to pretend.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.500
There is no time that exists or
there is but it stops while I write

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:28.290
and its stead letters tick across
the page or screen like seconds

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:35.490
and just like time poetry
is both linear and cyclical.

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:38.710
I always have time to write poetry.

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.010
That's all I do.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.310
[applause]

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.610
&gt;&gt; Andrew Springer:
Juris collection,

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:52.720 position:56%
Wolf One-Eye is available from Arc
Publications in English translation.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.350
Thanks so much to the
Library of Congress

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.610
for this event marking
Latvian literature.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.540
As the Ambassador told us at
the beginning, it's the first

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:06.040
such event here so it is
wonderful that all of you have come

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.110
and commemorated this
culture here with us.

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:12.500
And how appropriate that it's
here in the European Reading Room.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.600
Thanks especially to Grant
Harris who is the head

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.310
of this European Reading
Room for helping

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.060
to facilitate this
and to all of you.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:26.950
[applause] Why don't we have
one more round of applause

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.510
for our performers today?

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:41.510
[ Applause ]

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.390
It's our lucky day.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.420
We're able to take
one or two questions,

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:51.970
if anyone has any questions
to go with our writers.

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:57.550
&gt;&gt; My question is to both
ladies writing in Latvian,

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.010
you seem to be knowing English

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:07.820
but still you are using
Ms. Gailitis to translate.

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:12.280
Would it make a big difference
for you to write in English?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.470
Is it connected to your, I guess
your feelings or your emotions

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:25.630
that you express better in
Latvian than in English?

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:30.810
&gt;&gt; Nora Ikstena: So I believe in
the theory that writer belongs

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.470
to language so I belong
to Latvian language.

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:39.540
And I'm not going to
switch my writing language.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:44.580
I think that's why translations
exist and that's so nice

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.730
that we have this variety
of languages in this world

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:54.630 position:56%
and so I'm happy to write in Latvian
and to have good translations

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:58.570
to get the readership
outside Latvia.

01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.150
&gt;&gt; Liana Langa: We believe that
the newborn baby already cries

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:09.650
in his native language and I
completely agree with the poet

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:17.490
who used to be poet laureate in
this institution, Joseph Brodsky,

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:23.340
whom I had luck to listen to
couple of times in New York City.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:29.350
He said that poetry can be written
only and only in native language.

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:35.370
He tried himself writing English
and it was not the best experience.

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:40.900
He write prose in English but
poetry can be written, we believe,

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.380
in Latvia, only native language.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.810
And I must say our
language is sacred to us

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:50.760
and to any Latvian writer.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.060
Thank you.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:59.510
&gt;&gt; I'm curious how that last
question would be answered by Juris

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:05.030
who is both deeply Latvian
and deeply European so.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.310
&gt;&gt; Juris Kronbergs:
Well if it is question

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:15.220
of the English language then I try
to write something in English just

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:22.270
for fun and showed it to my
translator, who is also my wife.

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:27.870
She grew up in Australia.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:34.260
And she said please don't.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.430
[laughter] But as I
grew up in Sweden

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:46.940
and I'm bilingual I also
write poetry in Swedish,

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:54.170
let's say 25 percent and
75 percent in Latvian.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.480
But not at the same
time, with one exception,

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:08.000
when I wrote Wolf One-Eye it was
a decision that I will write this

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.800
and immediately translate
into Swedish.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:21.540
And so I did and I wrote it
and used both the languages.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:29.800
And the language is sometimes
decided in different ways,

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:35.550 position:56%
how I should proceed with each poem.

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:41.670
But of course it's a very
exceptional situation because of

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:46.250
when I grew up in Sweden my
first language was Latvian.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:50.780
We lived many Latvian families
in one part of Stockholm.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:10:00.050
And until I started to go to
school I spoke almost only Latvian.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:03.460
I didn't know the Swedish
language very well

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.870
when I start to go to school.

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:12.870
But it was not problem because
the requirement was not such,

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:18.940
should be very good in
native language at that time.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:22.250
So how can I say?

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:27.610
When I started to write,
when I was 17 or 18,

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:32.570
poems I wrote in Swedish language.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:38.510
But then there was a friend
of mine whose mother was one

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:44.000
of the best Latvian poets
of the 20th century,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:53.640
Veronica [foreign name], and she
encouraged me to write in Latvian.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:11:00.620
And when I started to write
poetry in Latvian it was

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:09.890
like all my childhood and
everything was opening up in a way

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:17.330
and it wasn't quite another
emotional experience to write

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:26.280
in Latvian for the Swedish
language was more connected

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:35.080
with collecting information
and getting, what's it called,

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.610
bad, you know, from teachers.

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:53.220
And so I think that I cannot
fully answer your question,

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.230
only shall I continue?

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.500
[laughter]

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.350
&gt;&gt; Andrew Springer: For
people who live on the cusp

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:05.960
between two cultures like that, I
think that they're doing more good

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:10.140 position:56%
and more work for the infrastructure
of the future civilization

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.780
that we're building
than almost anyone.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.270
And for those who don't live

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:20.240
on such a cusp we have literary
translation doing that work.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.020
And Paul Valery said that when you
translate something that you love,

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:29.800
your heart will break but
something beautiful will come

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.920
from that breaking and
that's our experience

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.440
of enjoying another culture
through the lens of our own.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.110
It's quite a creative art.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:44.510
Thank you again very
much and good afternoon.
