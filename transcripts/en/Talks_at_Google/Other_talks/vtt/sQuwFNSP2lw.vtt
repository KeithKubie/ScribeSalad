00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.350
&gt;&gt; I had the opportunity to get to know Chef
Cardoz two years ago when I was a [INDISTINCT]

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.769
in his restaurant, a very ineffective one,
peeling garlic, but to say we're all in for

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.080
a super, amazing treat today would be a serious
understatement. Raised in both Bombay and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.679
Goa, Chef Cardoz attended culinary school
in Bombay, spending time in the kitchens of

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.539
the Taj Hotel and also Les Roches in Switzerland.
He eventually moved to New York where he worked

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.070
with his mentor, Gray Kunz, at New York's
Lespinasse, rising from chef de partie to

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.170
executive sous-chef over the five years that
he was there. Floyd went on to open Tabla

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.460
with Danny Meyer in 1998. And as executive
chef of Tabla, he introduced diners to his

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.440
groundbreaking, new Indian cuisine where he
incorporated Indian ingredients with western

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.489
techniques. Tabla has, as you all probably
know, received numerous media accolades including

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.300
three stars from the New York Times. And,
in addition, Floyd was named as one of the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.350
innovators in Bon Appetit's 2003 Annual Restaurant
Edition and has received three nominations

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.770
by the James Beard Foundation for Best Chef
in New York. Floyd released his first cookbook,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.360
"Once Spice, Two Spice," which hopefully some
of you have gotten, in 2006. It includes his

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.579
favorite new Indian recipes from Tabla, including
one of my favorites, the crab cakes and demystifies

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.770
Indian food and flavors and teaches how to
expertly add the Indian spices to American

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.759
cuisine. I ask you all to join me in welcoming
Chef Cardoz. And as two quick reminders to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.521
the extent that you can close your laptops,
it would be greatly appreciated, and if you

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.040
have any questions at the end of this session,
please use the mics because we are recording

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.540
for YouTube. Thanks so much. Welcome, Chef.
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: Thank you. Well, good afternoon,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.310
and thank you for being here. What she didn't
say was I initially thought that I was going

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.899
to go into the sciences and I was doing my
masters in biochemistry when I got--I had

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.520
this moment in the lab one day that this is
not something that I want to do. I enjoy food.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.130
I enjoy cooking. And as a kid, I saw all this
cooking in the kitchen with my cook at home.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.230
For those of you Indian families, you know
that men don't cook in India and you have

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.540
someone do it for you. And I started hanging
out in the kitchen, and, you know, my way

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.170
of eating extra was hanging out with the cook
in the kitchen so she would feed me, you know,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.450
before my brothers and sisters, and then when
I went to the dinner table, I got some more.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.130
But I enjoyed eating so much that I started
cooking from the age of nine. I used to make

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.329
omelets and stuff and I used to do these barbecues
in India, you know, with my friends, and I

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.320
realized that I absolutely love doing this
and I have not regretted one single day of

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.470
my cooking because I get up every morning
and I want to go to work. On the weekends

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.000
when I'm home--I don't work weekends, I work
Saturday, Sunday, I'm off--I'm up early in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.810
the morning, I plan my menu for the day. I
know we're going to have three meals at home,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.700
drives my wife absolutely crazy because I
start cooking at seven in the morning. I go

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.600
shopping with my kids. I buy whatever is available.
And it's about passion for me. It's about

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.340
doing what I love to do every single day.
And what I do at the restaurant, at Tabla,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.130
is that I try to bring these flavors that
I grew up with in India. When I came here

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.030
22 years ago, Indian food in the United States
was very bad. There was a few restaurants

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.290
on 6th Street, a few restaurants on Lexington
Avenue, and they did an adaptation of Indian

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.410
food that was found only in Mogul cuisine
and it had cream and butter and--I didn't

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.850
grow up that way. So, when I was approached
to do this restaurant, to do Indian food,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.540
I said, "You know what? I'm going to do Indian
food, but I'm going to do my take on Indian

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.940
food because most people in the United States
don't know the kind of food that I grew up

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.940
with." And if you're an Indian, you know that
the food you eat at home is nothing like what

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.840
you find in the restaurants. It's seasonal.
It's light. It's fresh. It's absolutely delicious.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.240
So, we opened Tabla. I opened upstairs, I
did my take which was French--I was classically

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.180
trained in French foods--as French and Indian
mix; and the Bread Bar which was the lowest

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
street-level restaurant was a space we had
which--first I wanted to prove to the United

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.750
States that I could cook. So, I concentrated
on that restaurant and my partner would tell

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.090
me, "Let's do this," you know, "Let's do this,"
and I was just doing stuff that I didn't truly

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.510
really care about. And then, two years into
the restaurant, I spoke to Danny, my partner,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.190
and I said, "Danny, listen. Let's change this.
I always say when I retire I wanted a home-style

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.500
Indian food." So, in the Bread Bar, we do
home-style Indian food, which is not really

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.970
Indian food that all Indians in India eat,
but it's also a food that Indians in the United

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.920
States and England and Australia, what we
cook with the local ingredients. So, what

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.260
we're going to do today is we're going to
do a little bit, something of an adaptation,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.790
okay. The lamb that I'm doing today, and I
think you're going to have it at lunch, is

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.810
a spice-frosted lamb. In India, when you do
lamb it's always killed, you know, it's not

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.730
cooked medium rare. Being that in India, the
meat we use is not aged and it's killed and

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.780
cooked right away. So, it's stewed. So, I
have adapted the spices from the lamb that

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.800
I--you know, in India, you always cook lamb
with black pepper, with green cardamom, with

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.200
mustard, with black cardamom. And what I've
done is I've taken a nice cut of lamb like

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.010
a lamb chop or a lamb loin or leg of lamb,
I treated it with spice and we're going to

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.100
make a little marinade today for the lamb.
And we've taken lamb loin and we're using

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.730
mustard seeds, black pepper, might as we go
for a black cardamom, but they didn't have

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.630
any, so we have green cardamom. And, you know
what I think is if you use spices, it adds

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.050
flavor to the dish and it makes it exciting.
It just doesn't, you know, keep it one-dimensional.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.300
Yeah, lamb is great. You have a nice lamb
chopped, put it around the grill and roast

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.430
it. You know, there's nothing wrong with it,
but if you can add some flavor to it and make

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.220
it more exciting, why not? So, we--there's,
you know, and anybody comes into my restaurant

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.640
and says, "Oh, I don't like spices." First
thing out of my mind is SOL (ph) because everything

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.330
across the board has got spices in it. You
know, we can do a piece of fish or piece of

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.520
meat, but our sauces are premium, our vegetables
are cut as, so... But in India, you know,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.100
we have, I think, over a billion people, and
the reason why our population is so big is

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.740
because of the spices, you know. It's good
for you; it keeps you in good health. And

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.990
now that we are eating more like the western
world in India, we're having more of the disease

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.310
and all the other, you know, rich man's diseases
coming to India. So, we're going to make a

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.240
spice rub. And, you know, what I do at home
is I never buy ground spices, we buy whole

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.900
spices. I have two little coffee grinders
at home, and in my kitchen at the restaurant,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.400
everybody has traveler's spice grinder because
we make our spice mixes, you know, fresh every

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.900
single day. So, we're going to grind that
and we're going to add a little bit of oil,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:01.640
rosemary and salt, and we're going to crust
the lamb. And what I like to do is--I live

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.380
in the burbs, so it's easy for me to grill
stuff at home, so I have a grill in the backyard

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.480
and I like grilling it. But if you don't have
a grill, you can put it on a pan and cook

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.030
it on a pan or you can even put it in the
oven and under the broiler. When I was deciding

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.060
that I was going to do this lamb, I said,
"You know, let's do something else that will

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:26.090
go with it." Now, most people here love chickpeas,
and in this dish of chickpeas is actually

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.160
quite close to the original that I'm making,
okay. So, we're going to do chickpeas, or

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.460
we're going to do cracked wheat, again, all
really healthy, good ingredients. So, is that

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.290
done? So, we're also going to use rosemary
with the lamb. Now, in Indian food, rosemary

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.710
is not very often used, but I believe that
when I take Indian cuisine which is a great

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.240
cuisine and I take French cuisine or German
or Italian or Chinese or Japanese, for that

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.810
matter, I stay with the traditions. Now, you
always do leg of lamb with rosemary and that

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.831
kind of works really well, like I do duck
at the restaurant, I do the orange--I'd make

00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:11.949
an orange curry. There is no orange curry
in India. But I use orange juice and I use

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:16.110
spices that work with orange. I don't know,
like, I use star anise, I use fennel seed,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.150
I use ginger. So, we have the spice--is the
rosemary in there?

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.660
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: And I'm going to add rosemary to

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:33.760
it. And whenever you do herbs, it's always
great to, you know, mince the herbs up right

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:41.940
at the end and not in the morning or the day
before because it kind of loses all the aromatic

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:55.730
oils. And I'm going to add a little bit of
oil to that and salt. And salt is good for

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:03.470
you so, you know, if your doctor says, "Don't
use salt," they don't know anything about

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.390
flavor. Now, the black pepper in there adds
a little bit of heat to it. And what I love

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:14.980
about black pepper is that it has this constant
flavor unlike chili pepper that keeps on building.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.300
So, when you add black pepper you can add
as little or as much as you want. And the

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.450
great thing about black pepper too is it's
a great digestive. Black peppers are used

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:33.740
a lot in the south of India, and also it's
good because it helps in digestion, too. So,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:55.940
we have the lamb. I love using my hands when
I cook because...

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.770
And once you marinate the lamb and let it
sit, you should let it sit in the fridge overnight.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:10.410
I think if you let spices sit on a piece of
meat, it tends to, you know, permeate the

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.240
meat. In India, if you have a lesser cut of
meat, say, you use a piece of leg and it's

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.680
not as tender as a tenderloin or, say, a rib
eye, you want to let it sit a little because

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.190
it helps tenderize the meat a little bit,
okay. In India we use other tenderizing agents

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.690
like lime juice and tamarind and green papaya,
but with the meat we get here in the United

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.510
States, you don't really need to do that.
So once this is marinating and we have something

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.620
that we marinated earlier, we're going to
start shearing it off. In the meantime, what

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:44.520
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a sauce
to go with the lamb. And I use shallots, garlic,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.690
ginger; I use tomatoes and mint. Now again,
mint is very, very traditional with lamb.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.450
And again, who am I to say, "I'm not going
to put mint in?" If it has worked for so many

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.899
hundreds of years, I'm just going to keep
it and I'm going to change it. I like to innovate

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:06.480
a little bit. So, with the sauce, you're going
to add a little bit of olive oil. And I'm

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:18.960
going to put shallots, garlic and ginger in
there. And basically I'm going to sweat it

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.460
out a little bit. And when you sweat stuff
out what you're trying to do is you're trying

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:30.980
to release the essential oils. Most flavoring
agents in food are from the essential oils.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:37.279
And again, I mentioned earlier about with
the spices being freshly-ground. You want

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:43.140
freshly-ground because there are spices have
these essential oils in them. And if you buy

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.940
a mix from your local grocery store of, say,
cumin or coriander or black pepper, you don't

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.620
know when this has been ground, it could be
from 10 years ago. You could be just going

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.971
to your backyard, picking up some dirt and
throwing it in the pan because that's what

00:11:56.971 --> 00:12:04.709
it taste like, you know. I'm a big snob as
far as spices go, because I do feel that if

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:08.990
you are going to use these great flavorings,
why not use them at their prime. You know,

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:29.800
why half-ass it because you don't really need
to do that. Okay, we are chefs, we like to-—like

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.110
you tech people, you like to have multiple
screens working at one time. With us, chefs,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.390
is we have multiple tasks going on in the
kitchen. You know, that's multiple windows,

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.490
if you will, because if we try to do one thing
at a time and you have eight hours to get

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.790
your lunch shift ready, there's no way the
restaurant is going to open. So, if right

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.420
now I'm making the lamb sauce at the same
time, I'm going to start cooking the chickpeas

00:12:53.420 --> 00:13:00.411
and the crack wheat. So, for the crack wheat,
we have--it's regular [INDISTINCT] wheat,

00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:06.310
and I think this is really a healthy thing
to eat. We have clove, we have cinnamon, we

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:13.390
have turmeric, ginger and shallots, and onions
and shallots. And I like to use clove and

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.940
cinnamon. Actually, there's this story I have.
I used to work in the St. Regis about 10 years

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:25.330
ago, and there used to be a princess who used
to live in the hotel, and she claimed she

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:32.040
was a princess. So we called her "Princess."
And she asked me to make an Indian-style pilaf

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.440
for her one day. I worked for this French
restaurant and she said, "I love Indian food,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.440
make me a pilaf." So, I got Basmati rice and
I made her a nice pilaf. In India, when you

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.070
make pilaf, you always use clove and use cinnamon,
because it has this aromatic flavor to it

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.530
which adds to the rice. So, I made her the
rice, I threw the cinnamon in, I threw the

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.720
clove in, and we sent it up to her room. In
India, you know, when you use cinnamon you

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.860
want to put it on a dish so people can see
that you are using good cinnamon. It's just

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.940
a way of showing off. So, she sends the rice
back down to the kitchen and she says, you

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.360
know, "What are you doing, making dessert?"
I'm like, "What are you talking about?" She

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.320
says, "You got cinnamon in there. Nobody put
cinnamon in rice." But in India, we do that,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.149
you know, you add cinnamon because it makes
it very aromatic. Indian food and Indian flavors

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:21.390
is all about the aromaticness of food. So,
I'm going to add a little bit of the spice

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:32.200
into the shallots and ginger, and we're going
to add the tomatoes. So, yeah, Indian food

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.930
is not only about heat. Indian food is a balance
of sweet, sour, spicy, bitter, and about texture.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.980
I know you eat a good Indian food, Indian
meal, they'll always be something sweet, something

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.740
hard, something crispy, something crunchy,
something in between, and that's what makes

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.660
Indian cuisine exciting. I mean, you could
go for a dosa and you'll have a nice crispy

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.820
pancake, you'll have a spicy, you know, some
are like a coconut chutney. And what I do

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.740
with my food is I try to bring this into everything
we do, because I get this all the time in

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.029
my restaurant. They say your food is very
exciting. It's exciting because I'm using

00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:20.060
these tricks that we've been doing in India
for hundred of years using texture and flavor.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:29.490
So, for the cracked wheat and this is very
easy to make, I have the canola oil and I

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:36.329
want to add the whole spices in the dish.
Now, I believe that if you use whole spices,

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:40.741
you should add them in the beginning in hot
oil because (a) there are oils in these spices

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:48.920
and the oil helps extract them. And you put
the clove and cinnamon. And if you have cumin,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.279
whole cumin; whole cumin works really, really
well with this. So, when you put it in the

00:15:54.279 --> 00:16:00.450
dish--if look at it, it starts kind of shimmering
and I don't know if you can see that, and

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:10.250
that's when you know that you're extracting
most of the flavors out of it. So I have onion

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:27.920
and ginger. I pretty much feel that if you're
starting off anything, if you want to do a

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.820
boiled vegetable at home, if you add a little
bit of onion and ginger and chili and cumin,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.800
it makes it so much more exciting rather than
having steamed broccoli or sautéed zucchini

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.910
or sautéed asparagus. You know, asparagus
is great, but if you add a little bit of mustard

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.310
seeds, a little bit of cumin, a little bit
of coconut, a little bit of ginger or tamarind,

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.339
it again adds layers of flavor. This is what
you want to do, you want to build layers of

00:16:51.339 --> 00:17:02.740
flavor. So, I'm going to cook that until transparent.
And then I want to add my cracked--oops!--my

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:10.769
cracked wheat in there. And we are going to
add a little bit of turmeric. And turmeric,

00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:16.579
besides giving that lovely yellow color, has
a little bit of bitterness in there and has

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:20.899
great flavor. And you always want to add just
a tiny bit because there are a lot of things

00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:24.370
you can do with food if you add too much.
If we add too much salt, you can add potatoes

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.710
to a dish and kind of extract out the excess
salt. If you add too much chili, you can add

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.860
a little bit of acid, yogurt, tomatoes and,
you know, make that a little tamable. If you

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.799
add too much turmeric, there's nothing you
can do. You know, you have to either double

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:45.241
or triple or quadruple the recipe or throw
it out. I'm going to toast this a little bit

00:17:45.241 --> 00:18:07.380
and then add the stock to it. And that's good.
Now, the great thing about this is if you

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.809
are cooking at home and you are entertaining
and, you know, there's all these tricks of

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:15.649
what you can make, perform what you can do.
And this is one of the things that can make.

00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:19.669
And if you have a low oven at home, just put
it in a bowl and just take it in the oven

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:25.409
in 180 degrees and let it stay for up to two
to three hours. Okay, it's the same thing

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:30.679
if you're making the chickpeas, you can do
the same thing and hold it. So, we're going

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:37.019
to let it calm down and go, you know, really
let it all cook. And then we are going to

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:42.799
finish with a little bit of stock and the
mint. So while this is cooking, I'm going

00:18:42.799 --> 00:19:07.200
to start with the chickpeas. And the chickpeas
are again--it's an adaptation of Gujarati

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:16.100
cuisine which is on the west coast of India
and next to north of Bombay. And the cuisine

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.081
from Gujarat is very different from the rest
of India being that they use a little bit

00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:27.859
of sweetness in their cuisine. And that sweetness
comes from the Persians who came, you know,

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:34.739
Parsees, they came to India few hundred years
ago--and when they came and they brought their

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:40.139
cuisine in with them. And they always have
a little bit of sweetness, a little of sourness

00:19:40.139 --> 00:19:47.980
in their food, and that is kind of being brought
into everybody in India. So with the chickpeas,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:53.179
it's basically coconut that you can toast
in the oven and I like sometimes put it in

00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:57.769
a sauté pan on the fire so it gets a little,
you know, a little faster color. And then

00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:04.749
it's a roasted chili pepper. And this is—-it's
typical from the west coast of India, but

00:20:04.749 --> 00:20:12.369
if you are a Mexican food, you know, fan,
they roast Chili peppers in Mexico, too, and

00:20:12.369 --> 00:20:16.269
it changes the flavor of the chili pepper.
And now what I'm doing is I'm using a fresh

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:19.509
chili pepper. So, when I take-–when I take
a fresh chili pepper, I just take it and hold

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:27.090
it over the fire and it did get a smoky flavor
that changes the entire texture of the dish.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:35.609
So, what we have is we have coconut, we have
a fresh roasted chili pepper, we have ginger,

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:39.919
and we're going to puree that and we're also
going to add the spice of black pepper and

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:47.440
coriander to it. Now we're going to add stock
to that and we're going to let that, you know...

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:57.279
It's going to continue reducing. And this
is actually really good for this time of the

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:02.419
year because you get some amazing tomatoes
in the green market. If you go on to Union

00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:07.609
Square Market, actually today, Wednesdays,
Fridays, Saturdays, they have these farmers

00:21:07.609 --> 00:21:12.179
bringing the best tomatoes in the country,
I think, in my opinion, from New Jersey. The

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:18.580
soil is red, you know, the weather is perfect,
and they get these amazing tomatoes. And if

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.360
you make a sauce like this, just take these
tomatoes, slice them and put a little bit

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.249
of salt and black pepper, just freshly ground
black pepper. It's just amazing, to make simple

00:21:27.249 --> 00:21:37.279
ingredients so good. So, we're going to grind
this with a little bit of water, and we have

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:41.629
some chickpeas that we cooked earlier. And
if you have canned chickpeas, you can do it

00:21:41.629 --> 00:21:48.789
with canned chickpeas too. I do canned chickpeas
at home. Fresh soaked and boiled chickpeas

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:55.139
are much better, but sometimes you don't have
the time and it's a great substitute. So,

00:21:55.139 --> 00:21:58.740
as I said earlier, when you make a spice mixer
sauce, you want to cook it out on oil. So

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.980
you're going to start this, we're going to
cook the spice out a little bit in the oil

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.049
and I'm going to add the chickpeas. I mean,
I just let this cook. And we're going to add

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:10.299
a little bit of tamarind to this. Now, tamarind
is an acid. Indian food, I spoke about a little

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:15.559
earlier, has these layers of flavor and one
of them being acid. And in Indian Cuisine,

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:20.530
depending of where you are from in the country,
you would use a different acid, like on the

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:26.460
west coast of India, we use tamarind. So you
go from Gujarat to Bombay to Kerala, you'd

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:32.119
use tamarind. You go to the north of India,
you'd use yogurt, or you'd use tomato, or

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:36.870
you use lime juice. Also in the west coast
of India, and sometimes in the north, just

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.409
use green mango. So use green mango or use
kokum if you're on the west coast again. So

00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:46.179
it's these acids that we use to build these
layers of flavor and to give the food this

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:56.629
roundness that Indian cuisine is known for.
So, I'm going to cheat a little bit over here

00:22:56.629 --> 00:23:02.010
and use a puree that we already have that
we made out of coconut, the chili pepper,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:30.509
and the tamarind. And I'm going to cook that
in a little bit of oil with the spice.

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:36.259
And these recipes are in the book. I'm just
winging it right now, but it will taste good.

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:41.659
I hate following the recipes. I can't stand
following the recipes. And when I cook in

00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:45.409
the restaurant, these guys... My sous-chefs
follow me around in the kitchen. Every day

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:52.190
I was changing the menu and I change my menu
pretty frequently. I don't write things down.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:58.440
I just go in to--we have a spice room which
is about that, a little bigger than that table,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.229
and I get inspired by the ingredient. I don't
get it--I don't have something in my mind.

00:24:02.229 --> 00:24:07.239
So, you know, in the night I'll call up and
find out what they have and say, "Okay, we

00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:11.789
have halibut today." So, I'd tell my sous-chef,
"Okay, you know, just bring some halibut tomorrow.

00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:16.539
I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
And these guys normally come at about 12.

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:19.899
So, from 12 o'clock they're hounding me. "Chef,
what are we going to do with this? What are

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:24.821
we going to do with this?" And I honestly
don't know. And around 3 o'clock, it's when

00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:29.239
I decide, "OK, I'm going to change the menu
today." I go into the kitchen, open the walk-in

00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:33.330
cooler, or on Wednesdays, as it's normally
going to change. I go on to the market, I

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.640
pick up some vegetables, I go in and then
I start cooking. And when I start cooking,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.649
I'll tell the cook, "OK, get me fish stock,
get me tamarind, get me lime juice, get me

00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:48.739
this, this, this, and this." And they would
be lined on the table behind me, and I start

00:24:48.739 --> 00:24:53.479
cooking. And half the time I would use everything
they bought me and sometimes I will change

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:58.639
my mind halfway to the cooking, because with
me it's all about what the inspiration is.

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:02.330
And I don't try to, you know, put stuff in
that doesn't belong because it is very easy

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:09.100
to do that and then you get food that doesn't
make sense. It's about adding ingredients

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.139
that make the ingredient taste good. And then
after I cook, these guys write down every

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:20.830
single thing they do. And I have a database
of over 10,000 recipes. And sometimes they'll

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:26.909
ask me, "Chef, remember last year we did the
snapper?" and I have no recollection of it

00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:32.179
at all. And you know, when I have people over,
too, they ask me, you know, when they eat

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:40.989
in my home, you know, "May I have your recipe,"
and I don't know what the recipe is. So, now

00:25:40.989 --> 00:25:44.489
when I started doing is, you know, when my
wife asked me when I cooked dinner, she writes

00:25:44.489 --> 00:25:50.989
everything I'm doing, and then I tried to
recreate it again but I can't. So, we're going

00:25:50.989 --> 00:26:04.979
to cook this out a little bit. In the meantime,
our cracked wheat is done,

00:26:04.979 --> 00:26:20.559
and our sauce is looking good. You know, for
me, cooking is about having fun, it's about

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:27.869
enjoying the process of cooking and then enjoying
the process of eating, because I think if

00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:32.960
you cook without eating is no fun, and if
you eat without cooking, it's no fun. So,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.389
it's about enjoying the company you have and,
you know, doing things that make you happy.

00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:56.899
I'm going to use that. So, once this is cooked,
we're going to add our chickpeas to this.

00:26:56.899 --> 00:27:00.890
And if you have stock, you can add stock to
it or you can add water to it. I'm going to

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:11.730
add some water right now. What I do at home
is I use chicken stock. You let this cook.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:39.989
We need some more water. It's easier. And
while this is going, I am going to start my

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:51.429
lamb. And as I said earlier you can either
go to the lamb or you can, you know, roast

00:27:51.429 --> 00:28:07.080
it. And don't worry about the oil I'm using
with the lamb because if you have protein,

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.149
you can't put fat into protein, you can't
put fat into carbs, put in into the protein,

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:21.049
so. Everything that is on the outside is going
to just stay on the outside. Anybody have

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:30.289
any questions?
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about your selection for oil.

00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:36.200
I mean, you have two of them there. Actually,
I was a little surprised even for such inspiration

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.440
and you got this in your [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: It's a very good question. I use

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:45.060
a bunch of oils. I like to use, I like to
use canola oil because I feel canola oil has

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.830
a perfect smoke point for – when you're
cooking spices. You don't want your oil to

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:55.950
be too hot, because if it's too hot, it's
going to burn the spice. And if you have grape

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.609
seed oil, a lot of chefs is using grape seed
oil these days. Grape seed oil has the highest

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:05.909
smoke point. So, you could be heating it up
much higher than you wanted to and you could

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:12.379
burn your spice, okay? I like to use olive
oil because I think olive oil has a nice fruitiness

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:18.809
which adds another layer of flavor to the
food. I do use geese (ph) sometimes, but if

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:23.049
I do use geese (ph), I'll make sure that people
know that's got geese (ph) in it because of

00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:28.679
the animal fat. A lot of vegans don't like
it. I do use nut oils in the restaurants.

00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:34.549
I think nut oils are great flavoring, but
I use them more as finishing. I love peanut

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:39.419
oil but again, because of the allergies, I
tend not to use as much. In my own cooking

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:44.820
at home, I use a lot of peanut oil. But I
think you could have a bunch of oils and you

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:59.979
could choose as many oils as you want, but
you got to be careful on how you use them.

00:29:59.979 --> 00:30:07.619
So, I'm going to season this with salt. Whenever
you season with salt any meat, you want to

00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:11.719
let it set for a few minutes, like, I'd say,
five or ten minutes because it helps with

00:30:11.719 --> 00:30:21.389
the crust on the outside, it absorbs the salt
going to the meat. Okay?

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:24.840
And when you have a spiced crust from the
outside, you want to be careful that your

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.739
pan doesn't get too hot. You know, sometimes
when you do steaks, you want the oil to be

00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:35.859
really hot so you can sear it. But if you
have the oil too hot for this, you are going

00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:52.690
to burn the spice and make it bitter. You
know, our sauce is almost done, so I'm going

00:30:52.690 --> 00:31:08.999
to finish it up with some mint. You know,
cooking with spices can be so much of fun

00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:14.779
and make things so interesting that, you know,
most people don't realize that by adding something

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:25.719
really, really simple to a dish, it changes
the whole complexity of the dish. Another

00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:38.469
thing that we--we chefs always do is we like
to--we like to taste as we cook because you

00:31:38.469 --> 00:31:48.940
are building flavors in there. And the other
thing that you want to put is, you know, put

00:31:48.940 --> 00:32:07.789
a little bit of jaggery or brown sugar, you
know, to balance out the acidity. Now, if

00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:13.210
this was a bigger piece of meat, I would most
definitely put it in the oven. This is very

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:19.370
small; you can do it in stove top if you have
to. And there's another thing that we do in

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.389
the restaurant is, when we are cooking a piece
of meat or fish we add a little bit of butter

00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:44.729
to the pan and then we baste it. And that
helps with the flavor as well as... So, as

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:47.859
this cooks, if, you know, the longer you let
this cook the more thick it's going to get,

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:56.440
the chickpeas. And you want it nice and thick
because it just, you know, the fattiness of

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:51.859
the chickpeas comes through with acid and
the sweetness and the heat. And other thing

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:56.359
we like to do, too, in the restaurant is we
like to add herbs to a pan when we are basting

00:33:56.359 --> 00:34:02.410
a piece of meat or fish because it just gives
it a little fresh flavor. You know, you could

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.809
do the whole garlic, you can do sliced ginger,
you can do sliced shallots, you can do spice

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:14.240
if you want. But it just makes it—makes
it more interesting. Now, I'm going to kind

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:23.310
of rest this for a minute. And whenever you
do, if you're roasting meat, it's always a

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:29.250
good practice to let the meat roast or let
the meat rest before you slice it, especially

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:36.149
the medium rare or anything less than that.
Because if you-—you cook the meat and you

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:41.120
go and slice it right away, what happens is,
as with protein as it cooks it tenses up,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.110
and all the juice from the inside comes to
the outside. And when you go and slice it,

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:50.620
you got blood in the plate. But if you rest
it and you slice it, you got a beautiful pink

00:34:50.620 --> 00:35:13.010
in the middle and there's no juice on the
plate. And it's also very interesting because

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:19.930
if you cook with spices there are very, very,
very many people who are very afraid of using

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:26.190
spices in their food. And in my restaurant,
I get cooks who come in all the time and say,

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.930
"Chef, I don't know how to cook with spices."
I say, "As long as you know how to cook, I

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:36.700
can teach you." And if you've known the basics
of, you know, fresh spices, using oil, you

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:43.900
know, taking care, balance, you know, don't
use too much, you can cook very well with

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:50.990
spices. If you--you know, I have tasted restaurants
where the food has got way too much chili,

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:55.600
or way too of garam masala, way too much of
something or the other. That's what kills

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.090
the dish. But if you use it in limitation
and you follow the recipe and you follow the

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:07.770
cooking technique, your dish can come out
perfectly every single time, you know. There's

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.590
nothing that's-—I mean, you know, what I
did here is not what you guys do. This is

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:17.220
not a rocket science. You just follow the
recipe. You know, I'm not discovering anything.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:23.370
I'm not doing new web pages or new search
engines or any of that kind of stuff. I'm

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:29.040
just putting food together. And it got to
start from here, because if you don't have

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.860
the passion, you know, you can—-like I can
tell when someone is cooking without passion

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:40.310
in my kitchen. If a cook is unhappy, I can
see the product coming out. If I can go to

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:45.390
someone's home and eat a meal, and I can tell
you if that meal was cooked with passion or

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:51.020
not, or that person have a good day or a bad
day because it translates into the balance

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.550
of the salt, the balance of the heat. It could
be the most simplest dish that they could

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:00.090
be making. It doesn't-—like when, you know,
my friends who like to invite me over to eat,

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.310
and they try to make fancy. And I told them,
"Don't make fancy. Make what's close to your

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.970
heart because that's going to be good every
single time." And if that passion translates

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:16.470
into what you do and you eat it, you get that
joy. And with food, that's all it's about.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:24.670
It's not about my ego, it's about the community.
It's about making you happy, making you enjoy

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:33.980
these wonderful flavors and partake of this
meal.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:52.061
So I'm going to cheat a little bit and slice
this lamb right now. You know, just going

00:37:52.061 --> 00:38:23.040
to plate this, a little bit of lamb.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.400
And we'll put it on the plate. [INDISTINCT]
right now. Any questions?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:37.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. Can you tell us about
the stock you're using? And do you cheat with

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:42.160
stocks at home?
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: Do I cheat with stocks?

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:49.700
&gt;&gt; Like instant Bouillon, anything.
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: I have two freezers at home. One

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:56.950
has ice cream and normal home stuff, and the
other one which is in the garage has my stocks.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.770
And I have chicken stock, I have shellfish
stock, I have lamb stock, I have pork stock,

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:08.140
I have beef stock, and I have a vegetarian
stock. What I do is I buy whole chickens at

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:15.640
home, and I save the scraps. The skin, the
necks, the wingtips, and I put them in these

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:21.750
small bags. It drives my wife totally insane
when I do that because she'll open the freezer

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.900
one day and all these bags will be everywhere
and you know, once a month I make stock. And

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.650
I make the stock and I freeze it. You know
these small cork containers? They're the best.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:35.360
And I think if you do that--I used to at one
point buy stocks commercially but they don't

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:44.750
have the body. You need the gelatin in stocks.
I do use bouillon cubes but not for everything.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:52.370
My mom makes a rice dish with bouillon cubes,
scallions and tomatoes, and it's absolutely

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:58.220
amazing. And I'm not embarrassed to say that
I make-—I made that rice on Sunday night.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.910
It is—-it tastes pretty good. But making
your own stocks, it can be difficult, but

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:09.010
if you have space to store like scraps, you
know, bones and skin and especially of chicken

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:17.170
or you have shrimp heads, save them. It just
makes a total difference to the way food tastes;

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:22.320
it can be so much better. And in the restaurant,
of course, we make-—we have a big steam

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.860
kettle where we make chicken stock every single
day. But we don't cheat with, you know, if

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:33.530
we say it's vegetarian, it has a vegetable
stock in it. We don't put beef stock and anything

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:37.690
unless it's beef. Or if we say that there's
beef stock in there, we don't put fish stock

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.320
or shellfish stock or lamb stock or pork stock,
for that matter, in any dish that doesn't

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:55.940
contain pork. I just like to respect people's
beliefs.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.330
&gt;&gt; I have another question. You said, you
know, using fresh spices is good. Do you ever

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:06.730
need to sauté those spices before you grind
them off? I know my mom does that, and that's

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.650
one of the reasons I'm-—it's seems like
more of a pain, so I'm wondering if you do

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.849
that, or you just put them in, like cumin
seeds and stuff?

00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:17.100
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: You can use-—you know, there
are certain spices that you can use whole,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.780
okay? You can use cumin seed whole, you can
use black pepper roll but pull it out, you

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:28.080
can use mustard seed whole, black cumin, fennel
seed; those you can use whole. Do you need

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.030
to cook spices? I think you do. There are
certain spices that you can use without cooking,

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:40.820
very limited, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, black
pepper, fennel seed can be used uncooked.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.340
But you can extract the flavor of the spices.
You need heat for spices to extract the maximum

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.820
flavor. So you can either do what I did and
start in with oil. That's one way you can

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.660
do it. Or you can dry toast it...
&gt;&gt; Right, that's what...

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.450
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: Okay. All the other thing is you
can grind them like I did and cook them in

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.590
oil. But if you grind them and cook them in
oil, then you only have a liquid with that.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:08.660
And in my book I mentioned, you know, best
ways to do it, but if you're going to grind

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:14.010
it, you want to make sure that you have a
liquid to prevent the seed from actually burning.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:19.180
Because if your oil is too hot, if you have
water in there, you know, at 2:12 it's going

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:25.190
to evaporate. So, you have--it's going to
bring the temperature down, okay. So, there

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.850
are recipes in Indian cuisine where they start
off especially some bars where they start

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:34.250
off with whole spices and they kind of toast
them in oil with onions and coconut and stuff,

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.690
and then they take that and they grind it.
Now, in India, you have someone with a stone

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.790
sitting over and grinding it. If I tell my
wife to do that, my bags will be outside of

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.460
the house, you know. But you could use a blender.
There is one blender make which is called-—which

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.910
one do we use at the restaurant?
&gt;&gt; Vita-Prep

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:55.980
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: Yes, it's called Vita-Prep which
is a great, great brand. Every restaurant

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:01.820
kitchen uses it, and in that you can grind
spices with the oil. So, if you want that,

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.310
it costs, well, I think, 500 bucks. But it's
a great blender.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:15.360
&gt;&gt; Where would you suggest getting fresh,
high-quality spices in the city?

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.750
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: OK, if you want to buy spices,
what you want to do is, and I'm not going

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.830
to name any of the big stores because I don't
know if they advertise on the website or not,

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:27.410
but I don't want to get into trouble, but
what you want to do is you want to go to an

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:33.420
ethnic store. You want to go to a place that
has a fair amount of, say, if you go to an

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:39.560
Indian store, a fair amount Indians and Pakistanis
going into buy them. Lexington Avenue has

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:47.770
a fair amount of stores in New York. Every
major city in the country I know has an Indian

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:52.730
spice store. In California; in New Jersey,
there are plenty of them; in Queens, there

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:59.910
are plenty of them; in Manhattan, there are
tons of them. And, if you see--because if

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:04.090
you know that if you're going to these stores
there is turnover and that there are people

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:08.940
buying. And normally what happened in India
was that spices that spices grew one time

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.260
a year. There were harvested once and they
were harvested for the whole year until the

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.550
next year when they grew again. And you'd
use them for a year. What's happening now

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:22.620
is because of packaging and we keep it for
a long time and it loses the flavor. So, if

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.050
you go to a store that has high turnover,
that's the place to buy it from. You also

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.880
want to buy small quantities, you know. You
can go to Edison, New Jersey, and you can

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.290
buy 1 kilo or 2.5 pounds of coriander seed.
I don't know if they store any 2.5 pounds

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:40.900
of coriander seed in my home, and I cook a
lot of Indian food. So you can buy it in ounces;

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:46.310
you know, 1 ounce, 2 ounces. And they're pretty
good. You can even buy them online. There're

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:52.560
tons of places that sell spices online; whole,
in small bags, 1 ounce, 2 ounces. So, that's

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.810
what I would suggest. You know, I would not
go and buy everything because, you know, if

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:02.770
you buy-—I have seen people buy half a pound
of, like, fenugreek. Fenugreek half a pound

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:07.890
is a lot. You use half a pound of fenugreek
in anything and not going to eat it, it's

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.020
going to be so bitter. The other, you know,
the other spice that they also have in this

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:17.930
recipe, which I've forgot to use is azevetido.
It's a gum and it's used with beans. It's

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:23.980
nice to put there with the chickpeas, which
I didn't. But you buy these containers which

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.020
are that big. I have a container that big
at home which last me for a year. Because

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.080
you use, like, an eight of a teaspoon when
you use it. Now, I had a new sous-chef in

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.530
the restaurant who said, "I want to buy things
in bulk," and he bought six cases of azevetido,

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:42.780
which I had to throw it because we could not
use them. It was so much. So, you want to

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.140
be careful what you buy and how much you buy.
Like, you know, the other thing with—-if

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:52.680
you buy green cardamom and if you use-—if
you grind green cardamom and you get green

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.960
cardamom powder, okay, as soon as you grind
green cardamom, it has a half-life of 14 days.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.890
So, in 14 days it's going to lose half its
flavor. So just think about it, as it stays,

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:14.010
even if it's ground, you're losing all these
wonderful oils that help you. Has everybody

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:27.770
got everything?
&gt;&gt; So, for people who are just starting to

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:33.050
cook Indian food, what three ingredients do
think they should add to their cupboard to

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.700
start?
&gt;&gt; CARDOZ: The first three ingredients to

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:44.570
buy are cumin, turmeric, and I'd say, coriander
seed. Because you have these three things

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.500
you can do whatever—-you could do steaks.
Everybody has black-—I'm assuming everybody

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.790
has pepper in the house, everybody has chili
flakes in the house, everybody has cinnamon

00:46:52.790 --> 00:47:01.730
at home, you know, and bay leaf. So, if you
have black pepper and coriander, you can make

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:07.210
a curry out of it. If you have cumin and turmeric,
you can make a curry out of it. You can make,

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:13.330
by varying these whole spices, you can make,
like, ten different curries just playing with

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:24.450
the volume. But it's fun having fun with them.
It's not about being intimidated or, you know.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:30.291
It's not rocket science, absolutely not. It's
easy and fun and, you know. When I was—-when

00:47:30.291 --> 00:47:36.550
I went to school in Switzerland, I was dying
to eat Indian food but there was no Indian

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:42.720
food in Switzerland where I was. I was in
Bluche, in the valley mountains. And the only

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:49.880
spice they had was a curry spice that they
have which is absolutely nasty and disgusting.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.900
You know, if you're cooking, don't even go
and buy it because (a) you don't know when

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.460
it was drowned, (b) you don't know what's
in there. And you know it's got some turmeric

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.840
and it's got some fenugreek because can smell
it, but we had to use that and then it's just,

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.620
you know. If you can make your own spice blend,
it's so easy, especially today. You know,

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.280
you get a little spice blender like that,
and you can go anywhere and buy them. So,

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:17.430
it's just not hard. It's pretty simple, you
know. I've made-—I've made curries with—using

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:23.900
Bloody Marry mix at 2 o'clock in the morning
when I was a bachelor. You know, come back

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.880
from a night out drinking and you want to
eat something and there's no food in the fridge

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.350
but there's Bloody Mary mix and there's spices,
and there's potatoes. So, you make a potato

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:34.620
curry and you eat it with rice, you know.
Or a chicken curry with Bloody Mary mix, but

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:40.540
it tastes damn good, you know. But it's being
creative and using these spice mixes that

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.720
you have and, you know, as long as you have
that, the neighbors are going to complain

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.620
that you're grinding spices at 2 o'clock in
the morning. But who cares, you know? You're

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:56.290
happy. Well, thank you.
