00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.529
It is perhaps the most famous photograph ever
taken. It came into being almost by accident,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.070
when on the morning of Christmas Eve 1968
one of the astronauts aboard the Apollo 8

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.640
spacecraft, Bill Anders, turned the camera
from the supposed object of their mission

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.980
– the moon – towards a spherical, brightly
glowing, blue object rising above the lunar

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:39.200
horizon. This was Earth, our irreplaceable
planetary home. Suddenly humankind was able

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.500
to view its habitat with a gaze hitherto reserved
for the entity we have termed God. It was

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.870
a moment that invited and continues to offer
us a fundamental change in perspective. Although

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.510
the theory that the earth was a sphere had
been proposed by ancient Greek thinkers from

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.379
Pythagoras onwards, such thinking remained
theoretical for hundreds more years, and still

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.670
remains today, as we make our way laboriously
around our streets, mountains and seas, largely

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.130
implausible. Though the Earth typically appears
inexhaustibly vast to us, suddenly it emerged

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.130
as what it truly is: just another medium-sized
planet in one solar system, in one galaxy,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.450
in a mind-defyingly infinite universe. Though
it might seem far for an earth-dweller to

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.930
journey from NY to Sydney, or from one pole
to another, these are, in the greater scheme,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.000
the trails of an ant. Earthrise allowed us
to feel a kind of care, even love, for the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.390
planet. Viewed from space, we see it protected
from terrific bombardments of meteorites and

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.090
solar and cosmic rays, and made habitable,
only by an infinitesimally thin membrane – which

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.220
it is now wholly in our remit to destroy.
Our oxygen rich atmosphere – the difference

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.500
between a barren desert planet like Mars,
and our lush, abundant, breathable home – appears

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.440
in the photo as the vaguest of halos. From
up here, it is possible to feel so much more

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.880
generous towards the human project than we
normally do. We can smile gently at humanity

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.361
and perhaps admire it a little too. Everyone’s
faults drop away against such majesty. We

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.950
are tugged towards being more patient and
warm around our fellow ants spinning with

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.151
us in endless darkness. We might like to tell
one or two of these ants in franker, more

00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:51.530
direct terms how fond we are of them. On the
planet, right now, babies are being born,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.840
adults are crying themselves to sleep, people
are on their knees hoping for redemption.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.020
There is struggle, error, folly and hope.
The photograph urges us towards a higher form

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.230
of kindness and forgiveness. There is – probably
– no divine being to look down on us and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.450
help us: it’s only us responsible for ourselves
and our fragile home. We may have to adopt

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.040
in and for ourselves some of the attitudes
we once projected onto divinities. If there

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.849
were to be a new religion, one without a god,
a secular religion set up to remind us of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.280
our need to love, to be kind and to forgive,
then Earthrise might fittingly be its logo

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.760
and its central image. But even without such
a fanciful though perhaps necessary creation,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.900
Earthrise deserves a place on the kitchen
wall, on our screen savers and in our minds,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.240
a constant reminder of our power, our vulnerability
and our deep responsibility to one another.
