00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.780
So, there are a lot of
open source systems for

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.840
different aspects of monitoring.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.640
This is a really vast subject, so
we can't really cover all of it.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.210
Couple of important points, one you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
won't be able to monitor every aspect
of your system with only a single tool.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.740
That's okay.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.050
Pick a couple.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.420
It's important though that whatever
monitoring systems you pick be

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.930
generally accessible within
your organization so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.580
that other people can
learn from them as well.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.060
One of the most flexible
approaches to monitoring

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.600
involves having some kind
of key value data store,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.380
with a simple API to dump in
whatever values you want to monitor.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.320
This is the approach favored by
Graphite, InfluxDB, etcetera.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.460
Then you have various front
ends to visualize the data.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.390
Graphite offers it's
own web front end for

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.310
it's data, Graphite also works well for
a more flexible display.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.730
And there are a lot
of other systems that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.940
are mentioned in the instructor notes.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.990
Now for the app server you've
been working within this class,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.280
we've provided a Graphite monitoring
server with symmetric setup.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.990
You should check it out.
