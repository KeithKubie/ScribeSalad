00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:03.136
We all know that global warming
is perhaps the biggest threat

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.804
facing humanity
over the next 50 years,

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.707
but it's not all bad news
according to Yahoo.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.042
According to a recent study,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.710
rising temperatures
will actually be good

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.679
for getting folks in
North Dakota out of the house.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.716
You never even thought
about that part of it.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.818
-(applause and cheering)
-We never even thought about it.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:22.555
You, selfish,
underwater Hawaiians,

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.891
it's not all about you
all of the time!

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.059
ORLANDO JONES:
Yeah.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.527
-What about North Dakota?
-Yeah.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.029
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:32.665
For some people,
global warming is a good thing.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.867
There are at least
40 meth-addicted frackers

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.903
and a dozen or so
buffalo veterinarians

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.204
who stand to benefit

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.540
from it being a little nicer
outside for once.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:44.610
-So maybe open your (bleep)
minds... -(applause, cheering)

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:47.713
...and think of some of the
benefits of global warming.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.116
I mean sure, sure, the mosquito
population will skyrocket

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.618
and give most of the southern
hemisphere super Ebola,

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.089
but for a lucky few, they'll get
to sit out on their porch

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.491
on a balmy February night
in North Dakota

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.327
and get radiated by the sunset
with their pet polar bear

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.129
who now will look like this,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.966
-and great, I say. Fun.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.269
That's what they look like
when you shave them.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.206
-Every polar bear.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.575
Polar bears look all scary,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.143
but underneath,
just a little wiener.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.778
-Just...
-(laughter)

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.948
So, comedians, I've listed
a couple, but I'm sure there are

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.584
a lot more ways to approach this
very optimistically.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.720
What are some other benefits
of global warming?

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.289
-Orlan... I'm sorry. Nimesh.
-Donald Trump

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:32.592
will spend his winters
in Swamp Mar-a-Lago.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.026
-HARDWICK: Yes. Points.
Very good. -(laughter)

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.262
-(applause and cheering)
-Orlando.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.763
Well, if it's hot as balls,

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.032
we know nudist colonies
are gonna be lit.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:41.968
-HARDWICK: All right. Points.
-(laughter) -Yeah.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.304
-Very good. -Lit!
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.173
-Arden.
-Um, it'll only

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.809
take 15 minutes to fly
from coast to coast, Chris.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.244
-HARDWICK: Yes.
-(laughter)

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.012
-Points.
-Yes! -Finally.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.680
In-flight movie's
just gonna be a clip

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:58.513
-of the Cash Me Outside Girl.
-HARDWICK: Nope. -(laughter)
