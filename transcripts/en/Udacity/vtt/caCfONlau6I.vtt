00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.119
Start with decision tables. This is a common way for, getting a,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.700
getting your head wrapped around a situation where there are various different,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.820
states that can affect ultimate behavior of the system. If you,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.070
if you think about decision tables in terms of input conditions and and, and,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.760
and responses to those inputs. That is combinations of inputs yielding results.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.330
That's where the term netwire comes from. The table will have columns.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.080
Some of which correspond to the inputs and the remainder will correspond to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.090
the outputs. And then each of the rows is going to correspond to a different

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.760
combination of input values. Let's imagine that we have a workshop and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380
there are three switches, okay. Each of the switches can have on and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.480
off as possible values, okay? So we're going to have three columns and

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.170
eight rows. Where did the eight come from? Well, if we have three switches,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.329
two possible values for each switch, that's two to the third or

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.690
eight. Let's assume that the three switches control two output devices.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.670
Maybe an overhead light and maybe a, a power drill.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.030
The third switch is a master switch which controls all the electricity in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.460
the workshop. Well here's the, here's the decision table for this situation.

00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:39.790
Partitioned the columns into three input columns for

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.000
the three different switches and two Output columns for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.100
the lights and the motor on the power drill. Each of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.280
the rows correspond to one of the possible combinations of the values for

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.320
the input switches. Due to the third,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.490
eight different rows there. For each of the combinations of the inputs

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.800
there'll be a resulting situation as far as the outputs are concerned. So

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.630
for example, if the master control switch is off then it doesn't matter

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.010
the positions of the other switches, both the lights and the motor will be off.
