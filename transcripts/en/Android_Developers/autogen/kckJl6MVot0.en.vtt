devices are that it should be easy to

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:12.690
devices are that it should be easy to
 

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.930
devices are that it should be easy to
consume lots of content and but do a

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:14.940
consume lots of content and but do a
 

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.970
consume lots of content and but do a
little bit of content creation but the

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980
little bit of content creation but the
 

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.700
little bit of content creation but the
collaboration aspect is part of content

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:19.710
collaboration aspect is part of content
 

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.040

creation and the sharing of information
 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.530
creation and the sharing of information
is part of creation and consumption so

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540
is part of creation and consumption so
 

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.000
is part of creation and consumption so
basically you should be able to do a

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.010
basically you should be able to do a
 

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.850
basically you should be able to do a
little bit of both now when you're on

retrieval tasks and many of these tasks
 

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.640
retrieval tasks and many of these tasks
might be urgent in this scenario you

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.650
might be urgent in this scenario you
 

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.800
might be urgent in this scenario you
might just want to get visibility into

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:36.810
might just want to get visibility into
 

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.570
might just want to get visibility into
others activities for example you might

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:38.580
others activities for example you might
 

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.820
others activities for example you might
want to get commute updates and see when

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:40.830
want to get commute updates and see when
 

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.350

arrived at their destination or where
 

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.250
arrived at their destination or where
they are in transit and so on that'd be

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260
they are in transit and so on that'd be
 

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.160
they are in transit and so on that'd be
really cool at the multi-screen world

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
really cool at the multi-screen world

report suggests that people use
 

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.850
report suggests that people use
smartphones when doing this which made

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860
smartphones when doing this which made
 

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.310
smartphones when doing this which made
sense however the other people in this

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320

expectations is really complicated and
 

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:06.800
expectations is really complicated and
there are so many constituents that you

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:06.810
there are so many constituents that you
 

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.880
there are so many constituents that you
have to keep in mind when doing this

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:07.890
have to keep in mind when doing this
 

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.120
have to keep in mind when doing this
Google now is a great example so what if

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.130
Google now is a great example so what if
 

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.250
Google now is a great example so what if
you do if you turn on commute sharing it

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260
you do if you turn on commute sharing it
 

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.870
you do if you turn on commute sharing it
will notify people in the circles that

will notify people in the circles that
 

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.070
will notify people in the circles that
you've chosen to actually get these

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.080
you've chosen to actually get these
 

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.930
you've chosen to actually get these
updates without you actually having to

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.329
updates without you actually having to
do anything on your smartphone they get

do anything on your smartphone they get
 

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:22.010
do anything on your smartphone they get
notifications and you just go about your

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.020
notifications and you just go about your
 

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.579
notifications and you just go about your
day finally let's look at what happens

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:25.589
day finally let's look at what happens
 

00:12:25.589 --> 00:12:27.350
day finally let's look at what happens
when we focus on the mood aspect of

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360
when we focus on the mood aspect of
 

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.020
when we focus on the mood aspect of
context where you are how much time you

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.030
context where you are how much time you
 

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.150
context where you are how much time you
have and what tasks you need to perform

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160
have and what tasks you need to perform
 

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.040
have and what tasks you need to perform
have a big impact on your mood or

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.050
have a big impact on your mood or
 

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.290
have a big impact on your mood or
attitude when performing these tasks and

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300
attitude when performing these tasks and
 

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.840
attitude when performing these tasks and
again this drives your expectations in a

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:38.850
again this drives your expectations in a
 

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.640
again this drives your expectations in a
big way I know this is complicated but

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:40.650
big way I know this is complicated but
 

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.230
big way I know this is complicated but
it's complicated because it is complex

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240
it's complicated because it is complex
 

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.810
it's complicated because it is complex
it's a crazy interplay yeah exactly so

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
it's a crazy interplay yeah exactly so
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.040
it's a crazy interplay yeah exactly so
every little thing is related to

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.050
every little thing is related to
 

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.350
every little thing is related to
everything else so if you're at home or

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360
everything else so if you're at home or
 

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.840
everything else so if you're at home or
at work and doing research tasks with

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:50.850
at work and doing research tasks with
 

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.610
at work and doing research tasks with
lots of time to complete them

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620
lots of time to complete them
 

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.490
lots of time to complete them
then you might be in a relaxed mood you

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500
then you might be in a relaxed mood you
 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.250
then you might be in a relaxed mood you
might be lazy and open to collaboration

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260
