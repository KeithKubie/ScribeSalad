we're also expanding their size so even

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:37.040
we're also expanding their size so even
 

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.370
we're also expanding their size so even
in the collapse form the the user can

in the collapse form the the user can
 

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.440
in the collapse form the the user can
see up to three lines of text which

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:41.450
see up to three lines of text which
 

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.660
see up to three lines of text which
obviously makes it way easier to parse a

obviously makes it way easier to parse a
notification and this also happens

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:46.460
notification and this also happens
 

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.100
notification and this also happens
happens on a lock screen so if you have

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.110
happens on a lock screen so if you have
 

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.420
happens on a lock screen so if you have
been away from your phone and come back

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:49.430
been away from your phone and come back
 

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.580
been away from your phone and come back
you can immediately see like what is

you can immediately see like what is
 

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.130
you can immediately see like what is
relevant and get back to it

actually relevant but not doesn't

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260
actually relevant but not doesn't
 

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.410
actually relevant but not doesn't
require immediate attention all right so

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:42.420
require immediate attention all right so
 

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.890
require immediate attention all right so
this completes the visual notification

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900
this completes the visual notification
 

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.780
this completes the visual notification
hierarchy and let's get to the next

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:47.790
hierarchy and let's get to the next
 

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.420
hierarchy and let's get to the next
feature we are working on so the other

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:50.430
feature we are working on so the other
 

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.800
feature we are working on so the other
feature we're working on is called

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:51.810
feature we're working on is called
 

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.200
feature we're working on is called
visual stability and let's consider a

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.210
visual stability and let's consider a
 

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.050
visual stability and let's consider a
situation you may be encounter every day

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:57.060
situation you may be encounter every day
 

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.920
situation you may be encounter every day
you're carefully crafting in you reply

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:00.930
you're carefully crafting in you reply
 

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.220
you're carefully crafting in you reply
to maybe your friend Salim and just

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.230
to maybe your friend Salim and just
 

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.150
to maybe your friend Salim and just
about when you were to hit Send then

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:08.160
about when you were to hit Send then
 

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.740
about when you were to hit Send then
obviously the whole notification just

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:09.750
obviously the whole notification just
 

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.710
obviously the whole notification just
gonna reorder and it sucks and probably

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720
gonna reorder and it sucks and probably
 

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.200
gonna reorder and it sucks and probably
you hit the wrong notification and magic

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.210
you hit the wrong notification and magic
 

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.490
you hit the wrong notification and magic
stuff happens and you don't know what

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500
stuff happens and you don't know what
 

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.470
stuff happens and you don't know what
happened and of course this is a really

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480
happened and of course this is a really
 

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.570
happened and of course this is a really
bad experience and we want to prove on

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580
bad experience and we want to prove on
 

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.450
bad experience and we want to prove on
it and so the goal sans relativism poll

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460
it and so the goal sans relativism poll
 

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.340
it and so the goal sans relativism poll
don't reorder notifications while you're

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.350
don't reorder notifications while you're
 

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.260
don't reorder notifications while you're
looking at them and reality

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:27.270
looking at them and reality
 

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.330
looking at them and reality
unfortunately be slightly harder than it

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340
unfortunately be slightly harder than it
 

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.820
unfortunately be slightly harder than it
sounds because if you get a new message

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:31.830
sounds because if you get a new message
 

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.530
sounds because if you get a new message
for example you still want to know about

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:33.540
for example you still want to know about
 

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.830
for example you still want to know about
that right and yeah we actually like

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840
that right and yeah we actually like
 

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.330
that right and yeah we actually like
this feature so much that it's even

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340
this feature so much that it's even
 

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.580
this feature so much that it's even
available in NMR to new backported it

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:40.590
available in NMR to new backported it
 

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.830

personally I'm all about notifications
 

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.030
personally I'm all about notifications
and I'm all about animations with

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.040
and I'm all about animations with
 

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.550
and I'm all about animations with
notifications I care about every little

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:55.560
notifications I care about every little
 

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.350
notifications I care about every little
detail and even like the slightest

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360
detail and even like the slightest
 

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.120
detail and even like the slightest
little thing should be pixel perfect and

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.130
little thing should be pixel perfect and
 

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:04.310
little thing should be pixel perfect and
animated and in Android oh my designers

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320
animated and in Android oh my designers
 

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.159
animated and in Android oh my designers
and my co-workers let me off my leash a

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:07.169
and my co-workers let me off my leash a
 

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:09.950
and my co-workers let me off my leash a
little bit and I was allowed to go wild

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960
little bit and I was allowed to go wild
 

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.830
little bit and I was allowed to go wild
so I created this animation between an

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840
so I created this animation between an
 

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.799
so I created this animation between an
expand and basically where we expand the

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:15.809
expand and basically where we expand the
 

00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:17.840
expand and basically where we expand the
notification shade I think this slide

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:17.850
notification shade I think this slide
 

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.090
notification shade I think this slide
explains it way better than I ever could

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100
explains it way better than I ever could
 

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.360
explains it way better than I ever could
but the key goal essentially is to

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.370
but the key goal essentially is to
 

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.249
but the key goal essentially is to
create a sense of object permanence a

00:23:25.249 --> 00:23:25.259
create a sense of object permanence a
 

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:27.499
create a sense of object permanence a
user should always know where these

00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:27.509
user should always know where these
 

00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:29.360
user should always know where these
notifications are no matter redditor

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.370
notifications are no matter redditor
 

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.419
notifications are no matter redditor
collapse in an icon form in the in the

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:32.429
collapse in an icon form in the in the
 

00:23:32.429 --> 00:23:34.820
collapse in an icon form in the in the

the tool notification shade and

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120
the tool notification shade and
 

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.580
the tool notification shade and
obviously that needs to be a really nice

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:37.590
obviously that needs to be a really nice
 

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.249
obviously that needs to be a really nice
transition between those as you can see

00:23:40.249 --> 00:23:40.259
transition between those as you can see
 

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:42.289
transition between those as you can see
by the way notifications appear on the

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299
by the way notifications appear on the
 

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:44.060
by the way notifications appear on the
very bottom and they appear like as

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.070
very bottom and they appear like as
 

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.100
very bottom and they appear like as
overflow dots to indicate an overflow

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.110
overflow dots to indicate an overflow
 

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.690
overflow dots to indicate an overflow
and they go away when you close the

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700
and they go away when you close the
 

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.930
and they go away when you close the
shade all right let me hand it over to

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940
shade all right let me hand it over to
 

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.940
shade all right let me hand it over to
Dan to talk about channels and other

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:52.950
Dan to talk about channels and other
 

00:23:52.950 --> 00:24:00.350
Dan to talk about channels and other
nice features thanks Lee oh hi it's me

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360
nice features thanks Lee oh hi it's me
 

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.730
nice features thanks Lee oh hi it's me
again

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740
again
 

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.619
again
notification channels is probably the

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:03.629
notification channels is probably the
 

00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:06.590
notification channels is probably the
biggest piece of new API surface in the

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600
biggest piece of new API surface in the
 

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.539
biggest piece of new API surface in the
notification system so and there's a lot

00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:08.549
notification system so and there's a lot
 

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:09.830
notification system so and there's a lot
of interesting design decisions there

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840
of interesting design decisions there
 

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.159
of interesting design decisions there
let's talk about it okay so let's just

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:13.169
let's talk about it okay so let's just
 

00:24:13.169 --> 00:24:14.990
let's talk about it okay so let's just
start with like the base assumption that

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000
start with like the base assumption that
 

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.210
start with like the base assumption that
apps post a lot of notifications like

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220
apps post a lot of notifications like
 

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.919
apps post a lot of notifications like
like kind of a lot but okay because

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:21.929
like kind of a lot but okay because
 

00:24:21.929 --> 00:24:24.919
like kind of a lot but okay because
users like notifications also kind of a

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:24.929
users like notifications also kind of a
 

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:26.840
users like notifications also kind of a
lot so there's actually a good state of

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:26.850
lot so there's actually a good state of
 

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.539
lot so there's actually a good state of
affairs and to tell you the full story

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:29.549
affairs and to tell you the full story
 

00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:31.700
affairs and to tell you the full story
of channels I need to sort of stop for a

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:31.710
of channels I need to sort of stop for a
 

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.779
of channels I need to sort of stop for a
second and talk about my friend here it

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:35.789
second and talk about my friend here it
 

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:37.690
second and talk about my friend here it
might be your friend isn't my friend

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:37.700
might be your friend isn't my friend
 

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.970
might be your friend isn't my friend
this is the neurotransmitter dopamine

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:39.980
this is the neurotransmitter dopamine
 

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.139
this is the neurotransmitter dopamine
it's actually cartoon of the

00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:42.149
it's actually cartoon of the
 

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:43.430
it's actually cartoon of the
neurotransmitter dopamine which is fine

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440
neurotransmitter dopamine which is fine
 

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.379
neurotransmitter dopamine which is fine
because I'm not a neuroscientist so you

00:24:45.379 --> 00:24:45.389
because I'm not a neuroscientist so you
 

00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:46.580
because I'm not a neuroscientist so you
shouldn't really trust anything I say

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:46.590
shouldn't really trust anything I say
 

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.619
shouldn't really trust anything I say
about brain chemistry anyway but let's

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:48.629
about brain chemistry anyway but let's
 

00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:50.869
about brain chemistry anyway but let's
just say that this is dopamine it's

00:24:50.869 --> 00:24:50.879
just say that this is dopamine it's
 

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:52.399
just say that this is dopamine it's
really really complicated how it works

00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:52.409
really really complicated how it works
 

00:24:52.409 --> 00:24:54.049
really really complicated how it works
in the brain and the body it's involved

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059
in the brain and the body it's involved
 

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:55.580
in the brain and the body it's involved
in all kinds of stuff but what we're

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:55.590
in all kinds of stuff but what we're
 

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:00.889
in all kinds of stuff but what we're
gonna talk about today is the things

00:25:00.889 --> 00:25:00.899
gonna talk about today is the things
 

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:03.649
gonna talk about today is the things
that is associated with that I show here

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659
that is associated with that I show here
 

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:05.629
that is associated with that I show here
so things like anticipation of reward

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:05.639
so things like anticipation of reward
 

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:09.499
so things like anticipation of reward
motivation seeking rewards your

00:25:09.499 --> 00:25:09.509
motivation seeking rewards your
 

00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:14.299
motivation seeking rewards your
attention salience your sort of you're

00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:14.309
attention salience your sort of you're
 

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:16.610
attention salience your sort of you're
in the moment and looking for something

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620
in the moment and looking for something
 

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.590
in the moment and looking for something
including the

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600
including the
 

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.930
including the
right word for that slide it's basically

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:19.940
right word for that slide it's basically
 

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.419
right word for that slide it's basically
the user engagement chemical in your

00:25:22.419 --> 00:25:22.429
the user engagement chemical in your
 

00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:27.370
the user engagement chemical in your
brain and so bringing this back bring

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:27.380
brain and so bringing this back bring
 

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.120

Android comm but this is effectively how
this is going to work to set up your

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:30.570
this is going to work to set up your
 

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.660
this is going to work to set up your
notification channels you create one the

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:32.670
notification channels you create one the
 

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.390
notification channels you create one the
most important thing is the channel ID

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:35.400
most important thing is the channel ID
 

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.220
most important thing is the channel ID
which is the first parameter to the

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.230
which is the first parameter to the
 

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.480
which is the first parameter to the
constructor there that's just a string

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:38.490
constructor there that's just a string
 

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.670
constructor there that's just a string
and it's totally whatever you want it to

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:40.680
and it's totally whatever you want it to
 

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.500
and it's totally whatever you want it to
be it becomes the unique identifier for

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:42.510
be it becomes the unique identifier for
 

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.400
be it becomes the unique identifier for
that channel when you post a

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:43.410
that channel when you post a
 

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.100
that channel when you post a
notification later everything else about

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.510
straightforward you give it a localized
string that the user can understand is

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520
string that the user can understand is
 

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.970
string that the user can understand is
the title you give it the importance

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980
the title you give it the importance
 

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.440
the title you give it the importance
that you would like for it to have you

a little while let's let's walk through

so here's an example of something that
 

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.630
so here's an example of something that
an app could do oh well if the user
