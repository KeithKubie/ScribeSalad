Hi.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.216
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; I'm Gabrielle.

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:03.762
&gt;&gt; Edith.

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.319
&gt;&gt; So good to meet you.

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.899
You just talked to Jessica, right?

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.535
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had a great conversation.

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:09.137
I was just showing her
a prototype of my app.

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:10.278
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:12.026
I totally want to check that out later,

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:15.316
but I want to start off with a few
technical questions about Objective C.

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:16.079
We can get those out of the way.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.298
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:20.574
&gt;&gt; Can you give me an example of
when you would use NSArray and

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.697
when you would use NSMutableArray?

00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:24.613
&gt;&gt; Help me out.

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:26.215
How do I answer this?
