00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.811
“From the tip of every branch,

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.691
like a fat purple fig,

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:13.381
a wonderful future beckoned and winked…

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.571
but choosing one meant 
losing all the rest,

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:19.541
and, as I sat there, unable to decide,

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.951
the figs began to wrinkle and go black,

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:27.461
and, one by one, they plopped 
to the ground at my feet.”

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.599
In this passage from Sylvia Plath’s 
"The Bell Jar,"

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.819
a young woman imagines 
an uncertain future–

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.909
and speaks to the universal fear

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.269
of becoming paralyzed

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.799
by the prospect of making 
the wrong choice.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.799
Although she considered other careers,

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.989
Plath chose the artist’s way.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.749
Poetry was her calling.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.779
Under her shrewd eye and pen,

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.409
everyday objects became haunting images:

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.559
a “new statue in a drafty museum,”

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.709
a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap.

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:59.749
Fiercely intelligent, 
penetrating and witty,

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.799
Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.029
She used poetry to explore her own states 
of mind

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.859
in the most intimate terms,

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.589
and her breathtaking perspectives 
on emotion,

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:14.969
nature and art continue 
to captivate and resonate.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.784
In her first collection of poems,

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:17.804
"The Colossus,"

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:20.324
she wrote of a feeling of nothingness:

00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:23.454
"white: it is a complexion of the mind.”

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:24.274
At the same time,

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:26.194
she found solace in nature,

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.334
from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,”

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.974
to white flowers that “tower and topple,”

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:34.074
to blue mussels “clumped like bulbs.”

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.634
After "The Colossus" she 
published "The Bell Jar,"

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:37.744
her only novel,

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:41.524
which fictionalizes the time she spent 
working for Mademoiselle magazine

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:43.574
in New York during college.

00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:46.184
The novel follows its heroine, Esther,

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:49.044
as she slides into a severe 
depressive episode,

00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:52.094
but also includes wickedly funny and 
shrewd depictions

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:56.174
of snobby fashion parties 
and dates with dull men.

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:59.104
Shortly after the publication 
of "The Bell Jar,"

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:02.304
Plath died by suicide at age 30.

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:07.074
Two years later, the collection of poems
she wrote in a burst of creative energy

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:09.128
during the months before her death

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.048
was published under the title "Ariel."

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.228
Widely considered her masterpiece,

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:17.188
Ariel exemplifies the honesty 
and imagination

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.998
Plath harnessed to capture her pain.

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:22.578
In one of "Ariel's" most forceful poems,

00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:27.808
"Lady Lazarus," she explores her attempts 
to take her own life through Lazarus,

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:30.461
the biblical figure who rose 
from the dead.

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.861
She writes, “and I a smiling woman/
I am only thirty/

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:38.325
And like the cat I have
nine times to die.”

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.135
But the poem is also a testament 
to survival:

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:45.115
“I rise with my red hair/
And I eat men like air.”

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:48.825
This unflinching language has made Plath 
an important touchstone

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.305
for countless other readers and writers

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.815
who sought to break the silence

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:57.355
surrounding issues of trauma, 
frustration, and sexuality.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:01.962
"Ariel" is also filled with moving 
meditations on heartbreak and creativity.

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.932
The title poem begins “Stasis in darkness/

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:10.922
Then the substanceless blue/
Pour of tor and distances.”

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:14.642
This sets the scene for a naked ride 
on horseback in the early morning—

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:19.232
one of Plath’s most memorable expressions
of the elation of creative freedom.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:22.302
But it is also full of foreboding 
imagery,

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:25.582
such as “a child's cry” that “melts 
in the wall”

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:28.552
and a “red/eye, the cauldron 
of morning.”

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:31.112
This darkness is echoed throughout 
the collection,

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:35.892
which includes controversial references 
to the holocaust and the Kamikazes.

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:40.680
Even the relics of seemingly happier times
are described as crucifying the author:

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.394
“My husband and child smiling out 
of the family photo;

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:49.484
Their smiles catch onto my skin, 
little smiling hooks.”

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:53.051
Her domestic dissatisfaction and her 
husband’s mistreatment of her

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.981
are constant themes in her later poetry.

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.911
After her death, he inherited her estate,

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:03.261
and has been accused of excluding 
some of her work from publication.

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:06.943
Despite these possible omissions 
and her untimely death,

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:10.013
what survives is one of the most 
extraordinary bodies of work

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:12.173
by a twentieth century poet.

00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:15.443
While her work can be shocking in 
its rage and trauma,

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:18.063
Plath casts her readers as witnesses–

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:21.063
not only to the truth of her 
psychological life,

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:26.583
but to her astounding ability to express 
what often remains inexpressible.
