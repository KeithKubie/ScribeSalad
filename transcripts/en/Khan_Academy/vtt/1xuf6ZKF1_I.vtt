00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.610
We're now going to learn how
to go from mixed numbers to

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.680
improper fractions
and vice versa.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.120
So first a little
bit of terminology.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.490
What is a mixed number?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.350
Well, you've probably seen
someone write, let's

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.850
say, 2 and 1/2.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.470
This is a mixed number.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.950
You're saying why is
it a mixed number?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.520
Well, because we're including a
whole number and a fraction.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.630
So that's why it's
a mixed number.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.510
It's a whole number
mixed with a fraction.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.240
So 2 and 1/2.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.760
And I think you have a sense
of what 2 and 1/2 is.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.050
It's some place halfway
between 2 and 3.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.086
And what's an
improper fractional?

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:36.260
Well an Improper fraction is a
fraction where the numerator is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.410
larger than the denominator.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.330
So let's give an example
of an improper fraction.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.140
I'm just going to pick
some random numbers.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.760
Let's say I had 23 over 5.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.390
This is an improper fraction.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.090
Why?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.290
Because 23 is larger than 5.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.030
It's that simple.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.450
It turns out that you can
convert an improper fraction

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.040
into a mixed number or a
mixed number into an

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.360
improper fraction.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.790
So let's start with the latter.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.380
Let's learn how to do a
mixed number into an

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.600
improper fraction.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
So first I'll just show you
kind of just the basic

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.390
systematic way of doing it.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.190
It'll always give you the right
answer, and then hopefully I'll

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.110
give you a little intuition
for why it works.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.875
So if I wanted to convert 2 and
1/2 into an improper fraction

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.900
or I want to unmix it you could
say, all I do is I take the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.190
denominator in the fraction
part, multiply it by the whole

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.150
number, and add the numerator.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.130
So let's do that.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580
I think if we do enough
examples you'll

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.600
get the pattern.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.340
So 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.040
So let's write that.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.330
It's 2 times 2 plus 1,
and that's going to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.600
be the new numerator.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.320
And it's going to be all of
that over the old denominator.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.543
So that equals 5/2.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.410
So 2 and 1/2 is equal to 5/2.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.260
Let's do another one.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.050
Let's say I had 4 and 2/3.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
This is equal to -- so this
is going to be all over 3.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.490
We keep the
denominator the same.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.180
And then new numerator is
going to be 3 times 4 plus 2.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.040
So it's going to be 3 times 4,
and then you're going to add 2.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.640
Well that equals 3 times 4 --
order of operations, you always

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.730
do multiplication first, and
that's actually the way

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.940
I taught it how to
convert this anyway.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.240
3 times 4 is 12 plus 2 is 14.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.340
So that equals 14 over 3.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.030
Let's do another one.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:48.710
Let's say I had 6 and 17/18.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.520
I gave myself a hard problem.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.450
Well, we just keep the
denominator the same.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.192
And then new numerator is
going to be 18 times 6

00:02:57.192 --> 00:03:03.960
or 6 times 18 plus 17.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.200
Well 6 times 18.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.010
Let's see, that's 60 plus
48 it's 108, so that

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.910
equals 108 plus 17.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.310
All that over 18.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.070
108 plus 17 is equal
to 125 over 18.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.150
So, 6 and 17/18 is
equal to 125 over 18.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.100
Let's do a couple more.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.810
And in a couple minutes I'm
going to teach you how to go

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.700
the other way, how to go from
an improper fraction

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.640
to a mixed number.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.680
And this one I'm going to try
to give you a little bit of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.850
intuition for, why what I'm
teaching you actually works.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.050
So let's say 2 and 1/4.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.920
If we use the -- I guess you'd
call it a system that I just

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:04.140
showed you -- that equals
4 times 2 plus 1 over 4.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.720
Well that equals, 4 times 2
is 8 plus 1 is 9, 9 over 4.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.110
I want to give you an intuition
for why this actually works.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.150
So 2 and 1/4, let's actually
draw that, see what

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.280
it looks like.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.200
So let's put this back into
kind of the pie analogy.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.130
So that's equal to one pie.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.040
Two pies.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.840
And then let's say
a 1/4 of a pie.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.900
A 1/4 is like this.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.560
2 and 1/4, and ignore
this, this is nothing.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.430
It's not a decimal point --
actually, let me erase it so it

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.300
doesn't confuse you even more.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.930
So go back to the
pieces of the pie.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.490
So there's 2 and
1/4 pieces of pie.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.000
And we want to re-write
this as just how many 1/4s

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.800
of pie are there total.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.770
Well if we take each of these
pieces -- I need to change the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.225
color -- if we take each of
these pieces and we divide it

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:17.800
into 1/4s, we can now say how
many total 1/4s of

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.060
pie do we have?

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:28.490
Well we have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 fourths.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.760
Makes sense, right?

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.620
2 and 1/4 is the
same thing as 9/4.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.920
And this will work
with any fraction.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.830
So let's go the other way.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.700
Let's figure out how to go
from an improper fraction

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.680
to a mixed number.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.260
Let's say I had 23 over 5.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.080
So here we go in the
opposite direction.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.290
We actually take the
denominator, we say how

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.080
many times does it go
into the numerator.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.650
And then we figure
out the remainder.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.220
So let's say 5 goes into
23 -- well, 5 goes

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.400
into 23 four times.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.890
4 times 5 is 20.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.240
And the remainder is 3.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.150
So 23 over 5, we can say
that's equal to 4 and in

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.970
the remainder 3 over 5.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.860
So it's 4 and 3/5.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.850
Let's review what we just did.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.220
We just took the denominator
and divided it into

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.140
the numerator.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.830
So 5 goes into 23 four times.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.050
And what's left over is 3.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.930
So, 5 goes into 23,
4 and 3/5 times.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.240
Or another way of saying that
is 23 over 5 is 4 and 3/5.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.270
Let's do another
example like that.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.850
Let's say 17 over 8.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.680
What does that equal
as a mixed number?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.600
You can actually do this
in your head, but I'll

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.430
write it out just so
you don't get confused.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.540
8 goes into 17 two times.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.550
2 times 8 is 16.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.380
17 minus 16 is 1.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.810
Remainder 1.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:19.060
So, 17 over 8 is equal to 2
-- that's this 2 -- and 1/8.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.610
Because we have
one 8 left over.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.200
Let me show you kind of a
visual way of representing this

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.590
too, so it actually makes sense
how this conversion is working.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.540
Let's say I had 5/2, right?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.780
So that literally means I have
5 halves, or if we go back to

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.310
the pizza or the pie analogy,
let's draw my five

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.290
halves of pizza.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.880
So let's say I have one half of
pizza here, and let's say I

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.740
have another half
of pizza here.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.530
I just flipped it over.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.340
So that's 2.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.720
So it's 1 half, 2 halves.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.570
So that's three halves.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.380
And then I have a
fourth half here.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.900
These are halves of pizza,
and then I have a fifth

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.660
half here, right?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.910
So that's 5/2.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.150
Well, if we look at this, if we
combine these two halves, this

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.750
is equal to 1 piece, I have
another piece, and then I

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.910
have half of a piece, right?

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:31.330
So that is equal to 2
and 1/2 pieces of pie.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.010
Hopefully that doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.290
And if we wanted to do this the
systematic way, we could have

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:43.580
said 2 goes into 5 -- well, 2
goes into 5 two times, and

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.560
that 2 is right here.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.170
And then 2 times 2 is 4.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.870
5 minus 4 is 1, so the
remainder is 1, and

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.050
that's what we use here.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.710
And of course, we keep the
denominator the same.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.090
So 5/2 equals 2 and 1/2.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.530
Hopefully that gives you a
sense of how to go from one

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.570
mixed number to an improper
fraction, and vice versa,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.520
from an improper fraction
to a mixed number.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.660
If you're still confused
let me know and I might

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.660
make some more modules.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.740
Have fun with the exercises.
