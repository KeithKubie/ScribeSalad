In the previous lesson, we examined some techniques for

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.540
learning about concepts from examples. But those were simple concepts that we

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.470
learned from a few examples. Concepts like arg or foo,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.250
which was our imaginary, hypothetical concept. The real world

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.780
concepts can be much more complicated than that. Consid, as an example,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.120
consider the eight animals shown here. Each picture shows a very cute

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.340
animal here. How many of these do you think are birds? Which ones are birds?
