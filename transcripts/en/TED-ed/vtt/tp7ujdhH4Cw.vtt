00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:07.513
In my case it's a little bit different

00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:12.089
because I think, probably, my parenting experience

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.048
associated with my work experience

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.878
becomes probably one of the leading elements

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:19.108
of my life.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:22.548
Trying to balance a job that is very demanding

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:24.623
in terms of intensive traveling

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.798
and having a family and a home

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:28.889
that is also very demanding

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:30.162
with some little comments

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:33.418
coming from a seven-year-old daughter

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:36.465
are often something that makes me think

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:38.700
if I'm always doing the right things,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.137
if I'm getting the right balance

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:42.522
between the effort I'm putting in my job,

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.040
which I'm very passionate about,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979
and a family that I love very much.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.957
But in the end, what is the right place

00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:51.160
and where am I making excuses

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.587
to try to make the most out of the other side?

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.919
So, it's always an interesting subject,

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:59.371
something that is very challenging.

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.860
And every time I hear one of my fellows here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.464
talking about the subject,

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.434
I'm very intrigued

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:06.931
because I try to get ideas

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.999
on how they are coping with a subject

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:13.232
that is probably a big and important one

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:14.474
for many of us,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.629
especially as you move up in positions

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:18.626
that give you a lot of responsibilities,

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:19.880
but with responsibilities,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.960
you also get this,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.079
let's say, downside.
