00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.970
A standard elevator in a
mid-rise building can hold a

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.050
maximum weight of
1 and 1/2 tons.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.220
Assuming an average adult weight
of 160 pounds, what is

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.170
the maximum number of
adults who could

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.130
safely ride the elevator?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.480
So what we need to do is we have
to get the maximum weight

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
that the elevator could hold
in terms of pounds.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970
And then say, OK, well, how
many adults is that?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.930
So they gave us the maximum
weight in terms of tons.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.070
So they say it is
1 and 1/2 tons.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.870
And it's always easier to deal
with improper fractions than

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350
mixed numbers, so let's write
this as an improper fraction.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.500
1 and 1/2 tons is the same thing
as-- well, 1 ton is 2

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.230
halves, and then you
add another 1

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.870
half, that's 3 halves.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.990
So you get 3/2 tons.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.700
Or another way to think about
it is 2 times 1 is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.640
2, plus 1 is 3.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.550
So the maximum capacity
is 3/2 tons.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's think about how
many pounds that is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And to do that, we have to
know that there are 2,000

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.769
pounds per ton.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.870
Let me write this up here.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.260
We know that there are
2,000 pounds per ton.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.240
This wasn't given in the
problem anywhere.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.300
This is something I knew from
past experience, and it's a

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.950
good thing to know,
in general, that a

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.090
ton is 2,000 pounds.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.630
So I'm going to write
it right over here.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.280
Now, how do we convert these
3/2 tons into pounds?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.640
Well, we're going to multiply it
by something, and the units

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.590
that we're going to multiply
by, we want the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.780
tons to cancel out.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.170
So we're going to want to have
tons in the denominator, so it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.520
cancels out with this
tons up here.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.760
And then we want pounds
in the numerator.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.900
And that's exactly what
we wrote up here.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.760
There are 2,000 pounds for every
1 ton, or you could just

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.640
say 2,000 pounds per ton.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880
You could put the 1 there, but
it doesn't really change the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.940
expression.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.260
Now, if we multiply 3/2 tons
times 2,000 pounds per ton,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.030
what'll happen is that
the tons cancel out.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.240
That was the whole point of
multiplying it by this.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:15.860
And we would be left with 3/2
times 2,000, and the only unit

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.110
left is pounds.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.740
And if you do it this way,
you'll never get confused.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.420
You'll know that the units
cancel out so you're getting

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.390
the right units.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.370
But if you just think about it
in your mind, it should also

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.430
make sense.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.600
If there are 2,000 pounds per
ton and there are 1 and 1/2

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.670
tons, I should multiply 1 and
1/2 times 2,000 to get the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.460
number of pounds.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.020
That makes sense.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.860
And we know 1 and 1/2 times
2,000 is 3,000, but we'll

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.780
figure it out right here.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.110
So what is 3/2 times 2,000?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.590
Well, I just told you answer.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.130
We can actually simplify
it right over here.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.920
This is going to be 3 times
2,000/2 pounds.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.690
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.610
This will become 1,000, and this
will become 1, so it's 3

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.010
times 1,000 pounds, or this
is equal to 3,000 pounds.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.980
So what we've done so far, we've
just figured out the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.870
maximum capacity of
the elevator.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.540
It can hold 1 and 1/2 tons,
which is the exact same thing

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.440
as 3,000 pounds.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.010
Now, what we need to figure
out is 3,000 pounds is the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.030
equivalent to how many average
adults of 160 pounds?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.860
Or how many 160 pound people
would it take to weigh a total

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.320
of 3,000 pounds?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.150
Well, we can just
divide by 160.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.660
And if you want to make sure
that the units work out,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.900
remember, we want our answer to
be in terms of people, and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.060
we want the pounds
to cancel out.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.130
So we have pounds in the
numerator here, so if we

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.050
divide by pounds, the pounds
will cancel out.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.535
And then we want our leftover to
be people, or maybe person.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.820
Person, people, same thing.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.300
Let me do people.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.620
The grammar of it, singular,
plural, might make it a little

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.260
confusing, but I think you
get the general idea.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.750
Now, if we were to write this
out, what does it tell us?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.130
1 person weighs 160 pounds, so
there's one person for every

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.060
160 pounds.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.860
So notice, if we multiply these
two expressions, the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.250
pounds will cancel out.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.590
We'll be just left
with people.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.520
We're multiplying 3,000 times
1/160, but it's really just

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.490
taking 3,000 and dividing by
160, which makes sense.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.060
We have a capacity of 3,000.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.370
Each of our people weighs
160 pounds.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.080
Divide by 160.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.240
It tells you how many people.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.750
But this way, you know that
the units are working out.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.620
So this is going to be equal
to 3,000/160 people.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.340
That is the maximum capacity
of the elevator in terms of

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.550
average people.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.280
Now, what is this?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.170
Well, we can divide the
numerator and the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.940
denominator by 10.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.230
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by 10, this

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.510
becomes 300/16.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.990
If we divide 300 by 2,
this becomes 150.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.840
If we divide 16 by 2,
this becomes 8.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.620
Now, let's see, what can
we do more here?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.760
We could divide by 2 again.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.300
Let me rewrite it.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.070
So this is the same thing
as 150/8 people.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.290
150, we can divide by 2.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.860
It gives us 75.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.440
And if you take 8 divided
by 2, that is 4.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.830
So we have 75 divided
by 4 people.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.620
Let me just do that,
work it out.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.700
So you have 75 divided by 4.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.240
4 goes into 7 one time.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.900
1 times 4 is 4.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.200
You subtract.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.840
7 minus 4 is 3.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.620
Bring down this 5.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.070
4 goes into 35 eight times.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.560
8 times 4 is 32.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.810
Subtract.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.440
5 minutes 2 is 3.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.630
And then you have the decimal.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.520
We're going to the right
of the ones place.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.650
We're going to the
tenths place now.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.550
So we can bring down
a zero over here.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.730
4 goes into 30 seven times.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.890
7 times 4 is 28.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.670
You subtract.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.700
You get 2.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.560
Bring down another zero.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.250
4 goes into 20 exactly
five times.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.770
5 times 4 is 20, and
then we are done.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.610
So this expression is exactly--
the 3,000 divided by

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.740
160, or the 150 divided by 8,
the 75 divided by 4, it all

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.810
turns out to be 18.75
people is the

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.110
capacity of the elevator.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.790
18.75 average 160-pound people
would weigh 3,000 pounds.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.990
Now, do they want a decimal?

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.350
What is the maximum number of
adults who could safely ride

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.730
the elevator?

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.240
Well, if they're all going to
be average, then the maximum

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.210
number of adults, since you
can't have 3/4 of a person, or

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.860
75/100 of a person,
the maximum number

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.560
is going to be 18.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.560
If you have 19 average-weight
adults, you are going to be

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.270
too heavy, and the elevator
will fall or something.
