00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:10.100
SPEAKER: His New York
Times best-selling book,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.970
"Work Rules--

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.490
Insights from Inside
Google to Transform

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.900
How You Live and Lead," has
been published in 24 languages

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.780
and garnered numerous
book of the year honors.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.470
From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo
was senior vice president

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.290
of People Operations and a
member of Google's management

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.390
team, growing the company
from 6,000 to 72,000 employees

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.390
and ensuring the firm's culture
remained innovative and robust

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.560
throughout.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.650
During his tenure, Google
was recognized over 150 times

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.622
as an exceptional
employer, including

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.580
being named the number
one best company to work

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.920
for in the United
States seven times

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.630
and every year since 2012,
which was when I joined, so just

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.050
hold onto that one.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.340
It must have something
to do with this.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.540
Laszlo is credited with creating
the field of people analytics,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.970
the application of
academic quality rigor

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.910
and Google paced innovation
to people management.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.450
He also led development of
the Google Cloud Jobs API

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.779
and what is now known
as Google for Jobs

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:09.320
with the goal of
solving unemployment

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.960
by better matching people and
jobs through applied machine

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.060
learning and people analytics.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.381
He joined Google from the
General Electric company

00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:19.130
and beforehand was a
management consultant

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.555
at McKinsey and
Company, probably

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:22.340
a better management
consultant than what

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.900
you heard from me earlier.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810
He has served on the boards
of Pomona College, Evolve,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.722
and whoops--

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:29.180
I'm going to
mispronounce this one.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.980
I'm just going to
scoot right by it--

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.130
another one.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.950
In 2010, he was named
human resources executive

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.480
of the year, and in 2015, the
HR professional of the decade.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.650
He briefly was ranked number one
in the world in the video game

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.490
"Assassin's Creed."

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.600
Laszlo earned a
bachelor's degree

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.670
in international relations
from Pomona College,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.155
graduating in three years,
and an MBA from the Yale

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.030
School of Management.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.640
Please join me in
welcoming Laszlo.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.614
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:00.780
LASZLO BOCK: That was great.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480
I wish my mom could
have heard all that.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.725
That was terrific.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:04.600
How's everyone doing?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.520
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.330
LASZLO BOCK: OK, nothing
standing between lunch and you,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.979
except me.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.710
So I just have like
200 or 300 slides

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.990
I want to walk you through.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.560
It is-- I was going to
say it's great to be here.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.360
It's super weird, actually,
to be back at Google.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.670
I left at the end of the
year, and I don't even

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.660
think they had this
building at the time.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.610
So it's kind of--

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.340
I just got to get
that off my chest.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.660
It's also great to be here.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.010
It's actually a real
privilege, because there's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.290
a long history of
teaching and caring

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.420
about education in my
family and in my own life.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410
And so more than anything else,
I want to thank all of you

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.109
for the work you do
every single day,

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.400
for all these kids, who are
the future of this country.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.590
And I'm sure you've heard
this again and again

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.990
and again, but it's
the most important job

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.450
there is on this planet.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.640
My mother was a teacher.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.490
I was born in Romania, and
she was an English teacher.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.709
And we defected.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.250
We snuck out.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.910
We stayed in a refugee
camp in Austria.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.450
We came to the United
States in 1974,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.990
and my mother and her side
of the family are Jewish,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.770
and what she always--
and so, you know,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.160
if you're from Europe, and you
know, my mom was born in 1945,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.930
she had lost chunks of her
family in the Holocaust.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.750
They were murdered
in the Holocaust.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.600
And my mom always raised
me with the phrase,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.400
they can never take
away your education.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.050
That's one thing they, whoever
they are, can never take away.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.630
So what you're doing is
the most important thing

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.244
there is out there.

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:36.660
I dabbled a little in education
when I was in high school.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.240
I worked as a summer
school teacher

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.030
for three years teaching
a debate program

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.830
in a forensic debate thing
the school had set up.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.080
I spent a summer teaching
in Japan, teaching English,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.871
like everyone does.

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.499
I did a bunch of tutoring.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.040
It still sounds
weird, but I remember

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.582
there was one guy I
tutored, and my gift to him

00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:58.040
at the end of the tutoring was
a copy of "The Autobiography

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.770
of Malcolm X," which,
coming from me,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.340
was probably a pretty
weird thing for him.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.011
But he, years later,
followed up with me

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.010
and thanked me for that.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.560
And the impact you
have, as you know,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.930
you don't feel in that
year all the time.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.540
You feel it five years later,
10 years later, 15 years later,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.623
if you're lucky enough to
have students come back.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.380
So I'm incredibly
grateful for the work

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.390
you do, and it is
a sincere honor

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.580
to be here and be
talking to you.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.580
So I hope you find it helpful.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.760
I was-- I did leave
Google fairly recently.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.190
And this was my mission
when I was at Google.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.490
So I led People Operations,
and this was it.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.860
And the way we came
up with this mission--

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.280
find people, grow
them, keep them--

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.080
we had our first
global get-together

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.450
for the People Operations team.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.980
And literally, 30
minutes before it,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.670
we had no idea what our unifying
mission was going to be.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.220
This amazing woman
named Judy Gilbert said,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.930
isn't it just
these three things?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.750
And so the unifying spirit
behind everything we did

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.277
was find exceptional people,
grow them as fast and as much

00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:03.360
as you can, give them the
tools, the capabilities,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.609
the experiences to get better,
and then keep them here

00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:07.780
as long as possible.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.839
I recently left.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.380
I left Google at
the end of last year

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.530
and a few months ago, started
a company called Humu--

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.510
not an education
company, unfortunately.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.010
And we're actually
still in stealth,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.450
so I can't say
too much about it.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.715
But the underlying
idea is how to make

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.590
work better and the
experience of work better

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.660
for everyone in
every environment.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.240
And eventually, there may be
some education applications

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.350
for students, but
I guess the stakes

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.100
are a lot lower when dealing
with grownups than with kids.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.100
And so we start with
grownups, and then maybe we

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.500
eventually work our way to kids.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.530
But if you want
to learn more, you

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.840
can sign up to
learn at humu.com.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.140
What I really want to
talk about is an epiphany

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.110
I had when I was
at Google, which

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.750
is we spend more
time working than we

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.660
do anything else in our lives.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.060
And it's a little
crazy, because think

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.100
back to when you're, like,
in junior high school

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.154
or high school.

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:01.070
You're first starting
to discover that there's

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.528
other people in your life you
might want to be romantically

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.660
involved with, and you
start caring about stories

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.243
like "Romeo and Juliet," and you
start thinking, somewhere out

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.220
there, there is someone for me.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.320
And I'm going to find
that perfect person,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.750
and I'm going to dedicate
my life to that person.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.860
I'm going to be
fulfilled and happy.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.670
And then you grow up, and
you find the person, usually.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.070
And you never get to see them,
because you spend all your time

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.782
with all these bozos you got to
work with day in and day out.

00:06:32.782 --> 00:06:34.490
And there's a member
of our team at Humu,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.530
who, among other things,
she was a fourth grade

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.290
teacher for a few years
at a local charter school.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.060
And she said, yeah,
this is a good chart,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.143
but what you should tell
the teachers is it really

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:45.860
should just be work and sleep.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.530
Teachers don't get
the other stuff.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.260
But it seemed wrong to me
that for too many people,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.580
it's a bad experience.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.995
Work is a means to an end.

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:56.120
Amy Wrzesniewski is a
professor at Yale University,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.050
did a study that found in every
profession, about 30% of people

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.890
find meaning in it.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.356
The other 2/3, not so much.

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:04.730
And even in
professions you would

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.550
expect everybody's fired up
about the meaning, right?

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.974
Like nursing, like medicine.

00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:10.640
Like, it's fine.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.600
I understand lawyers.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.230
2/3 of them don't care.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.890
But for teachers, for people
in ministry, only about 1/3

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.250
of them, because it's hard to
sustain that your whole career.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.000
You have bad days.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.874
You have bad moments.

00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:28.920
It just becomes a job after
the first 15 or 20 or 25 years.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.890
And so what we tried to figure
out while I was at Google was,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.140
how do you solve this problem?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.550
How do you make it better?

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.030
And so they were kind
enough to let me write

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.850
a book called "Work Rules."

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.760
And the idea here was
to find some science

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.800
and some information
about Google's experience,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.240
but more importantly, about
the rest of the world,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.560
about what works to
make work better.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.060
So there's a bunch
of stuff in here.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.370
The only reason I'm
mentioning it is all the money

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.299
goes to charity.

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:55.340
Actually, the publisher
keeps whatever they want,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.110
but I have donated
and will continue

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.770
to donate all my money to
charities related to refugees

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.012
and immigration issues,
to educational access,

00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:06.470
so giving kids who otherwise
won't have access to education

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.970
or better educational
opportunities,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.660
and to veterans' charities, so.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.081
It really like-- because
there's a good chunk

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.580
of this which is Google stuff,
which isn't my story to tell.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.790
And it felt like it's not
mine to profit from either.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.450
So this is some of the
stuff that's in there.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.370
There's more in the book.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.160
I'm going to touch on
a few of these rules

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.690
that I think are particularly
apropos to teaching

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.169
and the profession of not
just being in the classroom,

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.250
but administering and running
educational institutions.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.640
And then we'll
have Q and A time,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.260
and I'm totally happy to
debate and discuss and learn,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.630
if I'm completely
wrong on this stuff,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.290
because I imagine I'm
probably 50% to 100% wrong

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.550
on the education piece.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.374
So I look forward to that
part of the discussion.

00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:58.540
But whenever I talk about
stuff, and whenever people

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.727
come to Google--

00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:01.060
you guys have seen the beanbags.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.080
You've seen the lava lamps.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.330
You've seen, like, you know,
like clearly this company

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.150
spends money on people.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.540
And I was once giving
a talk in Chicago

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.630
to a group of heads of HR, and
somebody said, well, at Google,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.422
you can do this.

00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:15.880
You got all the
money in the world.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.380
You got 30% profit margins.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.130
You're everywhere.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.010
You got-- of course, you can do
all these things to make work

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.840
better for your employees.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.870
I'm an insurance company
on a state pension fund.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.560
I can't do this.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.125
And before I could respond,
somebody stood up in the room

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.500
and raised his
hand, and he said,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.120
well, actually, basically,
what they're talking about

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.980
is giving people freedom.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.170
And freedom is free.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.630
Giving people in your
workforce more freedom

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.880
doesn't cost you
anything, except giving up

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.420
a little bit of control and
allowing them to do things.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.170
And then in the course
of writing the book

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.122
and being at Google in
sessions like these,

00:09:51.122 --> 00:09:53.580
there's all these companies
from very different industries,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.160
very different businesses,
very different economics,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.110
who look very different from
Google but feel very similar.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.070
So my favorite example is
a company called Wegmans.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.730
Is anyone here
from the Northeast?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.990
Any Wegmans fans?

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.156
AUDIENCE: I just went there.

00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:09.100
It was awesome.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.766
LASZLO BOCK: He said
he just went there.

00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:11.640
It was awesome.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.330
In 2006, Google was named,
for the first time, the best

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.190
company to work for in America.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.440
And the year before,
Wegmans had been

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.970
named best company to work for.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.740
So I was asked to be
on a panel together

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.080
with this guy named
Jack DePeters, who's

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.580
the COO of Wegmans.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.140
And the person
organizing the panel

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.510
thought we would,
like, go at it,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.340
because Google, 30% margins.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.170
Everyone's got a
master's degree or PhD.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.450
People at the time
went to fancy schools.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.800
That's changed a little bit.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.360
The company recruits more
broadly now, thank god.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.500
And Wegmans-- it's a high
school-educated workforce,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.000
largely.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.090
They promote from within.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.890
It's family-owned.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.960
It's a grocer, so they have
1% or 2% profit margins.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.647
And they put us on stage,
and every question-- how

00:10:52.647 --> 00:10:53.730
do you think about hiring?

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.110
Well, these are the
things we look at.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.850
We look for people who are
conscientious and thoughtful

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:57.766
and go the extra mile.

00:10:57.766 --> 00:10:59.186
Yeah, we do, too.

00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:00.560
How do you think
about promotion?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.150
We want people who really
care about their customer.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.526
We really care about the user.

00:11:04.526 --> 00:11:06.150
Everything we went
through, we do, too.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.650
We do, too.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.570
And Jack and I have
since become friends.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.070
Completely different company,
completely different industry,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.236
completely different
economics, completely different

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:15.860
workforce--

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.420
exactly the same
in terms of how we

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.540
treat our people and the
experience people have.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.250
And they do it without
a ton of money.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.540
So I want to share three
examples, three kind of rules,

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.500
things to take away that
I hope will be helpful.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.007
The starting point is finding
meaning in people's work.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:36.840
You know, I had talked
about Amy's research.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.090
This is the most
important thing.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.119
And yeah, everyone
says, OK, check.

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.410
We should have meaning in work.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.534
You know, that's important.

00:11:44.534 --> 00:11:47.630
I want to give you a
sentence of two pieces.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.410
One is, what's important
in setting up a mission?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.707
And the second is the
impact this can have.

00:11:52.707 --> 00:11:55.040
So Google's mission is organize
the world's information.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.560
Make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.630
What's amazing
about that is you're

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.360
never going to achieve that
goal, because there's always

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.230
more out there.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.069
So mission needs
to be unattainable.

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:07.610
It needs to be something you
can always kind of move towards,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.959
but you never quite get there.

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:11.000
If your goal is to be the
number-one rated school

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.760
in the town or the district
or the state or the nation,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.600
once you get there, where
do you go from there?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.344
The second thing is having
a strong profound mission

00:12:21.344 --> 00:12:23.510
that is different from the
other institutions around

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.086
you is a filter for
people who are applying.

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:28.460
It makes people
want to be there,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.510
because there's
something different

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.720
about your institution.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.965
So even in education,
every school is different.

00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.090
The students are different.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.840
The parents are different.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.740
The community's different.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.910
The level of support
is different.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.951
The faculty is different.

00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:40.450
The administration is different.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.832
Find what is different
and special and unique.

00:12:43.832 --> 00:12:45.290
And it doesn't
matter if the school

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.210
is high performing or low
performing or struggling

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.710
or not.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.470
There is some magic
there, some spark there.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.800
If nothing else,
other than that spark

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.850
you see in those kindergartners
when they show up

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.785
for that first day, they just
want to learn everything.

00:12:58.785 --> 00:13:01.160
Like those of you who work
with kindergartners know this.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.220
What is cooler than
having somebody experience

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.460
something for the first
time in their lives?

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.355
Somebody who doesn't know what
a slope is, so all these kind

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:12.980
of trivial things we
take for granted--

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.563
that's an amazing
thing to connect to.

00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:16.910
So find that mission, and
then be vocal about it,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.740
and make it different
and special.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.330
The other thing, though, is
that if people are connected

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.080
to that mission, they work way
harder than they will if they

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.360
don't feel that connection.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.450
So Adam Grant is a
professor at Wharton,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.890
the business school, Wharton.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.280
And he's a great guy.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.890
He's a good friend,
and he's like one

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.306
of these like crazy accomplished
people who you would hate

00:13:39.306 --> 00:13:41.100
if he wasn't such
a nice human being,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.070
because he was an
Olympic-caliber diver

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.100
and a magician and youngest
tenure ever faculty

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.375
at the university.

00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.750
But his original research was
around mission and meaning,

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.780
and this is what got him tenure.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.905
He wanted to quantify, does
this stuff really matter?

00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:59.030
There's all these books,
"The Purpose-Driven Life,"

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.830
and you go to church, and
they tell you about meaning,

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.830
and everyone's like, OK.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.704
Everyone kind of performs
the same afterward,

00:14:03.704 --> 00:14:06.110
so it's not like everybody
who does one of these things

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.400
or reads this book
suddenly performs better.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.430
So he went to a call center.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.744
And this call center was doing
fundraising for universities,

00:14:14.744 --> 00:14:16.160
so he basically
hired these folks.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.530
You give them your alumni
list, and they call everyone

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.946
on the alumni list
saying, can you

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:23.210
please donate college to Laszlo
University or whatever it is?

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.680
And these fundraisers were
raising $1,300 per week

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.420
on average for the universities.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.987
And Adam thought, if I
connect them to meaning--

00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:33.570
because his research
says that works--

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.370
they will get more productive.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.799
So he went out, and he
found a bunch of students

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.340
who had gotten
scholarships and said,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.490
do a one-page essay
that we're going

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.306
to give to these
people about the impact

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:44.430
the scholarship had on you.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.351
And he got these
beautiful essays back.

00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.100
I went to college.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.000
I learned all this stuff.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.300
I was able to get
this great job.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.490
I've lived happily ever after.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.240
I've got a family.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.730
Like life is good.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.130
Anyone want to guess what
happened to productivity, where

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.530
it went from $1,300
after these people read

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.990
these one-page essays?

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.430
Went down?

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.470
Pessimist.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.710
Anyone else want to guess.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.580
Doubled.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.000
It's a trick question.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.420
It didn't change at all.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.617
Our pessimist was close.

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:19.200
And they wrote about
what they learned

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.699
and how much money they made--
didn't have an impact at all.

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:23.970
And Adam, then,
completely freaked out,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.511
because he was like, oh, my god,
I'm not going to get tenure.

00:15:28.224 --> 00:15:30.140
So he went back to the
scholarship recipients,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.681
and he said, write
a different essay.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:35.040
Write to me about what it meant.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.980
And he got an essay
back, instead, that said,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.350
instead of like, oh, I took
this Shakespeare class.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.290
It was awesome-- that
said, I read Shakespeare

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.650
for the first
time, and I learned

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.350
about the English language and
where all these phrases we use

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.400
come from.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.830
And I learned something
about the human condition

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.410
and that it's universal and
that people hundreds of years

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.450
ago were going through the same
thing I'm going through today.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.080
It changed me.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.490
It affected me.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.870
And now, everybody, except
our pessimist friend,

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.870
what do you think happened?

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.930
No change?

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.480
It went up.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.230
It went up to $3,100 a week,
more than doubling just

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.810
by reading a one-page essay
talking about what this meant.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.090
And then he said, oh, I
can do better than this.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.214
So we had these students
come in, these scholarship

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:25.640
recipients, once a month
to give a five-minute talk

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.200
about what it meant.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.150
And these fundraisers started
raising more than $5,000

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.940
every single week.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.626
And so Adam's
replicated this study

00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:39.000
in a bunch of
different settings.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.010
He did a similar
thing with lifeguards,

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.090
and he found that lifeguards
became 21% more attentive--

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.670
you know, more time watching,
less time Facebook, whatever.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.180
He did it with tutors
and proofreaders,

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.700
and he found that when
people felt more connected,

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.860
when proofreaders,
editors read something

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.190
about how meaningful this was
to the person whose paper was

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.470
being graded and reviewed,
they spent 20% more

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.319
time on every single
paper and gave more

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.849
detailed and
substantive comments,

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.819
just because they could
feel that connection.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.819
So it's possible to do this in
all kinds of different fields.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.790
Meaning and finding that
meaning and refreshing it

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.890
and reminding people
of it again and again

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.970
is essential, particularly in
a job where most of your time

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.548
is spent by yourself or maybe
with you and an assistant

00:17:24.548 --> 00:17:27.089
in one setting, where you don't
have all that interaction all

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.588
the time.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.300
It's not like at Google, where
you're constantly on a team,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.740
and you may be on three
or four different teams

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.690
at the same time, and
you spend all your time

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:34.880
with other people.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.051
Rekindling that spark,
rekindling that connection,

00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:39.300
and the way you do it is
through narrative and stories

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.785
and exposing people to
this underlying meaning.

00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:44.160
Second thing I
want to talk about

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.390
is make sure people are
learning, which kind of seems

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.520
self-evident.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.350
That's kind of the
whole point of teaching.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.740
But if you think about it
in a corporate environment,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.580
and if you're an
administrator or a manager,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.940
most learning happens either
through training programs.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.940
And the research on training
programs is not good.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.180
In the US, large corporations
spend $120 billion a year

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.450
on training classes.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.270
$120 billion.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.855
And there's not a whole
lot of benefit to it.

00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:17.980
There's certainly almost
no measured benefit to it.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.470
I mean, if you think back
about trainings you've gone to

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.522
and programs you've gone
to, how many of those

00:18:22.522 --> 00:18:23.980
things do you use
every single day?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.070
Or if you're--
this was, I guess,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.820
a four-week session
or a four-day session?

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.319
Sorry.

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:30.290
Four-day session, not four-week.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:30.790
If only.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.497
Four-day session.

00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:33.830
Like, play forward in your mind.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.663
I'm sure this is well
done, and the pedagogy

00:18:35.663 --> 00:18:39.100
was fantastic, but even
including this talk,

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.640
you have four days of content.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.140
It's not like every
single moment,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.810
every single second is
transforming how you do things

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.740
completely from here on in.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.127
There's a limited
amount we can absorb.

00:18:50.127 --> 00:18:51.960
And that challenge is
compounded by the fact

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.510
that in professional settings,
what typically happens--

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.700
and in academic
settings, a lot--

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.426
is learning is married
to consequence.

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:02.800
So in a corporate setting,
you have a performance review.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.280
That's when you get
all your feedback,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.990
and the manager sits down.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.906
You get your performance
review, and then they

00:19:06.906 --> 00:19:09.070
tell you what your salary
increase is or maybe not.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.285
So the whole time
you're getting feedback,

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:12.910
in the back of your
mind, you're going,

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.160
oh, man, oh, man, oh,
man, oh, man, oh, man,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.330
I want to get a raise.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.720
I hope it works out.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.570
And what happens is
as soon as you tie

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.010
learning to
consequence, learning

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.810
shuts down, because
people become defensive.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.610
They care about the evaluation.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.400
They care about the score,
the grade, the doing well,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.057
and they focus on that rather
than, what can I learn here?

00:19:34.057 --> 00:19:36.390
Whereas as many of you know,
you learn more from failure

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.884
than from success.

00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:40.300
Failure's where you dig down
and say, what did I do wrong?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.160
What can I correct?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.500
At Google, we did this thing
called the Upward Feedback

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.080
Survey, and the idea was
we did a whole study called

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.144
Project Oxygen, and it was about
what makes managers effective.

00:19:51.144 --> 00:19:53.060
And it turns out there's
eight things managers

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.226
do that make them effective.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:56.150
And it's things like
have a regular one on one

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.510
with their people, act as
a good coach, and so on.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.924
So we turned that into a survey.

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:03.646
Survey goes to everyone
in the company.

00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:04.520
I hope it still does.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:04.990
Google people?

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.850
Yes, it still does?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.349
All right.

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:07.080
OK.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.210
Because this is really
important for the company.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.820
And it's 10 or 12 questions.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.950
Does my manager act as a coach?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.840
Do we have regular one on ones?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.299
And every employee takes--

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.590
I mean it's an optional
survey, but just about everyone

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.465
fills out the survey.

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:22.650
The manager gets a score.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.780
And the score is how
they did on each question

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.840
from a strongly agree
to strongly disagree,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.680
and then there's
an aggregate score,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.350
which is the average of those.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.810
And then the manager is also
told where that average falls

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.030
in the distribution
of the company,

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.012
because if everyone
gets a perfect score,

00:20:39.012 --> 00:20:39.720
there's still a--

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.370
well, not if everyone
gets a perfect score,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.900
but there's still a
distribution, right?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.610
Even if everyone's
getting 90% favorable

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.680
or 85% to 95%
favorable, there's still

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.120
a distribution within that.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.340
So we tell managers,
here is where you are.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.040
When we started doing
it, their managers

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.335
were rated 58% favorable.

00:20:56.335 --> 00:20:56.960
And that's all.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.200
We just told them,
here's the score.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.555
Here's where you are
in the distribution.

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:01.020
You're in the top, middle--

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.320
well, top third, second, or
bottom quartile of the company.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.260
And that's all we did.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.630
Then six months later,
we measured it again,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.290
and managers got better.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.037
And we measured it
again six months

00:21:15.037 --> 00:21:16.120
after that and six months.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.520
After five cycles, the
average favorability rating

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.420
went from 58% to 78% favorable,
which was awesome, because I

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.770
didn't have to spend any money.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.680
What happened was there
was no consequence.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.960
We just told people, here's
what your people think,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.390
which you can't debate,
because it's their opinion.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.806
Like, I don't care
what you think,

00:21:35.806 --> 00:21:38.750
and this is how they feel.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.980
And here's where you
fall in the distribution.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.490
We'll see you in six months.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.100
And most people are good people.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.810
Most people want to get better.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.310
And if you tell
them where they are,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.240
they'll kind of look
at it, and by the way,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.880
here's eight or 10
things to do differently.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.879
Here's where you scored.

00:21:55.879 --> 00:21:58.480
I'm going to do this
one that I was lower on.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.930
And they got better.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.690
It was amazing.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.300
There's a school nearby in
the town of Los Altos called

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.740
the Bullis Charter School.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.390
And some of you
may do this, too.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.250
In the middle schools,
which, for them,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.140
is sixth through eighth
grade, any time a kid

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.240
takes a math test,
they're allowed

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.370
to retake any questions
they got wrong,

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.750
and they get 50% credit for it.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.520
And the principal there,
Wanny Hersey, who's amazing,

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.510
she says, it's important
that my students learn

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.690
algebra and pre-algebra
and all these other things

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.740
they're learning.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.500
But she told me, it's
equally important

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.347
that they learn how
to learn from failure

00:22:33.347 --> 00:22:35.180
and that they learn
resilience and that they

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.380
learn how to recover.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.030
So the big lesson
here is-- and I

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.850
don't know how much this
applies in your world

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.170
versus in the corporate world.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.834
In the corporate
world, development

00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:46.500
needs to be a completely
different thing

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.695
from evaluation.

00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:50.070
And I know there's like state
standards and all this kind

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.630
of-- and that's a big issue.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.930
That's way over my head
and area of expertise,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.080
but giving people the
opportunity to fail and simply

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.464
learn from it is tremendous.

00:23:00.464 --> 00:23:02.130
It's the biggest gift
you can give them,

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.920
and they will learn
faster and learn more.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.880
There's another Google
person named Astro Teller,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.795
and he runs Google
X. And there's

00:23:11.795 --> 00:23:13.920
a YouTube video of him
giving a talk about failure,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.129
and it's fantastic.

00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:16.920
And it's all about all
the different things

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.060
they do at X to encourage
people to try things and fail

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.914
and learn from it.

00:23:21.914 --> 00:23:23.080
And it's really instructive.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.300
It's worth checking out.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.370
But the big message
here is, give people

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.060
that opportunity to develop.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.282
Keep it separate from
evaluation as much as you can.

00:23:32.282 --> 00:23:33.740
The last thing I
want to talk about

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.370
is how to have a really
big impact on things

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.040
without a lot of money and
without a lot of effort.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.190
There's a concept called nudges.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.180
So there were two professors,
Thaler and Sunstein--

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.710
one's at University of
Chicago, one's at Harvard--

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.860
who wrote a book 10 or 12
years ago called "Nudge."

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.230
And their whole idea
was they observed

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.230
that you can make small
changes in the environment

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.300
or present decisions
in a certain way that

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.670
drives people's behaviors
in really, really big ways.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.280
And the reason is it
goes back to how much you

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.720
retain from learning
environments

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.100
and from training programs.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.780
We only have so much
cognitive capacity.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.240
There's only so much we can
learn, so much we can remember,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.470
so much we can act on.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.810
We only have so much
willpower at a given time.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.780
So if you structure
your environment

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.080
in a certain way or present
decisions in a certain way,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.590
you can make it easier to
make a better decision.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:34.230
So for example, it's
really hard to lose weight.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.026
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:35.026 --> 00:24:37.010
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.760
Yeah.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.510
I can see I'm not alone
in knowing this and having

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.290
lived this.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.250
It's really hard.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.020
Our biology
conspires against us.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.930
Our peer groups
conspire against us.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.230
You know, getting older--

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.426
I mean, I'm now 44,
which, depending,

00:24:51.426 --> 00:24:53.300
feels a lot older than
I was a long time ago,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.540
but I know it's like I'm
not even halfway there.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.980
And it's just harder
to do anything.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.160
Like recovery time-- my
body needs fewer calories.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.144
In high school, I
was on a swim team.

00:25:05.144 --> 00:25:06.560
I remember coming
home, opening up

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.830
the jar of peanut butter, the
crunchy style peanut butter,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.844
and just eating spoonfuls of it.

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:14.010
And I literally the other
day was with some friends,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.093
and we were just sitting
around talking about what

00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:18.380
we used to be able to eat.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.200
And we're not that
old yet, so it's hard.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.621
So here's a nudge.

00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:25.370
If you open up your
refrigerator-- picture

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.140
this in your mind-- what's
sitting on the middle shelf

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.973
there, that big shelf
right in front of you?

00:25:28.973 --> 00:25:29.830
What's in there?

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.770
I see people
laughing and smiling.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.340
You going to admit it?

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.160
No.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.540
Usually, you got,
like, you might

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.880
have some juice, some
milk, maybe some take-out

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.230
containers, some leftovers
from the restaurant last night.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.767
Everything that is high in
calories, low in nutritional

00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:46.850
content right there, because
that's the big space.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.220
That's where all those
big things go, right?

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.500
Where are your vegetables?

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:57.200
Down at the bottom, and no one
wants to go in that drawer.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.110
Like it's like you don't know
what you're going to find.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.140
You may have created
new life in that drawer.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.120
And where's the fruit live?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.640
The side of it or
on the counter.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.360
Counter people?

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.400
Where on the counter, though?

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.130
Who said counter?

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.640
In a bowl.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.556
And where's that bowl?

00:26:11.556 --> 00:26:12.380
Yeah.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.580
On top of the refrigerator
to keep it nice and warm.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.770
I like that.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.250
Or like behind in some corner,
where it's out of the way.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.080
And you know, you
have some fruit flies.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.154
And it's-- what's that?

00:26:24.154 --> 00:26:25.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.890
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah,
and you've got

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.892
that peach that's been there.

00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:31.850
It's been there long
enough that you don't even

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.266
want to reach for it, because
you think your fingers might

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:36.850
sink into it.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.400
And then you throw it away.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.210
You want to eat better,
take the juice out.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.500
Take out the to-go containers.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.652
Take out all that stuff.

00:26:44.652 --> 00:26:46.110
Put your fruit
right in the middle.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.276
Put some carrots next to it.

00:26:47.276 --> 00:26:49.260
Put some strawberries
right on that big shelf

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.520
every time you open it.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.200
You actually will eat
better, and you can still

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.280
have all the other stuff.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.200
But it's just easier, because
every time you open it,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.430
it's staring you in the face.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.930
Same thing with
your pantry, right?

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.320
Big shelf-- sugary cereal,
all the easy grab and gos.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.860
That's a nudge.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.010
And there's lots of
applications and businesses

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.180
and a tremendous, tremendous
amount you can do,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.013
and it's one of the
things that over at Humu

00:27:12.013 --> 00:27:15.660
we're super, super excited
about and doing some cool stuff.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.820
I'll give you a
Google example just

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.540
to prove I'm not all
about weight loss.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.420
So one of the
problems we had was

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.850
we're hiring all these people,
and like in your organizations,

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.380
you want people to get
productive as fast as possible.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.257
There's a difference in the
quality of and the impact

00:27:35.257 --> 00:27:36.840
of a brand-new teacher
versus somebody

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.700
who's been doing it
for two or three years.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.710
And you want them to get off
that curve as fast as possible.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.090
We wanted the same thing.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.880
What we found was
the average time

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.280
from when somebody joined
Google to when they were fully

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.440
productive was nine months.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.440
So we're like, well, what
can we do differently?

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.840
How can we accelerate that?

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.026
And because we love
our science, we

00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:58.400
did a bunch of analyses about
what are these people doing

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.710
differently, and what are their
managers doing differently,

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.251
what are the teams
doing differently.

00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:05.030
And there's five things
that they do differently.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.590
One thing is they meet
at least two people

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.780
in the first couple of
days, because it turns out

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.480
building a social network
makes a huge difference.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.260
And again, I don't know
how it works in teaching,

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.230
but at Google, you can actually
just show up and for two days,

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.520
just kind of sit at
your desk and hang out.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.894
And there's cafes
and everything,

00:28:23.894 --> 00:28:25.370
but if you're an
introvert, you're

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.920
not going to go meet
people, so meet two people.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.650
If you're an engineer, the
ones who got productive faster,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.570
they checked in code
in the first week,

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.861
meaning they wrote something,
checked it in the system,

00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:36.620
got accepted within
the first week--

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.460
made them more productive.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.440
Having a computer that works
and a desk, because it turns out

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.990
part of what happens is when
you're new at an organization,

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.302
you're particularly
open to learning.

00:28:50.302 --> 00:28:52.510
Think about the kids in the
first two weeks of school

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.935
versus like 3/4 of the way.

00:28:53.935 --> 00:28:55.060
I mean they're still there.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.101
They're still interested.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:59.710
First two weeks, though,
you can teach them anything.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.430
I had a--

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.080
I don't know what he was.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.320
He was the principal's
son, and he

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.880
was in the classroom
for some reason.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.400
And I remember this is in
like second or third grade,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.230
and he was, like,
in the future, we're

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.450
going to be able to--
doctors will cut slits

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.075
in the side of your
neck, and we'll all

00:29:17.075 --> 00:29:19.260
breathe water like Aquaman.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.130
And for like two
years, I believed that,

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:23.880
because it was early,
and I liked Aquaman.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.570
And I was like,
that'd be really cool.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.445
So people are more open
to learning early on.

00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:29.830
They do a whole bunch
of other things.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.649
So one option was build
all this special training.

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:34.440
Well, we already had
an onboarding process,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.147
and it was giving us nine
months to full productivity.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:38.730
So instead, we said,
what's the nudge?

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.500
What's a smaller invention we
can have to change behavior?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.820
So we sent a couple of emails.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.830
So anytime-- and I don't
know if this is still true,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.630
so Google people
can keep me honest--

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.952
when a new employee gets hired,
the day before the first day,

00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:54.910
they get an email that
says, here's five things

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.710
to do that we've shown--

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.050
I see head nodding,
awesome-- that we know make

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.450
people more productive sooner.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.000
The manager gets an
email two or three days

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.560
before, so that they're
ready, that says,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.670
here are five things that
you should help them with,

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.646
because you can't rely on the
employee, the new hire paying

00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.020
attention, because
often they do.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.505
Sometimes they don't.

00:30:15.505 --> 00:30:17.380
But if you get to both
sides of the equation,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.424
you're much more likely
to have an effect.

00:30:19.424 --> 00:30:21.340
And what happened was
the time to productivity

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.100
shrank from nine months
down to six months,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.039
which on the one hand,
percentage terms,

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:28.080
that's a big improvement.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.663
On the other hand,
yeah, three months.

00:30:29.663 --> 00:30:30.320
Who cares?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.060
At the rate at
which Google hires,

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.190
and if you look at
average employee lifespan,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:39.060
it's a 2% productivity boost
across the entire company.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.190
2% is like for every
50 employees you have,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.980
you get a free person.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.020
So think about what that
means for your schools.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.160
That's actually-- that's
a lot of free bodies.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.630
So that's another example
of a small intervention.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.362
So what does that look
like in education?

00:30:56.362 --> 00:30:57.820
I'm going to go
out on a limb here.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.870
So don't get too mad.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.180
So I went out, and I Googled--

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.314
my search engine of choice--

00:31:05.314 --> 00:31:07.230
I Googled-- let me get
the exact phrase right.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.730
What was it?

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.610
I Googled children in classroom.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.165
And this is what I got.

00:31:13.165 --> 00:31:15.540
I imagine this is what most
of your classrooms look like.

00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:19.560
Like what is that?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.800
Like a nine-to-one
teacher-student ratio?

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.740
Yeah.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.930
Yeah, lots of technology.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.180
Oh, I didn't even notice that.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.860
Yeah, they've got
crazy technology.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.250
You've got-- it's clean.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.020
Oh, man, you guys are
breaking my heart.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.110
There's four walls, and
everyone's fully clothed.

00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:43.560
I mean, I joke.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.601
I make light of it, but
that's like a real issue.

00:31:45.601 --> 00:31:47.554
So in East Palo
Alto, so you've got

00:31:47.554 --> 00:31:48.720
Palo Alto where Stanford is.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.960
You cross the 101 freeway.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.410
You have East Palo Alto.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.510
My wife and my daughter,
one of my girls,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.730
does volunteer work over there.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.920
More than 30% of the kids
in that school district

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.866
are homeless.

00:32:00.866 --> 00:32:02.740
And I mean they live on
the street every day.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.870
I mean they don't
know where they're

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.967
going to sleep that night.

00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:05.800
Could be in the car.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.150
Could be in a friend's house.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.650
That's five miles from here.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.280
So I don't know.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.580
How much is Google worth?

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.047
$600 billion, $800
billion, right?

00:32:15.047 --> 00:32:17.380
You've got Apple down the
street worth almost a trillion

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.010
dollars.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.020
Five miles from here,
more than 30% of the kids.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.230
So I'm joking a little,
but you all live this.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:29.730
Like this is-- and who's raising
their hands in this picture?

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.766
Right?

00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:32.640
You've got the two girls
raising their hands.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.050
Who really raises
their hands first?

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.175
First time you ask a question
in a classroom, whose

00:32:36.175 --> 00:32:38.100
hands are like, me, me, me.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.555
Is it the girls or the boys?

00:32:39.555 --> 00:32:40.470
It's the boys.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.410
I see the men raising
their hands in the room.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.000
This is what it's more like, I
think, in an actual classroom.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.270
I'm trying to find a
more realistic depiction

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.218
of a California classroom.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.740
There's a couple
of problems, where

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.849
I think nudging and
things like checklists,

00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:05.890
like that manager feedback
survey I talked about,

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.280
might actually help a lot with,
which I kind of alluded to.

00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:14.230
Who gets called on
first in classrooms?

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.490
Whose hands are up the most?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.390
Boys, right?

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.240
Boys' hands go up.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.870
And it's because on average--
this is based on the science.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.440
This isn't me just
making stuff up.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.690
We had an incredible
people analytics team.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.720
So anytime before I would
talk about this stuff,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.220
while I was still here, I would
go back to the team and say,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.380
can you just make
sure this is true?

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.560
And like scientifically
validated and correct

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.110
and not based on what I
happened to see down the street,

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.320
but, in fact, true
across humanity.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.020
Boys raise their hands
earlier, and so do men,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.550
because boys and men aren't
as hindered by certainty

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.705
or knowledge as women.

00:33:50.705 --> 00:33:53.080
Men are more likely to go,
oh, I think I know the answer,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.260
whereas girls in classrooms
wait longer until they're

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.480
sure of the answer.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.130
And what happens is it
creates this vicious cycle,

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.220
because if I'm the teacher,
and I ask a question--

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.340
2 plus 2, why is an
apple red, whatever--

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.860
and the hands that
come up are boys,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.934
I want to call on somebody.

00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:15.350
And it's kind of
weird and awkward

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.252
to go, like, OK, boys, I want
to hear from one of the girls,

00:34:18.252 --> 00:34:20.460
because that also is a weird
way of isolating people.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.350
So I'll call on a boy.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.141
And the boy will go,
oh, you have 2 plus 2.

00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:23.660
That's 8.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.280
I go, no, that's wrong.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.370
And I mean all the
girls know the answer,

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:31.600
and I keep calling on boys, but
what's happened is two things.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.340
The boy has gone gotten
re-encouragement, positive

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.139
encouragement,
positive reinforcement.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.130
He raised his hand.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.150
Stimulus response.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.260
Teacher called on him.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.219
Positive.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.159
The teacher's also gotten
positive reinforcement.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.300
I asked a question.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.790
This person raised their
hand, and you know what?

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.370
It wasn't the right answer,
but look, they're trying.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.900
They're engaged.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.929
They're connected.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:57.472
And over time, we call more
on the boys than the girls.

00:34:57.472 --> 00:34:58.430
And it makes it harder.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.590
And the girls also
get a message,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.631
which is like, I'm just--

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:03.720
I'm not going to bother.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:08.280
And what's crazy is I was
at an event at a girls'

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.417
school, a girls' high school.

00:35:11.417 --> 00:35:13.500
And the science teacher
was doing a demonstration.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.124
It was for a bunch of adults, so
a mixed group of men and women

00:35:16.124 --> 00:35:19.090
in the classroom,
female science teacher.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.329
And the demonstration was she
had an aquarium, fish tank,

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:22.870
and she had--

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.850
I think it was a
lemon and a lime.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.672
And the question is, when
I put this in the water,

00:35:27.672 --> 00:35:28.880
is it going to float or sink?

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.580
It might have been a
lime and an orange.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.621
It was two citrus fruits.

00:35:31.621 --> 00:35:33.659
I remember that for sure.

00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:35.200
And she said, what's
going to happen,

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.217
and one's going to sink.

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:36.800
One can float.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.140
What do you all think?

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.540
And in the audience,
whose hands went up?

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.610
All the dudes.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.960
Not me, because I knew this.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.460
I was like, I'm not
raising my hand.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.451
I know they went up, and even
though it was a girls' school,

00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:53.992
and all she does is teach girls,
she called on the men first.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.820
And it speaks to the fact that
this is just how we're wired.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.350
This is just society.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.830
This is, on average, boys
are more risk-taking.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.500
This is part of why, if
you look at birth rates,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.230
there's more boys born
than girls for every 100

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.640
childbirths.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.140
We have a slightly
higher birth rate

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.690
of boys than girls as
a species, and it's

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.300
because roll the clock
back 10,000 years--

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.810
who's more likely to die?

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.829
Boys are more likely
to die, because we're

00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:26.620
more risk-seeking, and
we do stupid things,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.270
and then once you have
hunter-gatherer societies,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.950
there's a division
of labor and so on.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.540
So the reward, we are wired.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.860
We boys and men are wired to I'm
going to just put it out there,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.321
just a little bit more
on average than women.

00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:41.320
And if you look at the
population distributions,

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.460
there's a lot of overlap.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.043
So it's not true that every boy
is more wired than every girl.

00:36:45.043 --> 00:36:46.720
There's a lot of overlap.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.300
But we create these
vicious cycles where

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.827
this happens in the classroom.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.950
There's roots of this, too,
not just in the classroom.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.470
And so part of the answer to
addressing this kind of issue

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.620
and the application
of nudges isn't just--

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.430
it's not your responsibility.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.930
There's a book that just came
out recently called "Everybody

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.480
Lies," and it was written
by somebody who, basically,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.720
his whole trick--

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.990
and it's a good trick--

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.616
is he looks at--

00:37:15.616 --> 00:37:16.990
there's a product
that Google has

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.750
called-- it used to be
called Google Trends.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.254
And it's also called
Ngram, N-G-R-A-M,

00:37:22.254 --> 00:37:23.920
which lets you look
at search frequency,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.810
so what are people
searching for?

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.810
And the underlying data
from that is what informs--

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.520
when you start typing
in Google, and it

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.590
starts auto-filling in
everything you're doing,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.490
same data.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:36.520
So his old trick is he
thinks that better reveals

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.170
who we are than what
we say on Facebook,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.517
for example, because Facebook
is who we want to be.

00:37:41.517 --> 00:37:43.600
It's like, oh, here's some
shots from my vacation,

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.520
and look at my avocado
toast this morning,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.300
and my kid won this award.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.390
What we search for on
Google, nobody else sees.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:57.130
And his two big areas of
study in this book, he

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:02.920
talks about politics
and the recent election,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.990
actually, the last
three elections.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.982
And quite frankly, he
talks a lot about sex,

00:38:06.982 --> 00:38:09.190
because apparently, people
use the internet for that.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.630
I did not know that.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.120
But apparently, people
search for that.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.940
But there's two
pages in his book

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.640
where he talks about education.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.570
And he said, if you look at
parents of small children,

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.080
if the search query is
my child is a genius,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.470
or is my child a genius,
or is my child gifted,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.320
parents of boys are
two and 1/2 times

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.790
more likely to enter is my child
gifted than parents of girls,

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.370
which is weird,
because at young ages,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.390
girls have better vocabularies,
perform better in schools,

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.600
and are 9% more likely
to be in gifted programs.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.030
If you look at the search
query is my child overweight,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.950
they are much more
likely to look for that

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.450
if it's a girl
than if it's a boy,

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.200
even though there are more
overweight young girls

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.210
than there are
overweight young boys.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.250
It's something like
39% versus 33%.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.810
And I'm a parent.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.990
I screw this stuff up, too.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:15.580
I've never done those two
searches, just for the record,

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.430
but this is just the
society we live in.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.190
This is like the air we breathe,
and it's how we have evolved.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.010
It's who we are.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.059
It's like at the end of the day,
again, 10,000 years ago, you

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:28.850
see somebody coming
towards you, or if it's

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:31.887
somebody you know who looks
like you, sounds like you,

00:39:31.887 --> 00:39:34.220
the optimal decision is to
assume they're more like you.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.761
If it's somebody
who looks different,

00:39:35.761 --> 00:39:37.320
who's not from your
tribe, who has--

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.260
it's a little safer to
be a little cautious,

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.330
just like how we're wired.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.370
But today we got to
overcome this stuff,

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.040
because it shows up at
home and in the classrooms.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.600
And what I would
posit, what I would

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.690
put to you is that
one of the ways

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.220
to address this stuff
in the classroom,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.280
in addition to everything
else that's being done,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.540
is smaller inventions and
small nudges and small actions.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.350
One of the ways we
tackled this at Google

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.350
when it came to things
like performance ratings,

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:07.075
so the way ratings happened at
Google, was I'm the manager.

00:40:07.075 --> 00:40:09.200
I give my employer a rating,
but before it's final,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.030
I sit down with a bunch
of other managers,

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.655
and we all discuss our ratings.

00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:14.030
And there's all
these things that

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.629
happen in our brain, independent
of gender or ethnicity,

00:40:16.629 --> 00:40:18.170
that causes us to
make bad decisions.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.720
There's something
called recency bias,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.850
and you have this
in education, too.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.179
If I just had a meeting with
someone, and it was awesome,

00:40:26.179 --> 00:40:28.470
and then two days later, I'm
doing performance reviews,

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.830
I'm going to give them a
higher rating, because I just

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.610
had this meeting with Sally.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.070
She was fantastic, and now,
of course, she's awesome.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.520
It doesn't matter what she did
the prior six or 12 months.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.369
It's recency bias.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.410
Same thing in classrooms.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.330
You have a great interaction
with the kid on the playground

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.310
or something happens, you're
more likely to assess them

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.768
better subconsciously,
particularly

00:40:44.768 --> 00:40:46.580
on qualitative subjects.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.110
Math is math, but
everything else, it's tough.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.300
This stuff shows up.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.390
So what we did was we had a
one-page handout with here's

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.510
a bunch of biases, and you
just have this in front of you

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.270
when you do ratings.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.970
And it reminds you, it's
a trigger, it's a nudge,

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:06.170
and a checklist that says,
here's a better way to do it.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.870
And this I say,
again, like this part

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.980
with humility, because in this
field, you are the experts.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.709
I just have an opinion, and
everyone's got one of those.

00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:16.750
But I would imagine there's
a lot of small things

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.850
you can do in terms of--

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:21.460
and I would do it
in terms of trying

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.720
one thing for three months.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.830
It's not like here's
six things we're

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.038
going to do to revamp things.

00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:28.390
But if you believe what I shared
with you about boys and girls

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.820
raising their
hands, tell teachers

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.160
like, hey, for the next month,
make sure that you alternate

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.870
calling on a boy or girl.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.717
Just keep it 50-50.

00:41:37.717 --> 00:41:39.300
Or you can go two
to one the other way

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.860
if you really want to be crazy.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.020
But just try it, and then
at the end of the month,

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.790
let's all sit together and
see if that made a difference.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.498
And if you want to
get sciencey about it,

00:41:48.498 --> 00:41:51.832
say, OK, we're going to give
the kids a test on something

00:41:51.832 --> 00:41:53.290
or measurement of
their trajectory,

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.697
and see if that
trajectory has changed.

00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:58.780
Or compare first and second
trimester performance,

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.064
or something like that.

00:42:00.064 --> 00:42:01.480
But a small
intervention like that

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.140
can have a huge, huge impact.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.120
So pick small things
people can do.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.450
And second thing is, then,
remind them about this stuff

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:07.840
over time.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.270
Maybe there's two or three you
rotate through over a year,

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.539
or maybe there's like--

00:42:12.539 --> 00:42:14.080
I mean, there's a
handout people use.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.163
Maybe there's a checklist.

00:42:15.163 --> 00:42:17.170
But keep coming back
to it periodically,

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.429
and you will see changes.

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:20.720
But it's these little tiny
things, which, it turns out,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.100
are actually easy
to do in the moment,

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.250
as long you don't swamp people
with a lot of direction,

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.650
that have a huge impact,
tremendous impact,

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.670
on what's going on.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.430
So the last thing--

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.340
I guess there were
actually four things.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.423
This last thing, number
10, go back to number one.

00:42:37.423 --> 00:42:39.550
So all of this is
iterative, so figure out

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.160
what your purpose is.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.200
And think about nudges
and small interventions,

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.700
and constantly kind
of like iterate.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.220
Try it.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.220
Go back and do it again.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.735
Try it.

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:53.110
Go back and do it again,
because it's a lifelong process,

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.130
and each time you go through
this cycle, you'll get better.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.505
One of the challenges
when you're

00:42:56.505 --> 00:42:59.500
trying to build organizations
or build individual capability

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.790
is it's not a linear path.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.287
And you know this from teaching.

00:43:02.287 --> 00:43:04.370
It's not like someone gets
10% smarter every year,

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.320
and then at the end of 10
years, they're 100% smarter

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.341
or whatever the
compounding would be.

00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:10.840
They learn.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.465
They slow down.

00:43:11.465 --> 00:43:12.645
They go on summer vacation.

00:43:12.645 --> 00:43:13.270
They come back.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.450
They've forgotten
everything you taught them.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.920
You have to start from scratch.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.660
So you have to keep iterating,
kind of moving through this.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.950
There's one other resource
which I want to offer to you.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.470
And it's not mine,
but it's free.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.660
One of the things we were
big on while I was here,

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.370
and I hope it
continues, was a focus

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.620
on open sourcing and
sharing people practices,

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.080
not just from Google, but from
lots of other organizations.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.810
So there's a website
called Rework,

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.260
and you can see the
address-- it's g.co/rework--

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.350
where none of the things
that I've talked about

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.420
are there exactly as
I've talked about them,

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.010
but the manager
checklist stuff is there.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.780
And so there's a
lot of other things.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.660
And there's also things
that Google partnered

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.826
with a lot of nonprofit
organizations and government

00:43:55.826 --> 00:43:58.720
organizations to do, and also,
that we just learned from them,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.414
or I should say they
learned from them,

00:44:00.414 --> 00:44:01.580
because I'm no longer there.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.160
So it's free.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.430
It's available.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.699
And then, of course, we'll be
up to stuff over at Humu.com,

00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:10.490
if you're interested
in that kind of topic.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.935
But more than anything, it's an
honor and privilege to be here,

00:44:14.935 --> 00:44:16.310
and I was not
kidding around when

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.325
I said you have the most
important jobs there are.

00:44:19.325 --> 00:44:21.950
I mean, yeah, there's a bunch of
engineers here building stuff,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.450
and there's a bunch
of sales people,

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.510
and there's lots of jobs.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.610
But you actually shape
the future in a way

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.070
that nobody else
on the planet does.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.590
And just like we spend
more time at work

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.517
than we do anywhere
else, our children

00:44:34.517 --> 00:44:36.100
spend more time at
school than they do

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.930
doing any other single thing.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.990
And it's a bastion of-- go
back to East Palo Alto--

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:45.340
it's a bastion of consistency
and safety and security

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.730
and positive adult role models.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.590
Like the kids in Palo
Alto, the town itself,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.840
they're going to be fine.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.720
You know, they're
going to be fine.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.870
It's all the other kids, the
other 70% or 80% of the kids

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.944
out there that you're
serving, and it's

00:45:02.944 --> 00:45:04.360
an honor to be
able to talk to you

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.740
a little bit about this stuff.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.607
And I'm incredibly
grateful as a kid

00:45:07.607 --> 00:45:09.440
who went up through
public education for all

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.207
of the work all of you do.

00:45:11.207 --> 00:45:12.040
So I'll pause there.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.510
We can take questions
and chat about whatever

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.343
else you might like.

00:45:14.343 --> 00:45:15.102
Thank you.

00:45:15.102 --> 00:45:18.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.980
And I'm only going
to call on the women,

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.900
so guys, don't worry about it.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.485
You're good.

00:45:36.185 --> 00:45:37.610
Yeah.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.410
Thank you.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.227
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
about [INAUDIBLE] work failures

00:45:41.227 --> 00:45:42.060
[INAUDIBLE] success.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.290
Where is that place that you
have failed and [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:47.470
LASZLO BOCK: Oh, my god.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.028
Do you mean today, or do
you mean like in general?

00:45:54.316 --> 00:45:56.190
The other day, I screwed
something up at home

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.630
this morning.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:06.830
The-- I, actually, every
day, I use my commute home

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:12.720
to think about what I learned
that day and what went wrong.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.210
I guess since I'm
at Google, there

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.960
were a couple of things
I was wrong about.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.380
One was that I learned.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.690
We developed this
unconscious bias program

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.230
to help people be more aware
of their biases of the company.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.585
And I remember telling
the team, we've

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.710
got to make this mandatory.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:30.459
This is important.

00:46:30.459 --> 00:46:32.860
Like, everyone should
be aware of this.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.700
And the team was
like, don't make it

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.010
mandatory, because people
will totally shut down.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.930
And I was wrong.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.180
So we did not make it mandatory.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.270
About 60% of the company went
through the program voluntarily

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.850
in the first six months or so.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.300
And what was crazy was
that was enough to change

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.507
the tenor and conversation
inside the company.

00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:55.090
I mean, it didn't
make Google perfect,

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.380
but what happened was
suddenly, you'd be in meetings,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.020
and somebody would
interrupt a woman,

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.330
or a white person would
interrupt a black person,

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.824
and a white or Indian person
in the company would go like,

00:47:05.824 --> 00:47:06.990
no, no, no, that's not cool.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.724
Let her finish.

00:47:08.724 --> 00:47:10.390
And so it showed up
in these small ways,

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.890
and I was wrong in that I
thought you had to force it.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.280
But number one, turns
out people learn

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.139
better when you
don't, which was what

00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:19.430
inspired this part of the talk.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:24.299
But the second was I also
thought we had to have everyone

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:27.460
learn, and it turns
out we didn't.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.260
You just had to get to
enough of the people

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.600
that the culture changes
and that some things, which

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.660
were previously acceptable,
are no longer acceptable.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.290
And it's just like--

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.410
it blew my mind.

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:39.350
Great question.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:42.948
What else?

00:47:42.948 --> 00:47:44.336
Yeah.

00:47:44.336 --> 00:47:45.710
AUDIENCE: So in
your mission, you

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:49.220
said that it was to find people,
to grow them, and to keep them.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.935
And obviously, a
lot of the things

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:53.040
that we've been seeing
the last few days,

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.605
we can see why
you're keeping them,

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:58.646
or why [INAUDIBLE] keeps
them and grows them

00:47:58.646 --> 00:47:59.560
as a professional.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.452
Can you talk to us a little
bit about how you find people

00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:03.885
and what that practice is like?

00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:05.510
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah,
so the question was,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.150
going back to find,
grow, keep, you've

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.610
got an exposure to
how Google keeps them.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.840
We feed them a lot.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.100
But how do you
actually find them?

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.100
So there's a few things.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.340
When the company was small,
there was a huge focus on,

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.900
go to all the fancy schools.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.480
Hire all the people with fancy
pedigrees, high test scores.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.530
That was efficient
but wrong, because 2/3

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.780
of people in this country
don't finish college.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.130
So 1/3 don't ever go.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.010
1/3 do some.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.590
1/3 do.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.010
And there's really talented,
amazing people out there.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.551
Then there's all the biases that
cause you to overlook people

00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:40.791
and so on, and your top
performer at a state school

00:48:40.791 --> 00:48:43.040
is going to be way better
than your average performer,

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.580
or even top 10% performer off in
a place like Harvard and so on.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:52.950
So we started looking at many
different places, and part

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:53.546
of that--

00:48:53.546 --> 00:48:55.920
one of the lessons there was
that it took real investment

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.520
to build relationships.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.520
So the first year we
went to Howard University

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.640
to try to recruit, we
had exactly zero people

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.245
hired from Howard
for internships

00:49:04.245 --> 00:49:05.710
or for anything else.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.730
And what we realized was
what the students told

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:12.230
us was like, yeah, you're
Google, but you just showed up.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.980
And Microsoft has been
there for 15 years,

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.030
and Goldman Sachs have been,
all these other companies.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:17.904
So we had to invest and
build a relationship,

00:49:17.904 --> 00:49:20.070
so lesson one was
we went to places

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.870
that we had not gone to before.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.640
And that's actually expanded.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.930
I think Google, when
I was last here,

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.180
was recruiting at something
like 700 different schools

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.790
around the world, so
casting a really wide net.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.740
Internet makes it a lot cheaper.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.599
And actually the
Google for Jobs that's

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:38.390
now integrated in the
search that we worked

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.370
on when I was here, that
makes it much easier,

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.170
because it'll
scrape up your job.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.719
The second was we changed
the hiring standard from--

00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:48.260
I almost said, what
do you look like?

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.610
It was never explicitly
like physically

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.490
what do you look like, but what
do you look like in terms of

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.180
did you go to
these right schools

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.480
and have these right scores
to what's our assessment

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.640
of your capability?

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.567
And there's four attributes
everyone gets screened for.

00:50:01.567 --> 00:50:03.150
I think these are
still the same four?

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.130
Yes.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.080
It's only been seven
months, but who knows?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:06.920
Yeah.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.940
So general cognitive ability,
which is not an IQ test.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.520
It's problem solving,
and how do they kind of--

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.700
how quickly can they absorb
and integrate information?

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.800
Emergent leadership, which
is different from leadership.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.260
Leadership is I'm
in charge, and I

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.010
was president of this
and captain of this,

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.970
and that is leadership.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:29.655
Emergent leadership
is I see a problem.

00:50:29.655 --> 00:50:30.530
I'm going to step in.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.340
I'm going to help.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.150
My piece is done.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.180
I'm going to step out and let
somebody else take the lead.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.480
The third is what we
used to call Googliness,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.360
and Googliness has
two components--

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.090
intellectual
humility, which is--

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:45.860
I mean you can have a
big ego and be here,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.250
but you have to be willing
to admit you're wrong when

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.470
presented with new information.

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.019
And the second is
conscientiousness,

00:50:53.019 --> 00:50:55.310
because if you look at the
science of what predicts job

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.770
performance, the best
predictor is actually

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.070
having them do the job.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:50:59.930
Duh.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.510
The next best is
cognitive ability.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.010
So how do they learn?

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.530
And the best thing to add to
that is conscientiousness.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:07.820
Do they care about the
environment around them?

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.070
Do they care about the people?

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:12.320
The least important thing
was actual experience

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.210
in the field and
expertise in the field,

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.450
because it turns out if you
have those first things,

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:20.150
you can develop that last thing.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.430
And then the other last
big change that happened

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.610
was when we were small, most of
the hires were from referrals.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.520
And we found that as we got
bigger, referrals dried up.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.410
Referrals were also
really homogeneous.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.750
My friends are all going to
like the same teams and all

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.650
this kind of stuff.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.460
So we built a pretty
significant capability

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.377
to go out and actually find
people that we call sourcing,

00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:42.710
and so it's all about just
going out and finding people,

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:47.460
because the very best people
aren't looking for work.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.040
I mean like all of
you, like you're here

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.840
because you're
really, really good,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.030
and you're not
picking up the phone.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.440
You're not sending out resumes.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.944
You're valued by
your organizations.

00:51:56.944 --> 00:51:58.860
You're doing good,
important, meaningful work.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.359
But you're the
people, if you wanted

00:52:00.359 --> 00:52:03.610
to build the best school on
the planet, you would hire.

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.400
So that's harder to
do with the resources

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.500
in an academic environment.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.570
What I would offer,
suggest, make up

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.930
is what you don't often see
is different schools pooling

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.270
resources in these kinds
of ways, because in a way,

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:18.550
like if you have schools
within like a 10-mile radius

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.619
or a five-mile radius, not every
school's going to be hiring

00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:24.160
for every position every year,
but they all should constantly

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.067
be kind of looking.

00:52:25.067 --> 00:52:26.650
And so if you start
sharing candidates

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.649
or even had like a shared
person at the district

00:52:28.649 --> 00:52:31.306
level whose whole job is to go
out and spend time on LinkedIn

00:52:31.306 --> 00:52:32.680
or look at other
school districts

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.710
or what have you, who
is constantly generating

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.509
a stream of people, even if
you only need that person once

00:52:38.509 --> 00:52:41.050
every two years, you're sharing
the cost with everybody else.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.636
And then you have
that capability.

00:52:44.636 --> 00:52:45.260
Great question.

00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:52.765
AUDIENCE: Google, the employee
survey, is that public?

00:52:52.765 --> 00:52:55.240
Can other people see that?

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.200
[INAUDIBLE] how you make
an impact [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:04.994 --> 00:53:06.410
LASZLO BOCK: So
yeah, the question

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.771
was this management
survey-- is that public?

00:53:08.771 --> 00:53:09.520
Is that available?

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.557
And the second was,
what's the impact?

00:53:11.557 --> 00:53:13.140
How big an impact
has that had on kind

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.947
of the rankings as
number one employer

00:53:14.947 --> 00:53:16.530
and how people feel
about the company?

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.380
Is that fair?

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.020
So it is public,
completely public.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.030
So it was one of the
first things we shared,

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.954
and the public
name was Project--

00:53:24.954 --> 00:53:26.870
well, the internal name,
which you can Google,

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.260
is Project Oxygen, because
the idea is managers,

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.570
good managers are as
essential as oxygen.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.380
There's resources
on the Rework site.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:38.260
There's also, if you just Google
Project Oxygen New York Times,

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.010
there's a great "New
York Times" write-up.

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:42.260
They actually eventually did a
Harvard Business Review case.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.180
But if you just look at the
"New York Times" write-up,

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.250
it's got the eight
factors, and then there's

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.500
three factors which are
really bad indicators.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.530
And it's basically, you
ask, does the manager

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.780
do these things, or does the
employee do these things?

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.410
And whatever your scale is--

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.590
high to low, agree to disagree.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:58.629
That's it.

00:53:58.629 --> 00:54:00.170
And then you just
sort of-- everybody

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.670
gets a report back that
says, here's your score

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.071
on this question, and here's
the average of these scores.

00:54:04.071 --> 00:54:05.570
And here's how your
average compares

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:06.694
to everyone else's average.

00:54:06.694 --> 00:54:08.527
That is-- that's
the whole thing.

00:54:08.527 --> 00:54:10.610
But if you go on the Rework
site, you can find it,

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.950
or the "New York Times"
article is great for it.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:16.610
I actually-- I think that's one
of the more impactful things

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:21.139
we did, because it
touched everyone.

00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:22.680
There was a clear,
measurable effect,

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.650
so it was kind of
self-reinforcing.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:30.200
And one of the hard things about
leading large organizations

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.130
is there's very rarely a
one size fits all answer.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.780
And even in small
organizations, that's tough.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.370
And what was beautiful
about this was

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.437
I didn't have to know what
training to send you to

00:54:43.437 --> 00:54:45.020
or which of these
things you were weak

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.772
on, or across the
5,000 managers,

00:54:46.772 --> 00:54:48.980
when we started doing this,
like who is good at what,

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.060
and customize.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.160
I just told everyone,
these are the things.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.580
And then this goes back to
the freedom is free thing.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.640
You get better at it.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.399
You figure out
how to get better.

00:54:57.399 --> 00:54:59.690
The trick was-- and this is
not in the "New York Times"

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:01.520
write-up, the last
question on the survey

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.810
is always my manager shares
these results with me,

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.400
because that makes the manager
accountable to the team.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.150
And the only way you
get 100% is if you're

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.926
really good at sharing
the results back,

00:55:12.926 --> 00:55:15.050
and that causes the manager
to improve, work on it,

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.400
get better.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.970
But yeah, it had a
really big impact.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.842
I do think the rankings
are a little goofy.

00:55:21.842 --> 00:55:24.050
I mean it's always like the
high-rated companies that

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:25.760
are like, oh, the
rankings don't matter.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.910
But I think there's some
weirdness behind it,

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:33.500
so yeah, take that with a
grain of salt. What else,

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.000
if anything?

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.279
How are we on time?

00:55:35.279 --> 00:55:37.820
SPEAKER: Maybe time for one more
question, if anybody has it.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.650
Otherwise.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.190
LASZLO BOCK: Any last questions?

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.040
SPEAKER: Burning questions?

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:43.554
All right.

00:55:43.554 --> 00:55:44.720
Well, then-- oh, we got one.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.720
LASZLO BOCK: Is that OK?

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.314
SPEAKER: Yep.

00:55:46.314 --> 00:55:49.618
AUDIENCE: As a principal
of low income kids,

00:55:49.618 --> 00:55:51.570
what can I do to prepare
them for a job here?

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.444
LASZLO BOCK: As principal
of low income kids,

00:55:53.444 --> 00:55:56.260
what can I do to prepare
them for a job here?

00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:00.880
The research suggests
the most important thing

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.040
that kids learn in sort of pre-K
through second or fourth grade

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.550
is our social and
emotional skills,

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.600
not the academic skills.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.930
The ability to
function in a team,

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:16.390
the ability to
delay gratification,

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:20.090
the ability to show resilience
in the face of failure--

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:22.330
those are, if you
look at what incomes

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:26.690
are 15 and 20 years out
and job level attained,

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:30.020
those are the things that
most predict performance.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:30.742
Sorry?

00:56:30.742 --> 00:56:32.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.140
LASZLO BOCK: Yeah,
they were resilience

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.200
in the face of failure.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.927
What did I say?

00:56:39.927 --> 00:56:41.760
Well, social emotional
skills is a high one,

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.470
but then the examples were--
there's a whole cluster

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:44.710
of things underneath that.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.320
So team and
collaboration skills.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.940
What was the second one?

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.070
Self-regulation, yeah.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.130
Yeah, there goes my credibility.

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:54.630
But no, those are
the attributes,

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:58.704
which would stick with
you throughout life.

00:56:58.704 --> 00:57:00.120
For Google
specifically-- and then

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.495
I'll close with one other
thing, which your question just

00:57:02.495 --> 00:57:06.210
reminded me of, because it
relates to low income kids.

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:10.950
To get into Google, it's funny.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.240
I always used to index high.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.115
Like actually at Humu,
I just hired somebody,

00:57:14.115 --> 00:57:16.530
because what I saw
on their resume

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:18.720
was that they went to San
Jose State, so bachelor's

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.310
and master's at San Jose State.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:22.894
And they did well and
strong academic performance

00:57:22.894 --> 00:57:24.060
for our People Science team.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.880
But the reason I zeroed in
on that for this young woman

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.870
was you go to a state school
for a couple of reasons.

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.600
One is you're
smart, but you don't

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.210
have the role models to tell
you, here's the process,

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.376
and here's how you navigate
it, which I didn't have.

00:57:37.376 --> 00:57:38.090
I lucked into it.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:39.860
Or you just don't
have the money.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.654
And so I meet her.

00:57:40.654 --> 00:57:41.570
We start interviewing.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.069
We hire her.

00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.770
She's amazing.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.830
And then eventually, I ask
her, what's your story?

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.990
And she's in her late 20s.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:49.574
She's had 13 jobs.

00:57:49.574 --> 00:57:50.990
All the time she
was an undergrad,

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.270
she was a manager at a
Claire's like in a mall, one

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.800
of these earring places.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.210
She said she's pierced
over 2,000 ears.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:02.280
So when I was at Google, one
of the things I'd look for

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.280
is if somebody went to a
community college, then

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.350
transferred, that's a signal.

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.684
If somebody went to a state
school and performed well,

00:58:08.684 --> 00:58:09.350
that's a signal.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.930
If somebody had a
job that was not--

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:15.530
I went to Kenya and
helped build churches,

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.410
but the job was like, you know,
I worked at a Gas and Sip.

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:19.700
I worked at a 7-Eleven.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.330
Like I wanted to see those kids.

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:26.600
The ideal path, of course,
is you do well academically.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.100
So the conventional
advice, and this

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.790
is like for any company, the way
to stand out-- so for Google,

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.190
perform well at
whatever you are.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:37.770
Show an increasing rate of
progression in your results,

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.380
so not just I did well
here, and I did well here,

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.255
but I did well here faster.

00:58:43.255 --> 00:58:45.630
Once you're in the workforce,
if you're getting promoted,

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:47.921
if you're getting promoted
faster than every two years,

00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:50.100
that's a good signal.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.924
But for students, absolutely,
identify if you're

00:58:52.924 --> 00:58:54.090
from a low income household.

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:56.100
Identify if you're the
first in your family.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.879
Identify-- and it's not
about writing a sob story.

00:58:58.879 --> 00:59:00.420
It's just like put
it in your resume.

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.270
This is the context, right?

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.860
That's really, really important.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:09.880
The thing-- the generic advice
is for most organizations--

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.380
so Google's a bit of a
special case, and I'm biased.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.397
Most organizations
focus on brands,

00:59:15.397 --> 00:59:17.730
and they focus on academics
and all these stupid things.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.317
So the way to cheat your
way on that side is--

00:59:20.317 --> 00:59:22.650
because not everyone gets to
work for Procter and Gamble

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.774
or some fancy brand everyone's
going to recognize--

00:59:24.774 --> 00:59:27.210
is wherever you work, try
to do project work that

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.310
connects to a fancy brand.

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:31.110
And mention that in
the bullet points

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.049
on your resume or
your application,

00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:34.590
because people will
be scanning that.

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:36.330
And the first people who kind
of make it through the filter--

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.980
again, not at Google, but
like in the real world--

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.727
the first people
are the people who

00:59:40.727 --> 00:59:42.810
went to all the right
schools and right companies.

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.120
The next people are the
people whose resumes

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.370
mention those words,
and they get called up.

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:50.340
And then eventually, you
get to everybody else.

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.602
So that's signaling and
branding is really important.

00:59:52.602 --> 00:59:54.060
The thing I'll
close on, if I can--

00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:59.460
actually, my wife has a friend
named Michele Colbert Krantz,

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.910
who's a principal at a school
called La Mesa Junior High

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.680
School in Santa
Clarita, California.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.960
So it's a few hundred
miles south of here.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.430
It's just north of Los Angeles.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:13.470
And largely Hispanic school,
largely low income school--

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:16.200
she wanted to be at that
school for those reasons.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.140
And she does a couple of
things that are really amazing,

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.240
and the students love
her, and the school is now

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.350
a high-performing school.

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:26.210
And it's a lot of work.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.270
She greets every kid every
morning, shakes their hand,

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.190
looks them in the
eye, says their name.

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.480
And the other thing she does--

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.290
and I was reminded of it,
because you guys had these.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.990
And all I could see was
this kind and brave, so

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.330
she does this thing, where--

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.230
and you know, there's
like Kind bars.

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:51.760
So what Michele does, and
she's done this for years,

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.350
she gives out Kudos
bars, because she

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.449
doesn't have a budget.

01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:56.490
It's a low income school.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.060
So she goes to Costco,
buys like 40 Kudos bars,

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.550
and when she sees a kid
doing something well,

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.220
or she sees a staff member
doing something well,

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.220
she'll carry three or
four in her pocket.

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.660
She just gifts the kid.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.930
And what's wild is they
don't always eat them,

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.195
because it's a trophy.

01:01:14.195 --> 01:01:14.820
It's a memento.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.624
It means something.

01:01:16.624 --> 01:01:17.790
And it costs almost nothing.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.560
Those are the small nudges,
the small interventions.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.670
It is incredibly hard.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:26.670
Like, you guys don't get
the kids for that long.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.990
I mean, you're the
source of stability,

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.950
but you don't actually
have them for that long.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.033
They're in your classroom.

01:01:31.033 --> 01:01:32.070
Then they move on.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.385
And teaching is a solitary
profession in a lot of ways.

01:01:34.385 --> 01:01:36.510
I mean, you're doing what
you do in your classroom.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.320
Yes, you can compare notes.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.110
Yes, you do.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.780
But it's like you
doing this thing,

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.820
and let me try something
differently this year,

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.030
and I'll know in 20 years
if it was a good idea.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:46.830
That's really hard.

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:50.827
But there's so many small little
things that stick with people.

01:01:50.827 --> 01:01:52.660
And for those of you
who are administrators,

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.265
I know you're all
going to be coaches.

01:01:54.265 --> 01:01:56.360
And I don't know what the
content is that you guys have,

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.610
so I hope I don't screw it up.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:59.830
But really try to focus in.

01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:02.530
My advice would be, what are the
small things you can ask people

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.920
to change and that they
can try again and again

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.080
and run in small experiments?

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.760
So they try something.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.930
Go try this for two weeks.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.610
Let's talk again and
see how it works.

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:13.300
Now let's try.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.769
Now stop doing it for
two weeks, because you

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:18.060
want the people on the other
end to experience not just

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.602
that it worked, if
it worked, but you

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:22.060
wanted them to experience what
happens if you take it away.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.510
So do the 50-50 calling on kids.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.990
Then stop.

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:27.389
See what happens, because
you want people to feel this,

01:02:27.389 --> 01:02:28.680
if you want to change behavior.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.520
You want that connection.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.020
And I can't wait to
hear what you all do.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:34.880
It's super exciting.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.560
So thank you all
for having me here.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.510
[APPLAUSE]
