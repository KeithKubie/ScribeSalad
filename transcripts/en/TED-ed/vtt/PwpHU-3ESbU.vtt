00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:08.345
Apparently when I was five years old,

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:11.296
I told my mother that I was tired

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:13.443
of her wanting me to be a doctor

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:14.887
and that I was going to MIT

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:16.715
to be an astrophysicist

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:17.947
because I really thought

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.279
that I would be seeking out the truth,

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.145
the truth in physics,

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:23.950
you know, the origins of the universe,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.749
the laws by which all of existence exists,

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.087
and that's really what I wanted to do.

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:34.288
I wanted to do physics or astrophysics,

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:36.423
either I wanted to do atomic, subatomic physics

00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:37.643
or astrophysics.

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:39.363
But I think it's because that my mother

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:43.564
had taken me to the omnitheater planetarium

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:44.831
at the Museum of Science,

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:48.106
and I was extremely impacted by that visit,

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:50.443
and I was fascinated by black holes.

00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:52.314
And I really wanted to know if there were white holes,

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:53.768
like, if you went through a black hole,

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:54.613
what happened?

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:55.831
I remember for some reason

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.497
that question just completely fascinated me

00:00:57.497 --> 00:00:58.566
when I was young.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.701
So, astrophysics.
