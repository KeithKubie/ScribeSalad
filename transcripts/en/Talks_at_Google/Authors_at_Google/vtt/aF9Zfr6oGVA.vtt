[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.030
CAMERON STRANG: Thank you to
Google for having me here.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030
And that's not a sentence
that historians really

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.200
get to say very often.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.250
Thank you, Google.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.620
It's a very surprising
pleasure to get to present

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.670
at a place like this.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.250
And not only is it I probably
had the best cup of tea

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.450
of my life at the new upstairs
cafeteria a little while ago,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.530
but for me and I think
lots of Americans,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.870
Google is the cutting
edge of science, right?

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.340
This is where American science
is going in the future.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.600
So I think it's a
really interesting place

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
to talk about where
American science came from

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120
and what its origins were, its
character in the early United

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.210
States before we've gotten
to where we are now.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.430
And I'm certainly not
the first historian

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.240
to ask this kind of question.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640
But as with so many questions,
right, the answer really

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.280
depends on where you look.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.260
And nearly everyone
who's researched this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.140
has sought answers
to this question

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.200
in places like Philadelphia,
Boston, Cambridge.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.950
And in some ways, this
makes sense, right?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.110
These cities had some of the
best scientific institutions

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.810
and universities
in Anglo America,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.020
and they were also places
that had vital roles

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.720
in the American Revolution.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.880
And this coincidence
allowed historians

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.860
to tell a really
convenient story,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.650
one in which
knowledge and freedom

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.530
emerged together
in America, right?

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.840
And historians have loved
to tell this story that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.600
what made American science
distinct in the early United

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.200
States was this new context
of liberty and democracy

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.350
that supposedly emerged
with the revolution.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.360
But it doesn't take a
geographer to figure out

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.880
that the United States was much
more than this Northeastern

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.690
Anglo fringe.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.250
The basic argument in my
book is that American science

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.030
looks a lot different
when we include

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.150
the rest of the country.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.130
Really, the vast
majority of the country.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.290
But it was not
liberty and democracy

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.420
that most influenced
intellectual lives

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.740
for the diverse Americans living
throughout this territory.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.960
And throughout this
huge range, there

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.410
were natives, African-descended
peoples, Creoles,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.760
French, Spanish all of this,
all of whom studied nature.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.660
But they did so in ways that
were not influenced most

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.790
by this context of
liberty and democracy

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.370
that we like to think about
as characterizing early US

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.760
science.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.800
In these places, it was
imperialism, inequality,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.350
and violence that most
defined how people

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.450
studied the natural world.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.530
This is because imperialism
did not disappear

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.220
from North America after 1776.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.070
Instead, the American Revolution
created a new imperial power,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.420
one that was eager to
expand across the continent.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.060
And Americans don't really
like to think about the United

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.710
States as imperial.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.260
But it really did all
the same kind of stuff

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.000
that other empires do.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.400
It used diplomacy
and military force

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320
to conquer new territories.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.250
It used local cooperators on
the ground to get things done.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.110
And it enforced
these hierarchies

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.260
of differences, hierarchies
of inequality based on place,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.893
based on race.

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:30.560
So despite the fact
that Americans today

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.610
love to view 1776 as this
sudden shift from imperialism

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
to liberty, people throughout
most of the United States

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.030
did not experience it this way.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.670
Instead, they experienced this
as an era of US expansion,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.080
of yet another phase in a
much longer, older history

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.420
of European imperialism
in North America-- one

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.610
that goes back to
the early 1500s.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.790
So my book argues that it was
this persistence of imperialism

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.940
and not the rise of
liberty that made science

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.910
in the early United
States what it was.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.690
And it's because just
as in European empires,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.840
US imperialism led to
encounters-- encounters

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
with new places, encounters
with new peoples, all of which

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.519
affected how people studied
and applied the knowledge

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.458
they developed about nature.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:22.000
And across the
chapters in this book,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.300
I discuss this through
sciences like geology,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870
and natural history, and
botany, and ethnology.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.710
But for today's talk, I
want to focus on astronomy.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.150
And I do so for
a couple reasons.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.120
First of all is
that astronomy was

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.340
absolutely central, essential
to imperial expansion.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.445
It's because European and,
eventually, US astronomers,

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:51.640
they measured the heavens
to determine their location

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.240
on Earth, the location
of important spots

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.760
to run international
boundary lines

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.050
and to draw maps, all of
which depended on the stars

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.820
and were essential to creating
legitimate land claims.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.770
So before Google
Maps, right, if you

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.500
wanted to know where
you were precisely,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.180
you needed astronomy,
especially if you

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.390
wanted to claim that land as
yours or part of your nation.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.340
Second, astronomers
were able to turn

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.400
the individual observations
they'd make of the heavens

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.530
into accurate maps
and other things

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.010
because they shared data across
these robust national and

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.680
international networks.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.180
You get a sense of one of these
sort of compilations of data

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.070
there with the
chart on the right.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.610
And since I'm presenting
here at Google,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.680
the exchange of data and
the creation of data network

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.560
seems like a really
interesting topic.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.690
And I'd really be
interested in the Q&amp;A

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.257
to discuss how the kind of
networks I'm outlining here

00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:48.340
are similar or different
to those for which Google

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.410
is such a hub now.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.200
And third, while at
first blush astronomy

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.440
might seem like one of
the sciences most removed

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.660
from life on Earth,
in fact, I'd say

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.940
that it offers a really
good window into the wider

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.120
world of early America.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.350
That's because astronomy
in the early United States

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.560
was a tool of
expansion, depended

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.800
on slavery and
violence, was vital

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.020
to these geopolitical
and cultural competitions

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.430
among empires.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.250
It was a means of
claiming Indian lands.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.750
And because astronomy reveals
that then as much as now,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.670
really, astronomy
in the United States

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.390
was thoroughly multinational
and transnational.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.840
One of the first places where
astronomy and US expansion

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.390
overlapped was in the Gulf
South, the region that's

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.670
now the states of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.860
and Florida.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.620
When the US won independence
from Britain in 1783,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.460
all of this was part
of the Spanish empire.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.418
But US officials really
coveted this region.

00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:52.210
For one, they wanted
New Orleans because it

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.060
was this hub of trade between
the interior of the continent

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.700
and the whole Atlantic Ocean.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.680
And also because all
of this territory

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.130
seems like prime plantation
land for expanding slavery,

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.110
getting super rich off
cotton in particular.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.580
They had first started acquiring
parts of this region in 1795.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.950
By the early 1800s,
they had it all.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.010
This expansion was
very successful,

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.490
and it was the
first of many times,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.407
of course, that the
United States would expand

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:24.640
at Spanish America's expense,
something that's been going on

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.510
into the 20th century.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.480
So looking at astronomy
in this region

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.450
reveals a lot of the ways
that astronomy promoted

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.520
Anglo American imperialism.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.140
And perhaps most
importantly, it shows

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.950
that Anglos did not simply
export scientific practices

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.570
from the east into the west.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.450
Instead, these things
developed through encounters

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.590
in the region.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.620
And these are encounters
among Anglos and Spaniards,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.420
between masters and slaves,
and between whites and Indians.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.010
The earliest such
encounters occurred

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.890
during the Florida
boundary survey, which

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.620
was run from 1798 to 1800.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.570
You can see on the top of
the map there on the left,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.200
the line ran along the
31st parallel of latitude

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.180
for hundreds of miles.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.252
And a few of the boundary
stones still remain.

00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:11.710
But on the south
side of the stone,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.760
it said property of
King Carlos IV of Spain.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.640
Northern side of the rock said
property of the United States.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.710
And since this was a
massive and really important

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.210
astronomical
expedition, we're going

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:28.060
to spend a little bit of time
digging into it as this window

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.290
into early American astronomy.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.200
But astronomy was more
than just the means

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.000
to a geographic and
geopolitical end.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.880
It wasn't only
creating this boundary,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.380
this line in the sand.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.169
It was a field of competition
between Spain and the US.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.179
And both sides really
used this as a chance

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.960
to express national
pride and really compete

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.120
with each other for prestige.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.970
And also, part of the
reason this line was created

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.130
was that Spanish
and US officials

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.220
wanted to try to bring order
to this region, this very

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.610
chaotic border region where
they have little control.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.920
But the line itself actually
did more than actually

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.390
just prove the
messiness of this place,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.720
a place with very confusing
ethnic and national

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.230
relationships.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.960
For instance, Anglos
ended up working

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.410
for both the US and Spanish
Astronomical Commissions.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.190
Indians ended up working
both to protect and destroy

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.630
this survey.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.220
And both sides ended up
relying on black slaves.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.040
So to take a step
backwards briefly,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.730
Spain obviously had
the longer tradition

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.960
of using astronomy in the
service of imperialism here.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.180
Going back 300
years, it had been

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.710
crucial to navigators who
explored Spain's huge empire

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.560
and to the cartographers
who tried to map it.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.920
And a lot of these explorers
were often pictured

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.040
as astronomers, that astronomers
were these kind of heroes

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.360
of the empires, right, who used
the heavens to claim the earth.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.490
And astronomy really
remained a source of pride

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.310
for Spanish officials going
into the era of the Florida

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.810
boundaries survey.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.180
The governor of
Louisiana, a guy named--

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.830
Spanish Louisiana,
I should say--

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.250
Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, he
chose the astronomer he did,

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.030
a guy named William Dunbar,
a local plantation owner,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.420
because he said if I don't
get an excellent astronomer

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.640
like Dunbar, I'll be laughed at.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.710
This was really considered
a source of pride.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.290
And if gone wrong, shame, right?

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.780
That astronomy was
caught up in all

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.620
of these national
competitions for prestige.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.680
As in Spain and other
European empires,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.740
astronomy was a source
of both expansion

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.590
and national pride in
the early United States.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.925
For instance, right after
winning independence in 1783,

00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:46.300
there was an Anglo
astronomer who

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.510
wrote that the extensive
territories of the United

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.810
States are a foundation in
nature for a vast empire.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.690
And to know its geography and
fix the interesting boundaries

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.300
and lines, the best
and only proper method

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.872
is that of astronomical
observations.

00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:01.330
So from the very
beginning, they're

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.410
thinking of ways to use
astronomy to promote expansion.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.500
Also, as in Spain,
astronomy was a source

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.910
of national pride and identity.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.490
And one of the ways
you can see this

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.920
is in the early star
charts, these maps

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.620
of constellations that are
produced in the United States.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.560
These came up with new
distinctly American

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.150
constellations.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.820
On the left, there's a picture
of the bust of Columbus.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.400
My favorite on the right,
the flying squirrel,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.020
which you can still see up
near Perseus in the sky.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.860
Both patriotism and
imperialism would

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.540
mark the astronomical
work of the commission

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.490
of US astronomers
who went down to run

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.500
this boundary between
Spain and the United

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.020
States along the 31st parallel.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.390
The leader of this
expedition was an astronomer

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.370
named Andrew Ellicott.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.800
And for one, this
expedition gave him

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.060
a chance to experiment with
new methods of doing astronomy

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.610
in the field, especially
methods that are ideally

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.510
suited to this land-based empire
that the United States was

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.770
building.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.120
So astronomers at the time,
and today, really believed

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.910
that to do credible
astronomy depended

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.110
on being detached and
isolated from the influences

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.562
of the world, right?

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:17.020
Something that was
best achieved in

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.570
these closed-off observatories
and well-controlled spaces.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.910
And we still have this image
of science today, right?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.540
That doing credible
science depends

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.970
on being in these strictly
controlled spaces.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.530
Think of coming in here.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.840
You have to go to the desk
with your ID cards and such.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.862
And imagine trying to
do your work in a place

00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:38.320
where just anyone
could walk around

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.195
and start touching on
your keyboard and such.

00:12:40.195 --> 00:12:44.500
This idea of political
control to doing good science

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.870
remains very crucial.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.560
So one of Andrew Ellicott's
goals during this survey

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.720
was to figure out how
to produce this kind

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.650
of idealized detachment in
the midst of a place that

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.830
was poorly controlled
politically and still

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.950
very wild in terms of
nature, and wild animals,

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.300
and all of this.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.280
As he put it, despite the
efforts of France, Britain,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.730
and Spain to tame this
region, the country

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.260
is yet in a state of infamy.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.810
And so he aimed to,
quote, "determine

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.580
by experiment what
reliance might

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.430
be placed on observatories
made at temporary stations

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.110
without any of the
conveniences annexed

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.443
to permanent observatories."

00:13:22.443 --> 00:13:23.860
If he had thought
he could achieve

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.420
this kind of
detachment, Ellicott

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.580
was sorely disappointed.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.440
He constantly complained
about the weather

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.600
destroying his very
expensive instruments

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.330
and mosquitoes harassing
him, so he couldn't actually

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.250
concentrate on
his observations--

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.230
and also, human
sabotage, which we'll

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.920
talk about in a little bit.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.440
So this reminds us, for one,
that humans doing science,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.990
right, are never really isolated
from the world around them,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.510
even though they'd like to
think of themselves that way.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.180
And this is especially true
in places that are poorly

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.350
controlled places like these
unruly frontier regions

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.310
in particularly.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:06.120
Ellicott also found that
his social world was really

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.570
impeding his effort to
do credible astronomy

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.010
during this survey.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.530
For reasons that are
still very unclear,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.840
one of the other astronomers
that was working with him

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.120
accused Ellicott of
having threesomes

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.600
with his washerwoman
and his own son, who

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.270
is also an assistant
on this expedition.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.400
And even more
strangely, Ellicott

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.610
deflected these attacks by
accusing the Spanish people who

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.220
believed them of being
unscientific and bad

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.080
astronomers.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.210
As he put it, these
insinuations would

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.980
have but little weight with the
people of the United States.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.063
But the case is very
different with the Spaniards,

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:44.100
naturally jealous and uninformed
in science, particularly so far

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.550
as it relates to
astronomical observations.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.160
He didn't really explain how
he gets from defending himself

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.500
from charges of sexual
deviance to accusing Spaniards

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.110
of being bad at astronomy.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.450
But this rhetorical move
does suggest something

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:03.210
about how much Anglos' national
pride and prejudice really

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.110
cohered at these
frontiers of encounter.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.693
So Ellicott wasn't just drawing
a kind of territorial boundary

00:15:09.693 --> 00:15:10.443
in Florida, right?

00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:11.970
He was drawing a
national boundary,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.670
one that distinguished
Anglo Americans as peoples

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.198
with distinct traits.

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:19.740
And this characterization that
he makes, right, of the United

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.400
States and its citizens of a
scientific people in contrast

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.860
to those of Latin
America very much

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.500
remains part of national
discourse today.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.770
So the US astronomer Andrew
Ellicott and the astronomer

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.140
for Spain's commission,
William Dunbar,

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.490
their observations of stars,
planets, the moon, the sun,

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.310
moons of planets,
these were all used

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.120
to fix the position
of this boundary line.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.190
But all of this
astronomical work

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.830
wouldn't have been
possible without the work

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.080
of enslaved blacks.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.177
Black laborers carried
all this equipment

00:15:55.177 --> 00:15:56.260
that needed to be carried.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.930
They cut down hundreds of trees
to make it actually possible

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.510
to see the heavens
through the dense forests

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.990
of the southeastern
United States.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.940
And a lot of this work was done
in the middle of these swamps

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.762
and bayous.

00:16:07.762 --> 00:16:09.720
You couldn't control you
where you went, right?

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.490
You had to stay on
that latitude line.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.820
So extremely dangerous
and hard work,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.300
and work that the white
employees of these commissions

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.360
all got too sick to do from
the very beginning, really.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.360
So to put it simply,
this boundary

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.880
line we think of as
a work of astronomy,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.110
but it simply could not have
been done without slave labor.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.690
And at root, enslaved
labor depends

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.380
on violence, the
willingness of masters

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.650
to hurt people to make
them work for them, right?

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.200
And this use of slave labor
is really just one of the ways

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.030
that science hinged on violence
in the early United States.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.010
It's really common
to think of science

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.980
as this kind of essentially
peaceful activity.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.200
And this is part of the
appeal of science, right?

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.780
We think of it as this
peaceful detached thing.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.262
In the early United States-- and
I'd argue much more broadly--

00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:04.720
knowledge production
often depended

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.180
on various forms of
violence, from slavery

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.660
to direct military conquests
and even things like desecrating

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.869
and mutilating dead bodies.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:21.310
Anyway, the US and Spain split
the cost of hiring 24 slaves.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:26.680
Here's a list of one of
the records of these slave

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.552
employees that the
Spanish commission kept.

00:17:29.552 --> 00:17:32.010
The money, of course, wasn't
paid to the slaves themselves.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.920
It was paid to their masters
to rent out their work.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.930
And William Dunbar,
Spain's astronomer,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.090
was himself a very
rich slave owner.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.700
And he used these slaves most
heavily during the survey.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.110
And one of the reasons he
did so was using slave labor

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.320
as a way to transpose the
kind of order and discipline

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.710
of his plantation onto these
otherwise poorly controlled

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.540
spaces of the fieldwork.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.870
Remember how Andrew
Ellicott tried and failed

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.530
to order these spaces through
his temporary experimental

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.750
observatories.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.340
Dunbar had a lot more success
in this quest for control

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.220
because he was able to
use torture and violence

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.130
to recreate order
and discipline.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.920
By disciplining people, he was
able to do disciplined science.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.767
In fact, Dunbar would find this
to be such a successful method

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.350
that in his
correspondence with Thomas

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.420
Jefferson over the coming
years, he consistently

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.850
advocated that Jefferson
use enslaved laborers

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.520
for Western expeditions
like Lewis and Clark,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.250
instead of sending
Anglo Americans.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.270
So the violent coercion
of enslaved laborers

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.520
was able to get this
line progressing.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.710
But they were ultimately unable
to complete the survey because

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.420
of violence against
them, violence

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.130
coming from local natives.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.850
As the commission worked, it
started around the Mississippi

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.290
River and worked east.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.440
And as it worked
east towards Florida,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.520
they ran into lands dominated
by Creek and Seminole Indians,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.148
who very much resented
what this survey was doing

00:19:02.148 --> 00:19:03.690
because a lot of
their influence came

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.707
from being able to play
Spanish and US powers off

00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:08.790
against each other, right?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.020
And they feared that if this
clear boundary line were run

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.910
and jurisdictions
were made more clear,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.070
they'd lose this kind
of between status that

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.120
gave them such flexibility.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.170
So there was a threat
of armed violence

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.562
to ending this expedition.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.770
And one of the ways that
the expedition members tried

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.270
to overcome this
threat was actually

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.550
hiring different
natives as bodyguards.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.550
Groups of Upper Creeks got
paid by the commissioners

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.040
to travel with them and
protect them from attacks

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.710
by other Creeks and Seminoles.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.700
This is, again, a
list of employees.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.530
These are the chiefs and
bodyguards of the Creek Nation

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.790
hired by Spain.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.500
A lot of other
natives, though, chose

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.760
to try to thwart this expedition
instead of support it.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.870
And some did so by
non-violent means.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.600
Some stole the
expedition's horses

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.650
and scientific instruments.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.650
And these weren't actually
just random thefts--

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.360
they seem to have
chosen instruments

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.770
that they knew
would prevent them

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.500
from completing this boundary.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.020
They stole Ellicott's artificial
horizon, an instrument

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.890
that you need to
determine latitude.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.650
And you can't finish
this line if you

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.660
can't determine latitude.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.150
And Ellicott actually
grumbled that, as he put it,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.880
an impertinent young Indian
kept moving the minute hand

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.700
on his clock, which made
it impossible to determine

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.530
longitude.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.920
Still, the most effective form
of opposition to the survey

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.380
was armed resistance.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.690
And the surveyors
eventually encountered

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.390
a force of hundreds
of Seminoles,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.220
and as Ellicott put
it, they compelled

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.190
us to relinquish our design
and leave the country.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.430
So despite efforts by
Spain and the United States

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.690
to use this survey as
a chance to show off

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.855
their national
pride and power, it

00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:48.180
was actually Indian power on
the ground that determined

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.890
its ultimate success.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.480
For one, this is an
important reminder

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.090
of who was still actually
in charge in this region.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.140
It was still Indian country.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.930
But it also shows
some of the other ways

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.320
that science could
hinge on violence.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.920
It would be 20 years in some
places, 40 in this region,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.260
before the United
States had done enough

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.560
of a military conquest
that they controlled

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.440
those spaces enough
to do science in ways

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.617
they saw as credible and safe.

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:17.700
And this would keep going
throughout the expansion

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.580
into the west, too, where
people studying everything

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.610
from natural history
to astronomy either

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.740
were preceded by
the US Army often

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.620
or were embedded with
them, that a lot of time,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.950
these forces of soldiers
out in the west fighting

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.740
Indians and Mexicans had
naturalists, and astronomers,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.260
and geologists with them,
who were taking advantage

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.970
of the safety provided by them.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.360
So by the late 1790s,
the United States

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.180
had joined these European
empires, like France, Britain,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.720
Spain, and competed to control
this geopolitically valuable

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.090
region in the Gulf South.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.730
And like these other
empires, the United States

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.650
relied on local
cooperation to do this.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.625
Simply none of these
empires had enough power

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.750
to just send in their own
people and control these.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.620
They needed people on the ground
as local experts, local power

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.525
brokers.

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:08.620
And one of the most
influential of these guys

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.780
was the astronomer
William Dunbar.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.430
He had held plantations
in West Florida--

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.500
what's now the little
toe on Louisiana

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.040
sticking east of the
Mississippi River--

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.210
from during the eras of British,
Spanish, and ultimately,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.710
US rule.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.690
But far from being
a patriot for any

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.360
of these different
countries, he really

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.660
thrived by switching
allegiances among them,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.150
and sometimes holding these
allegiances simultaneously.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.960
And this portrait of Dunbar,
the guy in the middle, it's

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.382
hanging up in Natchez now.

00:22:42.382 --> 00:22:43.840
And the story behind
it is actually

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.330
that when it was
originally painted,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.000
he had a red coat because
Britain was in charge

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.090
of West Florida at the time.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.400
But after the region
fell under US control,

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.770
he had this repainted
to have a black coat,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.290
like a distinguished Republican.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.470
Literally a turncoat, right?

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.030
And here we see another
way that looking

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.800
at the rest of the country gives
us a different look at science

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.538
in the early United
States, that one

00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:11.830
of the things that historians
have almost all agreed on

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.730
is that a kind of
shared patriotism

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.812
made American
science what it was.

00:23:17.812 --> 00:23:19.270
But throughout most
of the country,

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.760
these people had ambivalent
allegiances at least,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.740
and some of them were directly
hostile to US rule, right?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.490
So Dunbar really became
a master of manipulating

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.970
imperial officials
and sort of having

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.250
this in-between status
between these empires in order

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.740
to improve his own
wealth and status.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.480
And he made very
similar arguments

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.110
to the patrons of the officials
in these different empires

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.420
to get more money.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.820
He told Gayoso de
Lemas, the governor

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.150
of Spanish Louisiana in
1798, as he was getting ready

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.310
for this Florida
boundary survey,

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.800
that he should get paid a lot
more than the US commission

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.900
because, quote,
"the high dignity

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.990
of a great and ancient monarchy,
when [? button ?] competition

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.060
with that of a newborn republic,
demands some distinction."

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.000
And this worked.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.740
Gayoso gave him
an enormous raise,

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.210
gave him all of
this land, and even

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.140
gave him servants to attend
to him during the survey.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.810
But this line itself actually
put Dunbar's plantation

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.990
outside of Natchez,
Mississippi, north

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.830
of the line in US territory.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.330
And so Dunbar had to start
looking for similar patronage

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.950
from US officials.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.510
And he had the most success
with President Thomas Jefferson.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.090
In 1804, Jefferson hired
Dunbar as the leader

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.770
of two scientific expeditions,
offering him $3,000

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.420
compensation.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.620
Dunbar was insulted.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.850
He wanted more.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.030
He told Jefferson that, quote,
"When a great empire talks

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.950
of compensation,
this ought to be

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.350
adequate to the importance
of the service and honorable

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.570
to the government and
to the individuals."

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.150
And just like Gayoso,
Jefferson fell for this play

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.070
on national pride and prestige.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.610
And he upped Dunbar's pay.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.453
He also knew that he
depended on him, right?

00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:04.870
So these kind of
negotiations were

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.300
really typical of
how imperialism

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.510
had worked in the
Spanish empire,

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.460
like this contested place
where weak officials really

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.260
had to rely on local
cooperation if they

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.103
wanted to get anything done.

00:25:17.103 --> 00:25:18.520
Individuals like
Dunbar had really

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.890
thrived in this system
of negotiated authority,

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.910
and they could continue
to do so under US rule

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.490
because the United States,
just like Spain, was,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.520
as Dunbar put it,
this great empire that

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.530
also was overextended, also
relied on local cooperation.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.180
So you can see from
examples like this

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.050
how Spanish ways of combining
science and imperialism

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.083
persisted into the
era of US rule.

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.500
And they did so
largely because of

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.410
the selfish and
self-interested actions

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.880
of guys like Dunbar, these
men of science on the ground.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.160
So William Dunbar
and Thomas Jefferson,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.160
they maintained this
correspondence for years

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.820
in the early 1800s.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.070
And it's fascinating to see
how new scientific practices

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.900
emerged from their
exchange of letters

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.078
across these hundreds of miles.

00:26:07.078 --> 00:26:08.620
In this sense, too,
the United States

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.500
was very similar to
European empires, where

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.020
scientific knowledge
didn't really

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.060
diffuse from Europe
to the world, right,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.470
but actually
emerged in this kind

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.120
of back-and-forth conversation
between colonies and metro

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.420
poles.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.280
So for instance,
Jefferson and Dunbar

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.790
developed together a new
method of determining longitude

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.380
on land through astronomy,
one that was ideally

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.490
suited for the US, this
kind of land-based empire

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.660
that the United
States was building.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.153
So European empires,
at this time,

00:26:40.153 --> 00:26:42.070
had really struggled
with [INAUDIBLE] question

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.073
of how to find longitude at sea.

00:26:44.073 --> 00:26:45.490
It was a challenge
that was solved

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.990
right around this
[INAUDIBLE] moment

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.510
by a guy named John Harrison,
who basically invented

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.866
a really, really good clock
that could be carried on ships.

00:26:52.866 --> 00:26:56.170
But for the US, finding
the longitude at sea

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.310
wasn't as important as
being able to do so on land.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.260
After all, they were building
this land-based empire.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.440
So what Jefferson
really wanted was a way

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.940
that a single explorer traveling
with sturdy, cheap instruments

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.320
could find out their longitude
through observations.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.820
You couldn't carry around one
of these Harrison chronometers

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.140
with you.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.765
It would break.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.110
It was big and heavy.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.990
So this challenge
really came to the fore

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.488
as Jefferson starts planning
these western expeditions

00:27:22.488 --> 00:27:25.030
after the Louisiana Purchase,
things like the Lewis and Clark

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.620
expedition.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.590
And Jefferson starts consulting
astronomers and mathematicians

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.170
throughout the country looking
for answers to this problem.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.110
And some of this advice
was useless at best.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.020
There's this image on the left.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.820
There's an inventor
named Timothy Clark who

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.340
sent Jefferson his design
for a device for finding

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.352
the longitude.

00:27:43.352 --> 00:27:45.310
And the way he explained
it is that there would

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.435
be a plumb line with the
weight that what you would

00:27:47.435 --> 00:27:49.390
fix at a particular longitude.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.340
Then as you rolled this
thing east to west,

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.210
this line would tilt to
stay gravitationally locked

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.835
at your original longitude.

00:27:56.835 --> 00:27:58.210
This doesn't work
because there's

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.140
no way this could possibly work.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.820
But it shows the extent to which
this longitude question, right,

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:08.200
became this national scientific
endeavor, both for astronomers,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.130
mathematicians, but also for
these tinkers and inventors.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.260
Jefferson had a far
more productive exchange

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.110
with Dunbar, who was, in fact,
his most distant correspondent

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.760
on this.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.380
The two fine-tuned a method
of determining longitude

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.560
through lunar altitude
observations, which

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.703
is different than the
usual stellar angle

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.620
observations, which we
don't need to get into.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.430
But basically, measuring
the angular distance

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.130
from the horizon to
the moon and then

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.990
comparing those
observations with those

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.390
in a place with a known
time, like the observatory

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.460
in Greenwich, where the
zero line of longitude is.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.130
And Dunbar explained
that, quote,

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.590
"This method was much better
calculated for travelers

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.710
by land than voyagers by sea.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.210
And a single observer with
a good altitude instrument,

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.400
though deprived of a
timekeeper, may still

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.328
make useful observations
for the advancement

00:28:53.328 --> 00:28:54.370
of geographic knowledge."

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.078
So all of these things
that Jefferson had

00:28:56.078 --> 00:28:58.027
wanted from this method.

00:28:58.027 --> 00:28:59.860
So this was a method
that was really created

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.820
with a new emerging kind of
American icon in mind, right?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.910
Like one of these guys
like Meriwether Lewis,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.420
these solo heroic explorers
who could go out and figure out

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.440
where they were and
make better maps

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.470
in this kind of low-tech,
rugged American way,

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:19.240
a distinct American science
for a distinct American empire.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.500
So guys like William Dunbar
and many other astronomers

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.840
collected all of this
astronomical data.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.850
Dunbar had built
his own observatory

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.400
on his own plantation, in fact.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.670
But all of this data
had to be compiled.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.430
It had to be calculated
and compared in order

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.230
to figure out things
like longitude

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.912
to comparing observations
in different places.

00:29:44.912 --> 00:29:46.870
And one of the key figures
in the United States

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.720
in interpreting and calculating
all of this data was

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.940
the Spanish astronomer
José Joaquin de Ferrer.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.900
Ferrer had been an officer
in the Spanish Navy

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.520
and had served in Spain's
royal observatory in Cadiz.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.050
And around 1800, he
moved to New York,

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.410
really bringing this tradition
of Spanish excellence

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.020
in astronomy to
the United States.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.640
Ferrer became deeply involved
with the US community.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.620
He became a member of the
American Philosophical Society

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.500
in Philadelphia,
and it was him who

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.980
really was in charge of taking
all of this raw astronomical

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.530
data flowing into the
Philosophical Society,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.870
turning this into useful
geographic knowledge,

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.520
things like latitudes
and longitudes

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.780
that could be used to make maps.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.900
And he was able to do
this even more precisely

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.960
because he was also
tapped into this larger

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.980
international network.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.900
He was receiving data from
Spain, from South America,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.980
from the Caribbean, from
Germany, from France,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.470
all of which helped to make
these observations more

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.970
accurate.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.637
The more data you
had, the more accurate

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:50.110
your locations could be.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.530
So Ferrer's role in
calculating and synthesizing

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.480
this information was
perhaps most clear in 1806

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.080
during a solar eclipse.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.120
As William Dunbar had
put it, this eclipse

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.490
was to be seen all over
Europe and North America,

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.860
and was thus very
important for settling

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.120
comparative longitudes.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.380
Basically, you just
figure out the local time

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.170
where you see the eclipse in
all of these different places.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.810
Allows you to have a good
comparison of longitudes

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.730
from throughout the
whole space where

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.350
you could see the eclipse.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.810
Observers from throughout
the United States and Spain

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.840
sent their raw data on
this eclipse to Ferrer.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.570
And he was able to
calculate through charts

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.550
like this one on the left
where all of these places

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.540
were with more precision,
make better maps.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.000
On the third from the
bottom on the left column--

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.760
it's hard to see--

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.520
it says the forest near Natchez.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.710
That's the plantation
observatory

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.270
that William Dunbar kept.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.520
And his observations are
particularly valuable in this

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.750
because they were by
far the most western.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.000
The further away, the better,
really, with this stuff.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.690
And this is Ferrer's drawing
of the so-called corona,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.140
the radiation that you
see around the moon

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.878
during a full solar eclipse.

00:32:04.878 --> 00:32:06.920
It was him who actually
coined this term, corona,

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.340
that we still use today,
talking about eclipses.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.170
So perhaps more
importantly, Ferrer

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:16.700
was able to draw
on his experiences

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.430
as an astronomer for Spain to
help officials in the United

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.620
States figure out the
best ways to use astronomy

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.360
to promote this expansion
that they desired so much.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.970
So based on Ferrer's advice,
several astronomers actually

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.340
lobbied Thomas Jefferson
that the United States

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.410
needed to build a
national observatory based

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.790
on the model of Cadiz.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.290
They said this model
was much better

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.380
than that of France or Spain.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.318
And this has actually
sort of turned a lot

00:32:45.318 --> 00:32:46.610
of our assumptions on our head.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.310
For a long time, historians
have seen Spanish science

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.198
as backwards compared to
that of Britain, France.

00:32:53.198 --> 00:32:54.740
At the time, though,
people in the US

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.190
very much saw this as
the model to emulate.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.590
So in short, I'd argue
that American science

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.860
is thoroughly multinational
from the very beginning.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.330
And the fact that historians
have almost entirely excluded

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.900
non-Anglos and especially
Hispanics from this story

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.910
says a lot more about
modern-day prejudices

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.800
than it does about
the conditions

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.110
of the scientific
community at the time.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.310
So astronomy is just
one of the sciences

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.110
I consider in this book,
"Frontiers of Science."

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.110
But I hope that this case
has provided a glimpse

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.510
into an intellectual
world that's

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.030
just very different
from our usual vision

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.190
of early American science.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.960
Again, historians
have usually agreed

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.170
that it's this post-independence
context of freedom

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.270
and democratic government
that set American science off

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.160
on its own path.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.120
But this conclusion really rests
on some very bold assumptions,

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.830
even if they're widely
accepted assumptions.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.570
It assumes that US territory
was a place defined primarily

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:56.000
by liberty and democracy.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.190
It assumes that American
people studying nature

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.225
were free and
independent citizens.

00:34:01.225 --> 00:34:02.600
And therefore, it
tends to assume

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.900
that the only truly American
intellectuals were white Anglo

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.590
men on the eastern
fringe of the continent.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.860
My book offers a more inclusive,
and I think more accurate,

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.281
way to understand knowledge
in the early United States.

00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:17.989
This intellectual
world of eastern Anglos

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.909
was neither separate
from nor really

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.090
all that much superior
to a vaster early America

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.969
populated by natives,
blacks, Hispanics, Creoles.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.550
And all of these people
studied the natural world.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.639
But again, it was not
liberty or democracy

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:35.750
that most influenced their
intellectual pursuits.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.949
It was inequality,
imperialism, and violence.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:44.030
So lastly, I believe that
recovering this broader

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.040
vision of American
science matters

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.870
far beyond the academic
work of historians.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.820
If American intellectual
history continues

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.429
to be told essentially
as the story about Anglos

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.110
working in isolation from
the rest of the continent,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.840
it remains really
easy to conclude

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.730
that other American
peoples have never

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.270
really mattered to knowledge
and culture in America.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.490
And it thus remains really
easy for huge portions

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.430
of the population,
including voters,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.490
to rally behind a very
narrow vision of America's

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.380
cultural past and
use this vision

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.940
to justify ongoing exclusion,
ongoing inequality.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.740
But if scholars
and teachers strive

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.250
to elaborate the many, many ways
that multinational encounters

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.970
have always been central to
American intellectual life,

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.110
then a new set of stories about
which peoples and places matter

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.920
to American culture can
then start to become normal.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.480
And more Americans
might then start

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.080
to draw on a vision of
history that inspires greater

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.900
inclusivity, greater humility.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.700
Thank you.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:52.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.507
And I have time for questions.

00:35:54.507 --> 00:35:56.090
AUDIENCE: Throughout
American history,

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.190
there's been waves of
anti-intellectualism.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:04.130
And a lot of that is, I think,
focused on or personifies

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:08.150
intellectuals as eastern--

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.900
what you call fringe
of the continent.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.820
And I was wondering if there
is any sort of relation

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.192
between the fact that,
as you were saying,

00:36:19.192 --> 00:36:20.900
all these other people
have been excluded

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.660
and then if that
plays into that sort

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.220
of political
anti-intellectualism.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.680
It just seemed like an
interesting sort of parallel.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.990
CAMERON STRANG: Oh, it does,
and I haven't thought about it

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.730
in those terms.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.130
And I think it's a really
great point in terms of

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:36.170
whether or not it's a kind
of resentment at exclusion

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.660
or just a sense of--

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.317
I live in Nevada
now, and there's

00:36:40.317 --> 00:36:42.650
this sense of like, oh, these
effete northeasterners who

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.870
think they know better
than everyone else, right?

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.650
And I think at least
at the beginning,

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.170
this image occurred largely
because these northeasterners

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.350
wanted everyone to know that
they were better than them.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.870
Like, there is a very sort of
clear sense of Anglo American

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.010
cultural superiority, especially
in these eastern spaces

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.630
that was pushed west.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.570
I'd say now, though, it's
less regional and more based

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.830
on class in a lot of
ways in that sense.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.340
But yeah, I hadn't
really thought

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:19.040
about this in connection
to sort of resentment

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.480
of intellectualism more broadly.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.332
That's a really great point.

00:37:22.332 --> 00:37:23.790
Thank you all very
much for coming.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.960
It's been a real pleasure
speaking here at Google.
