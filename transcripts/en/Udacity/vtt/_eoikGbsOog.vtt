Lauren, has anyone ever told you, you have

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.019
a trait in common with one of your parents?

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.300
&gt;&gt; Some people say I have my mom's eyes or my dad's nose, but I've

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.680
a sense of humor just like my dad. But, I'm also, kind of, my mom too.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually have my mom's smile and my dad's eyes. And,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.820
I actually think I'm probably a pretty even mix of their personalities. Oh yeah,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.900
I can see it.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.180
&gt;&gt; Well we all share similarities with our blood relatives, but the extent to

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.280
which we may feel have that similarity

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.210
depends on which relative we're talking about.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.800
&gt;&gt; So tell us, who in your family do you think you

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.830
resemble the most? Take a guess if you don't know exactly who.
