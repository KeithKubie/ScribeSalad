[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.220
JOHN WOOD: Room to Read started
a little bit by happenstance.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.210
I never expected to quit
Microsoft to become a full-time

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.370
do-gooder--

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.090
full time education person.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.080
But in 1998, when I was at
my seven year anniversary

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.790
with Microsoft, I decided
to take a long trip

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.212
to escape from the day
to day grind and meetings

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:25.420
and email and all that stuff.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.160
And a good place
to escape really

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.100
is the Himalayas, because you're
just isolated from the day

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.470
to day reality.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.760
I went to Nepal to do an 18 day
track in the Annapurna circuit.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.200
And at the end of
my first day, I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.520
met a local headmaster who had
a dilapidated little school

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.770
in the little village
of Bahundanda, Nepal.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.027
He asked me if I wanted
to come do a quick tour,

00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:48.610
and I thought this
would be a cool way

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.744
to see what's a local
school look like.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.660
And like many schools
in the developing world,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.540
it was simultaneously hopeful,
because 400 kids were showing

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.250
up, but it was also rather sad.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.564
The physical infrastructure
is in horrible shape,

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:02.230
the classrooms are
terribly overcrowded,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.880
they couldn't even afford desks.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.379
And when the headmaster
showed me the library,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.300
that was the most depressing
part of the visit,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.008
because the library
was completely devoid

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:10.021
of children's books.

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.520
And I asked the headmaster why,
and he said, well, in Nepal,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.024
we're too poor to afford
education for our kids.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:17.440
But if we don't
get them educated,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.130
we're going to
always remain poor.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.070
And that struck me
as a cruelest irony--

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.870
that you could look at any
five-year-old or six-year-old

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.640
in the eyes and say,
literally, you've

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.514
lost the lottery of life, right?

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.180
By the very accident
where you were born

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.640
and where I were born,
we got a good education.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.740
And it doesn't mean our
lives are easy or perfect,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.640
but we've been given
that opportunity.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.389
So these kids didn't
have the opportunity.

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.350
I thought, OK, I can
help this headmaster out.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.725
He gave me a
homework assignment.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:42.320
He said, perhaps, sir, you will
someday come back with books.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.060
I eagerly agreed.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.435
I shook his hand, and I said,
I'll see you within a year.

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:48.520
And I went back a year later
with 3,000 donated books

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.360
on the back of six donkeys,
and it was the happiest day

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.950
the kids had had,
because they'd never

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.866
seen brightly colored
children's books before.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.700
So it was kind of
like this mosh pit--

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.900
this literacy palooza.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.570
Kids were stage
diving onto the books.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.750
Their eyes were bright,
and their smiles were wide.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.889
It was a happy day
for me too, though,

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.680
because I realized that
there was something

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.100
a small amount of effort
and a small amount of money

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.500
would give these kids a chance
that their parents never

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.000
thought their kids would have.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.610
And that was the genesis
of Room to Read, really.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.860
That was good, but
let's not stop at one.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.532
In a world of 770 million
illiterate people,

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:25.240
we've got to find a
way to do a lot more.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.070
So that's where I
face the dilemma of,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.410
do I keep doing this
as a hobby, or do I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.170
quit Microsoft and make
it a full time thing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.775
that I do 7/24 365?

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:35.650
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Before
we go to that piece

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.140
where you professionalized
it-- so you said you came back

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.730
with 7,000 books, you said?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.215
JOHN WOOD: 3,000 books.

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:43.090
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Did
you buy them yourself?

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580
Was this donations?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.720
This first year--
how did it go along?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.920
JOHN WOOD: It was done
really as just a book

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.919
drive over the internet.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.130
It was sending old-fashioned
emails out to people.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.740
This is actually
before we really even

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.950
had widespread texting--

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.640
sending emails out to friends,
asking them to send books

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.680
to a couple collection
points we established

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.990
with friends in my parents'
garage in the state of Colorado

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.630
in the US.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.820
And so many people when
they sent books to us,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.770
they wrote us letters--

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.260
us me and my father and I,
because my 73-year-old father

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.970
had become my unpaid
right hand man.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.820
He needed a retirement
project, and my mother

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.710
needed him to have a
retirement project.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.575
And so many people
wrote us letters

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:20.950
to say, thank you
for doing this,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.410
because I've traveled in Nepal,
and I've seen the poverty

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.550
and wanted to do
something about it.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.440
But just giving money away
doesn't solve poverty.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.341
Other people said, thanks for
doing this, but by the way,

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.840
I've traveled in Cambodia, where
the Khmer Rouge burned down

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.697
the schools and
burned the books.

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:38.030
Can you bring the program there?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.380
So I just realized that so many
people got emotionally invested

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.750
in the idea that if you can
give a child in a poor country

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.320
the access to education that
they would not have otherwise

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.020
had, that that is something that
people can get excited about,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.964
because it's a permanent
solution to poverty.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:52.880
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: OK.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.890
I see.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.515
So you're at this
point of 3,000 books.

00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:56.681
You come back, they love it.

00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.330
So what went through
your head then

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.630
about your career and
the choices you faced?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.130
JOHN WOOD: I think leaving that
little village of Bahundanda

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.050
that day was very difficult.
Because the minute

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.580
I started walking away
from that village,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.440
I was walking back
towards my normal life.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.600
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: So you hadn't
quit your job at that point?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.140
JOHN WOOD: I hadn't.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.470
I had just taken a week off.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.490
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Did you consider it?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.280
Or was that--

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.680
JOHN WOOD: No, it was
premature to consider it.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.649
But what happened
was the minute I

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.250
saw how much this meant to
the kids and their parents

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.390
and their teachers--

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.494
and then even other teachers
had tracked four, five, six

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.120
hours from other remote
villages to be there.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.060
And they said, we heard there's
a man coming with books.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.050
And then people would--

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.070
petition was the
word they used--

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.731
can may I petition you
to come to our school?

00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.230
And so the challenge
I think I faced

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.927
going back to Microsoft to
where I was living in Beijing--

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:43.510
I was director of
business development

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.584
for the greater China region,
which is a very demanding role.

00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:48.250
I thought about those
other headmasters,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.560
and I thought about all the
schools I'd seen in Vietnam,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.935
and I thought about what having
traveled through Cambodia

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:55.090
in 1994 post Khmer Rouge.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.170
I thought, this is a really big
potential thing I could go do.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.540
To be clear, I didn't make
enough money at Microsoft

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.340
to start a foundation.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.325
I had made enough to
take a financial risk

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.039
and start a
cash-strapped NGO, but I

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.080
was going to have to be
reliant on public support

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.600
from the very beginning to
really get it scaled up.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.550
But the thing I faced really--

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.220
I think what it came down to for
me is, I could keep doing this

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.360
as a hobby.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.800
The problem is very simple--

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.759
hobbies don't scale,
organizations do.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.550
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: So
you're at this point.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.960
You decided you wanted
to just full time.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.590
But I think you
made a good point--

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.720
it wasn't also
your money, so you

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.636
need to come up with a
system and a model that

00:05:29.636 --> 00:05:31.124
actually scales.

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:32.040
So what happened then?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.415
What is the scaling then that
you managed over the years?

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.956
JOHN WOOD: Well, what the Room
to Read founding team did from

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:39.310
the very beginning was to
say, let's create and adopt

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.710
the project model, where anybody
anywhere can be connected

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.650
to a school-- it could be in
India, it could be in Tanzania,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.780
it could be in Vietnam--

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.652
and know exactly where
their money went.

00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:52.110
Too often with
charities, you don't

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.960
know where the money goes.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.260
You don't know if it's being
used to get things done

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.980
or whether it's being used in
superfluous or wasteful ways.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.590
So the number one thing we
said is adopt a school model

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.917
where our investors--

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:04.000
we don't call them donors.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.690
Donor to me sounds too passive.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.920
Our investors can get a
chance to connect directly

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.824
with a school.

00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:10.740
We'll send them photos,
we'll send them video.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.736
They can go visit it.

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:13.860
And that's really I think
what started to take off.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.264
So Marc Andreessen was
one of our first investors

00:06:17.264 --> 00:06:17.930
in Room to Read.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.140
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: The founder
of Netscape, a famous investor.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.090
JOHN WOOD: Which is
ironic, because I

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.040
had been part of the
group at Microsoft

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.105
that was against Netscape, and
we were competing head to head.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:27.480
But when I showed
Marc the model,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.250
he just said, it's
unbelievable that you

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.160
can reach all these kids
with one simple library that

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.430
costs in inflation
adjusted dollars $20,000--

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.400
enough to actually set up
a library serving 400 kids.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.144
So it's literally
$50 per child served.

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:44.310
So we started getting a lot
of Silicon Valley money.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.289
Paul Haahr, who was an early
Google employee in the Bay

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.080
Area-- he and his wife
Susan got behind it,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.000
and Don Valentine from
Sequoia Capital and his family

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.800
underwrote a lot
of the early work.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800
Because we just went to
a lot of the capitalists

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.140
and a lot of the tech
community to say,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.500
this model means a little bit
of money can go a long ways.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.970
And it's a chance--

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.440
I would never have enough
money to endow a building

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.320
at Northwestern University,
but gosh, you can actually

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.800
set up a program and bring a
literacy program and a library

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.134
program to a rural village
for a relatively small amount

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:16.633
of money.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:18.340
So that was the first
part of the model.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.270
The second part was really
having a very low overhead

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.550
model so we could prove
that the money was not

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.460
getting spent on overhead,
but it was going directly

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.220
to the program.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.300
So we deploy about $0.84 on the
dollar directly to programs.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.950
Charity Navigator, our rating
agency, gives us four stars.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.560
We've had that
for 10 plus years.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.050
And we take the financial
efficiency of it

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.160
very, very seriously.

00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:44.430
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Fantastic.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.250
So talk a bit about the impact.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.820
Because, obviously for us,
we have access to books.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.470
But talk a bit about what it
means for somebody living there

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.530
with access to books.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.710
What does this mean?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.711
What is the impact of the
trajectory of their lives?

00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.710
JOHN WOOD: So for us, we
started from very, very

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.490
humble beginnings.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.573
And that first little
library in Bahundanda, Nepal

00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:06.630
was opened in 1999.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.840
I was in India two weeks ago,
and we actually celebrated

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.320
the 20,000th community that
Room to Read has reached with

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.370
our literacy programs
and our library program.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.170
So it's scaled way
beyond my wildest dreams,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.870
where we've launched now in
14 countries around the world,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.840
primarily in
Southeast Asia, South

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.390
Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.330
And a really big
part of our model

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.760
is that really,
our leadership team

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.039
wants to run the
organization like a business.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.580
In the early years,
I said, the heart

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.905
of Mother Teresa, the
scalability of Starbucks.

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:41.280
And that's really been our
model from the very beginning.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.580
A lot of our leadership team are
what I call corporate refugees.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.454
They've worked for a decade
plus in the for-profit sector.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.870
They've learned
to run businesses.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.424
They've learned to
scale businesses.

00:08:50.424 --> 00:08:51.840
But a lot of our
leadership team--

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.090
they're ex-Goldman Sachs,
they're ex-Credit Suisse,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.060
they're ex-Chiron, I'm not
the only ex-Microsoft person

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.010
to be employed,
they're ex-Deloitte.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.820
And a lot of our leadership is
really built around the idea

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.810
that if you can run this like
a business and scale it--

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.800
and we have to
scale, because Google

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.050
is a classic example
of an organization that

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.310
sees opportunity in scale.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.450
We don't think the line
should stop at the nonprofit.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.090
We think nonprofit should
also scale as quickly.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.080
Our moonshot is 770 million
people are illiterate.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.030
Over 200 million kids
in the developing world

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.340
don't go to school every
day, and 2/3 of those

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.610
are girls and women.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.660
So if we could solve those
three problems in our lifetime,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.470
the effect on the world
would be just astronomical.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.970
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
So if I mentioned

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.950
I'm maybe a girl in
one of those villages,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.354
what does it mean for
me to have those books?

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:43.770
I guess they have
teachers, right?

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.440
So it's material in a concept?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.520
Talk a bit about the context.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.900
How does this now play
a role in their lives?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.180
I guess there's still more
context around it for them

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.900
to useful--

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.510
the books.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.176
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:59.986
So our goal is that every
community that we work in

00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:02.110
on our literacy program,
for example-- the literacy

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.320
program's, of course, open
to both boys and girls.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.410
It's important, we
think, that number one,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.880
they have trained teachers
and trained librarians.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.130
So that's a big part
of what Room to Read

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.713
does, because your
school's only going

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:16.900
to be as good as the
adults you have running it.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.060
We have community co-investment,
so the communities

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.010
are required to
put resources in.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.350
Quite often, it's sweat
equity-- it's labor--

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.816
to prove they value it.

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:26.440
The Ministry of
Education is required--

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.190
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
What do they do?

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.870
For example, you say sweat
labor-- what do they do,

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.260
for example?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.676
JOHN WOOD: So I was in Sri
Lanka at one of our communities

00:10:31.676 --> 00:10:33.640
we work in, and
parents had proudly

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.100
told me that they
had come and painted

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.460
both the inside and the
outside walls of the library.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.220
One parent told me that he
had gone out and saved money

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.980
to buy a 100 pound bag of
cement as his contribution

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.930
to building this
library building.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.890
Things like that where
our investor probably

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.130
made a little bit less effort
to write a large check--

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.170
they made a lot of
effort to earn the money,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.940
but the effort put in
by these communities

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.510
is absolutely incredible.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.850
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: So you
create leverage and buy in,

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.710
and it really multiplies
actually the impact?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.190
JOHN WOOD: Exactly.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.815
It multiplies it,
and it also, I think,

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:06.844
makes the programs
much more sustainable.

00:11:06.844 --> 00:11:08.260
Because if we just
send in a bunch

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.060
of well-meaning volunteers
to do a project,

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.015
and then those volunteers
leave, the community

00:11:13.015 --> 00:11:15.140
doesn't feel that sense of
ownership or engagement.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.840
So what we've always
been all about

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.131
is making sure that the
communities feel engaged enough

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:20.860
and that they value
the programs enough

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.940
that they will co-invest.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.356
And then the
Ministry of Education

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:24.730
also co-invests in each project.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.610
So when Room to Read brings our
literacy program to a village,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.260
we require the
Ministry of Education

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.660
to provide the teachers
and the librarians

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.740
and to pay their ongoing salary.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.530
Again, it's just
a way to make sure

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.470
that we're setting ourselves
up for long term success

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.030
by having a
tripartite agreement--

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.589
Room to Read, local community,
Ministry of Education.

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:44.380
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: It's
fascinating to hear

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.421
how you actually started
with, in a sense, a very

00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:47.050
simple idea--

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.340
bringing books.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.710
But then you managed to
scale a lot of-- it's almost

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.750
like a business model, right?

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.600
It's not a business.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.850
It's a nonprofit.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.350
But it's still a
model that you had

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.490
to develop and refine and find a
product market fit it and scale

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.180
it.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.570
It's a very
professional approach.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.560
Could be one of the
secrets, maybe, of scaling

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.144
this-- that it's run
by professionals?

00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:09.018
JOHN WOOD: I think that's
a really key thing.

00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:10.540
In our case, we've
also layered in--

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.070
and we have great support on
this from the Gates Foundation,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.420
from Bill and Melinda's
foundation-- that we've also

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.330
set up a research monitoring
and evaluation arm.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
Because we don't want to just
put in a literacy program

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.900
or put in a long-term education
program for girls and hope

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.010
it works, right?

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.250
The whole idea that in God we
trust, all others bring data--

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.750
we do that.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.430
We measure reading scores.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.506
I was in India two
weeks ago and saw

00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:36.880
the second graders
in our schools

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.955
were reading at 37
words per minute,

00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:40.330
whereas in the
average government

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.280
school that we're
not engaged in,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.380
that number is 14
words per minute.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.874
We track comprehension levels.

00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:47.665
We track how many books
are being taken out

00:12:47.665 --> 00:12:49.040
of the libraries.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.760
We track how many of the girls
in our girl's education program

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.490
are attending our life skills
courses, how many of them

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.580
are bringing their parents along
so their parents feel engaged.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.100
So we're kind of data-driven
geeks at Room to Read.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.370
And I think that data collection
and that evidence-based

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.420
learning permeates
everything we do

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.234
so we can find out
where are we strong,

00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:12.400
and let's replicate that
and share it out across all

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.720
the country we're working in.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.680
Let's also find out and admit
where we're not doing so well,

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.120
and then go try
to figure out why.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.744
What's keeping those
numbers from being

00:13:20.744 --> 00:13:23.770
as good as we want them to be,
and how does the program design

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.440
then need to evolve so that
those numbers get better

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.950
over time?

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.241
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Fascinating.

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.606
Do you have examples of maybe
something that didn't work

00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:32.230
and then you stopped
it, and then maybe

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.688
something that's surprising
and worked better than you ever

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:35.772
thought based on the data?

00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:36.437
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:13:36.437 --> 00:13:38.500
I once asked that question
to Dr. Cory Heyman,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.190
who at the time was our director
of programs-- one of the most

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.190
brilliant people I know.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.960
And every time he talks to
me, I feel like I get smarter.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.043
And I asked him that once.

00:13:46.043 --> 00:13:47.877
I said, well, give me
an example of this.

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:49.210
So it's actually Cory's example.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.130
But he was telling
me in our early days

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.060
in Zambia, where
80% plus of girls

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.790
don't make it past grade
six, we had all these girls

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.080
in our program.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.870
And the dropout rate
wasn't ridiculously high,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.060
but it was high enough
compared to other countries.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.410
We said, let's go study.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.810
Why are girls dropping out
of our program in grade seven

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.520
or grade eight or grade nine?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.680
And so they did a survey,
and they basically

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.054
tried to find out what reasons.

00:14:13.054 --> 00:14:15.220
Two of the top three reasons
girls were dropping out

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.180
of school were pregnancy
and teenage marriage.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.000
And the more the local
teams studied that,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.980
the more they realized
that bringing the girls

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.160
into the program at age 12
or 13 might be too late.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.700
The bad habits may have
already been formed.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.920
So they made a decision
to move the entry age

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.650
into the program up
by two to three years

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.549
so the girls would
come in earlier

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:38.340
and be able to take
part in our life skills

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.880
programs, which teach things
like the benefits of delaying

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.460
marriage, contraception,
their rights over their body--

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.610
things like that.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.175
In addition to the
academics, we're

00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:49.800
also teaching the
girls the life skills

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.342
they'll need to negotiate key
decisions they'll have to make.

00:14:52.342 --> 00:14:54.633
A lot it's done in partnership
with the tech community.

00:14:54.633 --> 00:14:56.910
So Goldman Sachs has
underwritten a program

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.350
to teach entrepreneurship.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.450
The MetLife foundation
is underwriting a program

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.550
to teach the girls
financial literacy.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.280
And that's a key part of
Room to Read's success

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.380
is partnership with
the corporate world.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.730
We're very pro-capitalist.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.580
Our belief is that if we
can partner with the world's

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.970
leading firm, we can just get
a lot more done in partnership

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.160
and get a lot more
done working together.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.910
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
It's fascinating to see

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.621
how you scaled this
from this core idea.

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.120
And like you said, it's almost
life coaching that you offer,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.620
really.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.820
You change deeply ingrained
habits and notions.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.990
You mentioned a scale.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.020
And in the preparation, I
looked at some of the numbers.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.770
It's mind-blowing.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.870
So talk about where
you stand today

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.900
and how big this whole
thing has become.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.880
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.980
The numbers are really great.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.180
They've got to get higher.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.710
You've got to stay humble,
you've got to stay hungry.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.120
We were happy with
where we are, but we're

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.786
well aware that there's
tens of millions

00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:51.930
of kids who have never
heard of Room to Read.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.070
And every day we lose is
a day we can't get back.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.850
So when I tell our results, I
try to also say with humility,

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.710
we've got a long,
long way to go.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.210
But two weeks ago,
we were in India.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.020
We celebrated a
couple of milestones.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.900
One is over 50,000 young
women have taken part in,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.587
are enrolled in,
or have graduated

00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:09.420
from our long-term
girl's education program.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.157
The number is actually 54,000.

00:16:12.157 --> 00:16:12.990
It's pretty amazing.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.354
Every time we raise 300
Swiss francs, one more girl

00:16:15.354 --> 00:16:16.770
can be in the
program for one more

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.130
year, so it's a very
inexpensive model of change.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.070
We celebrated our
20,000 community

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.980
reached by our literacy
and our library programs.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.550
That means over 18 million
books in the hands of kids.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.850
That means, right now,
by the end of 2017,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.000
we should have about
12.5 million students

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.550
in 15 countries benefiting
from our programs,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:43.350
and that number will go to
at least 15 million by 2020.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.030
But if I was a
betting man, I'd bet

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.800
we'll be even higher than that.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.270
The official number
is 15 million,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.460
but I have faith we're
going to get to reach

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.570
even more kids than that.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.153
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
And then I saw also

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:56.040
your revenue numbers
are impressive.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.020
What's the total revenues?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.330
JOHN WOOD: We bring in
about $50 million US a year,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.540
and that's pure
philanthropic capital.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.692
Five zero-- $50 million.

00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:06.900
And a lot of it is done
through that project adoption

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.609
model, where people
will say, well

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:12.420
gosh, we had a family
in Aspen, Colorado

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.250
whose daughter was
getting married.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.630
And as a wedding gift, they
funded a new school literacy

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.540
program in Cambodia, and
then sent their daughter

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.760
Lauren and her husband
Matt on a surprise trip

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.310
to go actually see it and
be there for the unveiling.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.634
And so while we do
raise a lot of money,

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.300
I think the important
thing to recognize

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.380
is a lot of it is
very bottoms up.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.350
So even things like
Giving Week at Google--

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.540
people have been super
supportive of us.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.060
And as big as we get, we try
to always remind ourselves

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.059
that even one person
can make a difference.

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.350
And that's why I think the
girl's education program has

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.720
grown as much as it has,
because a lot of that money

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.595
is coming from people
who literally just say,

00:17:47.595 --> 00:17:49.660
well, I don't have
a huge amount.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.050
But if I give $900 US, three
girls go to school for a year.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.240
But we're happy
with where we are,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.610
but I keep stressing
the fact that we're

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.430
competing against
forces out there

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.510
that are fairly nefarious.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.120
I mean, everything from
poverty, to apathy, to misogyny,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.650
to bigger things like
ISIS and al-Qaeda,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.080
who want to reach kids with
negativity in their lives.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.230
And I believe that education
is the ultimate positive thing,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.612
so it's what drives
us and drives

00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:20.070
our entire board
and our leadership

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.280
team and our front line staff
to keep working hard to say,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.625
don't ever get complacent.

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.250
We got to reach every
kid who needs us.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.919
And until we've done
that, there's no resting.

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:30.210
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Fascinating.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.230
When I did the research, I
looked a bit on your website,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.210
and you have, I think, a
2020 plan, 25 year plan.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.650
So you really run this
like a business like Google

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.999
or a startup that is
ambitious and spells out

00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:43.290
the vision in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.290
It's really fascinating.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:44.980
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.600
And part of that is also
admitting where you're weak.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.430
Because it's one thing
to be transparent

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.805
when you're talking about all
the wonderful things you're

00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:54.546
doing and all the
successes you've had.

00:18:54.546 --> 00:18:56.670
But we also have to really,
I think, analyze and go

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.544
collect data to say,
where can we get better?

00:18:58.544 --> 00:19:01.189
And so we learned in 2004--

00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:03.480
you and I were talking earlier
about our local language

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.890
publishing initiative.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.814
In 2004, we did a
study of students

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.480
who are using our
libraries to ask them,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.852
what would cause you to
use libraries more often?

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:13.560
And we give them
multiple choice options.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.720
They could check as many boxes
they want-- open at nights,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.354
open on weekends,
whatever it would be.

00:19:17.354 --> 00:19:19.020
But the number one
answer kids gave us--

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.720
54% wanted more books
in their mother tongue--

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.599
in this case, Nepalese
and Vietnamese.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:25.140
Which sounds obvious--
of course kids

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.120
want books in their
mother tongue.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.719
But the issue is that
the for-profit publishers

00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:32.010
don't publish books in
languages spoken by poor people.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.130
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Because it's
not an interesting business.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.690
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.689
There's no margin there.

00:19:35.689 --> 00:19:38.607
When I was at Microsoft, we
would localize all the software

00:19:38.607 --> 00:19:40.690
first in the French,
German-- the languages spoken

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.560
by wealthy people.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.580
And then you might eventually
get to Lao or Uzbek Setswana,

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.194
or you may never get there.

00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:49.360
Kids' books is even worse,
because kids' books don't

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.060
have the same scale economy
of what software has-- how

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.800
quickly software can spread.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.140
So the problem that we face
is that there's really not

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.100
like a Dr. Seuss or a Tintin
in these poor countries,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.470
so we decided to
basically start training

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.270
local authors and
local artists to be

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.750
the first in their generation to
publish children's literature.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.720
And what we did starting
in 2004 in Nepal

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.630
is we found local authors
and local artists.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.980
We asked them to
create original content

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.960
so kids would see books
that were relevant to them.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.729
So the kids in Cambodia
would see houses on stilts,

00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:25.270
and the kids in Nepal would see
yaks and mountains and things

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.236
like that.

00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:27.110
And we started small.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.647
We started with 10
titles in Nepal in 2004.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.230
But I'm proud to say
we've now created

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.470
over 1,300 original titles.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.410
99% of them are local
authors and local artists

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.610
and local editors.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.324
We print locally to try to help
create employment and create

00:20:43.324 --> 00:20:45.490
economic opportunities for
those authors and artists

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.030
to keep having income
from publishing.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.540
And we were given the UNESCO
Confucius Prize for Literacy

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.030
recognizing that we
weren't just taking

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.487
books like "Pippi
Longstocking" or "Heidi"

00:20:57.487 --> 00:21:00.070
and translating them into Khmer,
and then the kids in Cambodia

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.130
are confused--

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.630
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Create
something locally, right?

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.088
JOHN WOOD: Create
something locally

00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:04.090
that kids can relate to.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.416
And if people go
to roomtoread.org,

00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:08.040
one of the fun things
about our website

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.660
is actually going and seeing
the photographs of the books

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.618
that kids are actually
reading in our libraries

00:21:12.618 --> 00:21:13.380
in our schools.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.963
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
And you even said--

00:21:14.963 --> 00:21:17.260
I think I read somewhere
you are the biggest book

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.950
publisher in the world.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.240
Is this true, or
one of the biggest?

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.990
JOHN WOOD: Well,
it's a joke I made

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.073
that we're the biggest
children's publisher you've

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:22.990
never heard of.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.510
Like many of my jokes,
it's not that funny.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.760
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: It
was moderately funny

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.500
JOHN WOOD: But we
publish in languages

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.750
that our kids don't
speak in Switzerland

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.280
or in Hong Kong, where I live.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.680
We're publishing in Zulu,
Setswana, Xhosa, Sinholese,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.805
Tamil, Lao.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.530
We've done a couple
of new languages

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.700
in the last couple of years.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.400
We've added in Swahili,
which, as a person who's

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.900
spent a long time in East
Africa, I'm very excited about.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.691
But what I'm most proud
about with that is,

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:54.430
again, it's not
well-meaning foreigners

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.350
coming in with a solution.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.435
In Tanzania, those
books in Swahili

00:21:59.435 --> 00:22:01.810
have Tanzanian authors and
Tanzanian artists behind them.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.430
And I got to tell you,
they're the proudest people

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.000
in the world.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.390
Because when you have a really
motivated 25, 26-year-old

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.980
who realizes that in their
brain and in their talent

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.780
lies a possible solution to
poverty in their country,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.480
they're some of the most
motivated people I've ever met.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.313
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
That's fascinating, yeah.

00:22:17.313 --> 00:22:19.570
That's so inspiring.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.820
So I guess I don't even have
to ask you this question,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.778
but did you ever regret
leaving Microsoft then?

00:22:26.014 --> 00:22:27.430
JOHN WOOD: The
only thing I regret

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.980
is that I used to have this
magic credit card where I never

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.040
saw the bill, and I just
could just spend money and not

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.581
have to care.

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:34.820
It just went to an
accountant somewhere.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.320
But no.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.680
I mean, look, there's
sacrifices involved

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.110
for anybody who does this
social sector for a living.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.010
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Which sacrifices did you

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.676
take personally?

00:22:42.676 --> 00:22:44.320
JOHN WOOD: Well, I
think financially.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.080
I worked for no salary
for three years.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.150
Room to Read issues
stock options

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.610
that will pay off
karmically in the afterlife.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.660
I mean, you give up.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.580
I'm 53 years old, and
I'm still renting.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.840
I don't own a home.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.240
I don't know that I
ever will own a home.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.990
That's a very small
sacrifice to make,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.800
though, compared to
the parents I've met,

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.200
where they literally
will eat one meal a day

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.540
and save that extra money to
be able to buy their child

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.770
clothing or medicine.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.710
So the sacrifices we make
are very, very minor.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.910
Do I regret it?

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.670
Not at all.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.550
Some of the happiest
days of my life

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.261
have been those days when I'm
in villages that Room to Read

00:23:18.261 --> 00:23:18.760
helps.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.930
And not just meeting the
students, which is fun,

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.500
but also meaning
that grandmother who

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.860
says, I can die now that I
know my granddaughter is going

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.880
to get through school,
meeting that farmer in Nepal

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.750
who had brought a hundred
pound bag of grain

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.130
to the community celebration,
because they were doing a grain

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.175
drive where any
farmer could donate

00:23:40.175 --> 00:23:42.550
grain that would be sold off
and that money would be used

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.530
to help improve the school.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.000
The stories I've
gotten to here--

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.319
and if people have not
read my first book,

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.360
there's a lot of stories.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.735
That book was
titled "I'm Leaving

00:23:50.735 --> 00:23:52.900
Microsoft to Change the
World," which is, I know,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.632
a grandiose title.

00:23:54.632 --> 00:23:55.840
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: But it is.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.854
It's true.

00:23:56.854 --> 00:23:57.520
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.894
It just tells the
story, I think,

00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:02.530
about how any of us who are
committed and passionate

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.650
about education can just
make a humongous difference.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.860
And to me, that's the
ultimate question in life--

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.102
what's your legacy going to
be when you're 70 or 75 or 80,

00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:14.560
and you're sitting there in
your rocking chair looking back

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.170
on your life?

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.795
And you're going to
ask, what did I do?

00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:18.970
What did I create?

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.494
I would never judge anybody
by their own legacy.

00:24:21.494 --> 00:24:23.410
But I do look at myself
in the mirror and ask,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.701
what's my legacy, and what's
this organization's legacy

00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:26.650
going to be?

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.750
And I damn well want
that legacy to be

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.344
as huge and as impactful and
as long-lasting as possible.

00:24:32.344 --> 00:24:33.760
And if we don't
do that, I'll just

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.599
consider it to be
completely suboptimal,

00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:38.890
because this is the most
important issue in the world--

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.210
education for the
poorest of the poor.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.660
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Two questions
about this conviction part,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.701
because it's fascinating.

00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:46.930
It really comes through
how much it means to you.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.110
In that moment when you came
back with the books and you

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.810
got that feedback, and then when
you decided to leave Microsoft,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.017
how clear was that
for you to leave?

00:24:57.017 --> 00:24:57.850
did you have doubts?

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.058
I'm sure you had some doubts.

00:24:59.058 --> 00:25:00.670
Was it like 90-10, 80-20?

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.450
Was it 50-50-- first question.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.070
Second question--
throughout the years,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.570
did you ever doubt the decision?

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.320
I'm sure there were
challenges on the way.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.540
So how did you deal with
those doubts if you had any?

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.800
JOHN WOOD: Well, I think
leaving Microsoft-- yes, it

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.070
was very intimidating for me.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.050
I remember going into my
boss's office one day,

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.970
and I had been working up my
courage for a couple of days.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.970
And it was 8:30 in the morning,
and I walked into his office.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.280
And I said, I'm going
to tell you something

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.860
you don't want to hear.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.890
And then I'm going
to leave for the day,

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.030
and then you can
respond tomorrow.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.110
And he looked at me
like I was crazy.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.190
I go, I quit.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.770
This doesn't work
for me anymore.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.670
And he said, but, but,
then I said, no no no.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.940
We're not talking
about this today.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.939
I'm leaving for the day.

00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:43.660
And I literally went
out the building

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.929
and went to a little
tea shop in Beijing

00:25:45.929 --> 00:25:48.220
and pulled out my journal,
and I wrote like, holy crap,

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.910
I did it.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.400
I threw myself out
of the airplane.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.390
Now I got to hope the
parachute deploys.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.140
It was nerve-racking
in a sense, because I

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.450
think in the Western world,
so much of the way people

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.969
perceive us is what
we do for a job.

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:05.135
The first thing someone
asks you at a dinner party--

00:26:05.135 --> 00:26:06.210
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
It's identity, right?

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:06.918
JOHN WOOD: Right.

00:26:06.918 --> 00:26:07.662
What do you do?

00:26:07.662 --> 00:26:10.120
And I was going from saying
Microsoft, greater China, blah,

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.869
blah, blah, to being
like, I deliver books

00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:14.260
on the back of yaks in
rural Himalayan villages.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.990
It was an instant
loss of status.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.020
That was big.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.271
But then the second part of
your question was about--

00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:22.020
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
Through over the years.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.640
Was it like--

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.620
JOHN WOOD: The regret?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.786
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Did you
ever look back-- exactly.

00:26:25.786 --> 00:26:27.820
JOHN WOOD: I think 2000
was a horrible time

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.290
to launch a charity.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.550
The tech bubble burst.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.830
My own savings went way down.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.420
People had reasons not to give.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.680
Then in America, where we
were based, 9/11 hit in 2001,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.610
and America became this very
much more xenophobic place

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.345
then.

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:45.550
And it was rough the
first couple of years.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.740
Our first year, I think
we raised $35,000.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.485
Our second year, we
raised about $165,000.

00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:52.610
And although a little bit
of money goes a long way,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.006
that's way too little.

00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:55.630
So the frustration
was-- and I remember

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.340
being with our founding team,
and I wrote on our whiteboard,

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.250
I wrote TBIT.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.040
And those letters stood
for Too Big To Ignore.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.870
I said, one day,
we just got to keep

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.690
grinding this out school by
school, village by village,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.139
girl scholar by girl scholar.

00:27:09.139 --> 00:27:10.930
And one day, our numbers
will be big enough

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.100
that the world will not
be able to ignore us.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.808
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
And when was that day?

00:27:13.808 --> 00:27:18.290
JOHN WOOD: That was 2001, 2002,
during the very early years.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.160
But we're very fortunate that
not only did Silicon Valley

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.110
and a lot of the tech
community get behind us,

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.974
but also Goldman Sachs
and Credit Suisse

00:27:24.974 --> 00:27:26.390
and a lot of the
banking community

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.420
and a lot of the finance
community got behind us.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.753
Because we went to the finance
community and the banking

00:27:30.753 --> 00:27:32.740
community and said,
here's the ROI.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.220
When you put $300 in and a
girl goes to school for a year,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.660
her eventual wages
will increased

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.080
by 20% per additional
year of schooling.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.220
So give a girl six additional
years of schooling,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.410
her eventual wages
will double or triple.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.350
When a woman makes an extra
dollar in the developing world,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.200
she tends to spend 90%
of it on the family.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.472
Women are more enlightened
than we men are about how

00:27:52.472 --> 00:27:53.680
we spend the marginal dollar.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.686
They spend it on food, shelter,
clothing, education, medicine.

00:27:57.686 --> 00:27:59.560
So the ROI, I think,
was really, really clear

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.697
to say, if you can actually
put, let's say, $1,800 in,

00:28:02.697 --> 00:28:04.780
and a girl goes to school
for six additional years

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.654
and is the first in her
family to ever finish

00:28:06.654 --> 00:28:07.750
secondary school--

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.710
Don Valentine, the founder
of Sequoia Capital,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.350
and I explained it to him--

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.642
he said this is the biggest
no-brainer in philanthropy.

00:28:13.642 --> 00:28:15.433
And his daughter Hillary
had been involved,

00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:17.110
but she said you got
to pitch to my dad.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.490
And if my dad
agrees, then you're

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.560
going to get the family
behind it in a bigger way.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.090
And Don Valentine-- when I
published my second book,

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.280
he put a blurb on it for me.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.030
And here's a guy--

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.220
Sequoia-- they've
invested in everything.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.040
And he wrote, Room to Read is
the best long-term investment

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.300
I have ever made.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.689
And that was very humbling.

00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:37.480
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: So
actually, in a sense,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.910
you had success quite
early on in a sense.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.100
But the validation
and the scaling moment

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.792
came quite early, so congrats.

00:28:43.792 --> 00:28:46.000
JOHN WOOD: It did, but I
think for our founding team,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.666
we looked at it.

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.375
And it was just never
going to be enough,

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:50.874
because you keep thinking about
all the villages you haven't

00:28:50.874 --> 00:28:51.670
reached.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.130
So we did start to reach
some significant scale.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.790
But we opened our
5,000th library in 2007,

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.440
and that was our
first seven years.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.648
And then we got an invitation
from the Clinton Global

00:29:01.648 --> 00:29:03.940
Initiative to come up with
a big, audacious goal.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.110
So basically, Erin,
my co-founder--

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.140
we were like, let's go
from 5,000 to 10,000

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.440
and do that in three years.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.950
And so we did our first capital
campaign, and got to that.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.500
And now we're at 20,000
communities impacted,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.200
but I'm looking forward to
the day I can tell you there's

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.550
100,000 communities.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.810
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Talk
about the future, actually.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.018
Where is this going to be
in five years, in 10 years?

00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:25.870
What are your plans?

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.120
JOHN WOOD: Well, the most
immediate thing for us

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.460
is that we're launching it.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.740
Just right now, I'm
heading off from Zurich.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.520
I'll be going to Amman.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.250
We're launching Room To Read in
Jordan, which we're very, very

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.541
excited about, because Jordan
has been a country that's

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:41.930
been very accepting of
refugees, certainly more

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.799
so than my own homeland.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:45.590
The United States has
not been as welcoming

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.300
to Syrian refugees.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.270
Over two million
refugees in Jordan--

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:54.320
it's put an incredible strain
on the school system there.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.040
So with support from the
Dubai Cares Foundation--

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.800
Dubai Cares has a program
called Reading Nation--

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.260
we're launching our first
Arabic language children's book

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.550
publishing program.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.890
We're doing our first Arabic
language early readers.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.290
These are mostly
Jordanian and some Syrians

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.340
involved with doing this
next generation of books.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.700
We're doing 20 original titles,
30,000 copies of each book.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.010
Every primary school
in the entire country

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.850
at the invitation of
the Jordanian ministry

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.730
will now have these books.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.262
And for us, it's
our 25th language.

00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:27.470
We also are looking potentially
at bringing a program

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:28.190
into Lebanon.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.890
Lebanon has also a huge
number of refugees.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.210
If you look out five
years, 10 years--

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.710
by the end of this
year, we're going

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.070
to have reached about
12.5 million children.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.220
If you look out 10
years-- let's just

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.480
say if we could go from reaching
about 1 million students a year

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.120
today to reaching 2
million students a year,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.416
and then you did
that over a decade,

00:30:52.416 --> 00:30:54.290
you would add 20 million
additional students,

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.240
and you'd be at well
over 30 million.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.710
Could we do that?

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.060
I know our team is good
enough they could do that.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.200
The gating question
becomes the funding.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.820
Can you get enough
funding coming in

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.830
so that those teams
are well resourced?

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.290
Because we do not want to be
in the business of saying no.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.831
If a government says
to us-- and this

00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:13.790
happens in India, where 35% of
the world's illiterate people

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:14.434
live in India.

00:31:14.434 --> 00:31:16.850
And my challenge to the Indian
tech community and business

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.224
community is, you're
doing really, really well,

00:31:19.224 --> 00:31:21.140
but don't forget that
there's tens of millions

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.556
of our little
brothers and sisters

00:31:22.556 --> 00:31:24.620
out there who are
not getting educated.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.990
And I think for us, the path
to scale-- a lot of that

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.460
can pass through India.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.540
If we could just completely
blow out our work in India,

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.950
there's no shortage of kids
whose lives could be changed.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.010
And so I look forward.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.710
I was in India two weeks
ago, and our local team--

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.930
Sourav, our country
director who is amazing,

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.346
told me that we've already
reached over 3 million students

00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:45.080
in India.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.570
But I would love to see the
day where we're at 10 million,

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.430
15 million, 20 million in India.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.550
Because that in and of itself--

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.510
so much of the future
can be changed for India,

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.230
but we've got to
reach those kids who

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.745
otherwise are overlooked.

00:31:58.745 --> 00:32:00.620
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: You
mentioned tech already

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.550
a couple of times--

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.070
investors, the tech community.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.410
What role does tech
actually play in your model

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.536
in the initiative?

00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:10.160
JOHN WOOD: Yeah, I think there's
two ways for a group like Room

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.351
to Read to look at tech.

00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:12.850
Number one is, what
does tech enable

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.407
us to do just in terms of
running efficient operations?

00:32:16.407 --> 00:32:18.740
What does tech allow us to
in keeping a global workforce

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.070
of 1,500 volunteers
across 20 plus countries,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.620
15,000 volunteers--

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.250
how do we stay connected?

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:27.860
And so we have
great partnerships.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.190
Lenovo gives us free ThinkPads
to keep our overhead low.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.900
Salesforce has given
us free storage

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.340
from the very beginning.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.870
Marc Benioff is totally
walking the walk

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.140
when he talks about being
a good corporate citizen.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.300
Then there's how do
you use technology

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.910
in actually deploying
the education programs?

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.180
And we've been a little bit
loath to go too far too fast

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.400
in that direction,
because there's

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.960
an old saying of putting the
cart in front of the horse.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.670
And I think until a child
achieves early grade literacy--

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.620
can read at 40 words
plus per minute,

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.180
can comprehend what
they're reading--

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.971
technology can't do a
lot of good for them.

00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:02.220
Yeah, they can play games.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.670
But if you give an
illiterate child

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.152
a tablet that doesn't have any
local language content on it,

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.860
it's just not going
to do that much good.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.930
What those kids need
more is trained teachers.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.000
They need local language books.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.930
Books can be maligned.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:16.096
I think books are wonderful.

00:33:16.096 --> 00:33:17.810
Books are a
single-purpose device.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.019
There's nothing beeping
at you or tweeting at you

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:22.310
or telling you there's a
Facebook update that so-and-so

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.314
posted their daughter's
prom pictures,

00:33:24.314 --> 00:33:25.730
and it distracts
you from reading.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.660
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: It
goes deeper, longer.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.930
It's a longer commitment.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.860
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.014
You get totally engaged in it.

00:33:31.014 --> 00:33:32.680
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ:
So thank you so much.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.929
We heard a lot of great stuff.

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:36.700
We actually have a
little surprise now.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.160
We have actually a
video of a person

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.380
that went through your program.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.160
And actually, it's a
fascinating human story

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.380
about how much of a difference
you made for that person.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.810
So why don't we quickly
look at a video?

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.307
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:53.307 --> 00:33:54.804
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.752
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:04.752 --> 00:39:05.960
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Wonderful.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.910
And I love the reference
to Google Maps,

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:12.050
because I've worked on
Google Maps for seven years.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.160
So this was a wonderful,
touching story of Saluom

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.750
out of Cambodia,
and a second part

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:23.250
of the surprise-- we actually
have Saluom with us today here.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:27.565
So I would love to welcome
here on stage with us.

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.440
It's just a pleasure.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.230
JOHN WOOD: Hello, Saluom.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.230
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.620
It's wonderful that
you join us here.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.460
Saluom, tell us
a little bit more

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.190
how this initiative Room
to Read impacted your life?

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.990
SALUOM LAK: The
first thing, I would

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:55.920
like to say good afternoon
to everyone in coming here.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.980
If you ask me what is
the influence of Room

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.200
to Read on my life--

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.010
I think that there
are many thing

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.810
that it impacts on my life.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.170
But the first one, I would
like to introduce myself

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.950
to all of you.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.750
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.080
My name is Saluom Lak.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.450
I'm from [INAUDIBLE]
of Cambodia.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.580
I have been graduated
from high school in 2013,

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.690
and I also just graduated
from the Royal University

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:36.090
of Phnom Penh with my
major in sociology.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:42.540
And I'm currently now
a training teacher

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.510
at National Institute
of Education.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.555
It is the best
school in Cambodia.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.140
I also passed an exam to be a
high school teacher that only 3

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.550
of 75 students from
[INAUDIBLE] can pass.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.615
I'm so proud of this result.

00:41:02.615 --> 00:41:03.656
JOHN WOOD: You should be.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.740
SPEAKER 1: My parents very
happy that they could not

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.030
sleep that night when
the result was out.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.570
It's not only because I got
a position as a high school

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:25.160
teacher, but also because I
am the first one in my family

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.180
to study at the University.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.620
And also, I am the
first in my village

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.170
to become a qualified
high school teacher.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.790
I grew up in a family of eight.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:49.280
My parent and our
family has always

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.660
living in the
difficult situation,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.230
but I believe that
I'm be able to provide

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.480
my family with better
living in the future

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.490
through my education.

00:42:03.806 --> 00:42:04.930
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: Perfect.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.710
When have you first
met, both of you?

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.860
JOHN WOOD: Today.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.360
Today.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.314
It's our first time meeting.

00:42:11.314 --> 00:42:12.730
And actually, you
were also saying

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.980
you are the first
person from your village

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.080
to ever travel to Europe.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.410
SALUOM LAK: I'm the first
person that traveling to Europe,

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:25.182
and the first person that
can travel by airplane.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.647
It is many experience for me.

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.980
JOHN WOOD: And it's always
one of the highlights for me.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.230
Because when I
meet our graduates,

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.510
quite often when you see some
of these young women entering

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:42.580
the program in grade 6 or grade
7, they're not very confident.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.362
They're afraid of their future.

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.570
And one of the thing's that's
really critical to Room

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.110
to Read's success of our
girl's education program--

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.730
it's not an academic
scholarship.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.610
Yes, we're doing things like
paying school fees and exam

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.389
fees for those who
can't afford it.

00:42:56.389 --> 00:42:58.180
But the most important
parts of the program

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.190
are really what we
surround the girls

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:02.070
with-- that they have
social mobilizers,

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.540
strong local women who
check in on a regular basis.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.457
We have after school
tutoring available,

00:43:07.457 --> 00:43:09.790
so if they need help on their
math exam or their science

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.034
exam, they have tutoring.

00:43:11.034 --> 00:43:12.700
And then we have the
life skills course,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.010
which I mentioned earlier,
which teaches these young women

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.900
the skills they'll need to
negotiate those key life

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.470
decisions.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.080
And obviously, in
Saluom's case, that even

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.624
involves learning
about Google Maps

00:43:22.624 --> 00:43:24.790
and being able to figure
out how to use Google Maps.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.461
So that's a win-win
for the world.

00:43:26.461 --> 00:43:28.460
RAPHAEL LEITERITZ: It
makes me personally happy.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.670
Thank you so much.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.050
It's wonderful.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.820
Well, thank you so
much both for coming.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.590
Such an inspiring story, Saluom.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.340
Thank you so much.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.840
And really, congrats,
and you can be

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.282
so proud of what you achieved.

00:43:39.282 --> 00:43:40.240
And John, same for you.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.970
You can be incredibly proud
of what you kicked off here

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.590
and what you have done
to improve the world.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.900
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:47.410
Thank you.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.285
JOHN WOOD: Thank you.

00:43:48.285 --> 00:43:50.160
