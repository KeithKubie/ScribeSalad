00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.119
All right, I'm happy to be here today with Ian Buck from NVIDIA. Ian, welcome!

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:07.744
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey John, how are you? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Doing great. Can you tell us what your job is at NVIDIA?

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:11.439
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. I'm the General Manager of Computing Software at NVIDIA.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.251
Basically what that means is I'm in charge of all the things for using GPU's

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.707
that are not really graphics or video related.

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:19.333
Things like simulation and problem solving

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.036
that you don't really do in a game

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:25.668
but recycling those cycles to use them more kind of supercomputing kind of applications.

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:27.911
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you've had a lot to do with the development of CUDA.

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:33.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I started the CUDA team many years ago, going on 6, 7 years now,

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:37.649
finishing my work at Stanford to do it for real at NVIDIA.
