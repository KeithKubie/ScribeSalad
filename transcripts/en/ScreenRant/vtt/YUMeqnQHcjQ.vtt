00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.889
Entertainers spend more time on the road then
they do in their own element.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.209
And sometimes in the quest for comfort, actors
demand some outlandish stuff to make the journey

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.450
feel more homey.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.940
But occasionally, there’s something else
driving the drama.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.160
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Famous Actors
Who Were EXTREMELY High Maintenance On Set.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.620
Tom Cruise
Tom Cruise has headlined some of the most

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.199
successful movies in history.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.050
And while films like Jerry Maguire and A Few
Good Men gave him a chance to flex his acting

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.850
chops, his career choices have mostly revolved
around action.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.440
In fact, he’s one of the only people in
Hollywood who performs the majority of his

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
own stunts.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
How does he do it?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.530
With a thong.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.990
Apparently the actor has been wearing custom
thongs under his wardrobe for years.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.030
And the wardrobe department of every movie
he works on has to have about 50 of the undergarments

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.280
on hand at all times.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.980
Far be it for us to judge anyone's choice
of underpants, and Cruise swears by them.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.820
The actor cites their flexibility and comfort
as reasons for his thong passion, but we know

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.190
he was probably just trying to avoid those
unsightly panty lines.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.699
Lindsay Lohan
Since the age of three, Lindsay Lohan has

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.420
been in and out of the spotlight; modelling,
singing, and acting.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.040
Her big break came after starring in the 1998
remake of The Parent Trap.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
But going from Disney to DUI, Lindsay Lohan
devolved into a punchline rapidly after she

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.880
hit peak fame with 2004’s Mean Girls.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.690
Following a string of public embarrassments,
the actress was hired by director Paul Schrader

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.440
for his 2013 film The Canyons.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.320
Lohan was actually fired from the production
before it even began, but was re-hired thanks

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.890
to a 90-minute drunken tantrum she threw outside
the director’s hotel room door.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.690
Failing to show up for rehearsals, refusing
to change her makeup, and reckless drinking

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.410
jeopardized the entire shoot.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.430
Plus, her $600 sushi lunches put an extra
strain on an already low budget.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.720
George Clooney
When you’re as bankable as George Clooney,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560
there’s not much people wouldn’t do to
make sure you’re happy on set.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.610
The Kentucky native has been in the biz for
over three decades, and has made quite a name

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.610
for himself.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.250
And while he’s generally regarded as a pretty
down to earth guy, he apparently had a few

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.690
grand requests while filming the 2013 smash
Gravity.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.560
It seems the actor wanted to make his trailer
a bit more homey.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.060
And requested a custom beach hut, basketball
court, and hot tub be within close proximity

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
to his quarters.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
A lofty price to pay considering his limited
screen time in the final product.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.260
Marlon Brando
Marlon Brando is one of the greats.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.770
And depending on who you ask, he might me
THE great.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.280
A Hollywood heavy-hitter, The Godfather appeared
in more than 40 movies.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.080
And despite his passing in 2004, remains a
household name to this day.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.620
But nearing the end of his career, the actor
quickly lost passion for the job.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.970
Brando was notoriously difficult to work with
on 1979’s Apocalypse Now, but director John

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.180
Frankenheimer experienced the worst of it
while making The Island of Dr. Moreau.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.250
Brando showed up with an ice bucket on his
head and refused to take it off.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.200
He also insisted that a dwarf appear in every
one of his scenes.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.610
And in a move that would impress any fifth
grader, even had his doctor write a note proclaiming

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.790
that Brando was allergic to Frankenheimer.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.790
Classy.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660
Jennifer Aniston
Filmmaking is a team sport, but Jennifer Aniston

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.560
insists on remaining solo.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560
Stories from previous productions paint the
actress as standoffish.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.980
Saying that when everyone else was eating
lunch together, Aniston took off to her private

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.210
trailer and refused to speak to the crew.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.800
She wouldn’t ride in the production vehicles
either, and required her own personal SUV

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.940
and driver to shuttle her around the set.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.131
Other reports have surfaced claiming that
whenever the actress snaps her fingers, one

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.320
of her underlings will run to ice her forehead
so she doesn’t get too hot.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.590
It’s one person’s job to follow Aniston
with a fan, so wherever she is she’s temperature-controlled.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260
Like a fridge.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.730
Jack Nicholson
Jack Nicholson’s been a cinematic fixture

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.000
since the sixties.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.930
And one of only two actors to be nominated
for an Academy Award every decade since he

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.930
started working.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.810
And those bragging rights mean that the actor
gets away with some questionable behavior.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.250
While working on the Martin Scorsese-directed
The Departed in 2006, he decided to go off

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.250
script.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.459
Since Scorsese has tons of experience working
with moody artistic-types, he’s seen it

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.459
all before.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.670
Nicholson was adamant about including a scene
where his character snorts coke off an actress’

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.670
backside.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.920
And the ideas didn’t stop there.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.110
The actor was apparently passionate about
including a sex toy in the scene for no reason,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.110
other than it amused him.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.090
obviously the director was cool with the suggestions,
as both made it into the final cut of the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.130
film.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.340
Will Smith
Ever since the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air moved

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.440
to Hollywood, he’s been making headlines.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.880
And while some people argue that Will Smith
hasn’t done a good movie since 2006, 2012’s

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.900
Men In Black 3 made a lot of the franchise’s
fans ecstatic.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.250
But during production, some citizens of New
York felt eclipsed by the actor’s presence.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.100
Despite his home being only a few blocks away,
Smith insisted on staying in a double-decker

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100
trailer.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.959
Allegedly, it was so tall that it turned a
normally sunny community into a patch of shade,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.740
and blocked out the sun for the entirety of
filming.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.740
Presumably leaving behind legions of dead
houseplants in his wake.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.410
Jennifer Lopez
Everyone has a favorite color and Jennifer

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.230
Lopez’s is white.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.450
Apparently the dancer-turned-actress-turned-singer-turned-actress
likes everything in her dressing room to be

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.540
pristine white.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.540
Furniture, drapes, candles, you name it: white.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.910
Reports have surfaced that Lopez doesn’t
like eye contact either, and only speaks through

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.910
her entourage.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.080
Jenny from the block doesn’t forget about
her friends, either.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.160
And, in addition to her salary, demands private
planes and rooms for her entire team of handlers.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.430
Apparently the diva attitude isn’t even
new, and stories of her antics go all the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.710
way back to her time as a dancer on In Living
Color.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.500
Wesley Snipes
According to Patton Oswalt, the making of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.250
Blade: Trinity was a gong-show.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.680
And Wesley Snipes was the reason.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.810
The relationship between Snipes and director
David Goyer turned volatile almost instantly,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.800
and the two men came to blows.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.520
After Goyer hired some badass looking dudes
to come to set one day, Snipes holed up in

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520
his trailer.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.780
And would only communicate via post-it notes
that he signed with his character’s name.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.280
Oswalt mentioned how Snipes felt slighted
in the paycheck department, and would smoke

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.570
pot in his trailer all day as retaliation.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.340
Emerging only for closeups, the majority of
the actor’s slack was picked up by his body

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.690
double, and co-star Ryan Reynolds- who apparently
got most of his characters lines thanks to

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.690
Snipes’ bad attitude.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.740
And the final movie might actually be better
for it.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.710
Jared Leto
Jared Leto fancies himself a method actor.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.480
Which is usually all well and good, until
the character he’s tasked to play is a green-haired

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480
violent psychopath.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.760
On the set of the upcoming Suicide Squad,
the actor fully immersed himself in the role.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.840
He’s almost unrecognizable as The Joker,
so much so that his cast mates have admitted

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.199
to being freaked out by his mere presence.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.570
Will Smith has even stated that he’s never
met the Jared Leto underneath the costume,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.570
only The Joker.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.270
His costars were even afraid of him.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.590
Sending gifts of dead animals, used condoms,
and sex toys to his peers didn’t make him

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.590
any friends either.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.650
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.020
Do you know of other actors who were extremely
high maintenance on set?
