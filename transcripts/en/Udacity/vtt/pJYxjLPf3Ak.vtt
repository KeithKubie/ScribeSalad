00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.890
The accumulation of acid. How the height occurs because

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.000
of reduced activity from ALDH2. And if we use

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.380
a drug like disulfiram to inhibit ALDH2 we can

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.985
accomplish these effects artificially. The accumulation of the toxic

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.320
by-product acetaldehyde in the effects of sickness and alcohol

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.130
flush. Now if we were to inhibit the alcohol

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.250
dehydrogenates or the ADH instead, we'd end up with

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.430
more alcohol, and that would lead to increased intoxication.
