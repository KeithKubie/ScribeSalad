00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.202
-Now, Burger King

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:04.071
is making huge cultural strides
in Finland,

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.472
AKA Discount Sweden,

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.107
neither of which is Norway.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.109
-Okay. -But we couldn't
resist this pun.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.512
Reservations
for the spa are currently $285,

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.347
while here in America, people
are getting high cholesterol

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.682
and clogged arteries
for under five bucks.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.384
Diners can have their Whoppers
and fries served to them

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.752
while they relax in the spa,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.320
'cause nothing makes people
hungrier than the thought

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.688
of eating meat in a hot room

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.524
with sweaty seniors
with their balls out.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:27.461
-(laughter and groaning)
-Now, at normal...

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.730
"Those are not tater tots."
Now...

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.532
-(laughter)
"But they're on the ground."

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.534
"I know. I'm old."

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.271
-(applause)
-Now...

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.774
At normal spas, you can get
massages and facial scrubs,

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.376
so, comedians, what are some
services offered

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.178
at this BK Spa?

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.812
Sinbad.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.615
You get a free massage with
that really creepy king dude,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.151
but you get it your way,
and you like it.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.320
-All right. All right.
-(laughter)

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.456
-Points. Points. -Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.859
-Uh-huh.
-Brandon.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.861
Chicken fingers come
two in the barbecue sauce,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.730
-one in the stink.
-All right. Points.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.934
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.069
I...

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.372
I would guess it's excessively
stink after that meal.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.007
-Yeah.
-Uh, Moshe Kasher.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.144
Uh, the Whopper is a 7-foot tall
Viking named Hans.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.413
All right, points.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.381
-Points. Perfect.
-(applause)

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.585
SINBAD: I'm not saying anything,
but he didn't even

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.320
-buzz in.
-(laughter)

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.488
-HARDWICK: Uh...
-I... Listen, I don't... I don't

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.257
-have to buzz in, okay?
-Wait a minute.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.693
I don't even have to buzz in
when I call 911.

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.229
I just say, "Hello. I need
help," and they're there.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.563
-(laughter)
-It's amazing.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.866
(applause)

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.501
JOHNSON:
I still

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.503
don't understand why you
color-coded the stage?

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.004
HARDWICK:
I didn't color-code it.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.472
Oh, it's a gradient.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:49.076
(laughter)

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.615
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.984
It's all right.
It's all right.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.253
It goes from white, darker,
darker, and then Chris.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.154
-Uh-uh, uh-uh. No, I am not...
-(laughter)

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.457
I am not black.
I'm dark white.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.557
(laughter)
