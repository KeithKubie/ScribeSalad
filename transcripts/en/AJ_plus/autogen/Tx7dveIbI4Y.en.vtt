it's very simple technology but very

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290
it's very simple technology but very
 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.230
it's very simple technology but very
laborious and very interesting that it

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240
laborious and very interesting that it
 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.000
laborious and very interesting that it
occurred here in South America and other

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
occurred here in South America and other
 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.170
occurred here in South America and other
parts of the world and they made them

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180
parts of the world and they made them
 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.020
parts of the world and they made them
the same in Mesopotamia Egypt North

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030
the same in Mesopotamia Egypt North
 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.080
the same in Mesopotamia Egypt North
America Mexico all the similar

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
America Mexico all the similar
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.730
America Mexico all the similar
technologies I mean there's various ways

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740
technologies I mean there's various ways
 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.740
technologies I mean there's various ways
to make a reed boat but they pretty much

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750
to make a reed boat but they pretty much
 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:24.070
to make a reed boat but they pretty much
make it the same way it's important

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080
make it the same way it's important
 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.350
make it the same way it's important
historically that we show that these

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360
historically that we show that these
 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.210
historically that we show that these
boats can float more than a couple

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220
boats can float more than a couple
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.890
boats can float more than a couple
months at sea and then show the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
months at sea and then show the
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.270
months at sea and then show the
distances that these boats could have

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280
distances that these boats could have
 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.000
distances that these boats could have
traveled this is more than an adventure

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010
traveled this is more than an adventure
 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.490
traveled this is more than an adventure
this is a scientific experiment

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500
this is a scientific experiment
 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.420
this is a scientific experiment
I love the these adventures and I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
I love the these adventures and I
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.370
I love the these adventures and I
especially like mixing science and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
especially like mixing science and
 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.499
especially like mixing science and
history and other things in an

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509
history and other things in an
 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.990
history and other things in an
expedition so this to me sums up

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000
expedition so this to me sums up
 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.670
expedition so this to me sums up
everything that I like is it's been a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680
everything that I like is it's been a
 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.430
everything that I like is it's been a
burning desire to actually really make a

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440
burning desire to actually really make a
 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.870
burning desire to actually really make a
good attempt across the whole Pacific

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
good attempt across the whole Pacific
 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.640
good attempt across the whole Pacific
because no one is no one has done it in

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650
because no one is no one has done it in
 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.109
because no one is no one has done it in
a reed boat and and this will be the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
a reed boat and and this will be the
 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.860
a reed boat and and this will be the
longest reed boat in history
