00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.420
If you’ve ever wondered why Diet Coke and
Mentos react so strongly to one another, well,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.420
wonder no more.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.430
To start, it should be noted that it’s not
just Diet Coke and Mentos that “react”;

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.539
other carbonated beverages will also readily
respond to the addition of Mentos.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.500
What’s going on here is that Mentos has
thousands of small pores on its surface disrupting

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.660
the polar attractions between the water molecules,
creating thousands of ideal nucleation sites

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.390
for the gas molecules in the drink to congregate.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.400
In non-sciency terms, basically, this porous
surface creates a lot of bubble growth sites,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.710
allowing the carbon dioxide bubbles to rapidly
form on the surface of the Mentos.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.050
If you use a smooth surfaced Mentos, you won’t
get nearly the reaction.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.560
The buoyancy of the bubbles and their growth
in size will quickly cause the bubbles to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.219
leave the nucleation site and rise to the
surface of the soda.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.629
Bubbles will continue to form on the porous
surface and the process will repeat, creating

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.629
a nice foamy result.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.039
In addition to that, the gum arabic / gelatin
ingredients of the Mentos, combined with the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.930
potassium benzoate, sugar or (potentially)
aspartame, in Diet sodas, also help in this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.930
process.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.690
In these cases, the ingredients end up lowering
the surface tension of the liquid, allowing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.640
for even more rapid bubble growth on the porous
surface of the Mentos: higher surface tension

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.450
= more difficult environment for bubbles to
form.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.210
(For your reference, compounds like gum arabic
that lower surface tension are called “surfactants”).

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.420
As to why diet sodas like Diet Coke produce
such a bigger reaction, it’s because aspartame

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.310
lowers the surface tension of the liquid much
more than sugar or corn syrup will.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.170
You can also increase the effect by adding
more surfactants to the soda before you add

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.230
the Mentos, like adding a mixture of dishwasher
soap and water.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.500
Another factor contributing to the size of
the geyser is how rapidly the object causing

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.390
the foaming sinks in the soda.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.080
The faster it sinks, the faster the reaction
can happen, and faster reaction = bigger geyser;

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.470
slower reaction may release the same amount
of foam overall, but also a much smaller geyser.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.070
This is another reason Mentos works so much
better than other similar confectioneries.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.340
Mentos are fairly dense objects and so tend
to sink rapidly in the liquid.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.590
If you crush the Mentos, so it doesn’t sink
much at all, you won’t get nearly the dramatic

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.590
reaction.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.760
Yet another factor that can affect the size
of the Mentos / Coke geyser is the temperature

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.170
of the soda itself.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.830
The higher the temperature, the bigger the
geyser due to gases being less soluble in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.480
liquids with a higher temperature.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.340
So, basically, they are more “ready” to
escape the liquid, resulting in a faster reaction.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.530
Note that while caffeine is often cited as
something that will increase the explosive

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.470
reaction with the soda, this is not actually
the case, at least not given the relatively

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.950
small amount of caffeine found in a typical
2-liter bottle of soda generally used for

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.790
these sorts of Diet Coke and Mentos reactions.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.250
If you add enough caffeine, you will see a
difference, but the levels required here to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.280
see a significant difference are on the order
of the amount that would kill you if you actually

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.499
consumed the beverage.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:01.370
You’ll also sometimes read that the acidity
of the soda is a major factor in the resulting

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.370
geyser.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.579
This is not the case either.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.950
In fact, the level of acidity in the Coke
before and after the Mentos geyser does not

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.849
change, negating the possibility of an acid-based
reaction (though you can make such an acid

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.400
based reaction using baking soda).

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.459
Bonus Fact:
While you’ll sometimes hear an urban legend

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.629
that people have died from drinking Diet Coke
and eating Mentos, to date there has not been

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.129
a single documented instance of this ever
happening.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.760
This is likely for two reasons.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.079
First, the act of drinking soda releases quite
a bit of the carbonation in it, limiting the

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.189
possible effect.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.760
Second, even if one did get a strong reaction
to eating and drinking Mentos and Diet Coke

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.489
at the same time, you’d likely just quickly
vomit up the foam, which there have been numerous

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.829
recorded instances of.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.879
On a similar note, birds will not have their
stomachs blow up if you feed them dried rice

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.109
or Alka-Seltzer.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.029
The former of these two myths largely stems
from church caretakers not wanting to have

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:57.260
to try to clean up dried rice after weddings
(a particularly lamentable task if it’s

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.360
raining), ultimately giving rise to a myth
to explain why dried rice became banned, and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.549
the latter being spread about partially thanks
to certain viral YouTube videos purporting

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.909
to show birds blowing up after eating Alka-Seltzer.

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:25.400
The videos, of course, were heavily doctored.
