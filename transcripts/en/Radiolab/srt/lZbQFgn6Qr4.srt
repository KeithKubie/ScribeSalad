1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,340
Are you ready? Yes. Feeling, feeling.
I'm fully, I'm feeling full of value.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,490
Well, in that spirit I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,420
This is Radiolab and today three very
different stories that try to put a dollar

4
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,770
value move you in. It's okay. One
minute. [inaudible] $7 10 test downs,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,500
one things that seem priceless. Priceless.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,363
Really.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,220
Okay, so start at the top.
So for sound, the pressure,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,120
so to to to tell her we're going to
start the show with a story from our

9
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,600
producer Molly Webster. I
don't remember any of it. Cool.

10
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:39,600
We might actually want to rename Molly
Wong stir because she recently got

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,180
herself some to some serious numericizing.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,400
Actually it didn't start as a wonky thing.

13
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,580
It started actually with some
medical journals. So that was,

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,700
that was interesting because it was some
of the most poetic writing I've seen

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,800
out of doctors ever.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,460
One Journal article said like what would
one more month mean to a 37 year old

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,510
mother who has four children?

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,160
Or what would one more month mean if
you are a 67 year old who's about to go

19
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,570
traveling around the world.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
People were just kind of like drifting
these questions out there where they

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,340
were.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,340
All these questions seem to circle
around the seemingly simple story of the

23
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,800
pricing of a drug, a cancer
drug, and this story,

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,630
if you really want to tell
it from the beginning,

25
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,690
it begins with this guy
named Leonard Leonard Salts.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm a medical oncologist at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,670
which is here in New York,

28
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:35,550
and it's one of the largest
cancer centers in the country.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,890
We have 17 doctors here who treat
colon cancer just for colon cancer.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,690
Treat a very large number of
patients. It's a huge hospital.

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,100
And one of the things Leonard's been
noticing in the last, I dunno, decade,

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,730
is cancer drug prices have just
gone through the roof. I mean,

33
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:54,420
we have drugs out there that are many
hundreds of dollars per pill. Really?

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,990
Yeah. Oh, just wait. Let's see.
Where does this start? It starts,

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,570
it's June in 2012 Leonard Salts is at a
conference and at this conference is a

36
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,410
pharmaceutical company called Santa Fe.

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,260
And they give a presentation about a
new drug that they have a drug called

38
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:10,980
Zaltrap.

39
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,980
And Zaltrap is a drug that
without getting into the science,

40
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,620
too much targets the
blood supply to the tumor.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,010
It cuts off the blood supply, which
means the tumor can't grow that.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,230
That's the scientific hypothesis.

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,040
So this new drug has presented and they
like present the data and they showed

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,990
that the survival difference between the
people who god Zaltrap and the people

45
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,820
who didn't was 1.4 months or 42 days.
In other words, if you take this drug,

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,730
you could get 42 more
days of life on average,

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,880
which means you could get three
more days, you could get no days,

48
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:49,881
you could get 42 or you could live
another three years to 42 days down to the

49
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,320
fine grain. Oh, please. Uh,

50
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,300
I could show you some graphs that have
been put up at meetings that show, uh,

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,340
survival curves calculated out to two
decimal places in terms of months.

52
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,170
So I'm looking at this, it not a
10th of a hundredth of a month,

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,520
a hundred of a month. That's a little
over seven hours. Pretty amusing.

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,720
Accurate. Why would you, why would you,
it's pseudo precision. Pseudo precision.

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,940
At any rate. Anyways,
after the conference,

56
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,470
the FDA approved the drug and basically
once the FDA approves the drug,

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,780
public insurance has to take it.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,630
And then the private insurance
companies just follow suit,

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,630
which means you get prescribed
the drug and people pay for it.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,420
And what is the drug cost?
That's the thing. It costs, uh,

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,980
roughly 30,000 for three
months. Course. Wow.

62
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:36,910
Whoa.

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,180
So, so Leonard's like,
wow, that is expensive.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
And there was already
another drug on the market,

65
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,350
did the same thing and it costs half
as much. To put that in context,

66
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,380
this is just one drug
that's $11,000 a month.

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,210
A normal cancer patient might take
dozens of drugs. There are anti, yeah.

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,690
Nausea medicines that are
sometimes used that are, uh,

69
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,570
in the range of 90 to $100 or a tablet.

70
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:02,490
And you take a tablet
once a day for three days.

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,360
One needs growth factors to help
support the white blood cell count,

72
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,010
which you sometimes need. And Chemo.

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,680
Those can be $5,000
every two to three weeks.

74
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,740
If you need antibiotics to treat
infections, those aren't cheap.

75
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,960
And then you need a pharmacist
to prepare it there.

76
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:19,350
Labor intensive need tubing and
equipment and needles to give it,

77
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,150
you need trained nurses to administer it.

78
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,950
You need doctors to take
care of the patients.

79
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,580
And don't forget there's a cost
for a cat scan or MRI. And,

80
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,350
and then of course someone's
got to pay for the real estate,

81
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,090
the heat and the lights. None of
those prices are figured into it.

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,930
Oh, okay. I'm just giving
you the cost of the drug.

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,870
So Leonard calls up one of his colleagues.

84
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,670
Uh, my name is Peter Bock. I am a
physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,960
Peter is the number cruncher of the group.
He does the statistical analysis of,

86
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,310
I don't know, the cost of care,

87
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,040
and Len grabbed him and ran
him through all the data

88
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,150
and we walked through the out of pocket
expenses for Medicare beneficiaries,

89
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,600
medicare beneficiaries. If they
don't have additional insurance,

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,420
20 cents of every dollar
they pay out of pocket,

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,320
and that number is sort of hit him
because he realized for Medicare patients,

92
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,360
they'd be paying something like $2,000
out of pocket every month for just this

93
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,800
drug, 2100 if I remember the number
correctly. For a lot of Medicare patients,

94
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,220
that's all of their money,
nevermind other drugs.

95
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,960
That's when I thought we should go
public with it. Memorial Sloan Kettering,

96
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,330
they decide to boycott this drug.

97
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,860
[inaudible]

98
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,330
now that is that.

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,340
I mean I'm just stopping you because when
you guys made that decision was that,

100
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,660
that feels like a big deal.

101
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,080
It did feel like a big deal and it felt
like a big enough deal that we decided

102
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,470
to write the op Ed piece
in the New York Times.

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,110
They write an op Ed in the Times that
basically says, look, this is crazy.

104
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:51,730
$11,000 a month for a drug that
maybe gives you 42 more days of life.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,410
Is that worth it? And little less than
a month after the op Ed piece came out,

106
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,070
the company makes sal trap.

107
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,300
They went to individual doctor's offices
and sent representatives and said,

108
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,640
we are offering a 50% discount. They
cut the price in half just like that.

109
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,840
Yup. Nationwide or like just
in this area nationwide.

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,250
It was sort of incredible

111
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,090
[inaudible].

112
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,510
We reached out to Santa Fe to talk about
the price of Zaltrap and they declined

113
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,200
to comment,

114
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,350
but in a statement that they released
when this whole Zaltrap thing happened,

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,680
they said that they incur so many costs
for researching and developing and

116
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,890
bringing a drug to market that that
is what their pricing is based on.

117
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,500
Leonard doesn't disagree.
We need these companies.

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,430
They're the ones developing the drugs
which aren't easy to develop. I mean,

119
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,120
Leonard gave us just one example.
If we talk about colon cancer,

120
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,120
he says for years there was only one drug
on the market called five F-you five a

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,280
few was patented in August of 1957 it
was from 1957 until 1996 that a second

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,890
drug came along.

123
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,850
That's how long it takes to develop
a good drug or that interim.

124
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,340
There were over 70 drugs
that were tried and failed.

125
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,330
Like I don't give it enough credit
because that just astounded me. It's very,

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,360
very hard and that according to Leonard
is one of the reasons why prices are

127
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,840
just going to keep going up,

128
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,310
but sooner or later this
system is going to fall apart.

129
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,520
And at what point does society say there
isn't an infinite number of dollars

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,530
that we can commit to
our healthcare system?

131
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,650
It's funny because I had this interesting
reaction to the word society because

132
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:37,420
all of a sudden I thought like
why is not not like a, you know,

133
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,040
crazy death panel way. But I thought why?

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Why is society involved in my conversation
with my doctor about if I want to

135
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:50,330
take this drug that may give me
another month and a half of life?

136
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,620
Why is society involved?
Because you're not paying unless

137
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,710
you have hidden resources.

138
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:01,711
I'm aware of probably couldn't afford
10 to $15,000 a month in drug bills.

139
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,450
Someone else has to pay that.

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,620
Obviously. He says it's
your insurance. I mean,

141
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:11,010
say you're part of a policy
that has 1000 members.

142
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,230
Let's say that the
premium for that is $100.

143
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,910
So we had a hundred dollars thousand
people. We got ourselves $100,000. Okay?

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
So when we now have $100,000 to take
care of that thousand people for that

145
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,930
month, whatever amount of time,

146
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,830
if nail one person comes up
with a health care costs,

147
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,150
let's say it's for a month,

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,320
that is $100,000 in that month,

149
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,440
everybody else's in trouble,
there's no money left.

150
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,930
So they write this op ed saying like,

151
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,210
prices are too high and the
drugs are not that great.

152
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:53,470
And sort of the next like notable
wave is, um, there was this,

153
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,060
there's this journal called blood,

154
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,770
which is really big to anybody that
works in a community that has like called

155
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,310
blood. Yeah. How did we not know about
this and we made the blood show, oh,

156
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:06,500
I knew. Just kept it in
here. Anyhow. Um, so yeah,

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,540
so there's the journal called
blood, which is basically like the,

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,170
the journal for anybody that works
in a field that has to do with blood.

159
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,590
And what happens is like a hundred doctors
get together and they coast sign in

160
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,130
editorial,

161
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,700
which basically says we totally agree
with everything you guys are saying,

162
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,620
but we have an even bigger issue.

163
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,760
You know with Zaltrap you're talking
about an expensive drug that maybe doesn't

164
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:30,594
really do that much.

165
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,260
It's kind of easy even though it had
never been done before to say we're not

166
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,250
going to use this. What all these doctors
in the blood editorial are saying,

167
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,420
what do you do when you have a really
expensive drug? But it's really,

168
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,720
really good. It's like a drug
you actually want to take.

169
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,760
Is that like a like a one day in the
future we will face this kind of question.

170
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,350
No, that is like a now today question.

171
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,210
The most important new
medicine approved this year.

172
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,570
Everyone I talked to pointed me
to this new drug called Sovaldi.

173
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,720
It's known as Savaldi civilizing.

174
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,840
Many in the medical community are
calling the new medication. Blockbuster.

175
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,640
Sovaldi came on the market last
December, so that's December,

176
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,490
2013 that's correct. This
is Bruce Bruce Moore.

177
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,470
I'm the Editor of Commonwealth magazine.

178
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,080
He's written about Sovaldi and
here's the basic story, right?

179
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,710
Okay.

180
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,650
It is a drug that treats hepatitis C,

181
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,570
which is caused by a virus and the
disease itself goes to work on your liver.

182
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,700
It inflames it. It scars, it can
cause liver cancer, cirrhosis.

183
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,990
It can be fatal and for the longest
time the treatments that they had just

184
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,890
really weren't that great or they
just had wretched side effects.

185
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,270
But along comes Savaldi
and it's one pill 12 weeks.

186
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,070
You take it with some
other antiviral meds.

187
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,020
It is a super simple treatment option and
the side effects are very minimal like

188
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:57,730
this. It was like kind of like the savior
drug and so a lot of doctors start to

189
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:58,420
prescribe it.

190
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,420
In the first half of 2014 70,000 people
in the country in the United States were

191
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:10,021
treated and it had a 95% rate of cure.

192
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,500
In other words, the cow virus
was eradicated. That's very big.

193
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,020
But in fitting with our story,

194
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,250
this truck costs $1,000 a pill. Whoa.

195
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,130
For like one, one pill
that I take one a day.

196
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,630
[inaudible]

197
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,070
which as you can imagine,

198
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,790
angered on a lot of people with Hep C in
total it costs $84,000 and if you think

199
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:43,941
about the fact that in 2014 we know at
least 70,000 people got this drug and

200
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,920
you're starting to talk about
serious money. Wait, I wanna I,

201
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,230
I just want to say that I, I,

202
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,750
I just timed out 70,000 times 84,000 and
I got something with seven Zeros in it.

203
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,400
It's five, eight, eight and
then there's seven Zeros,

204
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:04,690
which is like a bit $5 billion. Yes. Yeah.

205
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,180
[inaudible]

206
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,080
the big question is how stage will
pay for what could be upwards of,

207
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,340
and so we have a situation where states
are basically having to ration, yeah.

208
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,570
Say in Massachusetts,

209
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,630
most of the insurers currently are
requiring some liver damage before you can

210
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:21,984
take the drug.

211
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,280
Similar restrictions are happening
in other states, Florida.

212
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,470
It's happening in Oregon, Illinois.

213
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,650
The doctor says the only option may
be to wait until you're even sicker,

214
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,160
and then there's Arizona
out of the [inaudible]

215
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,360
entire state.

216
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Public Insurance only approves 180 people
for treatment or it's just 180 just

217
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:45,040
180 now when I talk to a representative
of the company that makes a truck,

218
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:45,870
Greg Altan,

219
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,050
executive vice president for corporate
and medical affairs for Giliad Sciences,

220
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,600
he says, you got to keep in mind this is
not a chronic care situation. This is a

221
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,360
sure here you're actually
curing a person of a disease.

222
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,290
We're talking about 12 weeks
of therapy period. That's it.

223
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,460
And you're done and
you've cured some. Yeah,

224
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,160
so he says, this is a onetime
deal. This is like one time,

225
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,440
$84,000 and then you're done.

226
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:11,490
Think about all the years you'll live
without having an illness. Then you'll see

227
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,800
over a 20 year period the savings that
will accrue to the system by having a

228
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:17,360
patient cured of Hepatitis C.

229
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,230
He also said it's important to understand
that every hepatitis C suffer is not

230
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,690
going to hit the system at the same time.

231
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:28,440
So all of the cost is spread out. Right,

232
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,090
which is totally true,

233
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,930
but I think there's like this bigger
picture here and Bruce points it out to,

234
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,990
it's sort of like a precursor of what
could come because these companies are

235
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,870
developing drugs all the time. What if,

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
if you could get a drug but it was very
expensive to treat diabetes and then

237
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,000
you're talking tens of millions of people,

238
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,250
an enormous segment of the population,

239
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,150
even if just a fraction of them
want a drug that's $1,000 per day,

240
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,940
that's practically our entire US
budget. What do you do in that case?

241
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,690
A drug comes along like that and
throws everything out of whack.

242
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:06,870
[inaudible]

243
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,840
this is the part where I really sort
of got hooked in where it's like,

244
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,380
how do you answer this
question? Is it that, you know,

245
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:18,381
at a certain point you just draw a line
and you say beyond this point we're not

246
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:23,010
paying. But beyond what point
exactly. I mean that's the hard part.

247
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Like how good does it treatment have
to be for you to say this is worth the

248
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,160
price that it's been set at? I don't
think we have rejected out of hand,

249
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,840
but I don't think I got into
this a bit with Leonard.

250
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,650
In the case of Zaltrap they said,
all right, 42 days, that much money,

251
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:38,484
we're not going to do it.

252
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,390
But would it have been different
if it was 50 days or a hundred? Uh,

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,780
is that enough? I'm sure you
want to be talking in years,

254
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:48,680
but I guess the question is like what
would be, is there a magic line line

255
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,250
for you? Um, um,

256
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,100
if I, this is a, I can't personally
determine it for everybody.

257
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,080
I wouldn't presume to try,

258
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,320
but ultimately as a society we're going
to have to reach an understanding of

259
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,860
what that cut point is because
we can't afford not to.

260
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,490
And the question that sort of
bubbles out of this conversation is,

261
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:18,491
what is one more year or one more month
or one more day of life worth to us?

262
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,680
Are we willing to pay $1,000
for an extra day of life? Well,

263
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,170
what about a hundred thousand dollars
for an extra day of life? You know,

264
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,570
people like to say, yeah, so
what's the value of a human life?

265
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,420
And the answer is, boy,
that's a complicated question,

266
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,190
but a really important one because
nobody thinks it's infinite.

267
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,850
He said that and I was like, okay,
it's not zero and it's not infinite.

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,770
Is there an answer like in the middle?

269
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,350
And so I started looking around, I dunno,

270
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,850
I guess I was wondering has anyone
actually thought about this?

271
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:54,510
And so I started looking around and what
I realized was that the World Health

272
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,620
Organization, actually, I'm, I mean
I guess they almost have a number,

273
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,090
but it's a number per country.

274
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,300
They have the recommendation
that that countries spend,

275
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,520
it's going to get gobbly
gooky but just bear with me.

276
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,750
The country spend one to three
times the GDP per capita,

277
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,480
which is like the gross
domestic product per individual.

278
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,400
So take the entire fat ball of money
that is in a country and divide it per

279
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,230
individual divided by the individuals.

280
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,400
And then you spend one to three times
that on one more good year of life.

281
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,160
And what would that be
for us? So for the u s um,

282
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,620
if that's about 50 to 150,000.
Interesting. And is that,

283
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,190
does that have any, any
teeth that recommendation?

284
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,280
It legally doesn't have any teeth,
but it has teeth in the sense that um,

285
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,270
doctors in the u s are actually going
to start using this. Who number two,

286
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:46,450
evaluate medical
treatments for cardiology.

287
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,020
They said they were going to do this in
a paper and it was kind of very quiet,

288
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:54,280
very subtle. But in other
countries, this conversation,

289
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,700
it's very loud actually. It
happens at the government level.

290
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,450
They're also passing out surveys
where they're asking citizens,

291
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:06,451
what is your limit on how much you want
to spend on one more good year of life.

292
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,800
Have they done that here? As far
as I know, no. Why not? Because?

293
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Because the last time we tried
to talk about cost in medicine,

294
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,330
it ended up in the hole
death panel, death panels,

295
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,050
panels or so called death panels thing and

296
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,250
I dunno, I just wondered into the
mess of it. Hey, times square.

297
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,300
If I actually tried to go out and ask
this question in a very basic way,

298
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,890
how would people respond? Excuse
me? Can I ask you a question?

299
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,320
What is a year of life
worth? Wow, what a question.

300
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey dusty, can I think about,
and that's a tough one,

301
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,630
but I was really surprised how
seriously people took the question, man,

302
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,770
what is a year of life worth? That
was the first thing I noticed.

303
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,090
Then the next thing was no one could
answer the question until I had answered

304
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,930
like a million questions of theirs.
Am I going to die tomorrow? Yes.

305
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,780
Where do I get that year? Do I get it at
the beginning of the middle or the end?

306
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,900
How would I spend that year of life?
Good. It would be a good year of life.

307
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,050
A good year of life. Depends. It's
like a pie in the sky kind of answer.

308
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,000
They wanted to know would
they be emotionally half
alone with friends or family?

309
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,010
Where did they get the
money? They borrow the money.

310
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,640
They have to pay the money back where
they dying. Was it an emergency?

311
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:27,570
Other people also trying to get money
at the same time because then there'd be

312
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,060
like a rush on the money in
America. Oh, interesting.

313
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,840
Did you actually ever end up
getting numbers? I did get numbers,

314
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,950
but they were at least $10,000 $15,000
$13,000,007 all over the place.

315
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,300
Yeah, I would say five
bucks. Head million dollars.

316
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,070
$44,000 you're saying one
woman said 10 million,

317
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,730
$10 million for a year.
It's irresponsible. Well,

318
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,300
you asking me about my
personal choice? $10 million.

319
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,020
Not about a public policy question. What?

320
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:04,140
Do you have any way of parsing
all this? No, I really,

321
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,050
I honestly don't like,

322
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,800
I think my biggest takeaway was
like no one punched me, which,

323
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,550
which makes me feel as
if people are ready,

324
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
not ready but willing to
engage in this conversation.

325
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,010
But I also realized I kept talking about
things and I just wanted to be in the

326
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:21,850
room with patients.

327
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:24,520
Like I just want to patients in the room
with me because it was like we were all

328
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:28,180
having this conversation that eventually
we'll all be patients I guess.

329
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:33,181
But we were also having this conversation
around like a group of people that

330
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:35,680
weren't ever present.

331
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:39,130
Like they're not at conferences
or not in research articles.

332
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,130
And so that was when I
started talking to patients.

333
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,740
Ah, well I guess what is 42 days?

334
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,450
What does 42 days mean in the sense of
is that something that you'd pay $50,000

335
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:59,450
for if you were, I mean, of course
you would that it's like, no,

336
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,630
I almost can't even ask the
question, but I don't know. I know,

337
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:03,860
I think it's a good question.

338
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:08,861
I think ethically it would be to the
good of patients and doctors to have this

339
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,310
conversation. This is Susan Susan Gould,

340
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,740
bar rider of the living with cancer blog
for the New York Times back in 2008.

341
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,650
Susan went to the doctor. She hadn't
been feeling well for a while.

342
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,420
They thought it was some
sort of bowel issue,

343
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:27,140
but then the doctor walked into the
room and said she had advanced stage of

344
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:28,100
Varian cancer.

345
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,810
Most ovarian cancers are
diagnosed at a late stage and um,

346
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,300
it's, it's basically
incurable. It can be handled.

347
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:43,301
It can be managed that it can be kept
at bay and for longer periods of time.

348
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:48,700
Now we hope, but you're given a
diagnosis of three, five years. Wow.

349
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,534
That is,

350
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,660
you go from having unlimited time in your
mind to three to five years in like a

351
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,810
doctor's visit. Yeah, it's,
it's, it's a big shock.

352
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,420
You sort of enter the zone. Well,

353
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:08,380
you're not quite aware of
what you're doing that day.

354
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,110
The day she was diagnosed,
she was told, pack a bag,

355
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,680
get in a car and drive to
Indianapolis. You need surgery now.

356
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,000
So I went the next day to Indianapolis
and the day after that I had the

357
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,290
debulking surgery,

358
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,180
which takes out the ovaries and the
uterus and the Fallopian tubes and the

359
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:29,500
spleen and sometimes the cervix and
sometimes the appendix and Holy Shit,

360
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,570
the bowel. And Are you serious? Yeah,
it's called the mother of all surgeries.

361
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,940
And then just like that, she was doing
multiple rounds of chemo chemicals

362
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,850
that are used. Uh, they destroy
all quick growing cells.

363
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,070
So for example, you have no hair, no
eyebrows, no eyelashes, that you know,

364
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,320
uh, you, you also can, I got terrible
sores in my mouth. I have no idea why,

365
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:55,750
but I know this happens
to other people. But yeah.

366
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,090
The other thing is this extreme fatigue

367
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,700
and Susan who writes for a
living couldn't even read.

368
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,180
I would look at the page and
think, had I turned the page

369
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,860
[inaudible]

370
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,060
chemotherapy. It really
is toxic to the spirit,

371
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,370
to the heart, to the mind.

372
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,970
Just the normal aspects
of life feel polluted.

373
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,630
Have you ever had to think about cost?

374
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,140
I was never informed of the cost of
any drug or any procedure I was given,

375
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,310
which really makes me think
about how masked these costs are.

376
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,600
Would you want to be thinking about cost
while you're going through it or is it

377
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:44,600
better to just say, here
are your treatment options,

378
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,580
these are statistical outcomes,

379
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,660
like pick one and then we'll
deal with it on the other side.

380
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,090
I think there's an a kind of unspoken
agreement among everyone that the

381
00:22:56,091 --> 00:23:00,350
insurance company or Medicare is going
to pay. And if it's the government,

382
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:04,940
that means that our grandchildren are
going to end up paying for all of this

383
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,340
money. So yes, I guess
to answer your question,

384
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:10,730
I think it would be healthier to know
what these things cost. On the other hand,

385
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:14,000
I have to say as a patient,
I was so traumatized.

386
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:17,150
I'm not sure I could have
taken that information in. Um,

387
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,320
I was thinking about your what,
what is worth, what's it worth?

388
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,650
A title. And I was thinking that, um,

389
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,350
the American individualistic
optimistic response would be,

390
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:34,910
well, whatever it takes, whatever
it takes, life is worth it.

391
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:35,990
Whatever it takes.

392
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,670
But whatever it takes
will not cure my cancer,

393
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,760
so I think this question changes
when have incurable cancer,

394
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,140
it becomes a different question,
which is when is enough enough?

395
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,430
I remembered she said that when
is enough enough? I was just,

396
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,480
I don't know that we are ready to say
there's one magic line thrown back to this

397
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:06,410
conversation that I had with Leonard
Salts where he was saying that we have to

398
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,080
look at everything in terms of value.

399
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,980
If you need to think deeply about
the kind of life you want to live,

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,840
it's not just about how many days,
it's about what kind of days.

401
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:22,841
So if you told me that there was something
that gave a 72 day survival benefit,

402
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,190
but it makes people feel
nauseous for most of the time,

403
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,580
is that worth it when we're trying to
draw this line as a society before we

404
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:32,230
figure out what we're willing to pay,

405
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:36,550
we have to think about what
we are paying for. Yeah.

406
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:40,270
I don't think we know
what for Susan, you know,

407
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:45,250
six years ago she decided that she was
going to get chemotherapy because in part

408
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:50,110
it would be more time with her daughters.
Yeah. And suddenly it's worth it.

409
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,790
Yeah. But I think what changed
by the treatment to, for now,

410
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:59,791
Susan's cancer is basically
under control because,

411
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,700
uh, she's on this new
drug for two and a half,

412
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,680
two years and now a month.
And I am counting, um,

413
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,740
I've been alive without a recurrence,
without the cancer growing,

414
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,580
by taking these pills every day. Um,

415
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,950
and I take them at home. They're not
infused in the hospital through my veins.

416
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,470
They are just pills and um,

417
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,500
it's made last few
years remarkably normal.

418
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:31,480
Like the new normal. Yeah.

419
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,373
[inaudible]

420
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,500
but when these drugs stop working and
I've been told they will stop working,

421
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,340
um, I'm not sure I would want
to go back to chemotherapy.

422
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,580
[inaudible]

423
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,700
but I, I suspect, I don't
know until I get there.

424
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:06,990
[inaudible], [inaudible]

425
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,470
producer, Molly Webster, and now
for the thank yous for that piece,

426
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,820
we we want to thank Steven Hall and
one I mentioned Susan Goo buyer's book

427
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,610
called memoir of a deep poked woman,

428
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,020
and it takes also to doctor a tool Guan
Day for all his help and his latest

429
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:24,180
book, which is really, I really
thought it was wonderful.

430
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,620
It's called being mortal. Yeah.

431
