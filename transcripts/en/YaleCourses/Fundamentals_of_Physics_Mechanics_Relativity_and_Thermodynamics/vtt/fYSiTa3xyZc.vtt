1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.490
Just the last and final chapter of the subject and I think it's again,

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.250
we're starting,
uh,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.490
by backing off a little bit towards the end of last class.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.050
I think that may be parts of it with you or maybe difficult for you to follow

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.940
there.
Let me remind you what we were trying to do.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920
We had learned that space time,

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.680
it described before coordinates so that if you're following some particular,

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.640
some event,
you label it with four numbers,
CT,

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.200
x,
Y and Z,

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
which I want you to let me come by into the single vector are and they are

11
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:45.120
written as x zero x one x two x three.

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.170
Now I'm on two minds about x two and x three sometimes like carry them around.

13
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.150
Sometimes I don't.
X one is just normal family or x,

14
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.450
y [inaudible] it possible to arrange all the motion to take place in the x

15
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:01.464
direction,

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.550
in which case Y and Z don't change when you go from one frame to the other.

17
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:10.520
So I don't usually bother with that but sometimes I put it back because if you

18
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.310
had only two components x nor the next one you might say,
hey,

19
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.680
the world is two dimensional is I want to keep reminding you.

20
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.810
Now we think of it in terms of four dimensions,

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.700
so at least for that reason sometimes a carry all the three components that

22
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.110
position sometimes only one,

23
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.250
but I'm sure you guys can figure it out from the context which is which.

24
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.260
So going back to the simplest situation of only x and time,

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.070
the point of those coordinators is that if you went to a moving frame x one

26
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:46.341
prime will be x one minus Beta is zero divided by the square root and x zero

27
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.951
prime will be x zero minus Beta times x one divided by the square root where

28
00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:59.610
Beta is to be oversea.

29
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.760
Sometimes it's useful to introduce gamma,

30
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.180
which is one minus a use squared overseas where also to prevent all confusion,

31
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.010
you will be the velocity of your frame relative to mine.

32
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.810
The will stand for the velocity of some particle that we are bought study.

33
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.520
So let's reserve the symbol before motion of actual particles,

34
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.350
which is why we are there.
We are all observers,

35
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.870
but we were observing something that's something has a velocity that I call

36
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.890
[inaudible] and you will call w and u is the speed relative to your frame and my

37
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.330
friend.
All right,

38
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:41.331
so this is the notion of space time because space and time are getting mixed up

39
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.150
when they go to a new frame of reference,
but even in this world,

40
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.690
but nothing is sacred.
The fallen combination is very important,

41
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.120
which we do notice X.
Dot.X is a new dark product.
Now in space time,

42
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.200
the new drug product will be the square of the time,

43
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.510
like part my minus the square of the space,
like part.

44
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.230
If you wanted to bring in all the components of space time,

45
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.990
then you can modify it to x square minus R.
Dot.

46
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.300
R R.
Dot.
R will be x squared.
Plus y squared was the square.

47
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.770
So you can use either than rotation whenever possible.
I just keep to,

48
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.550
but you've got to remember this is why it's a four dimensional dot product and

49
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.300
this is the same for all people so I can calculate it.

50
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:31.230
You can calculate it are Exxon arts and x one will differ,

51
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.750
but it's the property of the learning strand summation that if I squared this

52
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.640
guy and subtract it from the square of this guy on the right hand side,

53
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.040
it's a magical things will happen and I'll get the same combination without the

54
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.874
primes.

55
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.600
That's like the length of the vector and that's called the spacetime interval.

56
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.630
Let's call that a square.
This face time interval,

57
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.810
if it took two events separated in space by Delta x and separated in time by

58
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.644
Delta t,

59
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.570
then we like to use the symbol delta and square for the space that I'm in

60
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:04.404
trouble.

61
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.920
That's the same thing applied to the differences rather than with the coordinate

62
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.990
themselves and this is invariant in gradient descent.

63
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.950
A term mathematicians use for saying same for all people are unaffected by

64
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:23.710
learns transformation.
It's the analog of how far you are from the origin.

65
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.180
In the old days when I took two frames,
one which is the standard x,

66
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.690
y or that is rotated x,
y.
If you go to the rotated frame,

67
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.640
the components x and y change,

68
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.600
but how far you are from the origin or what's the length of the vector is the

69
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:38.590
same for all people.

70
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.130
More generally the dot product of two vectors is in variant on the rotations and

71
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:47.860
this is the new dark product.
We use the symbol dark product,

72
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.550
but I don't draw arrows because if I don't draw any adverse and use capital

73
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.200
letters,
it means it's a four vector.
That's the expectation.

74
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
Then I said,

75
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.760
let's try to reason by analogy and try to invent a momentum vector.

76
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.200
How did we invent the momentum vector?

77
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.860
In the old days we said let the particle move a distance.

78
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.590
Delta are backlit,

79
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.600
Delta are in a time Delta t and a divide by Delta t and take some limit but I

80
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:22.480
know this is a vector because delta art is a difference in two vectors that the

81
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:26.620
particles now and various later difference of two vectors is also a tiny vector

82
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:29.890
going from here to there dividing by a scaler.

83
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.920
By scale I mean something that is not affected by rotations means taking it back

84
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.190
to that and multiplying it by some number.
Therefore there's also backtrack.

85
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.790
So this ratio is also a vector and the limit of this ratio is also a vector.

86
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.410
I'm sorry I forgot the mass here and we call it the moment the matter

87
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.770
so you can manufacture vectors starting with the position vector by taking

88
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:58.771
derivatives with respect to something like that is the same for all observers

89
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.720
were observers.

90
00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:04.850
I meant in the old days people with an ax is rotated any way you like.

91
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.260
I wanted the same thing now in this present problem,

92
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.150
but I would not want to define obviously afford dimensional vector,

93
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.850
so do the four dimensional vector.

94
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.270
My plan is to define something called momentum,

95
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.860
which is now going to be the tank in this fort position divided by something.

96
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.980
Question is what do I divided by?

97
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.970
I cannot divide by Delta.
T in the old days dumped that he was a sacred number.

98
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:35.870
Same for all people.

99
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.160
No Delta t is like Delta x and Delta whites and one of the components and you

100
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:44.030
don't defy divide the change in the vector components by the change in one of

101
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.360
the components to get a velocity.

102
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.430
You gotta divide by something that's going to play the role of time and have the

103
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:54.020
same value for all people.
Well we sort of know what the quantity is.

104
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.060
Obviously if a particular is moving from here to here in space time,

105
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.230
this is x not equal to CT and this is x one.

106
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.550
It moves to distance delta x one in a time built and t

107
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.760
and we know that for this piece of its motion,
the following quantity,

108
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.060
Delta s with the C Delta t squared minus Delta x squared is the same for all

109
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:24.584
people.

110
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.850
<v 0>so I should really be dividing by this.
Let me write it slightly differently.</v>

112
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.420
I see Delta t square root of one minus delta x over Delta,

113
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.440
t square one oversee square.

114
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.400
So we had asked her divide by this crazy thing.

115
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.820
Well let me write this crazy thing a c times something I want to call ditto.

116
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.810
Ditto is the tea time is square root of one minus Delta,

117
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:07.041
x over Delta t squared times one overseas square.

118
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.230
Then I said we can give a meaning to this thing.
In fact,
let's,
let's take,

119
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:16.690
did I ever do with the specter of Tau,

120
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.970
not s they differ only by this factor c which is a constant so it doesn't matter

121
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.410
how has the interest of time and you can ask what does that time stand for?

122
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.940
It's not the time according to me,

123
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.070
but I argue that it's the time according to the potluck.
Why?

124
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.790
Because you can evaluate this quantity in any frame you like.

125
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.770
So go to the frame moving with the Party and moving with the particle and if

126
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.950
you're here now and that later,
later,
the certainly later,

127
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.210
but he had remains here for the party.
It doesn't move in his own frame,

128
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.200
so delta x will vanish.
Therefore,

129
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:57.420
Delta s simply reduces to see that pimy me or according to the party.

130
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.960
So ditto is the time elapsed according to the particular itself.

131
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.533
<v 1>Okay?</v>

132
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.180
<v 0>According to party,
that's what we're going to divide by.</v>

133
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.740
So it's a very clever way to circumvent the question of what's really take the

134
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:20.290
derivative with respect to my time in your time.
All our variable,

135
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.550
we don't agree on it,

136
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.060
but let's ask how much time elapsed according to the one thing we are studying.

137
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.470
Let's divide by that time.

138
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.580
That answered will be the same because you and I may not agree on how long it

139
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:31.930
took to go from here to there,

140
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.620
but we can all ask how long did the particle say took to go from here to there.

141
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.470
We're talking about the same thing and we'll get the same answer.

142
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.330
<v 1>Okay?</v>

143
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.470
<v 0>You'll get the particle time.</v>

144
00:09:41.471 --> 00:09:44.890
You got to take the time according to you and me and multiply by this factor.

145
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.900
This factor,
by the way,
is nothing but the usual time dilatation.

146
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.063
<v 1>Okay?</v>

147
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.180
<v 0>Because of the politics of series,
it took time.</v>

148
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:57.540
Ditto because the clock is slower.
Exactly.
This amount.

149
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.340
I will say it took longer by this summer.

150
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:01.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.410
<v 0>so let's rewrite this in a way that's going to be more than helpful to us.</v>

152
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:11.070
Take the ratio and write DT over detail is one over square root of one minus B

153
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:16.330
squared.
C squared.
I'm going to use that in a minute.

154
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.200
That just says the time according to me and the time according to the particle

155
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.540
are related by the time dilatation factor that's controlled by the velocity of

156
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:28.374
the particle.

157
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.170
Now we had ready to define the forward momentum p four moment than fee is going

158
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:36.480
to be m times DX,

159
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:40.790
not the Tao names.
Em.
Uh,

160
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.910
the x one detail.
I'm not going to bother with the other components.

161
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.140
You can always put them back.

162
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.230
But x snottier remember was Ct.

163
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.520
So this really becomes m d t divided by detail.

164
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.580
James M,
the x divided by detail.

165
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

166
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.180
<v 0>This is guaranteed to be a four vector.</v>

167
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.310
That means if you know the components of this in one frame of reference and he

168
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:19.311
called one of them as p zero and you call this one p one then in a moving in a

169
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.070
frame that's moving relative to what speed you,

170
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.720
a p zero prime will be p zero minus Beta Times p one over the square root and p

171
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:39.150
one prime will be p one minus Beta times visit over the square root.

172
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.810
It'll transform just like the components of X.
Yes.

173
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.810
Where did the sea,
uh,
no,
I did not go.
You're quite right.

174
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.590
I see a [inaudible] CT quite right.

175
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.490
It is c times VP.
You need that then this is correct.

176
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.820
So we got afforded vector,

177
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.730
but we don't know what it means because we don't know what detail means.

178
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:12.940
It's of course it's the time according to the article,

179
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:17.260
but I don't care about politics.
I'm studying this particle.
I got my own clock.

180
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.620
I got me on meter sticks.
I want to think in terms of time according to me,

181
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.050
period.
Well,
we can do that.

182
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.120
They can do that by going to anything.
When you take an event like this,

183
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:33.121
the x one d Tao and you can write it as Dx One d tee times DTD toe,

184
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.210
the x one d t something.

185
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:39.700
We understand it's just the velocity according to you and me.

186
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.830
If you use that rule here,

187
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.990
you will find the momentum has got components m times c,

188
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.650
d t d tau is Dt tee,

189
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.390
which is one times d divided by the Tao,
which is this factor here.

190
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.230
And the second thing will be m v divided by the same.

191
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.890
In other words you can take,

192
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.980
you can trade out of it is for t derivatives everywhere provided you attach this

193
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.440
factor.
That's the ratio of the Tao database through the tweet.
They did have it.

194
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.610
So now I have afforded vector.
I still don't know what it means,

195
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.530
but at least it is written in terms of things with are baric operations

196
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:27.100
significance for me,
I see a particular movie,
it's got a velocity.

197
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.020
Put that in and I get this thing.

198
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.320
Apparently the relativity theory says this should play the role of momentum but

199
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:37.450
afford dimensional momentum in your new world.

200
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.410
If you wanted to bring the other components,
we will put an arrow.

201
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.180
We can keep it or leave.
It doesn't matter.

202
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.540
No.
Notice once again that,
okay,
I'll continue some more.

203
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.150
I have already done this last time,
but let me remind you,

204
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.620
we looked at this guy and said,
look at small velocities,
Ben,
be overseas,

205
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:04.480
but it's small.
The denominators just one numerators and B.
Then I said,
Aha,

206
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.320
that's the momentum,
so it must be that with all these factors,

207
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.890
this is the momentum in the new relativistic theory.

208
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.270
The new [inaudible] momentum is not just mass times velocity,

209
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.570
mass times velocity divided by all this stuff.
The theory says,

210
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.220
use that as your momentum.
That's good.

211
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.040
Then be a say,
okay,
that's my momentum.
Who is this?

212
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.230
I expanded this out for small velocity.
If you put velocity equals zero,

213
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.440
you get mc that looks like this,
the mass,

214
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.610
and we don't know what that corresponds to in your just the mass.

215
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.800
Nothing kinematic will.

216
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.570
But if you expand the square root a little further out to one more term,

217
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.050
be found that the zero component p Zero looks like mc times one plus B squared

218
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.470
over two C's were less.
Dot,
dot,
dot.

219
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.950
That'd become mc plus one half MV squared times one oversea lists dot,

220
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:02.414
dot,
dot.

221
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.410
And now I finally have something I understand because one half MV squared is

222
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.700
familiar at Kennedy energy,
but I don't like this annoying.
See here,

223
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.280
if I multiply both sides by sea,

224
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.790
I learned that c times p zero

225
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.060
is MC square.
Bless one half Mv Square.
That's more stuff.

226
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:27.470
That's more and more powers that we oversee.
But this,

227
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.930
I argue since that's the kinetic energy,

228
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.890
everything is an energy formula to the whole thing stands for energy.

229
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.680
So I learned that the first component of p is energy divided by c.

230
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.450
So I come back here and I write business energy divided by c.

231
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.650
So put all,
if you are,
for many of you who found some of this mathematics,
uh,

232
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.810
difficult to follow.
It depends.
For me it was love at first sight is,

233
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.380
this is really when I said I want to go into the business.

234
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.120
For some reason this would work for me,

235
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.230
but it doesn't matter what you have to know is what I'm going to tell you now.

236
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.030
Operationally,

237
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.820
I'm not going to hold you responsible for this part of the material at all.

238
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:16.751
For me,

239
00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:21.310
it's part of explaining how logically starting with the very first axiom first

240
00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:22.810
to ask him if you can did use everything,

241
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.320
but now I'll tell you operationally what you guys are supposed to know.

242
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.560
You are supposed to learn the following two things.

243
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.920
In the old days we at time and Viet space,

244
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.280
there've been United in a single quantity CT are which be right.

245
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.930
This two zero x one it's it other words,

246
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:48.040
the three components of a vector joined with one quantity that looked like a

247
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:51.070
scaler together to form a four dimensional object.

248
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.540
Nobel learning that that is another four dimensional object.

249
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.320
One of it is just the momentum and the other does energy divided by C.

250
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.090
I'd be wanting to call that as p Zero p one
again,

251
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.880
the familiar momentum,
which is a vector join with another quantity,

252
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.440
which is the best way to think about it as candidate energy plus rests energy

253
00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:20.370
plus other corrections,
but it's the scalar.

254
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.560
It doesn't depend on orientation of access in the old days,

255
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.110
but now under load and transformation,

256
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.060
namely when you go from one frame to another,

257
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.580
e and p will all mixed with each other,

258
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.510
just like x and t will mixed with these other.
But this is the new form factor.

259
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.700
This call the energy momentum for vector.

260
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.330
Just like that's called the space time for vector.

261
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.220
That's the energy moment in Florida vectors.

262
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.310
So all over the lid tivity you will find three objects visit to be part of a

263
00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:50.670
vector will combine with the fourth one,
which used to be a scalar.

264
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.170
Together they will form a new four dimensional vectors.

265
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.240
So we should know the following.
When we are studying particle dynamics,

266
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.830
we have to know,
uh,
in more detail.
I'll,
in fact,

267
00:18:03.831 --> 00:18:08.460
let me dedicate the whole board to that is very important.
You know,

268
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.750
definition is that it's he oversee and P.

269
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.343
Yup.

270
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.040
Well it looks like mc squared plus one half MV squared plus other stuff.
Right?

271
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.340
So I recognize one half MV squared as an energy.

272
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.270
Then the other powers in volume,
we're at the fourth stage,
the fourth,

273
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.930
they're all corrections obviously to the energy at higher velocity.

274
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.740
This like momentum.
Even in the literalistic,

275
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.030
teddy was not MV started out like MV,

276
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.760
but when you expand the denominators and power,
so we oversee,

277
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:45.110
we'll get more and more corrections.

278
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.740
I identify this as an energy because if I go to very low velocities it reduces

279
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.680
to the rest mass with doesn't ever go into change plus a one half MV squared,

280
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:56.180
which played the role of kinetic energy.

281
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.553
<v 1>Right?</v>

282
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.820
<v 0>That's the way it has units of energy and one term and it looks like energy.</v>

283
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:03.481
So the whole thing,

284
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:06.420
the theory is telling you is all just the energy of the party.

285
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.880
In the old days in velocity is a very small,

286
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.360
we saw only the two terms of written one half MV squared and Mc Square Mc Square

287
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.720
we hadn't bothered with because it doesn't change in any coalition you add the

288
00:19:20.721 --> 00:19:24.470
MC squared is before each particle has got its own Mc square before and after.

289
00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:28.870
They simply cancelled is the one half MV squares before and after that would

290
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:30.980
equal and we use that to solve collisions.

291
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.660
Now we will be told you should use the conservation of this energy and the

292
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:37.910
conservation of this momentum in a coalition.

293
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.690
Okay,
so the first thing is this is e and this is p.

294
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:49.050
Anyone says what is e MC squared divided by one minus B squared.

295
00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:54.721
Receipt Square and P in one dimension is MBA divided by one minus B squared over

296
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.263
c squared.

297
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.320
This you must know,
so momentum,

298
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:06.950
middle 30 looks a bit like the old momentum but it's got this ubic with this

299
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.060
factor and energy looks really weird.
It doesn't look like anything on earth.

300
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.630
But if we expand this and power Sylvie,

301
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.440
you will see the term terms we rode down rest,

302
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.530
energy plus everything else you can call energy of motion.

303
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.850
And the first chairman of the energy of motion is the familiar one half Mv

304
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.240
Square.
In other words,
this is how the world always was.

305
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.760
It was revealed to us in the old days when we only looked at low energy

306
00:20:31.761 --> 00:20:36.110
particles as MC squared plus one half MV squared.

307
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:40.010
And we can see the dot.dot terms because we oversee,
we're so small,

308
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.880
the fourth power and six power and eight part of you oversee or too small for us

309
00:20:43.881 --> 00:20:48.040
to detect.
Likewise,
the of a particle

310
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.330
<v 2>was never MV.
It is MV divided by all this.
But for small valleys,</v>

311
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.480
we oversee look like that and we figured,
hey,
that's what is really happening.

312
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.210
So we were looking at an approximation.

313
00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:02.410
But these quantities in the old days when velocities are small and as velocities

314
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:04.780
go up,
uh,
those quantities that are useful,

315
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:09.310
this is what the theory says should play the role of the new Ford momentum.

316
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.890
<v 0>So the significance of this being afforded momentum.</v>

317
00:21:15.891 --> 00:21:19.550
First of all is what is written on the top right corner there.
Namely,

318
00:21:19.551 --> 00:21:21.740
if you know the energy and momentum in one frame,

319
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.920
you can find the energy and momentum in another frame of reference.

320
00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.980
Moving relative to me for that purpose,

321
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.140
you should take the energy and divide by C,

322
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.820
we should call it p not the momentum can be left as it is and this will behave

323
00:21:34.821 --> 00:21:38.450
like x,
not that'll be him like x one under Lorentz transformation.

324
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.290
<v 0>Well there are other consequences of the fact that P is afforded vector first</v>

326
00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:50.240
consequences.
This,
you'd remember the dot product of a vector with itself.

327
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.020
It's the same for all observers.
So what's the dot product?
The p with the,

328
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.240
with itself?
Well let,
before I do that,

329
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.100
let me remind you in general into the activity.
You will have four vectors,
eh,

330
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.630
they'll have a one part that looks like time and one part that looks like an

331
00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:12.260
ordinary vector
and B,

332
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.580
it's another four vector.
It's got a part that looks like time.

333
00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:18.570
And another part that looks like an ordinary lecture.

334
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.800
It's a union of a former vector with the farmer scaler.

335
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.550
And they will transform it.
A load than Samsung nation,
just like x and,
and t.

336
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.840
But the fallen quantity a Darby,

337
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.570
we can say zero be zero minus usual.
Dot.

338
00:22:35.571 --> 00:22:38.290
Product of the spacial components is in video.

339
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.850
That means all people will agree on this quantity

340
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.130
and a special cases,
eight dot.
A.
Dot.

341
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.220
A is equal to 80 zero square minus the length of the vector park,

342
00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.900
which for our purpose will be just a zero squared minus 81 square.

343
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.780
This is all reasoning by analogy.

344
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.200
<v 2>Yep.
No,</v>

345
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.220
<v 0>all right,
Lisa.
Quarterly answers slightly different objects.
Uh,</v>

346
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.480
you can form with his phone number numbers something that you've made color

347
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.180
[inaudible] right.
Uh,

348
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.540
they would invent it before it was distributed by Hamilton and they have a great

349
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:32.470
mathematical beauty and they generalization of numbers.

350
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.850
Uh,
you know,
we generalize real numbers to complex numbers.

351
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.320
Then you went from complex numbers and things called quaternions.

352
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.990
They are also numbers.
You can multiply them by each other,

353
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.650
but the product a B differs from the product B.
So it's a demo.

354
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.090
They had call a hyper complex numbers where the audit in which you multiply them

355
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.520
matters.
Okay,

356
00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.330
so now let's take,
let's ask,

357
00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:05.010
what is the invariant length square of the momentum for vector with itself?

358
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.260
That means you got to do p Zero Square minus p square.

359
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.810
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

360
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.060
<v 0>that means you're trying to take m zero.
I'm sorry,</v>

361
00:24:15.061 --> 00:24:20.061
you're going to take mc over this factors square minus M v over this factor

362
00:24:23.281 --> 00:24:27.720
squared.
But let's try to do this in our head guys.

363
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.940
M squared is going to come out to the whole thing.

364
00:24:29.941 --> 00:24:34.140
You agree the top I have got one over one minus B squared.

365
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:34.980
Oversee Square,

366
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.550
you have to have minus V squared over one minus B squared overseas square.

367
00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:42.270
So they have a lot of cancel giving you MC squared,

368
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.110
uh,
m squared,
c squared.

369
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:54.140
So the fallback that of any particle has a length that does not at all depend on

370
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:56.960
how fast it's moving.
The depends only on this,

371
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.870
when you talk take a velocity vector for a particle,

372
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.920
it doesn't have a fixed length party.
They can be moving slow.

373
00:25:07.921 --> 00:25:09.900
It can be moving fast.
So be x,

374
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.710
quiet plus v Y squared could be whatever you like depending on how it's moving.

375
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.280
But this relativistic length square of afforded vector is independent of

376
00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:22.570
velocity because the velocity here,
when combined with this,

377
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.070
I'm just cancel so well that's just the way it is.

378
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.680
Now,
if you're not good in Algebra,
that's a shortcut for finding this.

379
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.740
Let me tell you what the shortcut is and we love the shotguns because they very

380
00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:39.600
helpful and the model of the study is also illustrated by the shotgun.

381
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.890
I wanted to find p.
Dot.

382
00:25:40.891 --> 00:25:45.891
P it's an invariant because it's like a dark product so anybody can calculate

383
00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:49.220
it.
How about somebody writing with the particle?

384
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.110
If you're writing with the particle,

385
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.120
your zero component is m zero C is MC.

386
00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.130
There's no velocity for you and you have no momentum as the particle.

387
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:04.080
There's no momentum as seen by the particle.

388
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.470
So the components of the vector p become MC and zero.

389
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.990
What's the length square?
This vector,

390
00:26:09.991 --> 00:26:12.300
but it's a square of this guy and case closed.

391
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.980
There's nothing here to subtract from here.

392
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.920
That's a quick way to verify that this,

393
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.810
like the vector with itself is in fact m squared,
c squared.
In other words,

394
00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:26.310
the trick is right with the particle and calculate the vector and the vector is

395
00:26:26.311 --> 00:26:27.330
only one component.

396
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.620
Namely Mc doesn't have a spatial part because it's not moving according to

397
00:26:31.621 --> 00:26:34.620
itself.
That's what p.
Dot.
P's m squared,
c squared.

398
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.810
So people write it also as follows.
Uh,

399
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.910
remember p zero was he oversee.
This is p square,

400
00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.720
m square,
c square.
I don't rate it.

401
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:52.530
This is one way the write it explicitly,
but here is how people write it.

402
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.890
Multiply both sides by square and right east square physical disease where p

403
00:26:58.821 --> 00:27:03.330
square,
let's m squared c to the fourth.
Uh,
that deserves a box.

404
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.380
That's how we remembered it.

405
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.540
I have just rearrange this equation.
P.
Dot.
P is m squared,

406
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:14.600
c squared by definition.
P.
Dot.
P is the timeline component.

407
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.580
Square minus spatial components where we agree the time like part is you oversee

408
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.470
especial part is just the momentum.
So I've just rearranged it to get this

409
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.580
and it says the energy of the particle depends on his momentum.

410
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.230
If it comes completely the rest,
you kill this term that's equal MC squared.

411
00:27:33.231 --> 00:27:34.580
That's the rest energy of a product.

412
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.610
No,

413
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.560
I am almost finished with the kinematics except for one thing that are strange

414
00:27:45.561 --> 00:27:47.600
particles in the world called photons.

415
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.170
Photon has no rest mass.

416
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.680
Therefore if you namely went by any of these formulas,

417
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.180
if you kill the massive before time,

418
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.290
you might think energy and momentum vanish because m is going to zero,

419
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.640
but we all know enough mathematics and know that if the zero on the top you

420
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:06.540
could beat it.
If there's a zero in the bottle,

421
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.780
that blocker only for be equal to c.

422
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.020
So politic is moving at the speed of light.
Do have energy and momentum,

423
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.400
but they don't come from a mass divided by something or mass times velocity,

424
00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:23.600
but be something they simply have energy and momentum that obeys this equation

425
00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:28.601
without an m on the right hand side for the fourth time he square equal to c

426
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:34.050
times.
P Square is what?
A four time obs.

427
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.900
So four times can have energy.
Photons can have momentum,

428
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.320
but the energy would be c times that woman.

429
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.720
So that if you find the invariant squared at the fort on momentum,

430
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:51.590
you will get zero.
So fortnights or particles who's momentum squared is zero,

431
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.880
where the square is the four dimensional square with the times squared minus the

432
00:28:57.351 --> 00:28:58.184
spacial square.

433
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.000
So let me summarize,
um,

434
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.900
once more for people who may not want to follow every detail,

435
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.850
the practical part of what you must understand from what I've been teaching,

436
00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:20.851
you said when you study a single material particles which has a mass so that it

437
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:23.470
can be brought to rest and made to sit on the table,

438
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.410
we associate with that afforded vector.

439
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.650
The first part of that is the energy oversee.

440
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.640
The second part of that is called the momentum and the explicit formula for

441
00:29:33.641 --> 00:29:38.641
these are m zero or MC divided by this and end the embedded by this.

442
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:46.300
And one can explicitly verify that p.
Dot.
P is m squared,

443
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.710
c squared.
This is it.
This is somebody of all that I've said.

444
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.140
You don't know anything at all.
Notice

445
00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.030
<v 1>yes.
When you're ready,
eat up that either on the right.</v>

446
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.320
<v 0>Yeah.
A Capitol p without any address on it.</v>

447
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.140
I supposed to be afforded vector and the dot.

448
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:14.141
Product of it is defined as the square of the first component minus the way.

449
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.253
The second one

450
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.913
<v 1>that's correct</v>

451
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.940
<v 0>and four,
four times.</v>

452
00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.590
We always like to use the symbol k by the momentum of a photon rather than p.

453
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.140
Luckily people like read more or less back convention fought on momentum is

454
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:33.320
called k and more sometimes and I just called Q by some people,

455
00:30:33.321 --> 00:30:34.430
but we will call it k.

456
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:36.830
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

457
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.210
<v 0>and the energy of the photon is going to be called Omega momentum before time is</v>

458
00:30:41.211 --> 00:30:42.200
going to be called k

459
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.920
and the condition is we'll may go equal to KC and that's the condition k.

460
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.650
Dot.
K equals zero.

461
00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:58.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

462
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.220
<v 0>k squared if you like shorthand for k.
Dot.</v>

463
00:31:01.221 --> 00:31:04.850
K Zero four four times four times a particle is square to the four.

464
00:31:04.851 --> 00:31:09.020
Momentum is zero material particles that can come to rest have a square at the

465
00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:13.880
Ford momentum which is m squared,
c squared.
This is really,

466
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.980
this is something you have to know.

467
00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:19.370
Another thing you have know is that when I write them in this notation as four

468
00:31:19.371 --> 00:31:23.030
vectors,
you should know the following.
You found all the components,

469
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.800
p zero and p one in one frame

470
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:31.130
and you move the electrode to me or speed you p zero prime and p one prime with

471
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.850
related to p zero and p one by the Lord and his transformation.
Yes,

472
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:39.851
like zero prime and x one prime are related to x one and x by that formula on

473
00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:44.730
the top left.
Last thing I wanted it to,

474
00:31:44.731 --> 00:31:48.110
I'm going to do a lot of problems for you so you get used to doing the

475
00:31:48.111 --> 00:31:49.690
relativistic kinematics.

476
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.360
Last thing I wanted to tell you is why do we take this definition on momentum?

477
00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:57.851
Okay,

478
00:31:57.851 --> 00:32:01.750
you agree that theory naturally gave out something that it said deserves to be

479
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:04.480
called momentum,
but why do we Watson Nice about this?

480
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:07.810
Why is it important that the momentum and energy form of vector,

481
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.160
I'm going to give you a reason for it and try to follow the reason,

482
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.340
the whole advantage of energy and momentum.

483
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.970
What is the big deal about energy and momentum?
Let me ask you that.

484
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:24.390
Yes you have concern they have or not useful unless the specialist utility came

485
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:26.680
from the fact they are concerned.

486
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.120
So you can put a restriction on possible coalitions you add the moment than

487
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:35.160
before.
It's got agree with momentum after you add the energy before it's got.

488
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.440
I agree with the energy after of course in the Nativity,

489
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:41.060
energy and momentum had been assembled into four vector.

490
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.230
So conservation of momentum will mean really for equations.

491
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:49.880
The zero part will be the energy before we put the energy after and the three

492
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:52.010
special parts will be x component.

493
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.450
The moment before it will be x component after them.
So on.
That's all very good.

494
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.900
But you got to make sure that if a momentum is conserved for me for momentum,

495
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.090
it must also be conserved for you.

496
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.830
There's no use having a quantity that's concerned for me and not concerned for

497
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:13.280
you.
So by the time you bring up something and say they're going to use it as a

498
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:13.971
concern quantity,

499
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:18.440
you've got to make sure the conservation law is not limited to one observer.

500
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.990
And that's what I want to show you.

501
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.590
I won't argue without writing any equations that if energy and momentum are

502
00:33:25.591 --> 00:33:26.424
concerned for me,

503
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.150
they are going to be conserved for you because they are vectors.

504
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.950
Let's understand why.
Suppose you got a coalition.
A lot of particles come in.

505
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.330
One particle brings momentum energy p one other one brings out energy and

506
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:43.331
momentum p two and at the end of the coalition maybe they become party country

507
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:47.810
and particle foreign particle five in Duluth,
dualistic theories.

508
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.790
If two particles come in,
you can have 36 particles coming out.
In fact,

509
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:55.900
that's why they build accelerators.
If two went in and two came out,

510
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.750
it's a waste of time.

511
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.560
You can smash into things and would that energy you can produce matter.

512
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.960
So it's not a mistake I've made.

513
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.020
I do mean that sometimes too can go into three or four five.

514
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.500
Let's take an example where this is true.

515
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.510
Each p is a four component object like this.

516
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.810
Suppose I say incoming equals outgoing
love.

517
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.310
You see the whole coalition from your frame of reference.

518
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:22.970
Then I maintain that the numbers you get,

519
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:28.110
the one frame and P to prime will also equal B prime plus before Brian,

520
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.320
let's be five prime that's guaranteed and I want to tell you why.

521
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.480
Suppose this for ordinary vectors,

522
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:40.590
let me make life simple by saying at p one plus p two became p three

523
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.253
<v 1>okay?</v>

524
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.040
<v 0>What that means is one vector p one another vector p two added up to one vector</v>

525
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.850
p three exit visa,
not ordinary arrows.
They said ad works in four dimensions.

526
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.390
The fact that two arrows add up to a third one are equal do third one means the

527
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:03.224
former triangle.

528
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.330
Now they can form a triangle for me and you can stand on your head and do what

529
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:11.330
you like.
It'll still be true even though it looks like this,

530
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.330
it is still true that this guy,
this guy is equal to that guy.

531
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.360
You have two vectors add up to third one.

532
00:35:18.361 --> 00:35:21.810
Namely if a summer two vectors is equaled another vector,

533
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.800
namely the lefthand side vector,
it is equal right handset vector.

534
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.911
Going to rotate.

535
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:31.440
That frame will continue to say that the rotated vector is equally rotated back.

536
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.890
That's because equal vectors upon rotation will remain equal vectors.

537
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.210
That's the whole point.

538
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:43.350
The total incoming momentum for vector Khalid fee incoming,

539
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.730
and this is the outgoing momentum college,
the p outgoing.

540
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.900
If p incoming is equal to p outgoing for me,

541
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.640
so two vectors that equaled space time for the rotator observer there will be

542
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:59.700
equal.
Do you understand why?

543
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:04.110
Because it my total incoming vector will undergo Lord Samsung nation to become

544
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:05.160
your incoming vector.

545
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.030
My outgoing vector will go along and transformation to find your outgoing,

546
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.580
but if the input of the Lord in his transformation is the same,

547
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.600
the output will also be the same because you will be putting the very same

548
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:18.120
numbers to get out the output numbers.

549
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.260
That's why it's very important that this momentum that we have be used because

550
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:27.390
it does a chance that if it's concerned in one frame,

551
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:30.120
it's conserved in all frame.
If you went and said,
you know what,

552
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:33.840
I don't like your formulas.
I am really wedded to this formula for momentum.

553
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.100
What you'll find is that even if it's conserved in your frame of reference,

554
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.950
in a different frame of reference,
that combination,

555
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.600
some over envy will not be concerned.
Okay?
That's the final,

556
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.500
uh,
property of four directors you've got to use.
Again,

557
00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:50.850
if you don't follow the details,

558
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.000
you must know that in coalitions that we are going to study,

559
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.690
we will add up all the four vectors coming in will equate them to all the four

560
00:36:57.691 --> 00:37:00.480
vectors going.
That's it.

561
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:05.220
So now I'm going to do sample problems to get you a feeling for that.

562
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.160
So as usual,

563
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.820
they will start out with the simplest one and then try to make it more

564
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:15.330
complicated.
So the first problem is this.

565
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.760
I am standing here,

566
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.050
I got some mass m and therefore time is coming towards me with some moment than

567
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:24.984
p

568
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.430
and it just hits me on the face and I absorbed the photon.

569
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.410
It's completely possible for the atoms forming my body to absorb a photo.

570
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.310
They absorb it.
So in the end,
that is no four ton.

571
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.390
That is me.
But possibly with a new mass in prime

572
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:51.320
into the list of collisions.
That is nothing called inelastic collisions.

573
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.260
You remember in the old days the one thing came and start to another thing and

574
00:37:54.261 --> 00:37:58.100
they move together.
Momentum is conserved,
but energy is not.

575
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.390
There is no such thing.

576
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.430
Energy will always be conserved in the linguistic theories.
In other words,

577
00:38:04.431 --> 00:38:09.170
even though this is a big,
I'm a single unit,
you might say,

578
00:38:09.171 --> 00:38:11.600
what happened to the energy previously?
I had a moving photon on,

579
00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:15.200
I got nothing moving here.
Well first of all,
I will be moving.
Secondly,

580
00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:16.250
I'll have more mass.

581
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.590
Best thing is to consider the two particles coming in opposite directions.

582
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.620
They collide and form a new mass in the activity that has no momentum in the

583
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:31.370
final particle is not moving at all.
But it'll be more massive than before.

584
00:38:31.371 --> 00:38:35.290
And that extra mass times c squared will be the extra energy brought by the

585
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.480
party consent form it.
So anyway,
the question here is what does m prime,

586
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.730
that's what we have to figure it out.
So the equation we will use is,

587
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:51.270
I would call my momentum is p and I would call p one as the initial one and Pete

588
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:56.860
was the final one.
Let's write down all the equations we can.

589
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.400
The only equation in town is k plus p one equals p two

590
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.850
case.
Now,
everybody is afforded vectors,
so don't be fooled.
It's 40 questions,

591
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.350
but in this problem,

592
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.670
luckily since there is no motion perpendicular the x axis,

593
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.800
we can have this x moment.

594
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.860
There's no need for y and z because the photon comes this way.

595
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.470
It can knock me and I can start moving this way,

596
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:26.290
but all the action is in the aesthetics.
So he had it.

597
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.820
It'll be actually two dimensional vectors and not for that's nothing vertically

598
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:35.170
before or after,
it'll be zero equals zero.
So what are those equations?

599
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.560
Before they do that,
let's write down the momentum of the photon.
First

600
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.740
momentum of the photon has got some energy.
I may go,

601
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.100
we may go oversea and it got some momentum.
K,

602
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.680
we had Omega Equals Casey.

603
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.740
You got to remember that p one has got an energy which is mc and no special

604
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:59.980
moment and because I'm not moving

605
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.160
at the end of the day P two I am moving,

606
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.870
but I also have a new mass and I have a new velocity which we don't know

607
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.110
going to have m frame be.

608
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:19.220
It might've best way to the one minus B squared over c square.

609
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.360
No.
All of you should be able to write this part down.
If you're not,

610
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:31.390
you should take a minute to think about it.
You can stop me,
you can question me,

611
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.280
but if you cannot do this,
you cannot do any of the problems.
You've got to think,

612
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:39.820
would I have done this?
Does it make sense to me?
What's the book?

613
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.360
Bookkeeping is all in the top.
Then you got a material particle.

614
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:48.870
It's first term zero component will be m times c divided by the square root of

615
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:50.980
all those things,
but the particle is addressed.

616
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.040
You only have mc that is normal mental.

617
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.560
The final object me after they hit the got hit by the fourth time I'm recoiling

618
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.140
so I will have a velocity.
I don't know what it is,

619
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.830
but my energy in terms of that,
the first term,
the zero will be this.

620
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:09.550
This will be p one.
No,

621
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.900
the law of conservation of Energy and momentum,

622
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:17.230
namely k one plus B one equals k two plus B two will really be saying all the

623
00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:20.180
energy parts are the zero components.

624
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.410
We'll add a before and after and the first component is the ladder before and

625
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:28.660
after.
In other words,
Omega Oversea Plus Mc,

626
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.540
would it be equal to m primacy over this,

627
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.610
then k plus zero will be equal and Prime v divided by this.

628
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.180
This is not any different from the old days we had law of conservation of

629
00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:49.601
momentum.

630
00:41:49.601 --> 00:41:53.590
You allow conservation of energy except energy is not one half MV squared.

631
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.510
Energy is this crazy thing.
Plus even if a particle is not moving,

632
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:02.470
don't forget to give it MCS the energy.
That's the new part.

633
00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:10.270
So what does the,
what is the question I asked you?
I said,
what does m prime,

634
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.290
so your job is to take these two simultaneous equations,

635
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:19.270
just one and this one and on foot m prime.

636
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.500
So what should I do?
What do you,

637
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.650
can you think of a strategy that'll give me m prime?

638
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.210
<v 2>Yes.
Okay.</v>

639
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.820
Right side of that equation.
Yeah.

640
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.190
<v 0>Into this one here.
Yeah.
Yep.</v>

641
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.230
You still have to sign for m prime and you also don't know the velocity here.

642
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.010
Memory of sound for the velocity and the episode for the employer.
If you say,

643
00:42:53.011 --> 00:42:55.560
what does the unknown's and what are the known,
so let's be very clear.

644
00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.180
The photon is a known momentum and on energy that's given to you.

645
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.600
Initial me has a mass m that's given to you.

646
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:08.220
Your job is to find the unknown mass m prime and the unknown velocity.

647
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.440
Do questions for two or not,

648
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:14.160
but they are not simple linear equations where you can add and subtract.

649
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.970
Okay?
The simple linear equations are multiply this by three,

650
00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:21.360
multiply that by four and subtract and you'll get what you want is more

651
00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:22.194
complicated.

652
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.310
The trick that you really want to use is the fact that for any particle,

653
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.560
if it took the square up the zero component,

654
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.040
so platform with the square of the spatial component,

655
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.690
the answer will be in Prime Square,
c square.

656
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.690
So I'm seeing this square,
mine is,

657
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.490
this square will be in prime time,
see square.

658
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.450
And that you get by taking this square up,
this minus two squared up this,

659
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.480
you can juggle that,
but I'm not going to do it that way.

660
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.310
I'm going to show you much more efficient and rapid way to do this.

661
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.460
So let's do it the most efficient way.
So let me come down here.
So you can see

662
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.780
here,
it's the shortcut.

663
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.010
Shotgun is the work entirely with four vectors and report dimensional dot

664
00:44:11.011 --> 00:44:14.630
products and don't get down to the ugly business or writing each component.

665
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.400
We know that p two is p one plus K,

666
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.900
right?
And who are we?
After we had after m prime,

667
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.260
then we remember that p two square,
namely p two.
Dot.

668
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:33.780
P two is equal to m prime square.
C Square.

669
00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:36.643
<v 1>Yes.</v>

670
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.610
<v 0>So the question you had asked this,</v>

671
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.760
nobody asked you how fast I am moving after I got hit.

672
00:44:42.761 --> 00:44:45.830
By the fourth time you only asked me what is my numerous mass.

673
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.540
So you have swallowed the photon.
So I way more.
It's really that.

674
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.350
How much more do a waste?
The question,
namely what is my rest mass?
Namely,

675
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.330
I swallowed it and I recoiled and if you've traveled with me and find me at
rest,

676
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.010
what mass end primarily measure.

677
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.300
So no one's asking me my velocity of Recoil v.

678
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:08.410
So you shouldn't bother to calculate that.
You could if you wanted to,

679
00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:11.860
but no one asking you that.
So go directly for p two square.

680
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.350
The quantity we're looking for is m prime square.
See Square.

681
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.870
That's gotta be p one plus k,
the whole thing.
Square.

682
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.730
Well do the old Algebra.

683
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.480
That's equal to p one squared plus k square.

684
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.240
Let's twice p one.
Dot.

685
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:38.241
K.

686
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.510
Okay.
Now let's see if I can do
what we do next.

687
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.540
What do you like to guess?
Yes.
No.

688
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.980
Do you know any of these quantities?

689
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.830
Do we know anything about what I've offered?
Three terms of written here?

690
00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.353
<v 1>Yes.</v>

691
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.880
<v 0>K squared is zero because of what?</v>

692
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.720
For the photon.
I told for any particle,
the squared up its momentum.

693
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.860
It's really the squatter for its mass time.

694
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:17.420
Cs where for photons I totally long back Kdot case,
you know?

695
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:19.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.300
<v 0>You don't have to worry about that.</v>

697
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.450
How about the square of the momentum of the of me?
Well,

698
00:46:25.451 --> 00:46:27.150
that was my rest mass before

699
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.680
IMC squared plus zero.

700
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:38.070
Now P one.
Dot.
K.
You got to be careful that dark product means,

701
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:44.210
let me write down the director of p one and can put you p one was Mc and zero

702
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.910
and k was the Omega oversea and especial momentum at Omega was equal.

703
00:46:50.751 --> 00:46:55.630
The Casey got,
remember that
put a photon.
Once you pick the energy,

704
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.280
you have no choice with a moment.

705
00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:01.420
Magnitude of momentum has to be a magnitude of energy divided by c.

706
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.210
So let's take p.
Dot.
K,
let's try to do p one.
Dot.
K.
Remember.
Dot.

707
00:47:07.211 --> 00:47:10.900
Product of two vectors is time.
Time is time.

708
00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.300
M C times,
we may go oversea minus space.space.

709
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:17.163
That was you.

710
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.870
So I canceled that and I find this really,

711
00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.180
and we'll make up

712
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:36.210
and that's equal to m prime c squared.

713
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.230
<v 2>Yep.
Can you just remind me what the uh,
what the Omega stands for again?</v>

714
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.170
<v 0>Yeah,
the four time.
Remember the four directors.</v>

715
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:51.670
First Component is energy oversea.
Second component is a momentum.

716
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.600
It's traditional to call the energy of the photon by the symbol omega and a

717
00:47:57.631 --> 00:47:59.550
Spanish.
I'm to call the momentum moment the Maga round,

718
00:47:59.551 --> 00:48:03.910
the usual momentum by the symbol k.
And that's pretty helpful.

719
00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:08.800
Otherwise you can have p one and p two and p one sub zero and k one sub zero to

720
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:09.634
many indices.

721
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.380
So what we're trying to do is whenever we write a k was components at Omega and

722
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:18.360
little K,
we know we're talking about the photon and Ben [inaudible],

723
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.530
I know I'm talking about the electron.
So Omega is destined energy up the photon.

724
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.420
So now if I can sell all the c squares and they get and prime square and square

725
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.090
plus two m Omega overseas,

726
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.040
now you can take the square root if you like,
and that's the answer.

727
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.360
So my mass would have gone up.
You might think,

728
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.300
how much would the mass have gone up?
We will say,
well,

729
00:48:56.301 --> 00:48:58.610
this guy swallowed a four ton of Energy Omega.

730
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.330
So maybe that energy overseas squint will be the change in mass.

731
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.090
That is not correct.
And you got to think about why that's not the answer.

732
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:13.670
Why is that wrong?
Wait,
listen,
the photon energy turned into my extra mass.

733
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.270
Yes,

734
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.103
<v 2>I know.</v>

735
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.560
<v 0>In other words,
when I observed the Fortran,</v>

736
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:25.260
I also have to require to consider the momentum of the photon.
Consequently,

737
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.090
my final energy will equal all energy plus four ton energy.

738
00:49:30.091 --> 00:49:31.890
But that does not mean all.

739
00:49:31.891 --> 00:49:34.320
If it does rest energy that doesn't manage your emotion.

740
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.010
So you got to make sure that in the end you calculators so that the total energy

741
00:49:38.011 --> 00:49:38.844
is balance,

742
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.010
but it's not contained in restaurants because you produce the rest mass in.

743
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:44.430
You also moved the rest mass.
And for all of that,

744
00:49:44.431 --> 00:49:46.320
you've got only the energy of the photon to work.

745
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.133
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

746
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.710
<v 0>Okay,
so this is,
uh,
this is one problem.</v>

747
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.370
I was going to do one or two more,
but I want to make sure you guys are falling.

748
00:50:00.371 --> 00:50:02.530
I just don't know.
Uh,

749
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.790
see if I ask you what you would do next.
If you have some idea,

750
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:08.230
then we can proceed.
But if you don't know,

751
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:12.220
maybe we should slow down and you've got to talk about which part of it you find

752
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.960
more difficult.
So let me say a few things.

753
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.810
And the first time you hear something that you find difficult,

754
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.920
you've got to put your hand up.
Okay?
Otherwise you're not going to make progress.

755
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:29.970
First thing I say is this particles of mass having energy and momentum that

756
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.820
depend on their velocity and rest mass as given by the first equation

757
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.620
and the energy and momentum,
but assembled into a four vector.

758
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.860
The first component that we just,
he oversee second company.

759
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:47.030
There's just a momentum that much you should know.
Secondly,

760
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.920
if it took the dot product of that vector with itself for the dot product is

761
00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:56.690
defined in to be Lawrence invariant.
So that the same for all people,

762
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.410
that's p zero squared minus p one square.
You will always get m squared,

763
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:03.920
c squared for any particular Massa independent of its state of motion.

764
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.030
And the simplest way to get,

765
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.800
remember that is to evaluate the dot product in the frame moving with the

766
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:11.690
particle in that frame,

767
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:15.320
it only has a p zero which is mc and doesn't have a spatial momentum.

768
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.970
So that's gotta be the answer.

769
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:22.190
Second thing when you deal with for Trans is a little tricky for tons of energy.

770
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:23.300
Photon some momentum,

771
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.590
but energy is not mass times velocity squared over two,

772
00:51:27.591 --> 00:51:31.040
etc. They have no mass,
but they have energy in their momentum.

773
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.580
And the condition of the photon is that the energy must be momentum times.

774
00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:41.230
See that'll make sure that k.
Dot.
K is,
you know,

775
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.290
because for a particular mass m we,
I showed you the relation,

776
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.550
he square equals c times p squared plus m squared,
c to the fourth.

777
00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.480
But for town there is no app that means equal the PC.

778
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.630
So four times energy in photon momentum have related magnitude.
Yes.

779
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:01.403
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

780
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:08.160
<v 0>That's what I'm telling you for for four it's not defined as MV over something.</v>

781
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.540
It is not defined that way because you,

782
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.390
you don't even get off first base without because m vanishes and be equal to

783
00:52:15.391 --> 00:52:16.650
zero you are in real trouble.

784
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.650
So you've got to realize that for Portland as an exception,

785
00:52:19.651 --> 00:52:20.460
how do you think about,

786
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.210
you don't think of it as an object of some mass that moves and sm energy and

787
00:52:24.211 --> 00:52:26.670
some momentum.
It always moves at one speed.

788
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:28.990
You might say if it always moves at one speed,

789
00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:31.860
it must have only one unique moment.
That's not true either.

790
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.870
So they are a little tricky for for trans you have to accept the fact that for

791
00:52:36.871 --> 00:52:41.730
Trans have energy and four times of momentum with equal a PC and apart from that

792
00:52:41.731 --> 00:52:44.160
there is no restriction.
You can give a fort on any energy,

793
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.650
like as long as the momentum you give it,

794
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.140
it says that each squared equals c squared,
p squared,

795
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.980
and you cannot go to the frame in which the photon is at rest.

796
00:52:52.981 --> 00:52:57.210
There is no such thing.
It has no rest mass particles with notice.

797
00:52:57.211 --> 00:53:01.310
Mass can have energies and can have momentum.
You know my,
the son,

798
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.760
when the inner four times hit you,

799
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.900
you can feel the force that's called radiation pressure.
So they carry momentum,

800
00:53:06.901 --> 00:53:07.740
they carry energy.

801
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.520
But the formula for momentum energy is not written in terms of a mass.

802
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.670
So that's the second thing I've said.
Yes.

803
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.173
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

804
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.360
<v 0>for the photon.
Yeah.
Yes.</v>

805
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.340
P Zero Equals R K zero equals k one for the time.

806
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.970
And if I wrote k zero is Omega oversee than it means Omega Equally Casey.

807
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.190
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

808
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:38.160
<v 0>that's the second statement.
That's not obvious from anything I taught you.</v>

809
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:39.630
So that's new subs,
new stuff.

810
00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:43.200
Because suddenly I got an object with no mass and my whole derivation for

811
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:46.650
momentum started with an time,
some velocity and so on.

812
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:50.430
So that fails for four plans,
but they exist and they carry energy.

813
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:51.270
They carry momentum.

814
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.780
You should think of them as particles that obey e squared equals c squared plus

815
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:59.460
[inaudible] squared,
c to the fourth with m equals to zero,

816
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:03.720
so they will be equal species.
That's the second statement.

817
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.600
Third statement is in a collision you add up all the piece in the case for

818
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:13.110
everybody on the left and that that's equal sum of all the pieces in the case on

819
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:16.410
the right
and you do that,

820
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.130
so you got to make sure that you can do that part for particles.

821
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.940
I will tell you this particular,
this rest mass is going at this velocity.

822
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.950
Then it should be able to build up this energy and momentum
for photons.

823
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.050
I won't tell you it's,
this is the velocity.

824
00:54:31.051 --> 00:54:33.390
Velocity is always see for four times,
I have to tell you,

825
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:36.210
this is the Omega of the Photon is the care of the photon.

826
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:40.020
So you farm a little vector with Omega oversee as the first component and cares

827
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:44.280
the second one.
Then it's very,
then it's very easy at all.
The first column,

828
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:46.050
Second Column,
Third Column,
fourth column,

829
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:51.020
and those four things are separately conserved.
That's it.
That's the trick.

830
00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:54.540
The coalitions balancing energy and momentum in one mega equation,

831
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.350
which is for momentum before is for momentum after.

832
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.870
And the beauty is any observer can look at this coalition from any frame of

833
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:04.704
reference.

834
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.190
Different people will disagree on what's the energy and watch the momentum of

835
00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:11.460
the particle.
For example,
in this example I gave you,

836
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.510
I said I am addressed and I got hit by a Fortran,
then I'm moving.

837
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.380
Well that's the point of view of some observer for whom I was at rest initially.

838
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.690
You can see the whole thing from a rocket.
In that case,
uh,

839
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.880
my initial momentum,
we'll have a special part because the rocket,

840
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:28.080
I'll be moving backwards.

841
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.860
This photon will also have a new omega and a new cables you can find from

842
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:35.310
learning transformation.
This final object,
we'd be moving at some speed,

843
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:38.040
so everything will look different.
Nonetheless,

844
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:42.210
the momentum and energy will balance on the two sides for you as well.

845
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.273
<v 2>Yes.</v>

846
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.403
Pardon me.

847
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.553
Ah,

848
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.020
<v 0>no.
You gotta be very careful about what you mean by mass.</v>

849
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.550
Some people think a master's m divided by square root of one minus B squared

850
00:56:06.551 --> 00:56:09.820
over.
I never want to take the point of view the only masters,

851
00:56:09.821 --> 00:56:14.460
the rest mass and nobody will disagree on what the rest mass of a particle is.

852
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.250
You understand that I may think the particulates at rest,

853
00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.470
you may think it's moving that is fine,

854
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:22.690
but if he bought asked the following question,

855
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.850
what does mass in a frame in which the particulates addressed the answer to that

856
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:31.410
person as a unique answer to find that you go sit with the particle and definers

857
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:36.500
maths so the rest of mass in this case m and m prime are Sam for all people.

858
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:40.530
You could see the whole coalition,
the rocket,
the end prime missed.

859
00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:45.531
The employer e and p are transforming as Lauren's variables but m is a length

860
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:51.490
square for four vector and therefore it's the same for all people
can have.

861
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.210
I want to do a second very interesting problem

862
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.073
<v 1>which is this,</v>

863
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:07.330
<v 0>the year is 1950 something for got 53 or 54 you are trying to build a collided</v>

864
00:57:09.681 --> 00:57:13.700
and Berkeley
is going to have a proton target.

865
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.630
By the way,
I'm going to show you one more trick.

866
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.690
It's a very useful put c equal to one everywhere.

867
00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:26.850
You can always put sequel one by choice of units.
For example,

868
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.450
if your unit of length instead of being a meter stick was three times 10 to the

869
00:57:30.451 --> 00:57:33.540
eight meters and that was your new unit of length,

870
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.480
that's called a light second for you.

871
00:57:36.481 --> 00:57:40.330
The velocity of light is one because it goes one light second in one second and

872
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.560
distance over time will be one even if that's not your unit.

873
00:57:43.561 --> 00:57:44.850
I said forget about c,

874
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.770
do the math without see in the end you can always put back the sea will always

875
00:57:49.771 --> 00:57:54.170
know in the end how to put back the sea.
Maybe you have an example here.
Yeah.

876
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.720
In this problem,
if I had forgotten,

877
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.580
see everywhere I'll get an answer that looks like this.

878
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:05.190
M prime squared as m squared plus 2:00 AM Omega.

879
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.110
I already know that.
If that's a mask where and that's a mass square,

880
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.230
well that's a mass and that's an energy.

881
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.710
So I know that should be a season where here you can always find the city square

882
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.290
or the end of the day.
There's no reason to carry it from the beginning.

883
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:22.830
Just from dimensional analysis.
When you're looking for an energy,

884
00:58:22.831 --> 00:58:24.930
you see a mass port where there,

885
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.230
when you're looking for a mass and you see an energy and it should be a mass

886
00:58:28.231 --> 00:58:30.270
divided by c square.
So that's what I'm going to do.

887
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.940
So here is a proton addressed.

888
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:37.860
Here is a proton that I've created from my bebber Tron,

889
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.110
which is going to come and smash into this.

890
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.780
And the job of this reaction is the following,
whether there's notations,

891
00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:49.980
very unfortunate,
there's not a momentum.
This stands for Proton.

892
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:52.170
Proton.

893
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:57.170
Proton should farm the two protons and the new Proton and anti-proton created

894
00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:02.070
from the vacuum created from nowhere.
This is what happens in a collider.

895
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:07.410
Particles and antiparticles are created in pairs using the incoming energy.

896
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.650
So it's the opposite of the atomic bomb.
Atomic bomb,

897
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:16.430
masses destroyed and energy is created in an accelerator.

898
00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.620
Energy is converted into mass,

899
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:23.600
which is why two particles can go in and for particles at 10 or 14,000 can come

900
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:27.740
up.
So we wanted to look at the experiment where people were trying to make

901
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:28.670
antiprotons.

902
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.570
The theory says anti-proton mass at the same as the proton mass.

903
00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:37.260
It's a very gentle symmetry of theories.
But do you want to make it,

904
00:59:37.261 --> 00:59:38.160
and the question is,

905
00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.940
what is the minimum energy of this incoming proton that'll make this reaction

906
00:59:44.401 --> 00:59:47.400
possible?
This guy starts out at rest.

907
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.233
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

908
00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:55.750
<v 0>So how,
what energy are,
what momentum should the incoming</v>

909
00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.930
predict?
I'll have yes.

910
00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:04.040
<v 2>Uh,
uh,
and uh,
energy,</v>

911
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.670
uh,
uh,
one or two.

912
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:16.650
<v 0>Uh,
let's see.
So here are four par four protons and in the tempest collision,</v>

913
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.720
what would they be doing in the end?

914
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.980
<v 2>Uh,
no.
I'll just be like</v>

915
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.960
<v 0>sitting in a clump.
Yeah.
And what would be the energy of that plump?</v>

916
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.213
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

917
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.130
<v 0>Do you agree that's for them?
Yes.
Okay.
This guy brings energy,</v>

918
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.230
emptied the collision,
big,
the static target.

919
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:40.540
So you will conclude the energy of this should be three m

920
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.793
<v 2>okay.</v>

921
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:47.990
<v 0>By that we mean m c squared divided by one minus v squared over c square should</v>

922
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.350
be three times Mc Square.
That's the energy.

923
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.460
You got that three.
This ambled make water.

924
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.710
<v 2>Yep.
Why are um,</v>

925
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:04.690
why don't we say that the [inaudible] are on the right that's coming in.

926
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.920
Is is m ones?

927
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.460
<v 0>No,
no,
no.</v>

928
01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.460
The mass of these particles is always am I'm saying the energy of this guy is

929
01:01:15.311 --> 01:01:18.040
three m
yes.

930
01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:21.790
If this is three m and that guy brings a name just by sitting there and we need

931
01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:24.940
for them to make for particles and we want the cheapest deal.

932
01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:28.930
So nobody's doing anything
but this is wrong.

933
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.680
This is an underestimate for what you need.

934
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.823
<v 2>You need more</v>

935
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.330
<v 0>think about why do we need more energy than this?</v>

936
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:41.180
<v 2>Yep.</v>

937
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.530
[inaudible]

938
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:49.330
<v 0>no,
right.
Let's say they don't annihilate their form and they are just,</v>

939
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.610
they don't analyze it that fast.
So they can be produced.
Antiprotons can,

940
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:57.490
that's not the reason why
I want you to visualize the question we are asking.

941
01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.850
Obviously,
if you send a super duper proton beam,

942
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:04.450
it can knock the hell out of this proton produce however many particles you
want.

943
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.580
You want the minimum energy.

944
01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:09.460
And the picture we have is what's the minimum energy afford particles?

945
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:13.410
Whether it's for particles at rest,
that's the one that which the computer,

946
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.290
the energy.
But there's something wrong with that argument.
Yes sir.

947
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.400
Yeah.
So let me repeat what he said.

948
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.240
Law of conservation of momentum will not allow you to take a situation about a

949
01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.760
proton comes in with momentum.

950
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.390
This guy is doing nothing and you cannot afford particles at rest because it had

951
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:33.330
momentum is zero.
Therefore,

952
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:38.130
the Ford guys who are produced must be drifting forward with some minimum

953
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:41.670
momentum so that that momentum equals incoming moment,

954
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.700
that means you got to pay the price to make them,

955
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:49.320
you got to pay the price to move them at a minimum momentum to balance the

956
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:50.154
incoming moment.

957
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.770
That's your tell you that the real energy of the incoming particle has gotta be

958
01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:58.640
more than just a whatever I said three yet.

959
01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.210
That'll be going to find out the real moment.
So the trick is again,

960
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:07.710
going to be the same.
So this the initial state is the final state,

961
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.560
but this final state has got some motion

962
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.590
cannot be addressed.
So what's the initial momentum?

963
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:22.400
Initial momentum for this guy is some energy.
He,

964
01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:27.090
but this guy is a mass m and the momentum of business,

965
01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:30.860
some number p and the moment of this guy is you.

966
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.450
That's the initial moment.

967
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.580
And that's gotta be equaled the final moment.

968
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.510
Very good.
Final momentum.

969
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:49.820
You can write down in detail by taking this for masters,

970
01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:53.120
giving them some velocities.
But I'm not gonna do any of that.
Yes,

971
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.983
this em,

972
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:02.830
this particle has an energy m uh,
it's really Mc.

973
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:07.160
So I did this.
He oversee MC and zero.

974
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.450
This guy has got you oversee and some momentum.

975
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:15.340
PEA pod.
I've forgotten the sea.

976
01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:18.050
Remember we agreed that we're not going worry about,
see in this problem.

977
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.280
So this is just an,

978
01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:26.060
so this is the initial momentum that's going to be the final momentum.

979
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.110
That also means initial momentum is square,

980
01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:34.130
is final momentum squared.
If two vectors at equal,
the squares are equal.

981
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.700
Now the final momentum square,

982
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:41.960
I could say we can evaluate not at the lab frame,

983
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.230
but in another frame called the center of mass frame.

984
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.540
And here is the center of mass frame.

985
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.170
Suppose you start moving to the right at some speed.

986
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.070
What do you think will happen?
Imagine in your head,
you move to the right,

987
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:57.710
this proton,
we'll start moving to the left.

988
01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.530
This brought on will appear slower that let you

989
01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.170
pick up your speed until they're coming in exactly opposite momentum.

990
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.570
That's the frame of reference you can imagine in that frame,

991
01:05:11.571 --> 01:05:14.070
the collision looks rather different in that frame.

992
01:05:14.071 --> 01:05:17.180
This guy and this guy at approaching each other with opposite velocities,

993
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.920
therefore equal and opposite momenta.
The total momentum is zero.

994
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.300
In that frame,

995
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.070
these two guys had allowed to go into four sitting ducks because the total

996
01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:29.904
moment in Mizzou,

997
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.160
so that is the frame of reference called the center of mass frame.

998
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.250
In with incoming moment,
uh,
add up to zero.

999
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.190
So the final particles that are allowed to be at rest,

1000
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:44.890
if they want to and the minimum energy coalition,

1001
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.760
they will be produced at rest because that's the least expensive way.

1002
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.840
So I found a frame in which this is possible.
That's not the lab frame,

1003
01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.600
that's a frame in which they're moving in opposite directions.

1004
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:59.110
But what's the total momentum in this frame?

1005
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.290
Total momentum at this frame B total is four m comma zero.

1006
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:12.931
No,
no one stays.

1007
01:06:12.931 --> 01:06:16.050
The total momentum and that frame has to be the total moment and my frame,

1008
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.590
but uh,
sorry to say p final,

1009
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.650
no one says that be financial should be,
might be final,

1010
01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:26.120
but the square of that be final.

1011
01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.800
This is great or might be fine because it's great if any vector is the same for

1012
01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:34.310
all observers.
So what does be final square?

1013
01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:39.670
You guys should know by now this bad product of this vector of itself with the

1014
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:43.100
square of this number.
Mine is zero.
There's nothing here

1015
01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:46.770
that fought.

1016
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:51.770
I argue here that p initial square is equal to p final square that they

1017
01:06:53.751 --> 01:06:57.020
calculate in the center of mass frame and it gets 16 inch square.

1018
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:01.300
<v 2>Yes,
people,</v>

1019
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.070
<v 0>right?</v>

1020
01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:08.630
Why is the square of the Ford momentum the same in two frames of reference?

1021
01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:10.400
Anybody answered that?

1022
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:17.950
Why is it [inaudible] are not equal,
but the squared is equal?
Why is that?

1023
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.400
Because it's a dark product of a vector with itself.

1024
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:26.780
And the whole idea of defining these squares so that they are the same for all

1025
01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:27.614
observers.

1026
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.350
The whole idea of defining four vectors is that when you take the legs square

1027
01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:35.510
for four vector defined in this crazy way,

1028
01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.260
zero component squared minus the first component square.

1029
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:42.020
That same for all people,
right?
That's the beauty.

1030
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.200
That's why if you really look at the total momentum vector in the lab frame,

1031
01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:53.260
it looks like this and that's gotta be the final total momentum to these numbers

1032
01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.420
are not,
uh,
they are both non zero.

1033
01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:01.250
So Norman says the total momentum vector is the same in the center of mass
frame.

1034
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:02.330
It looks like this,

1035
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.320
but the square of the vector of must be this way or the vector for all people.

1036
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.510
Well,
let me finish this and maybe we'll have a discussion.

1037
01:08:10.511 --> 01:08:14.290
So p initial squared is 16 m square.
So this is the pop most line.

1038
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.500
Find the square of this vector is e plus m squared

1039
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.070
minus B squared is 16 and square.

1040
01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:30.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:34.290
<v 0>Uh,
so let's see where to write this.
Maybe I'll write it here.</v>

1042
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.340
That means east square plus m squared.

1043
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:49.270
Let's do e n minus B squared is 16 named square.

1044
01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.813
Yeah.

1045
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.980
<v 0>What you must know that e squared minus B squared is the name square.</v>

1047
01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.390
I'm saying e squared equal to p squared plus m square.

1048
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.420
If you banish all those factors of c square.

1049
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.450
So this ie squared minus B squared is an m square.

1050
01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.530
That's an already an m squared here.
So I get to m square.

1051
01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.860
Let's do e m equal to 16 m squared.

1052
01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:25.860
You canceled the two and make it 14 and squares and to divide by two m you find

1053
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:32.170
e equals seven.
And
by the way,

1054
01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:36.280
this is posted on the web,
on the Internet,
so you guys can go.

1055
01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.300
You guys can read it whenever you like.
So don't worry about this last detail.

1056
01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:45.400
I've given you that every possible detail here,
if you didn't get every factor,

1057
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.770
doesn't matter what I want you to understand this.

1058
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:51.010
I have also given you the whole argument on how you go to this frame and that

1059
01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:51.844
frame.

1060
01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.120
The point is you get an answer that equals seven m you realize time to put back

1061
01:09:57.221 --> 01:10:02.220
the velocity of light and everybody knows even man and woman on the street that

1062
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:05.120
this should be the only seven MC squares.

1063
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.110
If it caddied factors of see throughout the calculation it would've been very

1064
01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:10.720
messy.
But here is where c squared,
what happened?
Turn out.

1065
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.980
We're looking for an energy and you get a mask.
You put back the c square.

1066
01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:20.410
So what we are told is the incoming proton acid moves,

1067
01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.110
his energy goes from MC squared,

1068
01:10:22.111 --> 01:10:24.820
the bigger and bigger numbers because they're nominated and won over to B

1069
01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.620
squared.
C squared is vanishing.

1070
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.500
Wait till the energy is seven times the rest energy.

1071
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.920
You've been a seven times at Este energy,

1072
01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.750
that's when it's ready to hit the static proton and produce Proton antiproton

1073
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:38.770
pairs from Norway.

1074
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.410
So some of the m square is going to give a momentum to the fragments of the

1075
01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:49.120
collision and some ways to create and the way we found or the minimum energy

1076
01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.280
[inaudible] energy moment of calculation,

1077
01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:55.750
but the minimum energy configurations easily imagine in the center of mass
frame.

1078
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.530
That's the whole point,
not in the lab,
free central mass from,

1079
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:01.990
that's why accelerators nowadays is they're taking one particle,

1080
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.300
make it move faster than passenger hitting a target.

1081
01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.860
The produce intersecting story drinks where the particles are going in opposite

1082
01:11:08.861 --> 01:11:12.460
directions and every time or they meet in the racetrack that allowed to collide.

1083
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.430
What's the beauty of that?

1084
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:17.910
Beauty of that is since they come to the opposite Momenta,

1085
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.590
the final fragments don't have to move it all so you can make more and more
mass.

1086
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.920
So don't put your energy all into one beam and a static target.

1087
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.410
Put them into two oppositely moving beams.

1088
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.800
Then all the energy is available for producing mass.

1089
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:37.530
All right,
so I'll stop now.
I think this is a difficult chapter,

1090
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:41.100
so you have to go and read and you have to talk to each other and try to do as

1091
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:42.120
many problems as you can.
