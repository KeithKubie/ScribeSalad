00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:04.901
Weininger: Okay,
so let's get started.

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:06.934
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.767
Um, I'm Nick Weininger.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.501
I'm an engineer on the Google
Custom Search team.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:13.767
And I'm going to be talking

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.267
about advanced Custom Search
configuration.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.434
So I'll start out by giving
a very brief background

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.467
on what Custom Search is.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:24.667
In a nutshell,
the idea of Custom Search

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.968
is to bring the quality
and the reliability

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.701
and the speed of Google search
results to search boxes on sites

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.968
all over the Web.

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:36.501
And what that means to you
as a site owner,

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:40.000
as a webmaster, as a developer,
is that it enables you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
to create
a contextual search experience

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.367
that's right for you,
your audience.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.234
You can define the scope over
which you want your search box

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:50.567
to search,
whether that be just your site

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.701
or a collection of hundreds
or thousands of sites

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.367
or small parts of sites
or even a long list

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.334
of individual URLs.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:01.534
You can customize the way
the search works,

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:03.734
the ranking,
and the navigational experience

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.234
that your users have.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.934
And you can present results
with a configurable-looking feel

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.267
so that you can integrate
that search better

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.000
with your site.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.100
And finally you can monetize
that Custom Search

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.334
by displaying relevant ads
through AdSense.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.234
And what you may not know

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:27.968
is that Custom Search
can do all of this

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:32.400
in a very sophisticated way
as a developer platform.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.367
You may have seen the Web-based
configurator that we have

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:38.067
for Custom Search engines,
but you may not know

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:40.400
that we also have APIs
that allow you

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.734
to programmatically create
Custom Search engines

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:46.601
and to tweak very considerably
both the ranking

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.100
and the content
and the appearance

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.601
of search results
to create a search experience

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.734
that's very tightly integrated
into your site.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.467
And to give you an example,
here is the search

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.801
on The New York Times'
website.

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:01.334
It doesn't look immediately
like a Custom Search--

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:02.334
a Google Custom Search.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:03.534
You couldn't tell immediately,

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:05.767
"Oh, these must be
Google search results."

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:09.400
And that's because The New York
Times has used our APIs

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.868
and a good deal
of their own data

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:14.901
to create a search experience
that makes sense

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.767
for New York Times users.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:21.501
So I'm gonna talk
about the key tools

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.434
that Custom Search provides
for doing things like that.

00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:28.200
I'm gonna describe
the XML format

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.067
that defines
a Custom Search engine.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.334
I'm going to talk
about the ways

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:36.133
in which you can
programmatically create CSEs

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.801
either by uploading them
to our servers,

00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:42.167
or by defining them on the fly
by files that you host

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.200
on your servers,
or even by provisioning them

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.701
on behalf of others.

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.100
And I'm gonna talk about
some of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.801
the more advanced
presentation options

00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.634
that you have, including some
that we've just released

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:56.868
in the last few weeks,
that allow you to include

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:59.234
rich, structured metadata
in your search results,

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:02.234
to present your search
results

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:04.567
using the new Custom Search
element

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:08.567
that DeWitt mentioned
in his keynote presentation,

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:13.167
and to use server-side XML even
to configure your results

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.334
using what's known
as Google Site Search.

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.601
So, as always, we should start
with an example.

00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.801
And, as always, we should
motivate the example

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.133
by doing something familiar
and easy.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:28.300
So I'm going to do something
familiar and easy.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.834
I'm going to create a new
Google Custom Search engine.

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:38.634
Uh, I'm going to call it
the CSE I/O demo.

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:42.167
I'm going to say, man,
this is a cool demo.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.400
I have to decide
just one thing

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.167
in the simplest version:

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.567
what sites do I want
to search?

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:49.734
Let's say I--for instance,

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:54.801
I want to search
code.google.com.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.734
And I click Next.

00:03:56.734 --> 00:04:00.801
And my search engine exists.

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:02.734
I can try out a query...

00:04:06.334 --> 00:04:10.934
and get relevant results
from code.google.com.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:16.601
Now when I finish,
I go to the Web control panel.

00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.534
And if I click through
on that control panel,

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:21.067
I see a whole bunch
of options,

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:23.567
various tabs,
which I can use

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.567
to configure graphically,
wizardly,

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.801
various features
of the Custom Search engine.

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.701
But this is an advanced custom
search configuration talk,

00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:37.300
so I'm going to go straight
to the Advanced tab.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.167
And here I see
a couple of things.

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:45.067
I see stuff
about annotations and context.

00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:48.300
You might say, "Hmm, I wonder
what exactly these things are."

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.934
Well, I can view this
in the browser.

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:53.968
I'm gonna view the XML
for this context in the browser.

00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:57.367
And I have
this annotations thing too.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.601
I'm not quite sure what that is,

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.734
so I'm gonna view them both
in the browser.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.567
Now I look at these,
and what do I see?

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.801
I see, aha,
I have an ID string

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:09.601
from my Custom Search
engine,

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.601
there's a creator ID here.

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.400
And I see the title
and the description

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.868
that I put in the wizard.

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:21.467
I see this BackgroundLabel thing
that I may not understand

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:24.934
but that I can at least
associate with the idea

00:05:24.934 --> 00:05:27.501
of my created
Custom Search engine.

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.467
And I see a LookAndFeel
section

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:31.234
that I haven't configured yet

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:32.400
because this is
a very simple,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.601
very easy Custom
Search engine.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.968
And then I go to the
annotations, and I see, aha,

00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:41.734
now here I start to see
the sites that I put in.

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:44.734
I have code.google.com.

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:47.734
And it's labeled
with this label

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:53.133
that refers back
to the Custom Search engine ID

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:56.734
that I saw in this context.

00:05:56.734 --> 00:06:00.567
And so that's the heart of it.

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:02.200
That's the heart
of what we do

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.968
to enable developers
to programmatically create

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:05.968
Custom Search engines.

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:08.434
We simply define
this XML format,

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.934
which is just the same
XML format that we use

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:12.767
under the hood,
and it gets modified

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:15.901
when you modify Custom Search
engines in the graphical wizard.

00:06:15.901 --> 00:06:20.267
And that Custom Search engine
takes sites

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:25.200
and relates them to a sort
of frame called a context.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.367
And those sites and the context
together define the operation

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:34.200
of your search engine.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.067
So to say in a little more
detail what this means,

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:39.634
the context tells you
about the basic settings

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.300
for the Custom Search engine.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.133
It tells you, in particular,

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:47.000
what you can do if you create
refinements for faceted search.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.501
So you may want your search
engine to have options

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:53.801
to drill down into different
parts of your site, for example,

00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.234
so that your users can navigate
your search

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:57.367
by doing a little browsing

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.067
and not just by entering
keywords.

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:02.767
And refinements allow you
to do that.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:05.868
It also allows you
to do custom things to queries.

00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:08.300
For instance, you might have
synonyms, which make sense

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.801
only in the context
of your domain of search.

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:14.334
You can define those
in the context.

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:16.667
And so we see an example here

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:20.334
where we have
a refinement label

00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:22.801
that's going to correspond
to a refinement link

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:24.601
with the title "Lectures."

00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:26.968
I'm sorry.

00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:29.567
And those lectures are--
aah--

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:31.300
those lectures are going
to be boosted

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.601
with a certain weight.

00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.234
And they're going to cause
the query to be rewritten

00:07:37.234 --> 00:07:39.067
in a certain way.

00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:42.234
And now you see
this background label thing.

00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:43.734
What that means is simply

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:45.567
the background label
is the label

00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:47.434
that defines
the Custom Search engine.

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:51.567
It's the label such that
any annotations, which I define

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.567
over any sets of URLs
or URL patterns,

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:57.801
can be hooked in
to the Custom Search engine,

00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:01.267
included in its scope
by labeling them

00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:03.934
with that link.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:07.400
And so if I look
at the annotations

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.968
for this sample CSE,
I can see, aha,

00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:15.701
I've included this--
oops--

00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.801
I've included a couple
of different URL patterns

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.534
and a couple of different ones
of my labels.

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:23.234
So I've hooked them in
to my CSE

00:08:23.234 --> 00:08:25.834
in a couple of different ways.

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.567
Now that's sort of the classic
Custom Search engine feature.

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.734
I want to also call out
a new feature

00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:35.400
that we just released
a couple of weeks ago

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.234
called Promotions.

00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:38.434
And what Promotions are,

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.734
are they're completely
custom results.

00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:44.100
And you'll see an example
and some screenshots later on.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.901
Which you can define,
simply by saying,

00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:48.701
"Okay, for thus
and such a query,

00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:50.901
"I want this kind of result
to show.

00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:53.133
"I want a result
with this link

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:57.067
"and that URL and this little
text snippet to show.

00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:00.200
And, you know, I can even
include a thumbnail image."

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.601
And the Promotions,
like everything else

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:07.534
about the CSE,
are defined in XML format.

00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:09.567
And it's
a very simple XML format.

00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:12.000
Each Promotion says
what queries

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.767
it should display on,
what title it should show,

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.701
what URL it should show,
and so on.

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:23.501
And if I don't want to interact
with the control panel,

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:26.367
if I don't want to manually
upload and download

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.968
these XML files in order
to create or to modify

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.534
my Custom Search engine,
all I have to do

00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:35.400
is use our RESTful URL patterns
to do these creations

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.000
and modifications.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.033
And you can see the full list
of RESTful URL patterns

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:42.868
in the Custom Search engine
developer docs.

00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:44.834
But they're pretty simple.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.133
To create a new CSE context,
there's just this URL pattern

00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:48.968
with CSE in it,
and you create it

00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:52.701
with a CSE ID.

00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.667
The one other thing
worth mentioning, though,

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:57.701
is that there are a number
of advanced features

00:09:57.701 --> 00:10:00.400
which are available,
at least for now,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.767
only in the XML API,
and which you might not notice,

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:06.234
therefore, if you've been
creating Custom Search engine

00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:07.367
with the wizard.

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:08.968
I mentioned, one,
at the beginning,

00:10:08.968 --> 00:10:12.100
you can create
user-defined synonyms.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.033
Another is that you can boost
and demote different sites

00:10:15.033 --> 00:10:16.267
with different weights.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.234
So, suppose you have
a Custom Search engine

00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:20.067
that searches
over ten different sites

00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:21.734
and you want to say,

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.667
"I want to tweak the ranking
as follows.

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:26.701
"I want this site to be
strongly boosted relative

00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:27.767
to other results.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:29.300
And I want this other site

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.667
to be mildly demoted
relative to other results

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:33.767
because I think site one
is really good

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.434
and site two
is sort of slightly bad.

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:38.801
You can configure that
in the XML

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:42.901
using labels
and annotations.

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:44.801
You can even force results

00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:47.901
to come from a certain site

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:50.367
whenever they're available
by specifying what are known

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.567
as top N results.

00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:55.100
You can affect ranking
in a number of other ways.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.100
For instance, you can bias
results by date.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.601
The New York Times Site Search
actually uses this

00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:05.300
to enable you to get
recent news articles.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.467
And, as I said,

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.534
there's this Custom Search
developer guide

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.767
which documents fully
all of these things

00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:15.267
which you can do.

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:16.934
So there's our API.

00:11:16.934 --> 00:11:19.767
There's the basis of it.

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:22.734
But now we have this thing
called linked CSEs.

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:25.534
And the reason we created
linked CSEs was as follows:

00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:28.267
People said to us,
well, I don't want

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:31.300
to have to interact
with this control panel at all,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.901
and I don't want to have
to interact

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.667
with this Google account
at all

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.801
that I used to create
my CSE.

00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:38.334
Because, in this example,

00:11:38.334 --> 00:11:40.934
you'll note I had to go
through a Google account

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.567
in order to log
into the control panel

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:45.167
and do the wizard
operations.

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:47.734
I want to be able
to handle a CSE as an object

00:11:47.734 --> 00:11:49.234
which is totally independent

00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:51.734
from any Google account
membership that I might have.

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:54.901
And the reason is that I want
to define my CSE

00:11:54.901 --> 00:11:56.601
on the fly.

00:11:56.601 --> 00:11:59.133
I have some data
about what sites are good

00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:00.200
and what sites are bad.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.033
I have some data
about how my users want

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:04.434
a search experience
to look.

00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:06.567
And that data is changing
all the time.

00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.834
And I don't want to have to push
an update to Google

00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:12.734
every time I change the
definition of my search engine.

00:12:12.734 --> 00:12:14.467
I want Google to come to me

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.367
and get that definition.

00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:21.200
So a linked CSE enables you
to do just that.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.133
The way you define it is
you write out the definition

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:29.200
of a CSE in that same XML format
I just showed you,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.601
you host it at some URL
on your site,

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:35.033
and then in your search box,

00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:39.133
you tweak the URL
of search command just a little

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:41.434
to point to that URL.

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:44.567
And the semantics of that
is Google, go get

00:12:44.567 --> 00:12:46.434
this search engine
definition file

00:12:46.434 --> 00:12:49.133
right when the user
queries it,

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.133
parse it out into a definition
of a Custom Search engine,

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:54.767
and give the user a search
on that Custom Search engine

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:56.868
which I've just defined.

00:12:56.868 --> 00:12:59.901
And if the contents
of that file changes,

00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:04.667
change the search engine
automatically for me.

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:08.434
And the power of this...

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:11.567
is not only that
you can refresh it on demand.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:14.133
The power of it is,
number one,

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:16.334
that you can make

00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:18.567
the contents
of that Custom Search engine

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:21.167
logically dependent
on something else.

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:24.033
The first great use case we had
for this was,

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:26.901
suppose I have a site
that's a directory of links

00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:28.934
and I'm constantly
modifying that,

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.133
adding sites to
the directory,

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:31.601
deleting them
from the directory.

00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:33.067
And I want a search,

00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:35.934
which is just, "search all
the sites in this directory."

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:38.300
So the way I want to create
the Custom Search engine 

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.000
at any one time is I want
to scrape that page,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.400
and I want to take
all the links on it,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.634
and I want to say,
"Oh, okay,

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:45.334
"all the sites
that this links to,

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:50.467
those are the sites that
are included in the search."

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:51.767
So it'll link to CSE.

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:54.067
You can easily do that.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.200
And the other thing
that it empowers you to do

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.767
is to create on the fly
very, very large numbers

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:01.767
of different
Custom Search engines

00:14:01.767 --> 00:14:03.601
with different annotations

00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:05.534
for different sections
of a site,

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:07.033
for different individual pages,

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:11.767
for whatever different
applications you may have.

00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:13.901
So let's see a couple
of examples of this.

00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:16.567
One of our biggest users
of linked CSEs

00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:18.834
is about.com.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:22.067
About.com is a site
which provides

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:25.234
encyclopedic information
on thousands and thousands

00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:26.801
of different topics.

00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:28.300
And for each one
of those topics,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.000
they have a sort of subsite.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.901
There's classiccars.about.com.

00:14:32.901 --> 00:14:35.133
There's a politics site
at about.com.

00:14:35.133 --> 00:14:37.834
There's sites for every special
interest you can think of.

00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:42.200
And every one of those needs
its own search experience

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.467
because, if you're
on classiccars.about.com

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:48.601
and you go and search
on carburetor

00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.133
or Corvette for that matter,

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:54.200
you want search results
that reflect your interest

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
in that particular vertical.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.334
And so what about.com does
is they dynamically create

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:02.400
a Custom Search engine
definition

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.767
for every single vertical

00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:09.734
that changes
as their vertical changes.

00:15:09.734 --> 00:15:14.033
And so here's a screenshot
of custom Web results

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:18.200
on the "Student Travel"
about.com site.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.100
And you'll notice--again I'll
talk more about this later--

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.200
that the look and feel
of those results

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.634
is very much customized

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:25.968
to the look and feel
of about.com.

00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:27.601
And in this case,
they've done that

00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:30.067
using server-side XML results

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:33.601
and their own rendering.

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:37.367
Another example:
the Blogger gadget,

00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:41.434
which we just--
we just today moved

00:15:41.434 --> 00:15:45.834
from draft to live status,
just launched on Blogger today.

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:48.200
And what this is
is a dynamic CSE

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.067
for searching your blog
and the context of your blog.

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:53.801
Because, again,
suppose you have a blog

00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:56.467
and it links to lots
of other blogs.

00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:58.334
It's linked to lots
of other articles

00:15:58.334 --> 00:16:00.601
you found interesting,
and you have a blogroll

00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:04.100
with perhaps 100 other blogs
that you like.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.567
That is a logical set
of information

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:11.200
over which your blog's readers
should be able to search.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.300
And that information--
that set of information

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.467
gets updated all the time.

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:17.734
And you want the search engine
to automatically update

00:16:17.734 --> 00:16:19.467
whenever you update
your blog

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:21.667
in a way that changes
that set.

00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:24.868
And so Blogger,
using linked CSEs,

00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:29.601
provides a feature
that does exactly that.

00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:34.000
And to give you an example
of what this looks like

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.501
and some of the power
that it uses,

00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:40.100
here is the XML source for a
Custom Search engine definition

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.934
on one particular blog.

00:16:42.934 --> 00:16:48.801
It includes here an URL
of a special format.

00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:51.634
Notice the makeannotations
in that URL.

00:16:51.634 --> 00:16:53.701
What this is is the tool
that I talked about before.

00:16:53.701 --> 00:16:55.067
It goes on a page,

00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:56.634
it extracts
all the links from that page,

00:16:56.634 --> 00:16:58.667
and it makes annotations
out of all of them

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:00.667
to say, "These are all sites
I want included

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:03.601
in my Custom Search engine."

00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:06.467
It includes all of those,

00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:11.334
it adds a couple
of actual blogs manually

00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:13.067
to the example.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.868
And then it defines
a Custom Search engine,

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.834
again just as
in a prior example,

00:17:18.834 --> 00:17:21.434
with a title
and a description

00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:25.734
and a refinement facet
and some labels.

00:17:25.734 --> 00:17:30.000
And that all shows up
within the context

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.467
of the blog as
a customized search experience

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:37.267
over that particular blog.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:40.234
And in this case, we're using
another very powerful,

00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:42.801
very configurable
rendering method,

00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:44.334
namely the AJAX API,

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:47.267
which I will also talk about.

00:17:51.434 --> 00:17:53.400
One other thing I want
to mention

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.901
in terms of the APIs

00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:58.367
for provisioning
Custom Search engines--

00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:00.834
the examples I gave
with the control panel,

00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:03.701
uploading and downloading
those XML files,

00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:06.667
those are all examples
of creating CSEs

00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:08.167
on your own behalf,

00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:10.367
on behalf of
your own account.

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:13.000
But we also have an API
that allows you

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
to programmatically create
a Custom Search engine

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.033
on behalf of another.

00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:20.968
Now why would you want
to do that?

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:24.200
Well, suppose you have--
you have a business

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.367
where you have clients
who host some content

00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:29.501
on your site.

00:18:29.501 --> 00:18:32.501
And you manage that business,
that client relationship

00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:35.033
through Google Apps
for your domain.

00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:38.434
So you have programmatically
created Google Apps accounts

00:18:38.434 --> 00:18:41.467
in a Google Apps domain
for them.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:44.300
And you know by virtue

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.868
of what content
they have uploaded

00:18:46.868 --> 00:18:49.501
what their Custom Search
experience should look like.

00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.901
And you want to set it up
for them

00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.367
without requiring them
to do any work.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:56.167
But you want to set it up
in a way such

00:18:56.167 --> 00:18:58.534
that they own it
under their account

00:18:58.534 --> 00:19:02.300
so that, if they want
to modify it later, they can.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.467
So this is exactly
what our provisioning API does.

00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:08.634
It's part of a suite of tools
that do provisioning things

00:19:08.634 --> 00:19:11.767
like this called Google Services
for Websites.

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:14.434
And that suite of tools
includes other things

00:19:14.434 --> 00:19:16.467
like submission
of site maps

00:19:16.467 --> 00:19:19.667
so that when your clients,
again, upload content

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.734
to your site, you can submit
URLs on their behalf

00:19:22.734 --> 00:19:25.434
to be indexed by Google.

00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:29.934
And here's an example of
one hoster that is using this.

00:19:29.934 --> 00:19:33.501
It's a web hosting company
called FatCow,

00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:36.834
and it has just a whole suite
of tools

00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:38.834
that enable its clients

00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:40.200
with a push of the button

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.601
to add Site Search
automatically

00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:48.067
under their accounts.

00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:51.300
So that's how you can create
and tweak the definitions

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.801
of a search engine
as a developer.

00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:59.601
What can you do to change
the presentation?

00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:04.133
Well, again, one very recently
launched thing that I want

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:07.734
to highlight is our support
for structured metadata.

00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:12.534
The idea is that if you have
structured date on your page,

00:20:12.534 --> 00:20:15.267
then, in a Custom Search engine

00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:17.367
that searches over pages
like that,

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:20.167
you may very well want to
include that structured data

00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:22.634
in the result block.

00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:26.300
And if we parse
and index that metadata,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.868
we can return it to you

00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:30.300
in a format that allows you
to do just that:

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.734
customize your results
so that they don't look

00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:35.033
like plain, vanilla
Google results.

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:38.000
They have the content
that matters to your users,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.400
to your audience,
to your domain.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.667
And we support several different
formats for encoding

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.200
that structured data
on your site.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.367
There's a format
called PageMaps.

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:51.634
We support several
popular microformats.

00:20:51.634 --> 00:20:55.400
And there's an RDFa parser
coming soon as well.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.467
And if you provide data
on your site

00:20:57.467 --> 00:21:00.934
in any of these formats,
we will index it for you,

00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:03.901
and, using these XML

00:21:03.901 --> 00:21:06.234
and soon the AJAX
presentation methods

00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:07.801
that I had mentioned,

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:11.400
you can return it and display it
in your CSE.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.334
And the return format
is extremely simple.

00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:17.267
In XML results,
in this example,

00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:21.734
it's essentially just a
dictionary of name value pairs.

00:21:21.734 --> 00:21:25.367
So your interpretation
of the structured data

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.400
is up to you.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.534
You can render it
how you choose.

00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:30.234
But we just provide it
to you

00:21:30.234 --> 00:21:32.934
as we've seen--
as we've parsed it.

00:21:32.934 --> 00:21:35.400
And you take it from there.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.400
Another thing,
great new thing,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.467
launched just today

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.434
is the Custom Search
element.

00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:49.267
And this allows a combination
of ease of use

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:50.834
and configurability

00:21:50.834 --> 00:21:52.968
that I think is really
a great step forward.

00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:56.868
It allows you to do
full UI styling with CSS

00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:58.234
on the client side.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.334
It includes
special CSE features,

00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:03.501
like those refinements
that I talked about,

00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:05.701
like those Promotions.

00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:07.701
It includes the ability
to monetize

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:10.367
with AdSense ads.

00:22:10.367 --> 00:22:14.667
And you can configure Custom
Search element very easily

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.601
based on any existing custom
search engine you've created.

00:22:17.601 --> 00:22:19.868
Now DeWitt in his keynote
gave an example

00:22:19.868 --> 00:22:21.467
of something
that's even easier.

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.634
You don't even need
a Custom Search engine set up

00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:24.968
to configure an element.

00:22:24.968 --> 00:22:27.434
You just copy and paste
a slice of code

00:22:27.434 --> 00:22:30.167
onto your page, and we
automatically make one for you.

00:22:30.167 --> 00:22:31.834
But if you have created one,

00:22:31.834 --> 00:22:35.501
if you have tweaked
and specialized

00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:38.300
your Custom Search engine
to be exactly the way you want,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.634
how do you get the element?

00:22:39.634 --> 00:22:43.534
Well, if you go back to

00:22:43.534 --> 00:22:46.934
this control panel
here...

00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:49.033
and you look
at "My search engines,"

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:50.567
you see a handy little link

00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:53.167
that says Custom Search
element.

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:55.868
And you click on that.

00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:59.767
And it looks just like
the zero configuration example

00:22:59.767 --> 00:23:01.100
from this morning,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.834
except in the snippet
of code.

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:04.767
If you look closely,

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:07.367
there is this one parameter,

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:08.801
and that one parameter

00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:13.033
is the ID of the Custom Search
engine you've created.

00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:15.334
And this will work
with any of the APIs

00:23:15.334 --> 00:23:16.667
that I've talked about.

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:19.467
So far it will work
with AP--Custom Search engines

00:23:19.467 --> 00:23:22.000
you've programmatically created
on your own behalf

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.400
or on other's behalf.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.667
It will work
with linked CSEs.

00:23:25.667 --> 00:23:27.734
Any CSE has some ID.

00:23:27.734 --> 00:23:29.801
You put that ID
into the code snippet,

00:23:29.801 --> 00:23:32.801
you drop the Custom Search
element on your site,

00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:36.501
and it works.

00:23:36.501 --> 00:23:39.968
And a couple
of screenshots here.

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:42.367
There's a Macworld example

00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:45.300
where you've got ads here
with all sorts of refinements

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.100
showing up as tabs.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.834
And here is the example,
which showed at the keynote,

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:56.200
with it coexisting
with a number of other elements

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.434
on the page.

00:23:57.434 --> 00:24:00.868
And note this completely custom
result here,

00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:03.601
this promotion
with a custom link

00:24:03.601 --> 00:24:06.934
and a custom snippet
and a custom thumbnail icon

00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:09.133
all specified by the user.

00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:17.033
And finally there is this option
to get XML results.

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:18.501
And the way you get
XML results

00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:20.601
is that you use a version
of a product

00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:22.901
called Google Site Search.

00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:27.734
And this has
a flat fee pricing model

00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:29.767
starting at 100 bucks a year

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:32.601
for certain chunks
of queries

00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.234
and page limits.

00:24:34.234 --> 00:24:37.734
And it basically allows you
to take that XML

00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:40.267
on the server side and do
whatever you want with it.

00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:41.934
You can mash it up
with other content.

00:24:41.934 --> 00:24:43.767
You can reorder the results.

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:45.601
You can configure
the look and feel

00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:47.300
to match your site.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:53.200
You can display it
without ads if you choose.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200
And we have a whole bunch

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.467
of sites--again,
eHealthInsurance is an example

00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:01.467
of a site
using Google Site Search.

00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:04.200
Uh, and they have
a custom result here

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.968
and a number of refinements.

00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:09.400
So again this is an advanced
user that uses these features

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.667
to create a sophisticated
search experience

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:16.634
tailored to
their user alliance.

00:25:16.634 --> 00:25:19.767
And, so to summarize,

00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:22.267
these are the various features
of the presentation options.

00:25:22.267 --> 00:25:25.901
We offer just standard HTML
rendered for you

00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:28.567
displayed in a separate page
or an iframe

00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:30.467
where you can do
a Custom Search element,

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:32.300
or with the Google Site Search
product

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.467
you can get XML results.

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:40.334
And for the next part
of this presentation,

00:25:40.334 --> 00:25:43.234
I'd like to invite
up on stage,

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:45.801
um, a couple of folks
from Adobe,

00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:50.734
one of our largest
Site Search partners,

00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:54.601
which has used Site Search
in some very innovative ways

00:25:54.601 --> 00:25:56.267
to serve their customers,

00:25:56.267 --> 00:25:59.200
and they'll talk a little bit
about how they do that.

00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:04.701
Thanks a lot, Nick.

00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:05.901
Nichoson:
My name is Mark Nichoson.

00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:07.200
I'm a product manager

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.701
for Community Help
at Adobe Systems.

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.667
I'm just--
being a product manager

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:14.501
in a room full of developers,
I'm gonna be really brief

00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:16.701
and invite my colleague
in just a moment,

00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:18.100
Joel Brandt,
who's gonna talk

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.234
about some of the more exciting
work that we're doing,

00:26:20.234 --> 00:26:23.300
but Nick in particular
wanted me to talk a little bit

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.801
about our use case
of the CSE,

00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:30.734
so we've been using
Custom Search as part

00:26:30.734 --> 00:26:33.434
of a service called
Community Help

00:26:33.434 --> 00:26:34.834
for about a year now.

00:26:34.834 --> 00:26:36.534
Um, and it's something
that we launched

00:26:36.534 --> 00:26:40.667
with the last round
of Creative Suite 4.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:43.400
Um, our use case
is a little bit unique

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.834
in that one of the things that
we've been really trying to do

00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:47.667
over the last year and a half,
two years,

00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:51.400
is really embrace some of
the new content community models

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.501
that have been enabled,
you know, via Web 2.0

00:26:54.501 --> 00:26:57.100
and find out how to best
leverage those models

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.567
within the context of Help
and Support with our products.

00:26:59.567 --> 00:27:01.501
So one of the great things
about Adobe

00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.934
is that our customers
are just incredibly passionate,

00:27:04.934 --> 00:27:07.133
so people love Photoshop,

00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:08.701
they love blogging
about Photoshop,

00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.701
they love writing tips
about Photoshop.

00:27:10.701 --> 00:27:12.367
Um, and they love helping
each other.

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:14.434
That's very visible
to anyone

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:16.901
who's visited our product
forums, things like that.

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:19.934
Um, or anybody who's been a part
of our developer community.

00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:22.033
And so really, for us,

00:27:22.033 --> 00:27:25.667
the real challenge
that we were trying to solve

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:28.400
was how do we bring
all this great wealth

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.767
of community content--

00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:31.968
I call it, sort of,
the community ecosystem--

00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:33.267
how do we bring that all

00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:35.934
directly
into the user experience

00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:38.934
when somebody's actually working
in one of our applications

00:27:38.934 --> 00:27:40.434
and has a problem?

00:27:40.434 --> 00:27:42.267
So how do we, you know--

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:44.734
it's a tremendous
aggregation problem really.

00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:47.300
And at the end of the day,
working with Google--

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.868
um, you know, Search became
a really natural,

00:27:50.868 --> 00:27:54.968
really simple metaphor
for solving that entire problem.

00:27:54.968 --> 00:27:59.634
So we partnered with Google
about a year ago.

00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:02.601
And we use, you know,
a lot of the features

00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:04.767
that we use are the ones
that Nick described.

00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:07.634
So we actually
use the XML results.

00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:10.400
For us, that's incredibly
important because, you know,

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.467
Adobe, you know, the brand
and the experience

00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:14.868
of our products
is very, very important

00:28:14.868 --> 00:28:16.834
to our users,
so being able to maintain

00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:18.300
that consistent
brand experience

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.734
when somebody's working directly
inside Photoshop

00:28:20.734 --> 00:28:23.901
and then taking them to,
you know, a branded experience,

00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:26.567
maintaining that
is incredibly important.

00:28:26.567 --> 00:28:29.467
We also really appreciate
that it was a hosted solution,

00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:32.033
that it wasn't anything
that we were gonna have

00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:34.167
to really, you know,
keep up with,

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:35.501
from a development
perspective.

00:28:35.501 --> 00:28:38.000
Let's let Google do
all the heavy lifting.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.634
Um, and for us, that was--
that was really important.

00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:44.334
So one of the key things
that we did

00:28:44.334 --> 00:28:46.767
with Custom Search
in the CS4 timeframe

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:49.400
was we actually integrated it in
with the products.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.534
So if you open up
Dreamweaver CS4

00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:52.934
or Illustrator CS4
right now,

00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:54.767
you'll find actually
a little search widget

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:57.467
that's embedded
in the application itself.

00:28:57.467 --> 00:28:59.167
Um, and what that search widget
is doing

00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:01.934
is it's going out and sending,
via an API,

00:29:01.934 --> 00:29:03.834
calls for a Custom Search
engine

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:06.968
and bringing those community
results directly back into--

00:29:06.968 --> 00:29:10.367
into that--
into the user experience.

00:29:10.367 --> 00:29:16.634
So right now we have
about 2,400 community URLs

00:29:16.634 --> 00:29:19.434
included in
our Custom Search engine.

00:29:19.434 --> 00:29:23.234
This has been a very successful
service for our customers.

00:29:23.234 --> 00:29:26.367
We're doing some data analysis
on that right now.

00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:30.167
I'm sure Nick and Rajat would be
very curious to see the data,

00:29:30.167 --> 00:29:31.400
and I'll definitely
be sharing it with them

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.067
as soon as possible.

00:29:33.067 --> 00:29:35.901
And, you know, that data's
definitely gonna be influencing

00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:39.100
how we are thinking about
Custom Search going forward.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.834
So right now, as I said,
if you open up

00:29:41.834 --> 00:29:43.767
any creative Suite 4 product,

00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:46.501
if you are a developer working
with Flex or AIR or ColdFusion,

00:29:46.501 --> 00:29:47.934
uh, you'll come across
some of

00:29:47.934 --> 00:29:50.033
these Community Help
search results.

00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:52.801
So I'm gonna invite up Joel
Brandt, who's gonna tell you

00:29:52.801 --> 00:29:54.234
about some
of the exciting things

00:29:54.234 --> 00:29:55.868
that his team's
been working on

00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:58.067
and some of the success
that they've been building upon

00:29:58.067 --> 00:29:59.634
with the Custom Search
engine.

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:04.701
Brandt: Thanks, Mark.

00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:07.100
Uh, so I'm Joel Brandt,
I'm a researcher at Adobe

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.667
and also a PhD candidate
at Stanford.

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:12.434
And I want to talk briefly about
another tool we're building

00:30:12.434 --> 00:30:13.701
called Blueprint.

00:30:13.701 --> 00:30:15.634
And if you like
what you see in this talk,

00:30:15.634 --> 00:30:17.534
you can come visit us
at the Developer Sandbox

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:19.100
and take it for a spin.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.334
So the work we're doing
right now is motivated

00:30:22.334 --> 00:30:23.968
by a really simple
observation.

00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:25.133
Programmers use the Web.

00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:28.467
A lot.

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:30.000
In fact,
we ran a recent study,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.701
and in this study we were
looking at how people learn

00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:33.968
to use new libraries.

00:30:33.968 --> 00:30:36.300
In that study,
over 33% of the code

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.601
these people produced
over several months

00:30:38.601 --> 00:30:40.767
was produced--
was lines of code

00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:42.767
that were taken from the Web
and modified.

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:45.167
So what's really crazy
about that

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:47.601
is that, despite the fact
that programming languages

00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:50.701
are designed to be read
by computers

00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:53.367
and our development tools
don't know anything

00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:55.968
about the fact that,
you know,

00:30:55.968 --> 00:30:57.834
we're using the Web to produce
this code.

00:30:57.834 --> 00:30:59.434
And our Web browsers
and search engines

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:01.567
don't know anything about the
rest of the code we've written.

00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:03.100
Our editor simply thinks
we're typing

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.767
everything we write.

00:31:04.767 --> 00:31:08.434
So our idea was can we leverage
Google Custom Search

00:31:08.434 --> 00:31:11.400
to bring search inside
the development environment?

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.100
So Blueprint is a tool
that explores this idea.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.434
And let me give you
a quick demo of that,

00:31:16.434 --> 00:31:18.334
and then we can talk
about how it works.

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:21.767
So in Blueprint--
Blueprint is built as a plug-in

00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:24.133
for Adobe's Flex Builder, which
is a development environment

00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:27.234
for Flex and Flash
applications.

00:31:27.234 --> 00:31:29.367
A lot of times,
programmers are in situations

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:31.968
where, here they have some code
that they want to visualize.

00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:33.634
In this case, they want
to put it in a chart.

00:31:33.634 --> 00:31:35.534
And creating a chart's
very easy to do,

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:37.000
but it takes about 20 lines
of code,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.033
and it's probably not code
you can write from scratch.

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:42.601
So it'd be great
if you could initiate a search

00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.000
for example code
that would help you learn

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.601
how to do that right from
your development environment.

00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:48.601
In fact, that's
what Blueprint allows you to do.

00:31:48.601 --> 00:31:51.567
You can hit a quick hot key
to bring up a search box

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:53.267
that's sort of
like AutoComplete.

00:31:53.267 --> 00:31:54.901
You can type natural language
into this,

00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:57.067
something like barchart,
and that presents you

00:31:57.067 --> 00:31:59.400
with results that present
example code first.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.200
So this is an example of us
customizing the search results.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.067
Here we present the example code
immediately,

00:32:05.067 --> 00:32:07.334
and you can scroll through this
to see running examples

00:32:07.334 --> 00:32:08.567
of that code.

00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:11.300
Once you select some code
you like,

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.501
uh, perhaps after performing
another search,

00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:16.534
you can immediately put
that code

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.734
into your development
environment.

00:32:18.734 --> 00:32:20.334
A few modifications
of that code

00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:22.868
and very quickly you have
something up and running.

00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:24.801
So how is Blueprint built?

00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:25.934
As I mentioned,
we're leveraging

00:32:25.934 --> 00:32:29.133
the Google Custom Search
suite of tools.

00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:31.033
But in order
to do that custom work

00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:33.501
of presenting examples
themselves

00:32:33.501 --> 00:32:35.501
rather than the entirety
of the web pages,

00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:37.968
we have to build on top
of Google Custom Search.

00:32:37.968 --> 00:32:38.968
So there's three components

00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:41.033
in what you saw here today.

00:32:41.033 --> 00:32:42.334
There's the Blueprint client,

00:32:42.334 --> 00:32:44.234
which is what lives
inside Flex Builder.

00:32:44.234 --> 00:32:45.501
There's the Blueprint server,

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:47.033
which sits
on Adobe's infrastructure.

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:49.467
It sits on top of the Google
Custom Search engine.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.667
When a user makes a query,

00:32:51.667 --> 00:32:53.334
we gather contextual
information

00:32:53.334 --> 00:32:54.701
from their programming
environment,

00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:56.934
so the versions of frameworks
they're using,

00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:59.234
things that are in scope
and so forth,

00:32:59.234 --> 00:33:00.634
and send that along
with the query.

00:33:00.634 --> 00:33:02.067
Our server uses
that information

00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:04.167
to augment the query
and produce a better query

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:05.434
to send off to Google.

00:33:05.434 --> 00:33:07.567
We then send that search
off to Google

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:09.801
and get back a set of results.

00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:11.300
We parse these pages

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.701
that come back to Google
for the actual examples

00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:15.067
in running code.

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:17.567
And then we send those back
to the user.

00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:19.868
So this is all well and good.

00:33:19.868 --> 00:33:21.167
Now you know how it works.

00:33:21.167 --> 00:33:23.501
But is this actually effective?

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.000
So we ran a laboratory study

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.567
to get at answering
this question,

00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:28.534
see if we were really benefiting
by sitting on top

00:33:28.534 --> 00:33:30.000
of Google Custom Search
results

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.567
and providing this tool
to users.

00:33:33.567 --> 00:33:36.000
So first we found
that participants found code

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.701
twice as fast,
which is a big step

00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:39.300
in producing the code quickly.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.000
In fact, if you look at the
ranking of all 20 participants,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.567
you see that the majority
of those,

00:33:43.567 --> 00:33:45.901
here presented in blue boxes,
that were using Blueprint

00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:48.868
fell toward the fast end
of the spectrum.

00:33:48.868 --> 00:33:51.501
But even more importantly
than writing the code quickly,

00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:55.267
they wrote significantly
better code.

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:57.734
And this is even more
striking.

00:33:57.734 --> 00:34:00.634
You see almost all of the people
who used Blueprint

00:34:00.634 --> 00:34:04.601
were on the side where
they produced the best code.

00:34:04.601 --> 00:34:06.234
We think this is probably
because we are able

00:34:06.234 --> 00:34:08.601
to present the search results
in a very customized manner

00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:10.234
that helps evaluate code
quickly.

00:34:10.234 --> 00:34:12.868
So in one of the tasks,
the best results didn't have

00:34:12.868 --> 00:34:15.067
a very good standard
Google results snippet,

00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:16.734
and so they normally wouldn't
click on that page,

00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:19.200
but because we were extracting
the code specifically

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.667
and they were to evaluate
that code

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.000
rather than the English
on the page,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.100
they were able to select
a great example

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.067
and get a really good result.

00:34:27.067 --> 00:34:29.400
So we just launched Blueprint
as a plug-in

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.567
that you can download for free
at labs.adobe.com today.

00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:34.133
So I'd love it if you could
all take a look at that

00:34:34.133 --> 00:34:35.634
if you do Flex development.

00:34:35.634 --> 00:34:37.400
And with that, I'll pass things
back to Nick to complete.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.334
Thanks a lot.

00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:43.601
[applause]

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:48.200
Weininger: Thank you, Mark.
Thank you, Joel.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.534
Um, I don't have a lot more
to say after that

00:34:50.534 --> 00:34:53.901
other than that's a really great
and innovative use

00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:55.868
of search in a context
where I would never have thought

00:34:55.868 --> 00:34:57.133
it could be used.

00:34:57.133 --> 00:34:59.467
Um, I want to call out
one thing

00:34:59.467 --> 00:35:02.300
that's something you might
think about as developers.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.801
I think the feature
of contextually rewriting

00:35:04.801 --> 00:35:08.801
the query based on what they
know about the user's context,

00:35:08.801 --> 00:35:11.000
that they're searching
within a particular product

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.868
and so forth,
is really powerful.

00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:15.701
We provide a number of hooks
to allow you to do this.

00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:19.367
And I think you should consider,
as search designers,

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.901
the extent to which your users
can benefit from this

00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:25.033
'cause it's a really great thing
to do.

00:35:25.033 --> 00:35:28.200
And Adobe is an example

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.133
of one of
our largest partners,

00:35:30.133 --> 00:35:32.767
but we have a very,
very long list of partners.

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:36.901
In fact, we recently passed--
not so recently any more--

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:41.167
passed quite a while ago
a million registered CSEs.

00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:42.567
And we're still growing fast.

00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:47.234
And we'd love to have
your Custom Searches

00:35:47.234 --> 00:35:49.434
hosted on our platform.

00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:52.000
And so that users
all across the Web

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.334
can get better search.

00:35:53.334 --> 00:35:55.567
So thank you,

00:35:55.567 --> 00:35:58.300
and I'll take questions.

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:04.067
Any questions?

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.200
Yes.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.767
man: So--
[feedback]

00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:07.868
Weininger: Whoo.
man: Wow.

00:36:07.868 --> 00:36:08.868
Weininger: You happen
to be mic'd?

00:36:08.868 --> 00:36:10.033
man: Should still be mic'd.

00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:15.267
So let's say I've got
a set of--

00:36:15.267 --> 00:36:17.067
a website
that I don't want indexed

00:36:17.067 --> 00:36:18.767
in the regular,
standard Google results.

00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:20.100
Weininger: Right.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.868
man: So I have, let's say,
a robots.txt file

00:36:21.868 --> 00:36:23.534
that says, "Don't index this,
Google."

00:36:23.534 --> 00:36:25.033
Is that still something
that I can use

00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:27.100
in Google Custom Search
engines

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.334
or Google Site Search?

00:36:28.334 --> 00:36:31.968
Weininger: So currently
the answer to that is no

00:36:31.968 --> 00:36:36.734
because we--the Custom Search
index follows--

00:36:36.734 --> 00:36:39.868
it follows the same crawling
rules and, well, ultimately,

00:36:39.868 --> 00:36:43.834
mostly, Custom Search index
just is the Google Search index.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.400
We do have some extensions
to it.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.534
As you know,
you can submit site maps

00:36:47.534 --> 00:36:50.968
to be indexed
in a special CSE index n-tier.

00:36:50.968 --> 00:36:53.167
But even that index respects

00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:59.100
the same robots.txt crawling
rules as any other Google crawl.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.234
So--but it's a good question.

00:37:00.234 --> 00:37:02.734
We should think
about whether to do that.

00:37:06.434 --> 00:37:08.667
man: You mentioned something
about AJAX APIs...

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:11.567
Weininger: Mm-hmm.
man: And I didn't see it.

00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:15.834
Weininger: Oh, so the Custom
Search element that I discussed

00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:19.033
is built on
the AJAX Search API,

00:37:19.033 --> 00:37:21.400
and the full power
of the underlying Search API

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.434
is available in that element.

00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:27.501
That's what AJAX refers to.

00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:30.567
man: If I have
a custom content site,

00:37:30.567 --> 00:37:33.767
and it gets crawled by Google
every two or three days...

00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:35.200
Weininger: Sure.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.634
man: And right now I have
my own Custom Search.

00:37:37.634 --> 00:37:40.200
If I want to use your engine,

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.000
can your content somehow be
indexed more frequently?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.267
Or how do you approach that?

00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:50.400
Weininger: Yes, in fact,
we have a feature design

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.400
to help you do just that.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.300
Um, it is called
On-Demand Indexing.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.467
And the way that it works
is you--

00:37:57.467 --> 00:38:00.934
if you've submitted site maps
already to Webmaster Tools,

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:04.000
you can pick one of
those site maps as containing

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.100
your freshest
and highest priority pages.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.000
And you can actually go and
click where there's also an API

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.300
that you can issue a request to
that says index this now.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300
And we will, again, use our
special Custom Search index

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.234
and capabilities to go out
and recrawl those pages

00:38:21.234 --> 00:38:24.267
and index them again
within 24 hours.

00:38:24.267 --> 00:38:26.667
So you can at least get
that increase

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:32.067
in speed and freshness.

00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:34.133
man: So Google keeps almost
everything that's crawled,

00:38:34.133 --> 00:38:36.601
but occasionally we know
that stuff falls out

00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:37.834
of the Google index.

00:38:37.834 --> 00:38:40.400
If we have a CSE,
is there anything that says

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.934
that our content
that's in the CSE

00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:45.067
will be somehow more sticky?

00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:46.767
Weininger: Well, again,
this is what

00:38:46.767 --> 00:38:50.834
our Custom Search-specific
indexing capabilities

00:38:50.834 --> 00:38:52.300
are designed for.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.100
Um, you can submit--
you submit site maps

00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.000
to Webmaster Tools,
and we either can implicitly,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.167
automatically learn that
those site maps are included

00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:05.267
in your CSE, or in
the On-Demand Indexing feature

00:39:05.267 --> 00:39:08.000
I described, you can actually,
explicitly tell us

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.267
this site map is for my CSE.

00:39:10.267 --> 00:39:12.868
And, you know, when we go and do
those on-demand crawls,

00:39:12.868 --> 00:39:16.934
those pages will be,
as you say, sticky.

00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:19.434
man: And you said
for the XML results,

00:39:19.434 --> 00:39:21.501
the price is starting
at $100?

00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:23.467
Weininger: Yes.
man: Um, okay.

00:39:23.467 --> 00:39:24.868
Then what?

00:39:24.868 --> 00:39:26.801
What's the real range?
Weininger: Okay.

00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:30.067
So there are a number
of different pricing tiers

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:34.133
based on two factors.

00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:36.434
Number one is the number
of pages that you want

00:39:36.434 --> 00:39:38.434
to include
in your Custom Search.

00:39:38.434 --> 00:39:41.934
And number two is the number
of queries you want per year.

00:39:41.934 --> 00:39:46.801
I think the, sort of,
online tiers

00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:49.167
go up to about
$2,000 something,

00:39:49.167 --> 00:39:53.434
$2,250 a year, which
gives you up to 100,000 pages

00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:55.634
and a 1/2 million queries
a year.

00:39:55.634 --> 00:39:57.901
Um, the $100-a-year level
gives you,

00:39:57.901 --> 00:40:01.901
I think, 1,000 pages and
a 1/4 million queries a year.

00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:04.300
And if you have needs
for Site Search

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.767
over a really large corpus

00:40:05.767 --> 00:40:08.868
or with
a really high traffic level,

00:40:08.868 --> 00:40:13.534
then you can contact one
of our sales representatives.

00:40:13.534 --> 00:40:15.000
man: I have a question about--

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.467
so I think it's great
that you guys are, like,

00:40:17.467 --> 00:40:19.267
indexing the microformat
stuff.

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:21.634
Is there a way you can search
against that?

00:40:21.634 --> 00:40:24.834
You know, so if you wanted to,
say, put an author,

00:40:24.834 --> 00:40:28.701
you know, as a micro--
you know, as a vCard

00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:30.334
or an hCard, as they call it,
I guess,

00:40:30.334 --> 00:40:31.801
in the microformat scene.

00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:34.133
Is there a way you can sort of
search against that?

00:40:34.133 --> 00:40:36.300
Weininger: You mean to filter
the search

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.601
or to re-rank the search
based on structured data?

00:40:39.601 --> 00:40:41.467
man: Yeah, like, so if I wanted
to, say, you know,

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.033
search a website
full of documents,

00:40:43.033 --> 00:40:46.200
and I just want to search
by author or something.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.267
Weininger:
That's a very good question.

00:40:47.267 --> 00:40:48.400
The answer is "Stay tuned.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.334
We're working on it."

00:41:00.133 --> 00:41:04.467
Um, so actually
our product manager is here

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:07.033
and is more qualified
to speak to that than I am.

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:12.434
Mukherjee: I don't know
about more qualified,

00:41:12.434 --> 00:41:15.067
but I can take a shot at it.

00:41:15.067 --> 00:41:17.267
Uh, so in terms
of terms of service,

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.667
so as I said--
as Nick mentioned,

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.067
there are various offerings.

00:41:21.067 --> 00:41:22.434
There's the online offering

00:41:22.434 --> 00:41:25.300
where you basically
get the vanilla product,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.801
and you're off and running.

00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:29.400
We also announced elements
today,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.434
so that's another kind of
turn-key kind of thing,

00:41:31.434 --> 00:41:33.133
which is you take it and go.

00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:36.367
The terms of service,
they are typically, you know,

00:41:36.367 --> 00:41:38.467
what the online terms
of service are.

00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:42.868
When you license Site Search
or if you're a direct partner

00:41:42.868 --> 00:41:44.467
and, you know,
you're actually driving

00:41:44.467 --> 00:41:45.801
a huge amount of traffic,

00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.133
there are typically special
relationships we have

00:41:48.133 --> 00:41:49.501
with our partners.

00:41:49.501 --> 00:41:51.267
And in some of those cases,

00:41:51.267 --> 00:41:54.934
there are special sort
of agreements that we have

00:41:54.934 --> 00:41:56.167
with those partners.

00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:58.467
At that point,
there's a lot more flexibility.

00:41:58.467 --> 00:42:01.467
So, for example, Site Search
customers like Adobe,

00:42:01.467 --> 00:42:04.868
you know, they have special,
sort of, contracts with--

00:42:04.868 --> 00:42:08.701
with Google, and we have
a lot more, sort of, control.

00:42:08.701 --> 00:42:10.601
In general,
Site Search customers

00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:12.234
have a lot more
branding controls

00:42:12.234 --> 00:42:13.701
because that's one
of the requirements

00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:16.033
of the enterprise, sort of,
offering.

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:21.501
But in general, the online,
sort of, customers go

00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:22.834
with the online terms
of service,

00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:25.234
which we typically don't,
kind of, negotiate

00:42:25.234 --> 00:42:26.934
on a one-by-one basis.

00:42:26.934 --> 00:42:28.133
So does that answer
your question?

00:42:28.133 --> 00:42:30.267
man: Yes, it does.

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:31.400
Mukherjee: Absolutely.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.667
So on the online version,

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:35.067
you need to use
the Custom Search branding,

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:36.634
and there are various options
there as well.

00:42:36.634 --> 00:42:39.133
So you can actually choose
the one that works for you.

00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:41.434
You can still customize it
in terms of look and feel

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.801
and colors and stuff like that
so it doesn't kind of--

00:42:43.801 --> 00:42:46.067
so it matches up
with the rest of your site.

00:42:46.067 --> 00:42:49.534
But you absolutely need to use
the Custom Search branding.

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:53.133
And typically online customers
use ads as well.

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:57.868
So monetization with ads
is on by default.

00:42:57.868 --> 00:43:00.200
And Site Search customers
have the option

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.200
to turn off ads.

00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:12.901
Weininger: Hi.

00:43:12.901 --> 00:43:14.767
man: I was wondering
if you could speak to--

00:43:14.767 --> 00:43:16.701
we'd all love to have
all of our content

00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:18.434
indexed by Google,
but in those cases

00:43:18.434 --> 00:43:20.434
where we can't
or it isn't indexed,

00:43:20.434 --> 00:43:22.067
the search appliance
and the integration

00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:24.033
between Custom Search
and the search appliances,

00:43:24.033 --> 00:43:26.267
if there's any pending,
future thing

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:28.467
where you can have results
coming from the search appliance

00:43:28.467 --> 00:43:31.567
that show up in the Custom
Search results as well?

00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:32.634
Weininger:
That's an interesting--

00:43:32.634 --> 00:43:34.067
that's an interesting
question.

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:37.400
Um, we understand
that, yes,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.901
there are cases
where you don't have

00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:42.067
all of your content indexed
by Google.

00:43:42.067 --> 00:43:44.667
Um, we have,
as I've mentioned

00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:46.701
for a couple
of prior questioners,

00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:50.100
we have these features
based on, you know,

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.367
CSE associations with site maps
and On-Demand Indexing

00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:55.934
designed to improve coverage
of your content

00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:59.400
specifically for customers
of Custom Search engine.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.300
Um, I recommend
that you try those

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.934
and see if they do
what you need.

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:08.767
If even those don't do
what you need,

00:44:08.767 --> 00:44:10.067
please let us know why.

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:14.100
Because we want to make sure
that, wherever possible,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.534
we do manage to get in
all the content

00:44:16.534 --> 00:44:19.567
in any given Custom Search
engine.

00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:22.968
And, as to your specific
question of search appliance

00:44:22.968 --> 00:44:24.467
and Custom Search engine
integration,

00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:26.234
we don't have anything
like that now,

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:28.167
but it's an interesting
possibility.

00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:34.400
Oh, ah, yes.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.601
Rajat has an additional comment
on this.

00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:40.200
Mukherjee: So in terms
of actually getting

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.834
Custom Search results
into your appliance

00:44:42.834 --> 00:44:44.267
in the intranet,

00:44:44.267 --> 00:44:47.334
I think there have been
some widgets

00:44:47.334 --> 00:44:49.167
and federated capabilities
that have been built

00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:51.767
so that if you, for example,
are using the appliance

00:44:51.767 --> 00:44:53.801
in your intranet

00:44:53.801 --> 00:44:55.667
and you also have
a Custom Search engine

00:44:55.667 --> 00:44:57.000
for your website,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.934
you are able to basically pull
those results in

00:44:58.934 --> 00:45:01.033
because they use
the standard XML formats

00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:03.501
that the appliance uses
and honors,

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:05.200
so you can actually
have federation

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.200
where you can actually bring
those external results

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.734
into your intranet.

00:45:08.734 --> 00:45:12.300
But the reverse
is typically not done.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.601
Weininger: Let me get that.

00:45:13.601 --> 00:45:16.467
Thanks--thank Rajat
for the reminder.

00:45:16.467 --> 00:45:19.400
If you're familiar with
the appliance in particular,

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.634
there's this API called
the Enterprise OneBox API

00:45:22.634 --> 00:45:24.133
that allows you to integrate

00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:26.367
many other kinds of content

00:45:26.367 --> 00:45:28.601
into Google Search Appliance
Search results.

00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:30.934
And one of the clients
that you could integrate into

00:45:30.934 --> 00:45:32.667
would be Custom Search
results.

00:45:32.667 --> 00:45:34.434
So you could do
the combination

00:45:34.434 --> 00:45:38.467
that you're looking for
that way.

00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:40.400
Correct.

00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:46.200
Oh, so just to say again,

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.467
there's an API
at the appliance level

00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:51.033
that would allow you
to take

00:45:51.033 --> 00:45:54.834
appliance-rendered search
results and include in those

00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:58.734
results from a hosted-by-Google
Custom Search engine. 

00:45:58.734 --> 00:46:00.367
But we don't have
the capability yet

00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:01.767
to go the other way,

00:46:01.767 --> 00:46:04.200
to have a Custom Search engine's
hosted results

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.133
include results from a GSA.

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:13.100
Other questions?

00:46:16.934 --> 00:46:18.067
Well, okay.

00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:19.367
If there are
no other questions,

00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:21.601
then thank you all very much
for coming.

00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.133
[applause]
