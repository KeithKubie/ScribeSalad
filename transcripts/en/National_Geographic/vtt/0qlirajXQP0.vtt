Karissa:<i> Almost three years ago,
 my life changed.</i>

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.573 line:0%
A powerful EF-5 tornado
ripped through Moore, Oklahoma.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.443 line:0%
Which, tragically killed
twenty people.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.112
<i> That day,
 my friend Dave Holder,</i>

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.280
<i> he's a Meteorologist,</i>

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.782
<i> and he called me about
 forty-five minutes</i>

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.149
<i>after the tornado went in.</i>

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.619
<i> And he had found a
 litter of kittens</i>

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.187
<i> that had been displaced,</i>

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.922
<i> the mom had, sadly,</i>

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.491
<i> been killed by some
flying debris, I believe.</i>

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.661
So, he called me, asking
for some advice on what to do.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.362
So, I'm telling him to,
you know,

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:33.166
get them really warm, if you
can put them against your skin,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.835
please do so, you need to
get them to a vet immediately.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:40.039
Unfortunately, the next day,
three of those kittens,

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.040
passed away.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.944
Dave, however, thankfully,
adopted one of the kittens.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.113
<i> And then Shanda,
 another friend of mine,</i>

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.715
<i> she adopted the
 other kitten.</i>

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:53.919
<i>That day the tornado inspired
me to go down a new path.</i>

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:57.056
<i> I decided that I wanted
 to help reunite families</i>

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:00.460
<i>with their pets and that has
been my mission ever since.</i>

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.895
Within a few weeks of
that mega storm,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.899
I had registered my
not-for-profit organization:

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.034
Never Stop Saving.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.871 line:0%
<i>Chasing tornados introduced
me to many great meteorologists,</i>

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.506 line:0%
<i> other storm chasers,</i>

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.175 line:0%
<i> and just a really
great community of people,</i>

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.245 line:0%
<i>where we could share stories,
kind of be nerds together,</i>

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.049 line:0%
<i>and really just share our
 love and crazy obsession</i>

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.052
<i> for extreme weather and
the beauty of the natural world.</i>

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.721
<i> Around that same time,
a film production company,</i>

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.823
<i> called BCII had heard
 about us,</i>

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.792
<i> and they asked if
 they could come out</i>

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.961
<i> and film a short clip
 of us.</i>

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.662
<i> So I said:
 "Sure, why not?"</i>

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.097
<i> We're already going to
 be out there.</i>

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.800
<i> So they came out,
and they started filming,</i>

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.468
<i> and it was actually
 perfect timing,</i>

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.336
<i> because they
 were able to</i>

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.972
<i> film our team as
 we bonded,</i>

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:49.309
actually, here is a clip
of our team members

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.044
in action as--

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:54.179
on our first deployment as
"Animal Storm Squad".

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.084
Narrator:
<i>They arrived thirty miles
outside of the fire's perimeter.</i>

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:00.519 line:0%
Could be if the animals
that are still alive,

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.155 line:0%
they may have gone to the
safer ground.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.758
<i>We did hear yesterday some
firefighters and other people,</i>

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.026
<i>there were some touch-and-go
 moments where</i>

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:07.994
<i> they almost got trapped.</i>

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.762
Erik: They have no cell data
up there right now.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.764
So we need to make sure
we know where that fire's at.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.967 line:0%
Winds in a fire drive the fire,
it's like the engine.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.905
<i>The winds will fan the flames,
so as the wind blows higher,</i>

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.406
<i>your fire's moving faster,</i>

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.774
<i> making it more and
 more dangerous.</i>

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.208
We're here in Wenatchee
right now,

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:26.078
we know there's a fire
break up here,

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.314
<i> so we want to try to
get into the town of Pateros</i>

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.915
<i> or the town of Brewster.</i>

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.452
Narrator:<i> Disasters are by
 definition unique.</i>

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:36.656
<i>Survival and success come
 down to being prepared.</i>
