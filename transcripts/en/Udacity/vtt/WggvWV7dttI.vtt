00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.260
I'm here with Tairi Delgado, who's
one of the course managers here at.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.060
They're the ones who really work one
on one with students to help them

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.070
through projects or
help them understand material.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.410
I thank you so much for
talking to me today.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for inviting me.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.000
&gt;&gt; So
the first thing I wanted to ask you was,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.560
many people have this conception that
online education is very impersonal.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.771
&gt;&gt; Because we're kind of taking
the synchronous in person

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:20.920
communication out of it.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.240
Do you think online education
generally is that impersonal?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.090
&gt;&gt; I think it really is
what you make out of it.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.640
Personally for me, knowing how a lot
of students interact with each other.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.580
I see students connect with each other
through chat, Facebook, LinkedIn.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.900
Getting together in groups.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.460
And I think that kind
of level of interaction

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
It doesn't have to be impersonal,
it could be something very rewarding.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.310
You can meet somebody from Dubai or
Mexico or China,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.130
somebody that you would never
have a chance to meet before.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.690
And instantly you could have
a connection with something that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.710
you both have a mutual passion for.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.033
When I look at online education,
I think in many ways It

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.820
could be a way to learn things
more in a personal way.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.400
Because, at least my experience
when I was in college was that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.660
you would sit in a classroom with 200,
300 people and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.520
it's very hard to talk to your
professor and get one-on-one advice.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.270
I found the most personal experience
you can possibly ever have is a small

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.020
group of people that were your friends
that were taking classes together.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.890
You could really get the chance
to work on the problems

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.730
are really collaborate with each other.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.190
The next best experience I had was, you
know very few times but you know, when

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.886
you had a one on one tutor who really
understood what you were struggling with

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:48.160
and knew the material very well, and
knew how to personalize things for you.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.010
I think online education has
a benefit of doing both.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.490
Because when you're going to these
classes you have the opportunity to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.380
practice on these quizzes at your own
pace, and when you put in your answer,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950
it's not like somebody's just
marking whether it's right or wrong.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.570
They're actually trying to tell you
specific feedback about what's wrong and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.900
how to actually fix it.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.080
And, you get immediate feedback
to work on and practice it more.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.720
And I think with the ability of getting
groups of people to study together,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.640
I think you don't usually have
that in all, like, settings.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920
So it's, to be able to have that,
I think,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.185
you know,
can make online education really great.

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:31.150
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
So it sounds like you're saying that,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.300
and correct me if I'm wrong,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.690
that there's certain ways that we can do
things online that not only break that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290
impersonal nature that people think
when they think of online education.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.960
But in many ways make it even actually
more personable because you've

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.490
got people talking over the Internet so
they can be available all the time.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.050
They can leave messages and
come back to them later, and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.090
as a result it's not bottled into
this one hour of lecture time, when

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.900
we're have a great discussion but now
class is over and we have to move on.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.877
Or you know press has one hour for
office hours a week and

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.817
you could go to talk to him then, but

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:05.766
can't ever interact with them on
a regular basis, it sounds like we're

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:10.129
really building in a way to interact
consistently throughout the experience.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.369
&gt;&gt; Right, actually I'll take
it even one step further.

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:16.863
I think the traditional model is, like
you would go talk to your teacher to get

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.350
all of the knowledge that you want.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.920
But I think in this age, where we're
constantly learning new things,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.860
and revitalizing our skill sets,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.030
sometimes you just need to
be able to learn new things.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.870
And also facilitate

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.130
collaboration with a group of small
people that you would be working with.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.460
So I think this model has changed
more from a teacher directed model of

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.920
presenting lectures, more towards this
online content that you can learn.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.060
And then if something
doesn't quite make sense,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.280
you have a group of people that
are willing to support you because

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.440
they're trying to
accomplish the same thing.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.230
I think that is a powerful motivator,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.490
having a group of people that you could
interact with and help each other out.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.010
Whereas, instead of always
going to the teacher,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.740
you have a lot more
resources to connect with.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.790
I think that's especially
the case in our OMS program, and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.040
as well as some of the NST nano-degrees.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.660
That because they're so flexible,
because they're so open, and because

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.860
they're so cost effective, we attract
people we wouldn't attract otherwise.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.050
And so, some of the classes
I've worked on in the past,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.620
we've had experiences where someone in
the class is already an expert in their

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.520
field in something we're talking about,
and we can basically say, you know,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.360
you don't really need to
listen to us about this.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.540
You've got so-and-so over there,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.960
she's working on a world
class project in robotics.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.190
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And she knows far more about

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.300
this than we do.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.260
And she would never take years off of
her career to go get a Masters degree,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.970
but if she can do it flexibly like this,
she comes and does this, and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.680
then she in turn builds
the class up even more.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680
Because having her there as a resource,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.410
even if she's just a student in the
class, is incredible for everybody,so.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the fact that you bring that
up actually cause, we constantly,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.450
at least I know for myself like,
even though like I've

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.160
gone through the content I know it
pretty well, there's times when

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.950
you're interacting with students you
realize that there's more to learn.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.780
And, like you said, every student
brings their own perspective.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.920
And I think, on top of that, when
we're talking about these study groups

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.800
is that, what we tend to
find is that when students

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.270
explain things to other students they
tend to learn content even better.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.720
So I think that's one of
the actual benefits that normal

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.520
classroom settings don't
really account for.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.780
It's like having a lot of time for
students to help each other out.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.130
Because in the end that's going to be
what's going to drive them the most.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, having that classroom
that's kind of available 24/7 even

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.220
though you don't want students to think
they're expected to be there 24/7.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.620
Having it always available
kind of means that

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.520
things that we usually have to put
into the set aside time for lectures,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
can now just happen organically
over a much longer period of time.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.070
But the conception that online education
is very impersonal doesn't come

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.880
from nowhere.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.310
It came from some courses that are done
in a model that makes it very difficult

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.580
to feel like you're connected.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.510
So, in theory, we have some students
who are taking this class who

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.450
will go on to be instructors for online
classes, or who will go on to be TAs for

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.790
other classes at the OMS.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.530
What would you recommend to them for
when there are teaching

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.710
classes in the future, making sure
to foster the kind of class that

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.010
could develop this community,
this communication between students?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.270
&gt;&gt; Right.
I think that's a really good question.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.770
So I would take a look at what kind of
environment you're trying to set up, and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.570
what incentives that gives.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.240
So, case in point,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.230
I remember when I was back in college, a
lot of times it was greater on a curve.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.230
And so one thing that we noticed
is that a lot of the classes that

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.290
were graded on curves didn't really
a foster a lot of sense of community,

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.060
because students felt that they
competed with each other rather than

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.850
wanting to help each other out.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.460
But in the end it kind of drew back
the ability to learn in general.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.180
Like, I felt like, because you're so
focused on competitive scoring,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.990
you're not willing to take the time
to really learn from somebody else.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.940
And you also want to take a look
into like what motivate students,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.120
like why are they in
the classroom in the first place,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.250
like what what passions they have that
are driving them to take these classes?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.070
Some things that I found when I was
going to classes was that incentivizing,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.980
collaboration with small groups.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.850
Getting students to,
from the very beginning, have

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.270
a voice about who they are and why they
are interested in taking this class.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.920
Being able to connect with other people,
so

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.640
they can find mutual people in
the class they want to interact with.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.530
And then from there help them setup
some kind of guiding rules that will

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.545
allow them throughout the course
to work with each other.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:47.433
Ohter things that I've noticed is that
you know when professors allowed or

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:53.690
instructors allowed opportunity for
students to kind of play around and

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.150
venture on their own a little bit, to
really learn the material on their own.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.510
Really helps a lot for me at least
because you're going to want to

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.435
prescribe a lot of quizzes or
homework assignments, and

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:13.390
I think in many ways when I had classes

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.710
that I didn't have to, every week submit
like a homework assignment, but rather,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.610
take the time to really focus
on the problem sets and

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.820
quizzes and concepts that I felt
that I really needed to study with.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.770
And then studied with my group, well,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.410
people from my study groups
allowed me really to thrive.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:37.580
I think sometimes homework
could be more, at times,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.830
it feels sometimes like you might be
just doing more work than actually

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.930
learning quality material that you
feel like you really need to focus on.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.850
Homework, I felt, was something that
you were supposed to practice on, but

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.630
in the end it was something
that you were graded for.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.710
So, like, a lot of times,
it didn't really

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.260
Incentivize people to just play around
and just kind of explore a little bit.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.340
I mean, obviously,

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.510
you can't expect somebody to know
something the first time around.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:08.020
Like, what is it to do a linear
regression or maybe how to add a whole

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.170
bunch of variables together if you're
learning algebra for the first time.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.550
Sometimes you just need
to practice that and

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.770
sometimes students are going to
know what they should focus on.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.485
As long as you give them ideas of
how to be self-sufficient learners.

00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:25.630
So, the last component I would make
is that, if you really want to set up

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.090
a good learning environment, it's not
only just collaboration and incentives.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.240
But also, how to help students
learn to be self-directed learners.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.240
Like what are the main
ways that people learn,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.760
and what kind of incentives
perform habit over time that

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.700
students will want to develop so
that they can always learn new concepts?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.280
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like, really,
what we need to do is make sure we're

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.980
leaving room for
students to collaborate.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.110
We're leaving room for
students to learn from failure.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.550
And we're leaving room for
students to learn how to learn.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.350
And those are all things I
think are very real to the way

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.550
we learn in the real world.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.700
They don't often, or don't always
make it into the classroom where we

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.630
have a very artificial
learning environment.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.050
But generally it's very
important to look at how people

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.980
learn naturally when they're not
in the classroom environment.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.070
Their not given homework, or quizzes,
or tests, or anything like that.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.670
But they're just out there learning
from their experiences and

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.700
trying to facilitate the same kind
of learning in the classroom.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So thank you so

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.650
much for chatting with me today and
for your insights.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you David for inviting me.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.
And thank y'all.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
