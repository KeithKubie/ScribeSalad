00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.800
I think it is
devastating to the image

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.166
of this city and especially
to our police department.

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.000
JOHN MACK: It's very
apparent that some--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.100
not all, but some--
of those officers

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.667
are clearly out of control.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.967
And they have to ultimately
be willing to take

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:16.033
a good, hard look at the
leadership of the department.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.367
CROWD: [inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:18.934
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:20.300
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.867
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:23.233
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.800
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.934
[inaudible] gotta go!

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:30.133
ZEV YAROSLAVSKY: Mr.
President, all of us, I think,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.400
have been stunned by
what has happened.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.567
And I can't imagine that
the chief or anybody else

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.767
in the city would
condone the kind

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.233
of conversation that
took place-- both

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.700
electronically and by voice--

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.667
in that Foothill
division that night.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.200
Blacks are not animals.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.266
They're not lizards.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.667
They're not apes.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:57.667
They're not gorillas
anymore than any of us are.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.300
They're human beings.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.166
The first way to open
the door to brutalizing

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.066
people in any
place is to cheapen

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.200
their worth as human beings.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.867
And when I read the transcripts
of the conversation,

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:12.400
I was appalled.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.500
But the ability to freely
converse in racist terminology

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.734
suggests a level of tolerance
for that kind of discussion

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.533
that--

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.166
that is unacceptable by
any standard of decency.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.667
Well, first of all,
this is a department

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.734
that this council has
supported over and over again.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.867
This is a police department
that has supported you--

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.233
each of you.

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:37.834
And I just tell you this--

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.700
if you don't speak out on behalf
of the men and women of the Los

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.367
Angeles Police Department
that has served

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.934
the people of this city well--

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:49.000
if you don't do that at this
crucial moment in our history,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.300
then I'm gonna tell you you're
gonna have a police department

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.834
that is not going to be
the kind of department

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:57.000
that you want, the kind of
department the people deserve.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.166
JUDGE: Mr. Woo.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.800
MICHAEL WOO: Thank you.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.367
I want to know-- did you
mean that as a threat?

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.633
In other words, that if--

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.567
if I or other members
of the council

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.433
are going to be criticizing
you or the department,

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.800
are you saying that
you will withhold

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.266
support of these services to
fight crime in our districts?

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.100
That is the most
insulting thing

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.767
I have heard on
this council floor

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.900
in all the time I've been
here, and I've been here a lot

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.233
longer than you've been alive.

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:29.233
Absolutely not.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.900
This is a professional
organization.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.633
What do you think we are?

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:33.734
