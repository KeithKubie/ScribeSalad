yeah so there's this interesting

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:01.820
yeah so there's this interesting
 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.419
yeah so there's this interesting
phenomena that is very characteristic of

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429
phenomena that is very characteristic of
 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.650
phenomena that is very characteristic of
societies I believe pretty much

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
societies I believe pretty much
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.220
societies I believe pretty much
everywhere it's being studied now you

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
everywhere it's being studied now you
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959
everywhere it's being studied now you
can calculate an index called the Gini

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
can calculate an index called the Gini
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.599
can calculate an index called the Gini
coefficient and the Gini coefficient is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
coefficient and the Gini coefficient is
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.910
coefficient and the Gini coefficient is
a number that represents how much

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
a number that represents how much
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370
a number that represents how much
inequality of income distribution there

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380
inequality of income distribution there
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.620
inequality of income distribution there
is in a given geographical area so you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
is in a given geographical area so you
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900
is in a given geographical area so you
could calculate a Gini coefficient for a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
could calculate a Gini coefficient for a
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.380
could calculate a Gini coefficient for a
street or you know an area in the city

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
street or you know an area in the city
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.389
street or you know an area in the city
or a city or a state or a country you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
or a city or a state or a country you
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.840
or a city or a state or a country you
can do it at all those levels and what

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
can do it at all those levels and what
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940
can do it at all those levels and what
you find is you know you owns here this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
you find is you know you owns here this
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610
you find is you know you owns here this
idea that poverty causes crime that's a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
idea that poverty causes crime that's a
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490
idea that poverty causes crime that's a
classic left-wing idea but it's wrong

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
classic left-wing idea but it's wrong
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.799
classic left-wing idea but it's wrong
it's seriously wrong and it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
it's seriously wrong and it's
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.130
it's seriously wrong and it's
importantly wrong and it's definitively

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
importantly wrong and it's definitively
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470
importantly wrong and it's definitively
wrong not only that so there's no

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
wrong not only that so there's no
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150
wrong not only that so there's no
argument about this it's already been

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
argument about this it's already been
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.900
argument about this it's already been
established

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
established
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090
established
what causes crime especially aggressive

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
what causes crime especially aggressive
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.029
what causes crime especially aggressive
crime is relative poverty and relative

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
crime is relative poverty and relative
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040
crime is relative poverty and relative
poverty is not the same thing as poverty

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
poverty is not the same thing as poverty
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.170
poverty is not the same thing as poverty
at all it's seriously not the same thing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
at all it's seriously not the same thing
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850
at all it's seriously not the same thing
poverty is when you don't have enough to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
poverty is when you don't have enough to
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890
poverty is when you don't have enough to
eat relative poverty is when the guy

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
eat relative poverty is when the guy
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.830
eat relative poverty is when the guy
next door has a much better car than you

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840
next door has a much better car than you
 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.260
next door has a much better car than you
so and there's lots of relative poverty

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
so and there's lots of relative poverty
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.760
so and there's lots of relative poverty
in the United States and there's some

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
in the United States and there's some
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.070
in the United States and there's some
absolute poverty but even the absolute

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
absolute poverty but even the absolute
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870
absolute poverty but even the absolute
poverty in the United States is nothing

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
poverty in the United States is nothing
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730
poverty in the United States is nothing
like the absolute poverty say in places

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
like the absolute poverty say in places
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980
like the absolute poverty say in places
like India or in sub-saharan Africa

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
like India or in sub-saharan Africa
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929
like India or in sub-saharan Africa
where absolute poverty means you have

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
where absolute poverty means you have
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940
where absolute poverty means you have
nothing now what's really interesting

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
nothing now what's really interesting
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.899
nothing now what's really interesting
about the Gini coefficient is that if

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
about the Gini coefficient is that if
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270
about the Gini coefficient is that if
you go to places where everyone roughly

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
you go to places where everyone roughly
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.749
you go to places where everyone roughly
speaking is it poor say by national

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
speaking is it poor say by national
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.270
speaking is it poor say by national
standards right I think South Dakota was

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
standards right I think South Dakota was
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399
standards right I think South Dakota was
often used as an example or maybe one of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
often used as an example or maybe one of
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.340
often used as an example or maybe one of
the Maritime Provinces like Newfoundland

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
the Maritime Provinces like Newfoundland
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.560
the Maritime Provinces like Newfoundland
where there's where there's low average

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
where there's where there's low average
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.380
where there's where there's low average
income but it's pretty flat distribution

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390
income but it's pretty flat distribution
 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.990
income but it's pretty flat distribution
there's almost no crime and if you go to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
there's almost no crime and if you go to
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.039
there's almost no crime and if you go to
places where the everyone's rich then

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
places where the everyone's rich then
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359
places where the everyone's rich then
there's almost no crime but if you go

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
there's almost no crime but if you go
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.230
there's almost no crime but if you go
places where there are poor people and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240
places where there are poor people and
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.639
places where there are poor people and
moderately well-off people and rich

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
moderately well-off people and rich
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.190
moderately well-off people and rich
people and the distribution is really

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
people and the distribution is really
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770
people and the distribution is really
steep then the rate of aggressive

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
steep then the rate of aggressive
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660
steep then the rate of aggressive
behavior among young men and it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
behavior among young men and it's
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490
behavior among young men and it's
usually within their own ethnic group

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
usually within their own ethnic group
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170
usually within their own ethnic group
starts to suck sky

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
starts to suck sky
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.449
starts to suck sky
out of control and the reason for that

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459
out of control and the reason for that
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.030
out of control and the reason for that
seems to be that if the dominant

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
seems to be that if the dominant
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860
seems to be that if the dominant
hierarchy is too steep then the young

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
hierarchy is too steep then the young
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.099
hierarchy is too steep then the young
men have no likelihood of climbing to a

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109
men have no likelihood of climbing to a
 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.349
men have no likelihood of climbing to a
dominant position while playing the

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359
dominant position while playing the
 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.720
dominant position while playing the
standard social game and so what they do

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
standard social game and so what they do
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330
standard social game and so what they do
is turn to aggression aggression to to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
is turn to aggression aggression to to
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280
is turn to aggression aggression to to
make their mark on the world and it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
make their mark on the world and it
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.030
make their mark on the world and it
works too

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
works too
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.649
works too
that's the other thing is that make no

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659
that's the other thing is that make no
 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.240
that's the other thing is that make no
mistake about it if you're if you're

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
mistake about it if you're if you're
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.979
mistake about it if you're if you're
looking for status in a place where

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
looking for status in a place where
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.990
looking for status in a place where
status is hard to achieve and you're the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
status is hard to achieve and you're the
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.619
status is hard to achieve and you're the
meanest toughest guy around then and you

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629
meanest toughest guy around then and you
 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.210
meanest toughest guy around then and you
know around a bunch of people who like

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
know around a bunch of people who like
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920
know around a bunch of people who like
you don't have much money then you're

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
you don't have much money then you're
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.839
you don't have much money then you're
going to benefit from that status it

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849
going to benefit from that status it
 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.050
going to benefit from that status it
works yeah

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
works yeah
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.020
works yeah
because the parvis reason why we know

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
because the parvis reason why we know
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.849
because the parvis reason why we know
the attitude violent crime rate in the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
the attitude violent crime rate in the
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.069
the attitude violent crime rate in the
u.s. is higher than it is in Canada we

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079
u.s. is higher than it is in Canada we
 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.740
u.s. is higher than it is in Canada we
got big part of the reason sure sure

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
got big part of the reason sure sure
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.240
got big part of the reason sure sure
yeah I mean you can make a real

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
yeah I mean you can make a real
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.979
yeah I mean you can make a real
conservative argument for making sure

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989
conservative argument for making sure
 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.289
conservative argument for making sure
that you know the Conservatives are very

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
that you know the Conservatives are very
 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.899
that you know the Conservatives are very
anti income distribution and we figure

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909
anti income distribution and we figure
 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.250
anti income distribution and we figure
that's because of the guys that have

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
that's because of the guys that have
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.229
that's because of the guys that have
this male independence you know they

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239
this male independence you know they
 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.940
this male independence you know they
identify with this male independence

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
identify with this male independence
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.409
identify with this male independence
factor they don't want to be

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419
factor they don't want to be
 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.180
factor they don't want to be
distributing resources to people who are

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190
distributing resources to people who are
 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.039
distributing resources to people who are
down the dolmen turkey because they want

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049
down the dolmen turkey because they want
 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.629
down the dolmen turkey because they want
they want them down in the dorm inner

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639
they want them down in the dorm inner
 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.800
they want them down in the dorm inner
turkey they want there to be a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
turkey they want there to be a
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.080
turkey they want there to be a
difference between the people on top and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
difference between the people on top and
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.759
difference between the people on top and
the people on the bottom so that they

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769
the people on the bottom so that they
 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.589
the people on the bottom so that they
can be the people on top so that it

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
can be the people on top so that it
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.879
can be the people on top so that it
increases their relative attractiveness

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889
increases their relative attractiveness
 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.969

that men are aggressive you can say that

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289
that men are aggressive you can say that
 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:43.779
that men are aggressive you can say that
on average men are more aggressive than

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789
on average men are more aggressive than
 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.959
on average men are more aggressive than
women and you can also say that if that

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:46.969
women and you can also say that if that
 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.450
women and you can also say that if that
if you put men in a situation where they

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460
if you put men in a situation where they
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.300
if you put men in a situation where they

establishing dominance and then you can
say that that's the reason for that is

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669
say that that's the reason for that is
 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:05.730
say that that's the reason for that is

what the fundamental reason yeah oh yeah
bring that on foul I read this article

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240
bring that on foul I read this article
 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.839
bring that on foul I read this article
once about the hollow of women society

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849
once about the hollow of women society
 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.059
once about the hollow of women society
no more volatile yeah absolutely

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:16.069
no more volatile yeah absolutely
 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:19.719
no more volatile yeah absolutely
just a week they live with one guy how

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729
just a week they live with one guy how
 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.450
just a week they live with one guy how
do I fit into the conversation

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460
do I fit into the conversation
 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.550
do I fit into the conversation
that's right do i versus them yeah

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560
that's right do i versus them yeah
 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.459
that's right do i versus them yeah
that's exactly right that evolutionary

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469
that's exactly right that evolutionary
 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.439
that's exactly right that evolutionary
psychology explanation for the pathology

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449
psychology explanation for the pathology
 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.450
psychology explanation for the pathology
of polygamy is that if once you let it

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460
of polygamy is that if once you let it
 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.950
of polygamy is that if once you let it
establish itself then the men get

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960
establish itself then the men get
 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.790
establish itself then the men get
ultraviolent

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800
ultraviolent
 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.529
ultraviolent
so would you say that

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:38.539
 
 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.929
 
many people have said that and yes I

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:41.939
many people have said that and yes I
 

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:43.159
many people have said that and yes I
think you can make a strong case for

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169
think you can make a strong case for
 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:45.049
think you can make a strong case for
that and I think the fundamental reason

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:45.059
that and I think the fundamental reason
 

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.089
that and I think the fundamental reason
is the one that you just pointed out you

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099
is the one that you just pointed out you
 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.790
is the one that you just pointed out you
know the idea is well would you rather

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800
know the idea is well would you rather
 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.510
know the idea is well would you rather
have one woman or die you know or sorry

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520
have one woman or die you know or sorry
 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.709
have one woman or die you know or sorry
that's not quite right would you rather

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:57.719
that's not quite right would you rather
 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:59.390
that's not quite right would you rather
no that's not quite that's not quite

00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400
no that's not quite that's not quite
 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.249
no that's not quite that's not quite
right would you it's more like would you

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259
right would you it's more like would you
 

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:02.959
right would you it's more like would you
be willing to limit yourself to one

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:02.969
be willing to limit yourself to one
 

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:06.679
be willing to limit yourself to one
partner or have a shot at many partners

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:06.689
partner or have a shot at many partners
 

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:08.529
partner or have a shot at many partners
but a much higher probability of dying

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:08.539
but a much higher probability of dying
 

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:11.719
but a much higher probability of dying
Yeah right and you know some guys will

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:11.729
Yeah right and you know some guys will
 

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:13.999
Yeah right and you know some guys will
take that they'll take that the high

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:14.009
take that they'll take that the high
 

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.179
take that they'll take that the high
risk approach you know so now it just

00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:17.189
risk approach you know so now it just
 

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.029
risk approach you know so now it just
doesn't eliminate the difference in

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039
doesn't eliminate the difference in
 

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.619
doesn't eliminate the difference in
individual differences in determining

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:21.629
individual differences in determining
 

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:22.790
individual differences in determining
who's going to be aggressive because

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800
who's going to be aggressive because
 

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.010
who's going to be aggressive because
what will happen is that as the Gini

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020
what will happen is that as the Gini
 

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.369
what will happen is that as the Gini
coefficient pressure rises the more

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379
coefficient pressure rises the more
 

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:30.079
coefficient pressure rises the more
aggressive men the men who are more

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:30.089
aggressive men the men who are more
 

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:31.730
aggressive men the men who are more
aggressive by nature will get more

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740
aggressive by nature will get more
 

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.069
aggressive by nature will get more
aggressive first right so you can

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:34.079
aggressive first right so you can
 

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:35.810
aggressive first right so you can
imagine it's a threshold phenomena to

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820
imagine it's a threshold phenomena to
 

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.600
imagine it's a threshold phenomena to
some sense so and what I should tell you

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.610
some sense so and what I should tell you
 

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.250
some sense so and what I should tell you
as well is the relationship between the

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260
as well is the relationship between the
 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.920
as well is the relationship between the
Gini coefficient and male-on-male on the

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:42.930
Gini coefficient and male-on-male on the
 

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.980
Gini coefficient and male-on-male on the
side isn't like 0.2 or 0.3 which is

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:45.990
side isn't like 0.2 or 0.3 which is
 

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.079
side isn't like 0.2 or 0.3 which is
about the correlation that you get if

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:48.089
about the correlation that you get if
 

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:49.879
about the correlation that you get if
you were predicting something like that

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:49.889
you were predicting something like that
 

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:50.930
you were predicting something like that
using personality

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940
using personality
 

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.389
using personality
it's like point eight or point nine it's

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399
it's like point eight or point nine it's
 

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.220
it's like point eight or point nine it's
like idiot of all of it it's the

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.230
like idiot of all of it it's the
 

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.120
like idiot of all of it it's the
explanation so it's a huge effect you

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.130
explanation so it's a huge effect you
 

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.829
explanation so it's a huge effect you
know it's so it's so big in effect that

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839
know it's so it's so big in effect that
 

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:02.449
know it's so it's so big in effect that
you can basically say oh well we figured

00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459
you can basically say oh well we figured
 

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.160
you can basically say oh well we figured
that out all those psychologists never

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.170
that out all those psychologists never
 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.960
that out all those psychologists never
know when they figured anything out and

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:05.970
know when they figured anything out and
 

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.480
know when they figured anything out and
they keep endlessly retesting it over

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.490
they keep endlessly retesting it over
 

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.920
they keep endlessly retesting it over
and over and over because you know we

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:09.930
and over and over because you know we
 

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.150
and over and over because you know we
don't know how to bring our science to a

don't know how to bring our science to a
 

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.360
don't know how to bring our science to a
stop but if you don't accept the Gini

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.370
stop but if you don't accept the Gini
 

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.009
stop but if you don't accept the Gini
coefficient aggression data it's like

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019
coefficient aggression data it's like
 

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:17.000

you might as well throw the rest of

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.010
you might as well throw the rest of
 

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.470
you might as well throw the rest of
social sciences out the window because

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480
social sciences out the window because
 

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.480
social sciences out the window because
then the effect is unbelievably powerful

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.490
then the effect is unbelievably powerful
 

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.870
then the effect is unbelievably powerful
hilarious it depends you can do it at

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880
hilarious it depends you can do it at
