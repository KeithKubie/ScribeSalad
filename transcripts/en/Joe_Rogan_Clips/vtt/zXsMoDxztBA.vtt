00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.290
The Joe Rogan experience,
do you,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.580
you'll never allow yourself to get back to 300 pounds?
Can Oh,
never.
No,
no,
no,

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.680
no.
I can't go down that road yet.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
Crazy transition though to go at a 10 year span from being a guy who's like

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
really overweight and worried you're going to die to being an elite UFC fighter.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.940
Yeah.
Like life life for me is as is happening now.

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.880
Like this is kind of the beginning of everything for me.
You know,
it's,

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.750
it's really cool.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
That's really cool and I'm glad that I found mixed martial arts just because it

10
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.040
just,
it gives me,
it's a journey man.
It's not just UFC,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
just like finding MMA and diving into different cultures and lifestyles and

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.690
understandings and sometimes philosophies,
all this stuff.
Just to understand,

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:49.830
just to put it all together,

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.670
just to have it all make sense at the end of the day.
Like it's,

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.420
it's been a beautiful thing.
Been able to meet a lot of people,

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.290
go a lot of places like I'm very thankful and very just like,

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.850
like I'm okay with life.
You know?
It's very good to hear,
man.

18
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:06.990
That's a cool thing to hear.

19
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.310
I love hearing that you're cool cooled life and yeah,

20
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.250
you're um,
you're on a great path,
man.
It's a,

21
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
it's also what's inspiring about it for other people is your story of being at a

22
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:24.510
place where you weren't like that before and your story of being overweight and

23
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.511
smoking cigarettes and feeling depressed and then now you're like for so many

24
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.390
people out there that gives people hope,
it gives them a thought.

25
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:38.280
Like maybe if I just figured this out,
I actually can't,
maybe life doesn't suck.

26
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.810
Maybe just sucks the way on living.

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.650
Maybe if I could just figure out this path in a positive direction,

28
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.900
I can change everything I can.
I could be a happy,
I could be like you right now.

29
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.650
What was the exact quote?
I'm happy with that.
Happy with life.
Happy with life.

30
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.550
Yeah.
You're cool with life.
I'm happy with life.
That is a great quote.

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.690
Most people don't get to that spot and the crazy thing is too,

32
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.510
I didn't have this dream to be in the UFC.

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.950
I made a choice to just go get healthy.
You gave me,
it was like doing a short,

34
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.950
just a short step in the right direction and I just,

35
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.770
what propelled you to take the first fight if you were just trying to get

36
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:15.610
healthy?
Uh,

37
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.950
a lot of encouragement and the first time really hearing people like being good

38
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.800
at something that like

39
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
I was like surrounded by fighters and guys who believed in me and like who cared

40
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.950
and like wanting to see me get better and tougher and I was getting my ass

41
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.670
kicked every day and that was something that wasn't used to just being in that

42
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:45.120
environment I had at the time learning,
I had a very strong team.

43
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.360
Like I started at Vandelay school when he was still fighting.

44
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.270
So a lot of the guys,
I was like shoot the box style.

45
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.700
It's like everyone's getting knocked out.

46
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.690
Every training somebody gets knocked out really very hard.
And that was,

47
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.720
that was new for me to get and like that and how to varying that in Vegas.

48
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.583
Oh yeah man.

49
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740
I remember helping him get ready for the either it was like Brian Sander Krystle

50
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.560
Ebid and throwing full on the elbows in the cage.
No Pad.
Like we're going at it.

51
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.450
I'm like,
my jaw was dislocated everything,

52
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.620
but it was just like what we learned was just always fight in Brazilian.

53
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.060
They pull Hada every day.
Wow.
Everyday People Hada

54
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.350
blow hod the,
yeah.
Think about that.
Um,

55
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.680
it definitely made me tough in the beginning.
Now I,

56
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.330
I realize that like I've only been doing this a short time and I already feel

57
00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:42.440
like aches and pains and stuff and I don't want it to be like that when I'm

58
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:45.860
older.
So I'm a lot more smart about my training.

59
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.300
And uh,
do you think it was a critical aspect of your success though?

60
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.890
I needed gone through the fire like that.

61
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.080
I needed that because you were saying different guys,

62
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:59.030
you know what I was made of,
right.
Being,
being a guy who's overweight and secure,

63
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.440
all these things,

64
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:05.060
never going on hikes or my dad passed away when I was younger,

65
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.440
like very young.

66
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:10.400
And so I never had my dad to encourage me to go throw a ball or anything,

67
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:14.810
play sports or be a man,
be a boy,
be at,
you know,
just be,

68
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.000
I was always like kind of sheltered by my mom and she was more like protective,

69
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.020
like,
ah,
I don't wanna go do that.

70
00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:23.270
And then she finally learned to just like set me free.

71
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.060
But I needed to know what I was made of,
man.

72
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.700
I needed to know what I was made of in,

73
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.343
<v 1>yeah,</v>

74
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.890
<v 0>in the realm of,
of med fighting,
whatever,</v>

75
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.490
it took blood tears,
sweat had the same thing that I say.

76
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:41.250
Like I didn't know what that was like.
I never got a taste of it.

77
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.850
And so going through it in a real way of like actually getting my ass beat and

78
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:49.851
having to find my way out of it and can't run from it and still like it's people

79
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:54.150
that cared about me too.
It was like,
it was just a great thing to have.

80
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.710
And now I enjoy it.
I enjoy really good,
hard fight.

81
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.460
You know what I mean?
Something about it.
That's,
well you're,
you,

82
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:06.450
you're enjoying your progress to your change of who you are as a person.

83
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.530
You're strengthening.

84
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040
How far into your training was where you like 100% all in committed like that?

85
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.983
<v 1>Uh,</v>

86
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.180
<v 0>I think it was after my loss to Tyson Pedro,</v>

87
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:25.480
which was my second fight in the UFC,
um,

88
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.070
before everything was still kind of very fun and games and I was like,
oh,

89
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.460
I get to travel,
go to Australia to fight in Australia.

90
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.220
So it was a big shock to be in the UFC,

91
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:41.050
especially not even expecting to be there.
And within just a few years.
So,

92
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:41.884
uh,

93
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.540
after losing that fight is when I met my friend and at the time my strength and

94
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.960
conditioning coach Lorenzo and he had been through,
um,

95
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.360
like para rescue school and things like that.

96
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.780
So he helped me to just develop this mentality of like,

97
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.590
how far will your mind take you,
how big is your will?

98
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.280
And when training with him and doing kind of like pararescue survival training

99
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.600
for conditioning,
that,
that was a,

100
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.380
that was a point where I started to like say like,
okay,

101
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.110
I'm going to take this full on.
I know I can fight hard,

102
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440
but now I know how far am I will can go in the face of the elements and

103
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:28.830
everything.
So like putting those two together,
going after it.
And then the,

104
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.470
the fight I took after that was Daniel Jolly and then I ended that in the first

105
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.304
round with the knee.

106
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.150
And then I thought Paul Craig in Scotland and I had the same mentality.
Like,

107
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.780
I'm going forward,
I'm getting better,
I'm going to grow stronger,
better,
harder,

108
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.950
like everything.
And uh,
then the,

109
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.930
the fight to the Polish guy,
uh,
Michael Alexei joke.
Have you seen him lately?

110
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.520
He's been,
he's been a,

111
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.290
he just beat like John Volante and I forgot.
Oh,
that's right.

112
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.800
Yeah,
that was the body shop.
I lost it.
All right.
I lost to him,

113
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:04.700
but then it got turned to a no contest.
So,
um,

114
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.350
after that was a go Saki fight.

115
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.340
So it's been three years and no contest.
Did he test positive?
Yeah.

116
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.610
Tested positive,
but he was also,
um,
uh,

117
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.780
a last minute,
uh,
last minute fight.
I always fuck his name up.

118
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.790
Michael l Alexi joke.
Oh,
Alexi.
Check.
Yeah.
It's a rough one.
At the weigh ins.

119
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.290
I was butchering
terrible.
But some of those fucking names.

120
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.850
Ah,
sage.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

121
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.250
So when like three or four years,
man,

122
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.200
and how many fights you have professionally?
Uh,
Dang.
What's my work?

123
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.850
83 83 and one that's funny that you know,
you don't really know your record.
I,

124
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.150
hmm.
I don't remember.
Eight three in one.
I think it's 83 and one.
Wow.
Yeah.

125
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.950
That's amazing that you've been fighting for a relatively short period of time

126
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.900
and have a,
achieved some pretty fucking spectacular results,
man.

127
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.130
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
