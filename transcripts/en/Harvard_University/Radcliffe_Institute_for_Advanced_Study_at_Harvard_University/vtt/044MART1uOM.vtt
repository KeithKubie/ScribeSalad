00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.044
- Welcome, everyone.

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm Hisa.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.959
I have my seat here.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.000
My name is Hisa Kuriyama.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.270
I'm the Director of Humanities
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.520
And I'm so glad to
have Scott here.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.356
He's been my idol
for so many years.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.598
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:27.170
How many people
is this true for?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.669
Yes.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:35.010
Is there anybody here who hasn't
read Understanding Comics?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880
- Well, don't put
them on the spot.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.590
- So if you haven't
read it, this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.075
is the first thing you
should do this evening.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:41.575
Yeah.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.270
So let me begin with
a question about that.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.910
So Understanding Comics,
probably your most famous book,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.860
right, is a book that makes
a wonderful case for comics

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.310
as a art form, as something
we should take seriously.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.240
But it's also sort of a
treatise on communication.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.710
And I want to follow up on
this question of communication.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.000
And I was very impressed by
your talk and the thoughtfulness

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.480
not only the content,
but the presentation.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.520
And I'm wondering if
you could say something

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.330
about how you think about--

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.635
I know you give lectures
at many, many places

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:28.910
and you're an experienced
lecturer and it shows--

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.360
how your work in comics and
that sort of comic communication

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.290
has influenced the
way you present live

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.410
and the differences you see
between live presentation

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.070
and, you know,
comic communication?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.080
- Well, you know,
in isolating images

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.640
for panels what
you're trying to do

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.790
is make sure that you're
siloing each idea that you want

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.710
to get across, and
you're presenting only

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.496
what's necessary to get
that message across.

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.120
We have a minimalist
kind of aesthetic.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.970
Now, there are comics, of
course, that really lard it up,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.480
you know.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.490
And sometimes it can
be enjoyable to see

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.779
all the excess detail and
excess unnecessary stuff that's

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:05.320
put in there.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.570
But sort of the default
setting for cartoonists is just

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.120
get it done.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.480
And when I'm presenting, one of
the things that I try to keep

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.180
close to the notion that, from
the audience's standpoint,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.872
if I don't need to think
it, I don't need to see it.

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.330
And I think that
that's a principle

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.315
that we violate often, we
being all of society worldwide.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.440
Almost everyone has given
a PowerPoint presentation

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.385
at some point.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.260
And there's always
information on the screen,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.980
at any given time,
maybe 80% of that screen

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.950
is inactive in the sense that
we're not talking about that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.750
now, but there it is.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.450
And I think that your
eye still drifts up.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.890
It looks at that bulleted list.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.220
And it looks at item number
two, and five, and four,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.680
even though you're talking
about number three.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.410
And we have this notion
that, by adding images,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.000
we're adding value
to a presentation.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.450
But you're beginning at
a deficit in the sense

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.390
that, when you give
a presentation,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.910
you have what you have to say.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.076
You have the manner in which
you're going to say it.

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:07.610
You have your vocal inflection.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.200
You have your body language.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.000
You have your enthusiasm
for the subject.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.640
Hopefully, you have
enthusiasm for the subject.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.850
And then what are
you doing first?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.160
You're introducing a
distraction, right?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.380
You're introducing something
that pulls people away

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.447
from that.

00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:24.530
And so if it's not amplifying
what you have to say

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.640
and it's not synchronized
with what you have to say,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.397
it's pulling way.

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:30.230
And I think that's where
a lot of that sleep

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.560
inducing cognitive
drag comes from

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.390
is the sitting and
waiting for them

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.070
to say x when they're still
talking about, you know, y.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.787
Or, I did that, it's
not in the right order.

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:44.120
See, that's going to bug me now.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.990
Waiting for y-- well,
they're saying x.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.400
That was so unnecessary, Scott.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.290
Just keep on the main road.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.210
But, yeah, it's
what I call the why

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.692
is there a llama on the
screen, you know, problem.

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:00.650
And it's just like, we're
getting to the llama,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.800
just give me 10
minutes and the notes.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.437
- So another
distinctive feature,

00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:09.770
very striking feature, that
I'm sure everybody picked up

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.830
on in your presentation today
was the use of the pointer.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.790
Not simply to point, right,
but almost like a magic wand,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.290
right?

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.790
- OK.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.730
- So that there
seems to be a sense

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.790
of something happening live.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.920
And this also happened with
your animations, right?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.000
Something happening live
in what is, in fact,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.960
a prepared presentation,
but it really

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.630
enlivens the presentation.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.370
Because one has a sense
of something happening.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.040
- Yeah.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.520
Well, I hope it does.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.670
Ivy makes fun of me for my
attachment to the stick,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.600
but I love my stick.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.880
I love my 7/16 of an inch
in diameter Home Depot

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.420
stick that I have to go and
find every time I fly someplace.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.160
I believe very
strongly there's--

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.990
I promise this will
make sense in a sec.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.580
But if you look at the film
Pinocchio, the old Disney

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.340
animated film, there's a
character called the Blue Fairy

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.260
who shows up at one point.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.370
And the Blue Fairy is rotoscope.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.800
Now, rotoscoping
is where you take

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.812
actual live footage of a
person, and you trace over it.

00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:17.270
And as soon as she
comes on screen,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.980
you can tell that
she's different.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.390
This can be very distracting.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.180
There have been films in which
rotoscoping was used poorly

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.740
in a way that was very
distracting, because all

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.531
of a sudden it comes
from another universe.

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:28.910
It comes from another reality.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.470
But in Pinocchio, it works.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.360
Because the blue fairy
is from another reality.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.260
So it's seamless, right?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.130
OK.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.050
I'm getting to it.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.860
I use the stick.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.810
I don't use a laser pointer.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.910
Because I believe that
there are two worlds.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.495
Whenever you get any sort
of PowerPoint presentation,

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:47.370
there are two worlds.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.550
There's the world of the
presenter, the human being

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.570
and what they say.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.370
And there's the
world of the images.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.080
You're building bridges.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.630
You're building bridges
between those two things.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.590
That red dot, that damnable
dot, everybody becomes a cat.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.280
When you see that dot, it
is from another reality.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.580
And what happens,
it foregrounds.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.080
It becomes the
foreground figure.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.700
And everything,
you and the picture

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.060
and everything else in the
room, becomes background.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.260
And, whereas, the stick,
following on McLuhan,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.921
is just an extension
of your arm, you know?

00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:24.670
You see the stick.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.260
And it's just like, my
arm is not long enough.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.420
My arm-- longer now, right.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.310
You know, with The
Extensions of Man, that idea.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.782
And so I'm building
a bridge there.

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.490
Now, when the screen
is low-- this screen

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.406
was a little bit high.

00:06:37.406 --> 00:06:38.630
I can only reach halfway.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.300
When it's even closer, I
can interact with it more.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.222
But this goes back
to what I was saying

00:06:43.222 --> 00:06:44.930
in the talk of this
notion that there are

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.760
no neutral visual decisions.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.700
One visual decision that's
been cast as neutral, I think,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.220
throughout the
community of presenters

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.240
is the idea that the physical
separation between screen

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.820
and speaker is of
no consequence,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.740
that it doesn't transmit
any kind of message.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.150
Well, it does.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.720
It does.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
And a close connection
between the two

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.920
transmits a very
obvious message once you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.310
see it exploited, which I hope
I was able to do a bit tonight.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.810
- Yeah.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.630
It was a wonderful
demonstration.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.541
So this is an example of your
attention to different media,

00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:19.040
right?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.520
So comics traditionally being a
printed form and then a lecture

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.990
being a live presentation.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.550
Another thing that I know
you're very interested in

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.924
and have worked
a long time on is

00:07:29.924 --> 00:07:33.620
digital, the use of the
digital in terms of translation

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.580
of comics into digital.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.660
- My Waterloo, yes, my attempts
to bring about a revolution

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.020
that's only half finished.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.890
- And, I mean, for
those who haven't

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.790
read Reinventing Comics, that's
another work I would recommend.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.120
But I also recommend
going to Scott's site

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.780
and seeing his early attempts
with digital presentation

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.280
comics.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.113
And I'm wondering if
you could say something

00:07:58.113 --> 00:08:01.520
about where you stand
now in terms of,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.070
in your early
writings on comics,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.320
you talk about how
it's important to think

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.330
about the new possibilities that
digital storytelling opens up--

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.610
not least, the idea
of an extended canvas,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.100
the screen as one long page
rather than simply a series

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.594
of reproducing the printed page.

00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:24.260
But you also mention
other possibilities

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:32.429
like sound,
interactivity, hyperlinks.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.934
And I'm wondering--

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:36.350
I'm sure you've tried all sorts
of different experiments--

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.150
where you stand
on what you think

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.340
are the possibilities of digital
that maybe haven't been fully

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.920
exploited yet and where
you think maybe still

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.607
the paper or the traditional
modes are superior.

00:08:49.607 --> 00:08:50.940
- I'll try the 3 minute version.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.380
And then I will close Pandora's
box as furiously as I can.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.330
Because, otherwise,
that'll be the whole day.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.080
Yeah.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.640
It was a full-time obsession of
mine for like 15 years or so.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.140
In fact, I became obsessed with
it right after Understanding

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.280
Comics came out.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.570
That was in '93.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.567
And it would be six
months until the web--

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:08.067
- Wow.

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:09.590
- --went mainstream with the
first graphical web browser.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.314
- Wow.

00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:11.480
- So it was very early days.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.646
Though, I didn't actually
publish Reinventing Comics

00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:14.754
until '99, 2000--

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:15.253
- Yeah.

00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:17.971
- --something like that.

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.950
But, in short, I
believe that the format

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.340
of comics that we
think of as being

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.550
part and parcel of the art form,
the idea of blocking things off

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.650
into that rectangle
we call the page,

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.360
is a technological decision.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.750
It's a decision to fit
it into the rectangle.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.360
By finding a lot of
precursors for sequential art

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.480
before print, I was able to
find lots of examples of things

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.970
that did not fit into that box.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.120
One of the interesting
things I found

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.340
was that they were continuous.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.467
- Yeah.

00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:46.070
- It's fascinating.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.940
If you look at all of
these old version--

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.340
I'm thinking of certain
very specific Egyptian wall

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.840
paintings.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.700
Not hieroglyphics,
that's something else.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.670
But certain Egyptian
wall paintings,

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.080
stuff like Trajan's Column,
the Bayeux Tapestry,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.410
the various codices
pre-Columbian picture

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.450
manuscripts, all
these things, you

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.992
had a single, unbroken reading
line from beginning to end.

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:06.450
The codices, they
were fascinating.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.574
They were accordion folded.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.052
So if you spread
them out, the story

00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:12.260
would just go like that all
the way beginning to end.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.380
So the idea was that the
story determined the shape.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.490
And it seemed to me as if, to a
certain degree printed comics,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.350
that technology was
determining the shape.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.000
And I liked the
idea of freeing it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.760
So many people saw it as
imposing new technology

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.110
upon an art form, but I tried
to bring about this awareness

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.590
that, no, our art form is
already very much enthralled

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.470
to a particular technology.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.580
We're simply maybe releasing
it to take its own shape.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.440
And the idea-- really
just imagine it

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.930
here out in pure thin air.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.010
If I said panel one here, panel
two, panel three, panel four,

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.290
you start to think about
the possibilities, one

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.240
of them being the simple fact
that nearly all panels in print

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.230
are the same distance
from one another.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.190
If you look a century
of American comics,

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.450
the distance between panels
in 99.9% of the cases

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.660
varies between a quarter of
an inch and a half an inch.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.740
That's it.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.170
For any given work, they're
usually identical all the way.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.600
Well, that is the
same frequency.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.770
Think of it as frequency.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.067
Think of the size and shape of
the panel as amplitude, right?

00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:18.900
So we have the amplitude
modulation, but not

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.860
frequency modulation.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.850
Well, what happens?

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.020
If this is beat one,
beat two, beat three,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.100
right, then that would
be boom, boom, boom.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.610
But what if we separate them?

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.110
OK.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.440
Now, it's boom, boom, boom.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.900
If time equals space,
then you should

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.430
be able to manipulate that.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.824
Frequency modulation, that
was fascinating to me.

00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:42.240
But then, of course,
you mentioned

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.948
sound and interactivity
and these things.

00:11:43.948 --> 00:11:47.280
To me, these were challenges to
the very definition of comics.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.770
And there were some
mutations that I thought

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.884
were just an off ramp, right?

00:11:51.884 --> 00:11:54.300
It's just like, well, this is
just a want-to-be movie now.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.262
I always point out the Watchmen
motion comic if anyone is--

00:11:58.262 --> 00:11:59.970
probably we've all
forgotten that by now.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.845
It's ancient history.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.594
But, you know, there
were some things that

00:12:02.594 --> 00:12:03.960
were just trying to be movies.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.110
I wanted to see something
that was actually accentuating

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.400
the qualities of comics.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.550
And when you put
a comic sequence,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.540
an entire graphic novel,
all in one massive canvas,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.370
hundreds of panels
all at once, you

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.350
are accentuating
the thing that's

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.540
unique about this
art form which is

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.060
that, unlike prose, unlike
movies, unlike theater,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.080
in comics, it is the
entire past, present,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.240
and future is laid
out all at once.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.970
That's unique.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.240
We're rising above
that landscape of time.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.660
It's not true about almost
any other narrative form.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.590
In almost every other narrative
form, it's always now.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.870
Past is just memory, and
future is just anticipation.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.554
If I go any further, we're lost.

00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:51.053
- OK.

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:51.860
- We're lost.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.960
I start to-- you
know, at midnight,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.694
I sprout horns and things.

00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:58.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.310
- I have tons of
other questions.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.420
But I know that there's
lots of people who

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.430
would like to ask questions.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.250
So I'd like to
invite anybody who

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.940
would like to ask a question
to come up to the microphone.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.790
And we don't have a huge
amount of time for this.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.390
But there will be a reception
afterwards, which I'm sure--

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.890
- Yeah.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.600
- --Scott will be happy to
speak with you individually.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.100
So--

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.789
- Absolutely.

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:26.830
- You had said something
during your presentation

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.770
that stuck in my head, which was
when you showed the six faces.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.670
And you said that
everyone knows this,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.430
but we don't really teach this.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.900
And I was wondering how it will
change people's perceptions

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.770
when they have sort of a
meta-understanding of vision.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.950
It's like, if I go to a
film, I'm not a filmmaker.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.830
I follow the story.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.620
But if I'm a filmmaker, I'm
going to look at the editing.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.340
I'm going to look at the cuts.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.964
I'm going to look at
the camera angles.

00:13:49.964 --> 00:13:53.500
And I know people
who go to films

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.140
who are schooled that way
who have trouble accepting

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.240
the story, because
they're so involved

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.360
in the meaning of the
vocabulary of the medium.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.722
So what would happen
if everybody was always

00:14:06.722 --> 00:14:08.430
looking at faces and
thinking, oh, I see.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.110
This is a combination of
fear and anger and all that?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.510
- I actually think that it
exists on a slightly different

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.910
level from, say, film literacy.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.110
Because literacy-- that's maybe
not the right word, literacy.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.310
But an awareness of the inner
workings of facial expressions,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.750
to me, it's like teaching them
how your heart pumps blood

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.870
or how your respiratory
system works or the fact

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.990
that the skin is an organ.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.040
These are things that we
believe are absolutely

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.470
essential knowledge
that we teach children

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.230
somewhere in the lower grades,
you know, maybe around--

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.760
well, I'm not
actually sure of this.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.420
I'm very old.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.490
God only knows when they
teach them these days.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:53.790
But, to me, the notion
that the face is the one

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.660
place where muscles go
from your bone to your skin

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.150
rather than bone to bone,
where they do not move limbs.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.420
They are an information display.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.040
The fact that you have this
jumbotron of information

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.850
for a social species like
us that communicates,

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.190
that sends signals silently
through perturbations--

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.950
perturbations, that
sounds wrong-- of skin,

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.560
is, to me, just basic.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.390
It's like this is what
it is to be alive.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.920
Look at what your body is
doing to send these messages.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.840
To me, that's fundamental.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.010
And I believe it should be
a part of basic education.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.160
And, also, it is so much fun.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.760
I have taught facial
expressions to little kids

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.940
and big kids and college
students and adults.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.310
And everybody has such
a magnificent time.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:51.210
All you have to do is set
them the task of communicating

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.210
with another student
a particular emotion,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.290
a particular very
specific emotion, and then

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.110
watch if they can get it across
and talk about how it could

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.550
have been done differently.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.620
Deconstructing the
muscles of the face--

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.990
oh my god, people freak out.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.980
It's so much fun.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.780
It's so much more
fun than chemistry.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.528
And chemistry can be fun.

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:14.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:15.720
- That was actually,
like, really

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.610
perfect to move into the
point that I wanted to make

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.109
and a question that
I wanted to ask.

00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:22.830
When I teach comics, I often
teach it in terms of semiotics

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.500
and how we have this shared sort
of connection to everything,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.680
like as a culture.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.180
Can you talk a
little bit about how,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.540
like, when I look at your
book, like I don't see that

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.470
in there a lot of the times.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.678
And so I'm like, you know,
there's one thing he left,

00:16:33.678 --> 00:16:36.380
you know, like semiotics.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.054
So I talk about that.

00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:39.470
Although, well, I
also, like, have

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.370
them buy your book and
sort of like read it.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.710
But can you talk a
little bit about how

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.180
semiotics sort of
works and the way

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.316
you think about these things?

00:16:47.316 --> 00:16:48.690
- Well, you know,
in some way, we

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.830
could say that Understanding
Comics stumbles backwards

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.140
into semiotics to an extent.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.800
It was a very--

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.910
I don't want to say naive.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.770
But, well, you know what?

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.390
I'll say it.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.910
It was a naive work.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.910
You know, for instance,
Magritte's Pipe shows up

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.868
in there, because I had
a professor at Syracuse

00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:06.670
who had used Magritte's
Pipe in lectures.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.920
I thought, well, this is good.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.690
This is things
art students know.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.839
I wasn't even thinking
about its origins.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.660
You know, I wasn't--
oh, closure.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.349
I thought closure was
this phenomenon that I

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.839
found wider applications for.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.560
I wasn't thinking about its
origin in Gestalt psychology.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.300
I wasn't even aware of it.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.940
In fact, for a while, I thought
I'd been using it incorrectly.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.620
People were telling me, oh
no, that's not we're used.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.090
But they were talking
about literary theory.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.400
And then I had to find out, oh
no, I was using it correctly.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.660
But I was using it this way.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.850
I had to backwards
engineer the whole thing.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.130
It's only really in
the last five years

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.660
that I've been
finally getting up

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.660
to speed on some of the thinkers
and schools that had indirectly

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.059
informed me.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:51.600
But, you know, much
of Understanding,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.266
I mean, I really have
to say, some of it

00:17:53.266 --> 00:17:55.860
I really did kind of
pull out of my ass.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.300
I mean, it was just--

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.890
I don't mean that
in a bad way, but I

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.770
mean in just a sense
of direct observation,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.230
of like this is how
this makes me feel.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.290
How could that be?

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.070
Well, I have just a little bit
of this cognitive equipment,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.690
these tools for thinking that
I got at Syracuse as an art

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.529
student.

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:14.070
And now I'm going to see if I
can apply those and extrapolate

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.000
from them.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.310
And I came up with things
that others found useful,

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.280
you know, like the big
triangle especially.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.120
But it wasn't from a place
of great understanding.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.030
And so, you know,
there are a lot

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.190
of writers on this subject
I'm still discovering.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.200
But when you pick a subject like
visual cognition, oh my gosh,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.330
you know?

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.820
I'm still working
through that bookshelf.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.520
But I do think that, you know,
the study of signs and symbols

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.660
and just the way
that we mentally

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.090
reduce the world into signs
and symbols is fascinating.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.660
But it also has a lot of
warring factions, too.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.950
You know, people talking
about the futility of meaning

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.410
and sorting through that
can be a real minefield.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.395
So it's a bit of
a rambling answer.

00:18:57.395 --> 00:18:59.520
But, yeah, no, there's a
lot missing from the book,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.122
because there was a lot
missing from its author.

00:19:02.122 --> 00:19:05.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.674
- Would you give me your opinion
on street signs, highway signs?

00:19:10.674 --> 00:19:12.090
I mean, they're
extremely mundane.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.030
They're everywhere.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.092
But they're also--

00:19:14.092 --> 00:19:16.050
I mean, I had to take a
driving class recently,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.937
so all this kind of
hit me like a truck.

00:19:17.937 --> 00:19:19.020
You know, no pun intended.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.660
But they're systematic.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.700
They seem very
intentional, you know,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.740
the way the coordinate
colors, you know, reds.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.270
A stop sign is an octagon, but
a yield is a triangle, you know?

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.520
What does that mean, you know?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.570
I mean, it seems as if there
is great thought behind it,

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.370
but it's also very mundane.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.230
I mean, our public
life depends on it.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.390
You know, I mean,
don't drive this way,

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.270
or you'll hit this person.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.010
Or, you'll hit this
figure if you don't, you

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.020
know, drive less than
20 miles an hour.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.670
And the use of colors--

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.230
you know, work crews have
orange diagonal stripes.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.790
And this just seems
really artistic

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.950
and really wonderful
and meaningful,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.290
and yet it's just very mundane.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.890
And I can't help thinking,
well, all these public employees

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.560
probably didn't all go to
design school, you know?

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.394
But they might have.

00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:06.101
- Well, I think--

00:20:06.101 --> 00:20:07.457
- Because it's brilliant I think

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.560
- The mundanity doesn't
disturb me so much

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.910
as one when signals
are missed, of course.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.800
Because they should be mundane.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.570
They should be background noise.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.209
And I think that
you have to think

00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.000
of it as a collective
effort, first of all.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.958
Of course, this is the
effort of many thousands

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.470
of people over many years.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:33.140
And so you have
people at the instant

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.290
of the creation of certain
types of signs who are thinking

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.280
very deeply about it.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.170
And then others later
on will take their work

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.150
and maybe misunderstand
it, you know,

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:45.060
misconstrue what the value of
using a particular shape was.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.030
Like the man going
down stairs, he's

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.640
a reasonably well-constructed
man going down stairs,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.010
but for a little weird
positioning of the arm.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.460
It does communicate.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.600
But the right to
left thing, you know,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.740
that was just happenstance
that people glommed onto.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.480
I am fascinated by street signs.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.735
There's an episode
of 99% Invisible

00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:08.150
with Roman Mars that talks
about a man who was so upset

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:13.340
by a highway sign over
a highway in Los Angeles

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.320
that he's snuck there, put
on a workman's uniform,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.560
and put up a better designed
version of it at the risk

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.050
to his own life and, quite
frankly, the lives of people

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.550
around him just because it just
bothered him, the bad design.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.460
I am bothered when you have
an exit-only lane that's

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.030
marked by-- you have, like, a
marker for lane, lane, lane,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.200
and then you have, like,
the exit-only arrow.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.870
But the arrow is equidistant
between the one that

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.200
is an exit-only lane and the one
that isn't an exit-only lane.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.890
That's bad and shouldn't happen.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.950
I have a longstanding rant
against the bike lane signs

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.620
that have so much space
between the word bike and lane

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.110
that they're committing a
kind of proximity infidelity

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.600
where they're kind of hitting
on the wheels of the bike,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.591
and they're not showing
their unity as a thought.

00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:04.340
But that's just to
make room for the bolt.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.557
But that's another one that
Ivy just tells me to let go.

00:22:07.557 --> 00:22:08.791
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:09.290
Yeah.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.956
I think signs-- I
think those things are

00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:12.380
absolutely fascinating.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.730
And I think it's long overdue
for a careful evaluation

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.630
of which practices work
and which ones don't.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.700
But, yeah, basically,
I think it's

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.850
people of goodwill and
intelligence and understanding,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.310
and they are joined by many
people who just aren't really

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.130
thinking about it at all, who
were just like given a task

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.650
and throw something together
and get on with our lives.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.983
And that's when things go wrong.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.410
- I hope I understood
you correctly.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.535
Because, otherwise, my
question makes little sense.

00:22:42.535 --> 00:22:45.680
But you gave a definition
of fishing, I think,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.720
to know what is
where by looking.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.160
Maybe I have to ask
Alexander, Marr, or Aristotle.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.200
But I was wondering why
where, and why not other?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.420
- Oh.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.020
Well, what is where--

00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.520
yeah.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.100
Locating in space and
identifying what it is

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.881
does cover a lot
of ground I think.

00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:04.380
- Yeah.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.870
But there's what,
there's how, there's who.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.460
I mean, if you're
a fish and you're

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.710
looking for other
things than just where,

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.370
just it struck me as
important, but, like, narrowly.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.450
- Well, I would say who is
included in what in the sense

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.060
that the parietal lobe
does include things

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.460
like the fusiform face area.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.770
So we're using what
in the general sense

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.390
of, like, is that my friend Bob
or is it a blender, you know?

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.270
And that's happening
in the temporal lobe.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.570
The where in the parietal
lobe, the parietal lobe does

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.640
handle location.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.300
But, you know, when you mention,
say, how, something like how,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.000
is it the kind of
inquiry that can

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.670
follow on the initial
impulse of vision?

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.930
I do think that what and where
covers a huge amount of ground.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.290
But I'm saying really it's
just that that definition,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.170
it arises with Aristotle, but it
comes through Marr's phrasing--

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.520
David Marr's phrasing.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.670
But I think that it's remarkable
for its economy of expression

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.380
that, in only seven
words, it covers

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.482
those four different vital
components of the mind.

00:24:07.482 --> 00:24:08.940
Now, of course,
the cerebral cortex

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.620
has many thousands of functions,
but vision, definitely,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.240
lives back here.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.820
And the parietal lobe
definitely does handle things

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.824
like navigation.

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:20.740
One of the cool things
about the parietal lobe

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.500
is that it's monochromatic.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.800
I promise I won't get too
far into this, but it's cool.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.830
So the temporal lobe uses color
to identify what things are.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.010
But the parietal lobe
doesn't really use color.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.510
It's monochromatic.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.700
And so one of the cool
things is that if you

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.780
have two colors that are
exactly the same brightness,

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.100
they start squirming.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.600
You can't quite
tell where they are.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.030
Their location gets all
messed up and weird.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.470
Sorry, that was so unnecessary.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.310
But I love it.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.590
It's cool.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.400
But, yeah, I think
it's good writing.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.130
Basically, I think I'm very
impressed by Marr's seven

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.940
words.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.040
Because it's rare that
seven words can take you

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.870
quite so far as I think
those seven words do.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.285
- Thank you.

00:25:05.285 --> 00:25:05.785
- Hi.

00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:06.285
- Hi.

00:25:06.285 --> 00:25:08.700
- You talked a lot about,
like, clarity and images

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.100
and how we're surrounded
by a lot of unclear images.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.240
But like some
images do definitely

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.990
mean different things
to different people,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.070
especially based off culture,
background, experience.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.910
So I was wondering how that
informs your own image making

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.260
or if you ran into any instances
in which you make an image,

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.660
and it's, like,
misinterpreted beyond what

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.029
you could have imagined.

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:30.570
- I'm sure that
happens all the time.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.153
But, of course, I
wouldn't necessarily

00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:34.126
know about it,
because my books get

00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:36.000
translated into a lot
of different languages.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.541
And I'm sure people are, like,
scratching their heads at this

00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:41.130
or that panel, but they don't
necessarily tell me about it.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.160
But to speak generally, I
mean, you're absolutely right.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.520
And there are some things that
are very culturally determined.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.410
We're always well-off
if we can try

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.939
to focus on the things
that are more universal.

00:25:51.939 --> 00:25:53.730
But, for instance, the
use of the color red

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.820
is a classic one in information
design, the fact that red

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.990
often, you know, in the West
will mean danger or, you know,

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.480
equivalent urgency,
that sort of thing.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.930
Whereas, it may mean
prosperity in parts of Asia.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:12.180
So, yeah, there are
definitely issues like that.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.720
I think the quest for a
completely universal lexicon

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.060
of visual symbols
is probably futile.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.250
One way or another,
we're going to run up

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.100
against those
non-universal differences.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.810
But if we're aware of
them, then at least

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:29.010
we can have means of either
substitution or interpretation

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.450
that can help to
ameliorate that.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.158
And also, of course,
many of these things

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:34.459
should be being
produced locally.

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:36.000
You know, much like
government, there

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.490
are things that can be done
universally from the top,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.447
from a universal
sort of authority.

00:26:40.447 --> 00:26:42.030
And there are things
that maybe should

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.970
be done in the much smaller
scale, such as like signage

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.700
in a given town.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.550
Oh, can I just say?

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.472
My favorite new sign,
speaking of street signs--

00:26:50.472 --> 00:26:51.930
somebody on Twitter
showed me this.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.510
It's there is two
paths that diverge.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.070
One is a bike path.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.470
Bike path goes to the right.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.990
The footpath goes to the left.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.920
And there is a sign
for the bike path

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.750
with an arrow going that way.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.140
And a sign for the footpath
with the arrow going that way.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.230
And under the arrow is a little
man icon walking this way.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.002
And a little bicycle
driving that way.

00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:21.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.390
I love it.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:29.205
- On that note, so let's
all thank Scott McCloud

00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:30.080
for a wonderful talk.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.580
- Thank you.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.030
