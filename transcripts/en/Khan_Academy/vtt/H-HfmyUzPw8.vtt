00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.420
Where we left off, we
were trying our very best

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.890
to get to the castle
and save whomever

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.660
we were needing to save.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.660
But we had to cross the
bridge and the troll

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.290
gave us these clues because
we had no money in our pocket.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.789
And if we don't
solve his riddle,

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.330
he's going to push
us into the water.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.024
So we are under pressure.

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:23.190
And at least we made some
headway in the last video.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.880
We were able to represent
his clues mathematically

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.020
as a system of equations.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.650
whether we can solve for
this system of equations.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.970
And you'll see that
there are many ways

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.026
of solving a system
of equations.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:39.650
But this time I want
to do it visually.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.483
Because at least in my
mind, it helps really

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:44.780
get the intuition of what
these things are saying.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.110
So let's draw some
axes over here.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.490
Let's draw an f-axis.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.430
That's the number of
fives that I have.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.310
And let's draw a t-axis.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.720
That is the number
of tens I have.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.680
And let's say that this
right over here is 500 tens.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.350
That is 1,000 tens.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.480
And let's say this is-- oh,
sorry, that's 500 fives.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.270
That's 1,000 fives.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.790
This is 500 tens, And
this is 1,000 tens.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.860
So let's think about all of
the combinations of f's and t's

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.790
that satisfy this
first equation.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.050
If we have no tens, then
we're going to have 900 fives.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.100
So that looks like
it's right about there.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.049
So that's the point
0 tens, 900 fives.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.340
But what if went the other way?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.770
If we have no fives, we're
going to have 900 tens.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.230
So that's going to be the
point 900 tens, 0 fives.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.310
So all the combinations of
f's and t's that satisfy this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.830
are going to be on this
line right over there.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.520
And I'll just draw a dotted line
just because it's easier for me

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.460
to draw it straight.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.780
So that represents all the
f's and t's that satisfy

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.800
the first constraint.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.430
Obviously, there's
a bunch of them,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.520
so we don't know
which is the one that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.870
is actually what the troll has.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.420
But lucky for us, we have
a second constraint--

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.580
this one right over here.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.470
So let's do the same thing.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.280
In this constraint, what
happens if we have no tens?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.569
If tens are 0, then we
have 5f is equal to 5,500.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.360
Let me do a little
table here, because this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.450
is a little bit more involved.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.260
So for the second
equation, tens and fives.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.440
If I have no tens, I have
5f is equal to 5,500,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.870
f will be 1,100.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.320
I must have 1,100 fives.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.750
If I have no fives,
then this is 0,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.770
and I have 10t is
equal to 5,500,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.520
that means I have 550 tens.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.150
So let's plot both
at those point.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.420
t equals 0, f is 11.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.120
That's right about there.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.860
So that is 0.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.700
1,100 is on the line that
represents this equation.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.860
And that when f is 0, t is 550.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.230
So let's see, this is about--
this would be 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.010
so 550 is going to
be right over here.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.430
So that is the
point 550 comma 0.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.110
And all of these
points-- let me try

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.384
to draw a straight line again.

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:25.800
I could do a better
job than that.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.530
So all of these points
are the points--

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.957
let me try one more time.

00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:36.040
We want to get this right.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.120
We don't want to get pushed
into the water by the troll.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.340
So there you go.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.470
That looks pretty good.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.170
So every point on this blue line
represents an ft combination

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.860
that satisfies the
second constraint.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.620
So what is an f and t, or
number of fives and number

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.640
of tens that satisfy
both constraints?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.620
Well, it would be
a point that is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.710
sitting on both of the lines.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.460
And what is a point that is
sitting on both of the lines?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.876
Well, that's where
they intersect.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.750
This point right over here
is clearly on the blue line

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.840
and is clearly on
the yellow line.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.950
And what we can do is, if
we drew this graph really,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.320
really precisely, we could
see how many fives that is

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.140
and how many tens that is.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.779
And if you look at it, if
you look at very precisely,

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.560
and actually I encourage you
to graph it very precisely

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.330
and come up with how many fives
and how many tens that is.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.256
Well, when we do it right over
here, I'm going to eyeball it.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:34.630
If we look at it
right over here,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.600
it looks like we
have about 700 fives,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.180
and it looks like we
have about 200 tens.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.490
And this is based on
my really rough graph.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.960
But let's see if that worked.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.130
700 plus 200 is equal to 900.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.840
And if I have 700 fives--
let me write this down.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.090
5 times 700 is going to be
the value of the fives, which

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.970
is $3,500.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:10.300
And then 10 plus 10 times
200, which is $2,000, $2,000

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.540
is the value of the 10s.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.200
And if you add up
the two values,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.280
you indeed get to $ 5,500

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.810
So this looks right.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.000
And so we can tell
the troll-- Troll!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.780
I know!

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.692
I know how many $5
and $10 bills you.

00:05:23.692 --> 00:05:30.530
You have 700 $5 bills, and
you have 200 $10 bills.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.000
The troll is
impressed, and he lets

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.390
you cross the bridge to be the
hero or heroine of this fantasy

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.671
adventure.
