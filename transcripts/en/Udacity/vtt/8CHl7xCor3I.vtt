00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.750
This was our final answer. Excellent work if you found it. We start by finding

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.290
the lowest common denominator, which means that we have to factor this

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.871
denominator and this one first. Factors of 24 that sum to positive 10 are

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:18.613
positive 6 and positive 4, while the factors of negative 12 that sum to positive

00:00:18.613 --> 00:00:24.246
1 are positive 4 and negative 3. This means that our lowest common denominator

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:28.644
would be y plus 6 times y plus 4 times y minus 3. Next, we multiply each

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:33.197
fraction by the missing factors of our lowest common denominator. For the first

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:38.441
denominator, it's missing the factor y minus 3. So we multiply the numerator and

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:43.274
denominator by y minus 3, since we're really just multiplying by 1. For the

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:47.872
second fraction, we need to multiply by y plus 6 divided by y plus 6. When we

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:52.492
multiply each of these fractions by a form of 1, we get two new equivalent

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:58.510
fractions. We multiply these two numerators together, or these two binomials

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.740
together, to get y squared minus 6y plus 9. And then here again, we multiply

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.630
these two binomials together to get y squared plus 12y plus 36. We multiply

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.768
these out, since we're adding our numerators in the end. The denominators,

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:17.276
however, we can just leave in factored form since these won't change. When we

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:22.622
add the like terms of our numerators together, we get 2y squared from 1y squared

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:29.155
and 1y squared. We get positive 6y, from negative 6y and positive 12y. And we

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:34.550
get 45 from positive 9 and positive 36. And finally, we want to check to see if

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.208
this is factorable, to see if we can cancel a factor in the numerator and

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:43.952
denominator. We find factors of 90 that sum to positive 6. When I look at the

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:48.299
positive factors of 90, these are the factor pairs. None of these add to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.839
positive 6. So I know this numerator is not factorable. Since we cant factor

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:57.650
this numerator, we actually have our final answer. None of these add to positive

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.813
6.
