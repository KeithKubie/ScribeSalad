00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.400
Today, we're testing at an experiment to see what happens if we combine silicone mold rubber with liquid nitrogen.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.559
Those of you who follow us on Instagram may have seen our latest poll about our upcoming mystery project.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.529
Well, 71% of you guessed correctly, and you now know that we have our very own DIY kit coming out soon.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.200
But what could be inside? Leave your guesses down below. and be sure to join our mailing list so you stay in the loop!

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.099
Over the years we have done several cool experiments with liquid nitrogen and with silicone rubber, and we've also had...

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:44.400
...hundreds of comments asking to see what happens if we combine the two; liquid nitrogen and silicone rubber together!

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.400
Today, we are going to put those to the test, and hopefully it'll be exhaustive enough that everyone knows what happens.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.200
Me too, because I've never done this before! Here's the basic idea: We'll take some uncured silicone, mix it with liquid nitrogen...

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.900
...we'll pour some liquid nitrogen into the uncured silicone, and then we'll see how the cured silicone reacts with the liquid nitrogen.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.509
We've got some silicone rubber and the catalyst that goes with it some styrofoam cups.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.400
Liquid nitrogen, a little bit, is in this cup here. We've also got these pieces of cured silicone rubber.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.059
Now, these are things that I already poured out, and just let cure completely, so they are no longer liquid.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.380
We're gonna test all of these!

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.089
So the first step is gonna be mixing up some silicone rubber, and then pouring some liquid nitrogen into a cup.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.400
Normally when this silicone is mixed up properly, it takes forty-five minutes to an hour to cure.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.749
That is effected by humidity, and temperature and so what we're gonna do is mix them up;

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.400
some of it will just get poured into a separate mold, and some of it will be in a cup, full of liquid nitrogen,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.300
and we'll keep topping that off, so it stays full and freezing cold the whole time.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.000
After about an hour, we'll come back and we'll see how the two compare.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.000
116 grams, so technically, the correct amount is 10% by weight, which would be 11.6 grams.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.900
We are gonna maybe add a little bit more.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.690
Twelve or thirteen grams, that should speed up the process a little bit, but not too much

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:16.480
I worked for several years as a sculptor and mold maker, and I have mixed up so much silicone rubber in my time.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.510
Oh, man...hundreds and hundreds, possibly thousands of batches. Maybe not thousands but...

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.600
…many hundreds! There's our silicone that's nice and mixed.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200
Now let's take a cup, and just fill it all the way with liquid nitrogen.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.400
And we're gonna take that cup, and put it inside two other cups, just for some extra insulation.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.600
We want this to hold on to its cold for as long as possible.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.880
First Test: We're gonna pour some silicone down into this cup. That's gonna stay in there for like forty-five minutes to an hour.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.200
Then we're gonna pour some more of it, just right onto the table.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.600
Once it's cured, it will peel up nicely, and then the rest of it, we're gonna see what happens if we pour some liquid nitrogen into the container with silicone.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.300
Silicone, like everything, makes the liquid nitrogen boil. It has formed some very interesting shapes already.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.869
It just froze as it dribbled in. It may not move from those spots the entire time.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.929
I'm gonna have to top that off, because the heat from the silicone has obviously boiled away a lot of our liquid nitrogen there.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
Now let's just pour some out onto the table...

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.620
We're just gonna let that sit there. It'll puddle out a little bit more, and then it'll cure into a sort of semicircle.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.769
Top that off. It's nice and full.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.730
Now let's see what happens if we pour some of this liquid nitrogen into our silicone.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.600
So normally the silicone just puddles back down, kind of immediately you can see that it's holding its shape a little bit more.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.800
It's a...less of a syrup ,and I don't know of a food that's that consistency.

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.049
I'd say we're almost a cream cheese texture there. Some parts of it are just hard where the liquid nitrogen...

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.400
...just sat in contact with it. It's--it's crunchy.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.549
Here in the middle, it's still a little bit goopy over on the sides where I wasn't stirring very actively. It's just completely hardened.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.940
So it kind of slows, it down cools it down.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.169
It stops being quite so runny. You saw how easily it poured out of the container.

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.639
Some parts of it are solid; other parts of it are just cold enough that they're very slow.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.288
I think if I hold it for a while. It will start to drip out of non completely frozen parts.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.400
But, before it was just pouring out at this point. Now, we're gonna test a little bit of already cured silicone. This is very stretchy.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.400
This is very stretchy...extremely flexible.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.400
Set this down in, and see if it changes...

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
I'd say that's different. Wow!

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.769
That's not just a little less flexible! That just completely shattered!

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.560
I'm gonna try and smash this on the table and see if it kind of explodes.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.619
So silicone definitely freezes, and when it does, it becomes very brittle.

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.729
Let's see what happens if we freeze it, but then just let it sit out until it thaws.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.350
It's taking its old shape back...regaining some flexibility.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.449
It's still cold, but, it's not brittle-cold. I'm able to twist it again. Gonna put my hands down...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.800
Just warm that all the way up. I'd say that's back to flexible. It seems completely back to normal.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.859
Alright, I've got one more bigger block. We'll just drop this down and see what we get.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.179
It warmed up too much. I got some interesting cracks in it.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.119
But it had warmed up enough. That's weird though. It's still like holding the shape I twist it into. Oh

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.139
Oh, that's funny!

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.139
It's almost like a hot metal!

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.139
Deforms to the shape I smash it into but, I can't really play with it or move it from there.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.908
I think the inside is too cold, and the outside has warmed up just a little bit.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.209
Our silicone that we poured down into the liquid nitrogen has now been sitting in there for quite a while.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.670
We've topped the liquid nitrogen off several times.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.640
Here's the piece that we poured down on the table...

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.939
…and I did get a little impatient, and tried to peel it off when it wasn't quite ready...

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.000
...so it got some wrinkles in it, but at this point, it's basically cured all the way.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.029
It's just stretchy, twisty rubber just like the other stuff we made. Now we want to take our frozen silicone out of the cup.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.700
We're just gonna set it in this bowl and see what happens.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.800
I think that the cold has probably stopped all of the chemical reaction.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.709
The catalyst has not began to cure or solidify. I think as this heats up, it's just gonna melt the funny stringy shapes...

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.480
…we have are just gonna turn into a blob.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.189
I think it's just gonna be goopy, but I haven't done this before, so I don't know. Let's find out!

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.729
Clink! That's not a sound silicone usually makes. Oh! And it's breaking too.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.450
I'm gonna go try and pour off the nitrogen here.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.659
We can already see the really thin strands. I was just blowing to clear out some nitrogen, and my breath is so much warmer. Watch this!

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:35.989
It's puddling already. I think that already proves what I suspected is correct.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:41.209
That is completely gooey and liquid still. Lets keep letting that melt.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:53.549
This has now melted all the way through, and look at that that is just gooey liquid.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:09:02.600
That is not cured at all. Same batch mixed at the same time, and this actually has not cured 100%.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.209
I was remembering that this was like forty-five-minute silicone,

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:12.809
but I think I am off on that, because I mixed this at a little over 10%, and it's still not cured all the way.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.409
But you can see there's a big difference. Like the top of this has really cured. It's got a skin over it.

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:22.139
And then this right here is just...

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:31.019
…goopy...completely. While it's wet, silicone sticks to like everything, and then once it cures, it sticks to pretty much nothing. Weird stuff!

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:36.539
Thank you for all our watchers who wanted to know what happens if you put silicone into liquid nitrogen!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.820
They are fun to do. We don't want to do too many of them,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:44.100
but if you've got any cool ideas of things you want to see us test out that we haven't done before let us know down in the comments.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.179
We might just try it out!

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.549
That's fun! Guys the day is not over. Te box of the top will transport you to our last video.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.800
You should go check that out. The box in the bottom will show you what YouTube thinks you need to be watching next.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.189
And if you're not a subscriber yet, then hit the bomb here in the middle, that way you'll never miss out on a fun video.
