00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.730
So we have all these fields added to the page

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.910
layout in theory, so now I can go add a record.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.060
&gt;&gt; Yep, but don't forget to click save, because that's like the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.120
easiest thing to forget and then it just loses all of your work.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.780
&gt;&gt; Okay, I would never want to do something like that. Okay,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.390
cool. Now all of these fields are there, but obviously they are not

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.750
populating yet. So I just goto Edit, and I'll fill up these fields.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.690
Okay, so there's going to be a ton of bands coming to this festival.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.220
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220
&gt;&gt; I guess this is the tedious part, where you have to enter

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.970
them all in, or is there any other way we can do this?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.549
&gt;&gt; So, you can save this record, but

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.290
there's a really way to take spreadsheets or

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.750
more specifically CSVs And put them into SalesForce

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.030
using what we call the custom import wizard.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.635
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:44.000
&gt;&gt; Let's just go into the setup and then we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.840
can import our CSV to load those records into SalesForce.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.250
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I want to import something,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.670
should I just search import up here?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't try and memorize any click paths. Let's just search for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.440
the import. And there's a few import things. Which one should I use?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.840
&gt;&gt; Import Custom Objects is probably the safest bet.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.810
&gt;&gt; I don't trust anything in beta.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.810
&gt;&gt;

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.910
[LAUGH]

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.300
Fair enough.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.150
&gt;&gt; This here tells you all the steps that you need in order

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.280
to be able to import custom objects, but we'll just walk through it ourselves.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.375
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:12.960
&gt;&gt; Don't need to read all that text.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.590
&gt;&gt; And we have this CSV that you showed me here, this spreadsheet.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.830
&gt;&gt; Band spreadsheet.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have all of our fields

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.460
along the top and then each row represents a record.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.395
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.650
&gt;&gt; And, if for any reason, let's say, you spelled your fields

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.230
different than the way we have it up ion the column names or

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.780
column headers, we could just manually match them.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.170
It will automatically try to do it for

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.750
you, but if anything is mis-spelled, or anything

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.680
like that, you could manually map them yourselves.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So let's close this and start the Import Wizard?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.530
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.300
&gt;&gt; Choose the type of record you are importing. That would be band.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.060
&gt;&gt; Do you want to prevent duplicates from being created?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't want two bands with the same name.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.470
&gt;&gt; Right. That's right. We want to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.850
make sure the band names are unique.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.530
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.310
&gt;&gt; Existing records are found, what do you want to do? There won't be, so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.350
I guess it doesn't really matter. What's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.960
this mean, which user field are you including?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.169
&gt;&gt; Well, since we're not including any user fields, we can

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.710
just leave it as default. Or, I guess we could put None.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.740
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.170
&gt;&gt; And, what about this? Which look up fields, if any, are

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.510
included in your input file? Our spreadsheet didn't have a stage on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.810
it, right?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.540
&gt;&gt; Right. So I should not click it.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.520
&gt;&gt; Yes, I should not?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890
&gt;&gt; You should not click it. Yes

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.340
[LAUGH].

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.490
Now we need to choose this CSV file. So, look it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.640
up on your computer, and add in those, those bands. All

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.980
right. And you can leave that as default.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.030
&gt;&gt; Okay. We haven't ran any workflow rules,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.810
so we don't need to check that box.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.230
&gt;&gt; Okay Field Mapping. Is this that stuff you were

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.910
talking about where Band name, band name oh that looks good.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah so it's map some of them because they're exactly the same as what

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.560
they are in your CSV, but for some of them like has piano. Needs Piano.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.870
&gt;&gt; Okay so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.990
I'll go ahead and change those. So we actually didn't add special requests as a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.490
field in our, in our band objects so

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.520
I can just say ignore those special requests.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.620
&gt;&gt; And the same thing with expected draw?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.120
&gt;&gt; Yes. And it tells you there that those values will

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.270
not be imported. That's fine and you can just click okay.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.930
&gt;&gt; Import now.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.230
&gt;&gt; Awesome. So, it's basically just going

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.580
to put it into a queue. It'll import

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.720
it when it can. And then you'll get an email, when it's done.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.620
&gt;&gt; Cool. All right, so, we're finished.
