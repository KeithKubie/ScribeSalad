00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.640
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.680
*sigh*

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.060
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.580
I have to admit, growing up, I wasn't really a Power Rangers kid.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240
I was more in that Ninja Turtles/X-Men kind of crowd.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.160
In fact, when the show first premiered, I remember saying to myself:

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.560
"There's no way this is gonna catch on. People can't possibly be this stupid!"

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.120
And this is why I'm not in the stock market.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.660
The show, about six bland teenagers who save the world from Japanese stock footage,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.840
was such a huge hit that they eventually made a movie about them in 1995.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.340
And does it suck balls?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.040
*oh yeah*

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.240
Major balls.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.940
In fact, the only difference between the movie version and the show...

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.220
...is that the movie version actually has a budget.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.960
But instead of using it on mind-blowing special effects and high-tech wizardry,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.600
they use it to go skydiving!

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.660
In fact, that's how the movie begins: with skydiving!

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.540
Like someone threw a whole bunch of money at the producers and they said:

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.480
"YEEHAW! We're goin' skydivin'!

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.640
Bring the camera along, I'm sure we'll fit it in the movie somehow!"

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.220
And as you probably would've guessed, it's an entirely pointless sequence.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.180
Now the first thing you Power Ranger fans might have noticed is the change in cast.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.000
In the film, we see there's a black girl and an Asian boy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.880
But wait a minute:

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.540
Wasn't there originally an Asian girl and a black boy?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.500
Well, the problem with that is that the black boy was put in the black suit...

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.880
...and the Asian girl was put in the yellow suit.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.120
*hiss*

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Not very politico-correcto.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.740
When the producers realized racial stereotyping isn't in at the moment, they got rid of the two actors,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.720
saying there was an intergalactic unemployment line that needed waiting in,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.580
and replaced them with the two you see now.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.960
However, the two cast members that sadly remain the same are Bulk and Skull,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.740
the supposed bullies of the group.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.700
Which I always found kind of strange.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.500
If they don't like the Power Rangers, and they're always picking on them,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.160
why do they hang out with them all the time?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.620
Kimberly:
Hey, guys!

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.540
Huh?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.680
Might wanna slip those on?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.360
*wah-wah fail horn*

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.780
The story, or some semblance thereof, is centered around a space-traveling villain named Ivan Ooze,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.000
who's just a little less annoying than Rita and Zedd, the Lucy and Ricky Ricardo of evil.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.200
Finally, a REAL man!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.140
*growls*

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.440
His plan is to hunt down and destroy the Power Rangers' intergalactic leader Zordon,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.940
who, despite having all the powers of the universe,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.240
still can't manage to sync up his voice with his lip movements.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640
Zordon:
It is good to see you again, too!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.080
Alpha:
AYIYIYIYI!

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.560
Oh, and I forgot about his little assistant, Alpha.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.780
The best way to describe him is, imagine C-3PO being even gayer than he already is.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.740
I know that's hard to fathom, but that's pretty much what you get.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.700
Things start heating up when Ooze starts destroying Zordon

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.540
for making him miss all the years of torment Earth has gone through.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.340
The Black Plague!

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.640
The Spanish Inquisition!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.920
...The Brady Bunch Reunion.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.860
I gotta admit, that's kind of funny.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.600
So Zordon's power is destroyed,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.460
and he's slowly wasting away into a festering ball of nothingness.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.900
But don't worry, that doesn't interrupt the Rangers' skydiving and rollerblading!

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.780
It does, however, take away their mighty morphin' powers.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.460
THAT seems to get their attention.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.780
Tommy:
We may not have our powers, but we’re still the Power Rangers!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.440
Mmm, I'm gonna disagree with you there, Tommy.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.120
You see, being a Power Ranger implies that you have actual POWER.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.120
So, WITHOUT power, you're just a plain old ranger.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.420
And trust me, they're not very powerful.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.920
Especially when trying to protect picnic baskets.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.220
Alphabet [?] tells them that the only way to save Zordon is to find the Great Power,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.840
that's located on a planet far, far away.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.320
The Great Power? Well, what's that?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.220
Where did it come from? How does it work?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.020
Well, this movie has far too many action sequences to worry about tiny little things like plot.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.080
However, it does take time to tap into our emotional sides.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.700
Kimberly:
Zordon, you can’t leave us!

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.100
Ever since you came into our lives, you've been like a father to us all.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.860
Yes, I think we can agree that Zordon has been like a father figure to us all...

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.860
WHERE are these kids' parents?!?

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.360
I mean seriously, do they ever show up?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.420
Are they so inattentive that they don't even know that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.600
their kids are on another planet, fighting giant black chickens?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.100
Do you think they even know that their kids are Power Rangers?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.460
How do you miss something like that?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.280
And just when you thought this movie couldn't get any lamer,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.300
take a look at what pops up next.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.860
*smack*

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.340
Discount Xena:
I am Dulcea, master warrior of the planet Phaedos.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.120
The planet WHAT?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.140
Come on, you could find more convincing names in a Star Trek word jumble.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.560
So apparently, she fights off the birds by swinging these two sticks together,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.900
throwing them into some kind of hypnotic trance.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.700
Yeah, how is that supposed to put you in a trance?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.920
Just taking two sticks and swinging them up and down, up and down, up and down...

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.760
...up and down... up and down... up and down...

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.660
...up and down... up and down... up and down... up and down...

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.520
...up and down... up and down... up—

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.400
*THWACK*

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.180
You win this round, Dulcea!

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.900
So she tells them that they have to travel to a giant phallic symbol that apparently holds the Great Power.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.340
To do that, she dresses them in fashionable burkas, and gives them the power of their new sacred animals.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.160
Dulcea:
You are the bear, fierce and unstoppable!

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.080
You are the wolf, cunning and swift!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.120
Adam, what's wrong?
-I'm a frog.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960
Yes, a frog! Like the one you kiss—

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.460
*smooch*

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.900
—to get a handsome prince.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.840
What the hell is that?

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.760
Kissing is my superpower? You shittin' me?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.580
They get the strength and the swift—I get KISSING?!?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.080
What kind of bullshit is that?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.000
*stammers* Don't let her get away with that!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.540
Stand up for yourself, maggot!

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.660
'Ey! 'Ey bitch, get back here!

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.060
Where's my REAL superpower?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.820
Hey! HEY!

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.080
HEEEEYY!!

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.440
Fuck this, man, I'm gonna go into anime.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.740
So the Power Rangers set out on a spiritual and enlightening journey,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.240
which I actually kinda like.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.840
It's good to see these kids look inside themselves, and discover their true spiritual essence.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.120
And what exactly do they learn on this journey of self-discovery?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.120
NOTHING!

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.200
They kick some ass, and they get their powers back. That's it.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.460
Bullshit!

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.140
That's like telling a kid the secret to enlightenment is punching somebody in the face.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.960
Which isn't that bad an idea right now!

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.140
As always, the Power Rangers have a thrilling giant robot fight in the middle of the city.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.120
The traditional toy robot models are replaced this time with CG replicas.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.400
And I never thought I'd say this, but after watching this metallic diarrhea,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.120
I think I actually prefer the toy robot models.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.960
There's also a subplot about how Ivan Ooze hypnotizes all the parents in the city

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.580
and forces them to jump off a cliff.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800
I'm sympathizing with them at this point.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.400
But don't worry, there's a little 12-year-old boy who knows how to operate a crane AND a monorail!

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.180
Where the hell did he pick THAT up?!

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.760
Was there a "How to Handle Heavy Machinery" class in grade school?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.200
If so, how did I miss THAT class?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.680
The battle eventually works itself up into outer space,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.980
where the mother of all finishing blows is thrown.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.300
*crunch*

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.140
DUDE! Did you just see that?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.420
*no more babies*

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.740
EEE—!

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.500
Real good lesson for the kids, guys!

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.700
If you can't overcome your enemies, just kick 'em in the happy sack, and they'll go down like anyone else.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.700
Top notch!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.760
Upon hitting an asteroid, Ivan Ooze is destroyed, and the Power Rangers fly off to save Zordon.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.120
But unfortunately, they're too late.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.700
Zordon is gone.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.020
If only they had gone to save him first,

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.480
instead of showing off their brand-new fighting moves and special effects.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.220
If only.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.600
If only...

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.660
Tommy:
Remember what we learned?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.760
To those who possess the Great Power...

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.420
...all things are possible.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.080
No Tommy, no, that—that's crazy talk!

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.700
Come on!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.600
Can it be?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.180
Is it possible?

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.760
*gasps*

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.060
*maudlin triumphant music*

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.200
Wait a minute...
*record scratch*

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.740
If the Great Power has the ability to do anything...

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.700
...couldn't they just use it to destroy Ivan Ooze in the first place?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.680
THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE!!!

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.580
Nothing about the Power Rangers does!

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.080
How come the monsters always land in the exact same city?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.360
How come the city turns into a canyon whenever the fight scene's about to happen?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.320
How come nobody recognizes the Rangers even though they wear the exact same colors every day?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.500
How come they always move like they have Tourette's syndrome?

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.160
How come Rita's voice never sounds right?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.300
How come they dress up like NASCAR mannequins?

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.820
How come it's sunny in space?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.000
How come Alpha's so gay?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.380
How come Kimberly's so hot?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.440
Why? Why? WHY???

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.240
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.100
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.040
♪Go Go Power Rangers!♪
