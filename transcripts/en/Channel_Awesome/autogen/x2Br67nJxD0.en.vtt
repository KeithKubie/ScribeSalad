00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
green agem and of that pop anyway so I'm
 

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
green agem and of that pop anyway so I'm
really<00:17:31.320><c> up</c><00:17:31.440><c> in</c><00:17:31.530><c> the</c><00:17:31.590><c> air</c><00:17:31.650><c> about</c><00:17:31.980><c> the</c><00:17:32.130><c> animation</c>

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:32.730 align:start position:0%
really up in the air about the animation
 

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.060 align:start position:0%
really up in the air about the animation
but<00:17:33.000><c> somewhere</c><00:17:33.900><c> in</c><00:17:34.020><c> the</c><00:17:34.110><c> middle</c><00:17:34.440><c> of</c><00:17:34.560><c> it</c><00:17:34.710><c> when</c>

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.070 align:start position:0%
but somewhere in the middle of it when
 

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
but somewhere in the middle of it when
they<00:17:35.220><c> go</c><00:17:35.370><c> to</c><00:17:35.430><c> the</c><00:17:35.730><c> ice</c><00:17:35.850><c> fortress</c><00:17:36.510><c> then</c><00:17:36.750><c> she</c>

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
they go to the ice fortress then she
 

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.300 align:start position:0%
they go to the ice fortress then she

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.050 align:start position:0%
I was a bit confused but they explained
 

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.370 align:start position:0%
I was a bit confused but they explained
later<00:17:55.350><c> at</c><00:17:55.650><c> least</c><00:17:55.830><c> they</c><00:17:56.040><c> allowed</c><00:17:56.280><c> to</c><00:17:57.170><c> to</c><00:17:58.170><c> show</c>

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
later at least they allowed to to show
 

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.650 align:start position:0%
later at least they allowed to to show
is<00:17:58.860><c> why</c><00:17:59.250><c> they</c><00:17:59.490><c> had</c><00:17:59.640><c> to</c><00:17:59.670><c> keep</c><00:17:59.910><c> the</c><00:18:00.060><c> two</c><00:18:00.180><c> separate</c>

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
is why they had to keep the two separate
 

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
is why they had to keep the two separate
but<00:18:00.870><c> then</c><00:18:00.990><c> when</c><00:18:01.110><c> you</c><00:18:01.200><c> see</c><00:18:01.350><c> how</c><00:18:01.410><c> people</c><00:18:01.680><c> react</c>

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:01.890 align:start position:0%
