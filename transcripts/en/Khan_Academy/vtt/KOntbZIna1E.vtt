00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.454
- [Voiceover] Welcome to
Official SAT Practice.

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:05.862
Khan Academy and the
College Board have teamed up

00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:08.484
to create the only SAT practice tool

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:11.550
developed with the
experts who write the SAT.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.442
It's personalized for each student.

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:15.830
Available any time, anywhere,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.705
and completely free.

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.154
We'll create personalized
practice recommendations for you.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.323
Based on your test
results from the PSAT89,

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.848
PSAT10,

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:27.464
PSATMMSQT,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:28.297
and SAT.

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:31.872
If you haven't already
taken a College Board test

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:35.398
you can take our short diagnostic
quizzes to get started.

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:38.446
Your practice plan will show
you where you already excel

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:41.076
and where you should focus your practice.

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:43.250
We'll also create a
practice schedule for you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.943
based on your test date.

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.453
We have tons of interactive
practice questions

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:48.805
developed with the College Board

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:51.639
that give you instant
feedback on your answers.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.621
As well as hints, and videos

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.790
to help you master your skills.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.508
Mini sections help you
practice under time pressure.

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:02.641
We have official practice
tests written by the

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.942
College Board.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.790
Taking at least two practice tests

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.218
will help you build the
experience and endurance

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:11.155
necessary to do well on test day.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:13.906
Join more than one million
students already using

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.739
Official SAT Practice.

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:19.277
- Khan Academy was probably the best way

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:20.774
that I can use the study.

00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:23.139
My math was below par.

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:25.061
Using Khan Academy built it up.

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:26.767
It improved my scores dramatically.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:28.210
- I like the leveling up.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.153
It kind of makes it a game.

00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:31.928
- I feel excited and prepared
because it's something that

00:01:31.928 --> 00:01:33.887
I've already seen, I've
already read through it.

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:36.305
So, when I take it I'm gonna do it well.
