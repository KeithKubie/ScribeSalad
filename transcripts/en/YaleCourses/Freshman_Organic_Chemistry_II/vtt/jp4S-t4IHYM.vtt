WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.660
Okay.
So we've started talking about,
uh,

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.010
the mechanism about carbon eel chemistry.
Uh,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.290
we'll talk today about addition to Carbon Eel,

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:14.070
that mechanism and equilibrium constant about protecting groups.

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.580
A little bit of Nmr review at the end if we have time.

6
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.030
And if we really have time,
a little bit about the next topic,

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.650
which is oxidation and reduction is involves carbon groups in electron
transfers.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.720
Uh,
so last time we,
uh,

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.130
took an overview of basic carbon eel reactivity,
right?

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.750
That you can have edition,
you can have addition where the nucleophile attacks,

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.970
that's a,
the old burgee done at story.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.470
And then the acid AA comes on to oxygen and you complete it.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.510
Or you can do it the other direction.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.260
You can start with the acid protonating the oxygen first or whatever acid it is,

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
uh,
and then,
uh,
to give a cat oxygen cad I and that stabilized,

16
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.160
uh,
by the,
uh,
double bond,

17
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.580
you can draw a resonance structure with plus on carbon and the nucleophile comes

18
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:05.730
in.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.690
So there are two ways of doing it initially with the nucleophile initially with

20
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:13.800
an acid,
right?
And we saw that you,

21
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.630
if you have an Alpha hydrogen,

22
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.090
then it's possible to pull it off with base to make an eternal eight and put it

23
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.930
on the back on the oxygen,
right?
So that's,

24
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.470
you can do an Al Lilly rearrangement to an eternal,

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.040
it can be base catalyzed via the EDA late.

26
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.260
It also could be acid catalyzed.

27
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.370
You could first put the Proton on the oxygen and then take it off the Alpha

28
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:42.990
carbon.
Okay.
Uh,
you can also,

29
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.991
because having that functionality ina late an anti and at the Alpha carbon or

30
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.560
the double bond of the Enal,
you can also do alpha substitution.

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.910
So we'll see examples of that.
And if you have a leaving group,

32
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.670
the thing is called an acid derivative,
right?

33
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.690
And you can replace it by a nucleophile by in the two step reaction,

34
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.170
first add to the carbon eel,
then remove the nucleophile.

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.910
So nuclear Felix substitution of acid derivatives,
uh,

36
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.470
and in the case of carboxylic acids,
right?

37
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.640
You can have addition,
of course,
just as we did before.
Uh,

38
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
you can have substitution at carbon where you make a new carbon oxygen bond,

39
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.960
or you can have substitution at oxygen where you make a new,
Oh,
our bond,

40
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.620
right?
And again,
if you have an Alpha carbon,

41
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.470
it's possible to do substitution at the Alpha carbon.

42
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.870
And we'll see examples of that.
Now,

43
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.470
one particular example is what's called Fischer esterification,

44
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:47.910
which was invented,
you'll not be surprised to hear by Emile Fisher,
right?

45
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.280
And it's substitution at carbon on a,

46
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.470
of a carboxylic acid to convert it into an Ester,
right?

47
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.830
And it's acid catalyzed.
So let's think about how this work.

48
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.530
Where's the acid going to come in and protonate this

49
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.953
<v 1>Carl?
Yes,</v>

50
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.510
there are two of the Os that's connected by the same alarm.

51
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.210
How do you know,
why should it do that one?
Um,

52
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.830
because water is a good leaving group can send so that,
oh,
just um,

53
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270
put the age or even at the protons,

54
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.480
<v 0>I'm asking him where are the best place to protonate is,</v>

55
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.340
<v 1>um,
that uh,
has,
um,</v>

56
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.830
has the,
um,
come on pairs.

57
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.360
How about the oxygen on top else's and terrace.
So,
um,

58
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.260
let's look at what would happen if you brought,

59
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.740
<v 0>if you,
if you brought the Proton in on top,</v>

60
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.440
you'd get that cat eye in.

61
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.690
Anything good about that one that you can have it be protonate the bottom one.

63
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.930
Anybody see Debbie?

64
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.780
You can get residents stabilization of that one.

65
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.570
<v 0>Why protonate this one instead of that one?
Well,</v>

66
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.280
notice in the start that this act,

67
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.630
this unshared pear is stabilized by that,

68
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.330
right to buy the low Lumo next door.

69
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:20.250
So that makes it a little harder to protonate right?
On the other hand,

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.430
the one that's up here is it could be a lower energy one if it were in those

71
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.690
rabid he or sp square or a.

72
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.280
So that would suggest that this one might be better,
right?

73
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:37.281
But it's killed by that and when you protonate but notice this stability you get

74
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:40.170
there gets even more.

75
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.080
So when you protonate on the top right,

76
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:46.870
whatever stabilization you had of this unshared payer before you protonated it,

77
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.690
you have more now because you have a lower Lumo to stabilize it.

78
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.120
So you get that special stabilization,

79
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:58.340
which you can draw by a resonance structure,
that resonance structure.
I,

80
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.280
so you in fact protonate the top,
not the bottom.
Okay?

81
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.440
So once you've done that,
then you can bring in an alcohol and attack the carbon.

82
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:11.700
It's going to be easy to attack.
Now since a very low Lumo and then lose.

83
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.050
So you get a tetrahedral intermediate,
you started with a trigonal carbon,

84
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:20.160
three atoms attached to it.
Now there are four.
It's a tetrahedral intermediate.

85
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.030
So notice that as opposed to sn two substitution,

86
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.380
this one first does an addition,
right?

87
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.860
And then loses the leaving group.
They're not both happening at the same time.

88
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.710
So the,
and that's in that sense,

89
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.770
it's analogous to nuclear Philly aromatic substitution.

90
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.870
Here's the nucleophile that comes in,

91
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.380
forms a tetra coordinated carbon.

92
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.410
And then this one is going to leave here.

93
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.470
The amine came in form to a tetra coordinated carbon from the one that had only

94
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.810
three things when the fluorine was down here,
right?

95
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.910
And now this is strictly analogous to that.
What,

96
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.990
what we do next as lose a proton from here and then lose the fluoride right

97
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.270
here.
We're going to lose a proton from here and then lose hydroxide.

98
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.720
So we lose the Proton.
Now of course you don't,

99
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.380
there's an easier way than losing hydroxide directly.

100
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.540
Now you can do what you want to do,
Carl

101
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.480
to that opposite to your favorite oxygen there right now.

102
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.040
Now you've got the leaving group,

103
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.580
but the first protonation was up here and you went through that tetrahedral

104
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.414
intermediate.

105
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.380
It wasn't a case of making this a leaving group and then doing something like an

106
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:34.280
sn two,

107
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.740
you first did an addition to the carbon eel and then eliminate,
uh,

108
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.450
eliminate the,
uh,
the water.
And of course the proton comes off again.

109
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.420
Okay?
So that's the mechanism of,
of um,

110
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.020
of Fischer esterification.
And of course you can run it either direction,

111
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.680
you can run it forwards or backwards.
It's a way of replacing,
oh,

112
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.550
are on the acid,
uh,
carbon,

113
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.340
the carbon yield carbon.
And you can do it with where,

114
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.290
where are his h as well as where our is is some al group.

115
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.330
So you can go either way,
traded them back and forth.
So you,

116
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.980
the way you decide to get Esther rather than getting acid,

117
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.000
which way are you going to go is to have a lot more alcohol than water there.

118
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.980
So you'd drive the equilibrium one way.

119
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.100
If you turn it around and have a lot more water than alcohol,

120
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.170
you'll drive it the other way.
Okay.
So that's fisheries,
their vacation.

121
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.140
Now Victor Meyer we saw last time is the,
uh,

122
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.440
short term supervisor of Moses Gomberg.

123
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.170
And remember what Gomberg did in his lab?

124
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.160
He made Tetra fennel methane,
right.

125
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:48.161
Which was hard to make because it was so sterically hindered as we found out in

126
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.710
trying to make it with models last time.
But it was fact.

127
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:56.711
It was Victor Meyer here introduced the idea of steric hindrance in 1894.

128
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.880
He wrote the source of this behavior is stereo chemical,

129
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.760
the space filling of the neighboring groups.

130
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.560
So this was something else that was ahead to the organic model in the 19th

131
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:12.020
century that we didn't really discuss last time.

132
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.090
We discussed configuration,
the things involving arrangement in space.

133
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.661
Right.

134
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:22.640
Which was [inaudible] in 1874 we talked about strained rings strain.

135
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:27.230
That was buyer 1885 and we talked about confirmation,

136
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.260
which socksy tried unsuccessfully to introduce into the discussion in 1891 but

137
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.771
Meyer had the idea of steric hindrance and he said the source of this behavior,

138
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.060
what was this behavior?
What was it?
The basis of his proposing steric hindrance.

139
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.370
It was Fischer esterification in this situation where it doesn't work,

140
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.010
right?
So it doesn't work for two six dimethyl benzoic acid.

141
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.040
When you have a methyl group here in a methyl group here adjacent to that,

142
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.270
then you can't do Fischer esterification.
All right.

143
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.793
Now,
why not?

144
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.210
You can clearly start out here by bringing in a proton and putting it on there.

145
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.800
No problem.
Right?
Where do you get into trouble?
Do you see?

146
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.070
<v 1>I'll try again.
Um,</v>

147
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.840
when you're going to have to bring in the org because it's going to have to

148
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:26.600
attack from like that way.
It's going to have to come in from here where this

149
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.640
<v 0>c is and you're going to try to make that into a tetrahedral carbon with three s</v>

150
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.590
extra substituents on it,
right?
So it's going to earth,
it's going to have the,

151
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.670
the uh,
it's going to have whatever just came in,
right?
So I'm,

152
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:44.440
Oh,
our group plus this wouldn't protonate it in this one.

153
00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:45.880
Protonated right?

154
00:09:45.881 --> 00:09:49.060
So you've got to get all of these three things here where that's not an age,

155
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:49.601
right?

156
00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:54.601
That's whatever just came in right adjacent to these two things and it's quite

157
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:56.830
crowded as you can see here,
that there's,

158
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.090
that there's going to be strain involved in these things running into one

159
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:04.780
another.
So you can't get to the tetrahedral intermediate of the,

160
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.910
of the Fischer esterification.

161
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.720
And this was actually the basis of the first suggestion that there was such a

162
00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:15.100
thing as steric hindrance.
Okay?
So,
uh,

163
00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:20.101
this tetrahedral intermediate is hard to make if r is really big and crowded,

164
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.580
okay?
But there's a way to,
to make the ester nonetheless.

165
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.360
And it was invented by a guy who sat in some of your seats.

166
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:31.840
I don't know which seat he sat in when he was a student here cause it was a long

167
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:36.190
time ago.
So you can't do that.
We can't do Fischer esterification that way.

168
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.260
But Melvin Newman,

169
00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:43.261
who's picture we showed last semester figured out in 1941 how to do this.

170
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.020
And he did it by putting the acid into concentrated sulfuric acid.

171
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.780
All right,
now what happens when you put it into concentrated sulfuric acid,

172
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.880
<v 1>Carlson,
so pulled into concentrated acid,</v>

173
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:03.630
it's going to protonate it.
Where will it protonate it?
Um,

174
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.660
topic,
right?

175
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.140
<v 0>Wrong again.
No,
actually you're right.
Of course you do.</v>

176
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:12.974
Protonated that.

177
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.010
<v 0>Put it in 100% and sulfuric acid,
you do protonate it on the top,</v>

179
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.610
right for the same reason that we went through before,

180
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.600
but once in awhile you were right originally,

181
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.410
once in awhile it'll protonate on the bottom,

182
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.910
the one you wanted.
And what's good about that?
It's a leaving group,

183
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.400
right?
So in fact,
that can now go away,
right?

184
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.110
Now,
of course,
it could come back again,
right?

185
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.460
But in concentrated sulfuric acid,

186
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.360
water is all protonated,
right?

187
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.950
And as long as it's protonated,
it can't come back.
It doesn't have the High Homo,

188
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.070
right?
So in fact,
you can make this thing,
which is called an ace,

189
00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:07.390
silly of Ion,
right?

190
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.970
And now what he does is take this concentrated sulfuric acid and pour it

191
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.810
carefully into water.
Or pardon me,
into alcohol,

192
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.590
right?
So as he pours it into alcohol,

193
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.300
it's no longer concentrated sulfuric acid,
right?
So the acid,

194
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.580
so you won't be able to make these things anymore.

195
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.990
But alcohol rather than water is the thing that will get the carbon,

196
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.180
right?
So then you'll,
uh,
that inhibits the reversal,

197
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.014
as we just said,

198
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.470
and you pour it into our h and now the OLR traps it and you'll lose a proton and

199
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:47.830
you've made the Ester.
But notice the difference here,

200
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:52.600
you made it by dissociation followed by association when it's crowded,

201
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.590
right?

202
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:58.510
The Normal Fischer esterification is association and then dissociation.

203
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.510
But by doing it in real strong sulfuric acid,

204
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.590
Newman figured out how to do this and the very,
very hindered cases.

205
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.990
Okay.
So now,
uh,
hydration,
uh,
of of uh,

206
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.050
carbon eel groups,
which can be done either acid or base.

207
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.440
And that was a note to myself,
which I forgot to take out.

208
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.450
So let's talk about acid catalyzed hydration of formaldehyde.

209
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.850
So I want somebody to help me out on here.

210
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:27.970
Here at down at the bottom we have formaldehyde and water.

211
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.270
And what I want to do is add to get the hydrate as it's called of the Aldehyde,

212
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.780
right?

213
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.780
The dial that's a hydrate or a gem dial that do o h is on the same carbon.

214
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.430
So how do we do that?
Here we have,
we have,
it's acid catalyzed,

215
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.090
it's hydration.
So we have water and it's formaldehyde.

216
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.980
How are we going to begin here,

217
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.810
<v 1>Amy?
What?
You said</v>

218
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.920
it's acid catalyzed and what's going to happen?

219
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.080
[inaudible] where are we going to protonate it

220
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.120
[inaudible]

221
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.890
<v 0>that on and now we have that,
which is a nice stable cad ion,
right?</v>

222
00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:35.390
It's a resonance stabilized.
Okay.
What's going to happen next?

223
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.483
<v 1>They keep us going.</v>

224
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.360
[inaudible]

225
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.630
<v 0>oh man,
back the cat ion.
So now we got that</v>

226
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.470
<v 1>and finally we're getting pretty close to the product.
What do we have to do?</v>

227
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.080
So you just have to lose the proton though.

228
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.170
<v 0>And you know,
it doesn't just fly off and alcohol will take it or something.
Okay.</v>

229
00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:11.830
Or water.
Okay,
so we've done it.
Okay.

230
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.010
So that's acid catalyzed hydration to formaldehyde.

231
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.330
Now how about base catalyzed hydration of Formaldehyde?

232
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.450
Uh,
need someone to help us here,
Laura.
And how about you?

233
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.950
<v 1>So what's going to attack one?</v>

234
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.270
[inaudible]

235
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.240
we got base for catalyst.
Notice we got the h plus back again here.

236
00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:39.350
It was catalytic,
right?
Hey minute first came out again.

237
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.480
So o h minus is going to come in at first to come out again.

238
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.340
It's base capitalized and we got water,
we got an Aldehyde.
What are we got?

239
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.030
In fact the VOA

240
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.160
[inaudible] on which APP?

241
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.900
Overseas.
Pardon me?
On the seat,
right?

242
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:04.260
This is our old favorite attack.
You

243
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.223
<v 0>pies star.</v>

244
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.420
So that'll come down there and you already got that.

245
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.730
But what we need is a hydrate

246
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.430
<v 1>the gem dial.
So what's going to happen next?</v>

247
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.180
What do we need in order to get there?

248
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.920
To get from here to here?
What Adam do we need

249
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.290
proton?
Where do we go for water

250
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.240
<v 0>base?
Right?
So we're not going to get it from h plus,
right?</v>

251
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:40.140
We're going to get it from water.
So the water will come down,
do an sn,

252
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:43.260
two type reaction.
That hydrogen substitution,
that hydrogen,

253
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.420
and we got the product and hydroxide,

254
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:49.260
which comes back and catalyzes another one lives to fight another day.

255
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.690
Okay?
So either acid or base catalyzed,
uh,
uh,

256
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.280
schemes will work for that.

257
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.810
Now how about independent of which catalysts you use?

258
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.020
They're going to be an equilibrium constant between water plus the Aldehyde and

259
00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:08.760
the dial,
the gym,
dial the hydrate.

260
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.770
And as luck would have it for asset Aldehyde,
the one which has c,

261
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.980
h three and h on the carbon eel,
the equilibrium constant is one.

262
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.650
And now we're going to see how that equilibrium constant changes as we change

263
00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:26.550
what,
what kind of Aldehyde or ketone we're dealing with.
Okay?

264
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.800
So suppose we have formaldehyde.

265
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.810
I want someone to predict for me whether this equilibrium constant is going to

266
00:17:33.811 --> 00:17:35.580
be greater than one or less than one.

267
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:44.060
<v 1>Can anybody see any factors that will be relevant?
Alex,</v>

268
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:46.550
can you see a dip?
We want differences between them.

269
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.310
<v 0>Listen,
this or between this and that.</v>

270
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:53.370
It's going to make one or the other more stable and therefore change the

271
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:54.480
equilibrium constant.

272
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.180
<v 1>That's a good point.</v>

273
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.070
<v 0>This angle gets smaller here,
right?
So this ch three could run into the age,</v>

274
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.590
but also,
uh,
uh,

275
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.190
the ch three gets more crowded because we got two o's on here now.

276
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.600
So that's a good point.
But it's the one that I've animated second.
Okay.

277
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:17.070
Which way is that going to change it?

278
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.000
<v 1>Is it going to make an equal or greater or less than one?</v>

279
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.310
<v 0>It'll make,</v>

280
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.880
it'll make this one less energetic than that was right.

281
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.310
Lower in energy.
So that'll tend to shift it to the right.
Okay.
Any other factors?

282
00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:36.580
How about anything on the left?
Anybody see anything there

283
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.720
between this and this?

284
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.580
Notice that here we have an sp squared bond to carbon,

285
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.620
and here we have an sp squared bond to hydrogen,
Carl.

286
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.090
<v 1>Oh,
with the methyl will be more like chunk,
chunk.
Uh,</v>

287
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.690
<v 0>generally electrons consider carbon is considered donating,</v>

288
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.870
but that's not the factor,
right?

289
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.210
The strength of bond.

290
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.990
Remember the strength of the carbon carbon bond depends on hybridization.

291
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.410
The strength of the carbon hydrogen bond depends on hybridization,

292
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.040
but the carbon carbon bond is more sensitive to hybridization.

293
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.150
Get stronger when you go sp squared than the carbon hydrogen does.

294
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.800
So this,
this one was a stronger bond than that one other,

295
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.410
uh,
has to with respect to the SP squared hybridization,
right?

296
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.710
So that made this one low and this one was high originally because Astirix as we

297
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:38.310
said,

298
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.310
now we've got this one is now a higher and this one is lower.

299
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.600
So it should shift it to the right.

300
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.460
And indeed both the bond strength that we just talked about and the steric

301
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:51.900
hindrance,
right?

302
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.820
Both suggest that it should shift to the right.
And it does.
That's a,

303
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.280
it's 20,000.
The equilibrium constant.
Now let's,

304
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.360
let's try this way.

305
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:08.130
Let's look at acetone to ch threes now,
what do you think?

306
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.550
How about,
how about on the left?
Is this,

307
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.060
is this going to be a better or worse than before?

308
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.740
<v 1>Then the ones above</v>

309
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.660
[inaudible]

310
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.570
<v 0>it's got two of these carbon carbon bonds that are especially strong.</v>

311
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:31.000
So this is good on the left.
How about on the right,

312
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.160
right.
There's even more steric hindrance,
right?

313
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.670
So that one should go to the left from one and in fact it goes,

314
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.930
it goes the other way,
right?
By a factor of 2000 or a thousand roughly.

315
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.910
Okay.
Now look at,
let's look at this.

316
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:50.800
Let's put chlorine on the,

317
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.120
on the a methyl group on top right now.

318
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.250
Uh,
does anybody have any ideas about that?

319
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.753
<v 2>Okay,</v>

320
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.240
<v 0>so the,
the fact of the chlorine will change this bond.</v>

321
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.470
It will also change that bond,
right?
Because its electron withdrawing.

322
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.160
So where can it withdraw electrons better from,

323
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.490
can withdraw electrons better from an sp squared or from an s p cubed bond?

324
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.550
Where does it withdraw better?
Cassie,
you've got an idea

325
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.300
which is the more likely to donate electrons,

326
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.030
s B cubed or sp squared,

327
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.760
which one is going to hold the electrons tighter?

328
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.683
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

329
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.391
<v 0>right.</v>

330
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:40.500
The one with more s will hold tighter and not be willing to give him up so of

331
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:44.420
chlorine and wants to get them.
It's going to get them better,
uh,

332
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.380
from here than from here.
So it should shift the equilibrium in that direction.

333
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.840
So the electron donation and it shifts it not nearly by factors of a thousand,

334
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.280
but by a factor of 37 okay.
Compared dope when I didn't,

335
00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:01.110
when I had an h instead of a chlorine.

336
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.680
Now suppose we have three Koreans.

337
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.890
Obviously the same direction should happen,
but how big should it be?

338
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.080
Sebastian?
Do you got an idea?

339
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.373
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

340
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.510
<v 0>If one chlorine did 37 a factor of 37 so it changed the,</v>

341
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.100
it changed the free energy difference enough to make a factor of 37 right.

342
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.780
What should they do more?
Do,

343
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.290
what should one board suppose if we just put one more in how,
what,
why,

344
00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:41.320
what factors should we

345
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.273
<v 2>Theresa,
do you think,</v>

346
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.790
<v 0>bear in mind that if you make the same energy change,
right,</v>

347
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.950
that trans,
because it's an an exponent for an equilibrium.
The energy,
right?

348
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.370
It's a certain factor,
right?
Because if you add things in exponents,

349
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.730
it's like multiplying things,
right?

350
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:09.250
So if one changes it by 37 the second one,
if things are simple,

351
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:13.810
would change it by a factor of 37 and the third would change it by another

352
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:17.980
factor of 37 so if we go all the way from one to three,

353
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.270
by what factor should we include?
Increase the equilibrium constant.

354
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.310
37 squared.
Is everybody with me on that?
Okay.
Now,

355
00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:33.210
37 squared is a little bigger than a thousand right?

356
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:34.381
And look at that.

357
00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:39.381
It's 28,000 that's better than we had any reason to expect.

358
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.500
Okay.
But it makes sense.
And finally,

359
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.410
what if we have benzene as the substituent?
So Benzaldehyde,

360
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.570
right?
Is that gonna shift it right or left?
What do you think

361
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.620
<v 1>Arvin?
Do you have an idea?</v>

362
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.200
<v 0>Where will the fennel be stabilizing things more on the right or on the left?</v>

363
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.170
<v 1>Why?
Right?
Because you're going to have</v>

364
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.730
<v 0>homo Lumo interaction between the carbon eel and the Pi System as the benzene</v>

365
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.110
ring.
So it should shift things to the left.

366
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.580
Conjugation should stabilize the Aldehyde.
And in fact it does.

367
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.190
It's a factor of a hundred,
right?
Instead of one,

368
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.310
it's 0.01 so it shifted it to the left.

369
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.610
So all these make sense in terms of what we understand of what controls,

370
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.550
uh,
molecular energy.
Okay.

371
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:38.170
Now ask the towel formation,
uh,

372
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.940
happens only with acids.

373
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.250
And I think that this is the one,
oh no.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now,

374
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.060
so let's,

375
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:52.060
let's look at at acid catalyzed Hemi Ke Tau formation from formaldehyde.

376
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.800
This is closely related to a slide that I just showed you.
Okay?

377
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.960
So what we have is we want to get from the Aldehyde to this,

378
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:08.190
right?
A hemi key towel,
right?
And what was,
so what we,

379
00:25:08.191 --> 00:25:13.190
it's acid catalyzed roa.
H is going to add to this.
And how's it going to happen?

380
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.780
Well,
let's not mess around here,
right?
Let's just go there.
Okay,

381
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.150
so we protonate just as we did last time when we were adding water,
right?

382
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.450
Alcohol comes in forums,
the bond.
Bingo.

383
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:30.560
We lose the Proton.
It's catalytic,

384
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.790
right?
And we have the product,
okay?
Nobody's surprised by that.
I'm doing,

385
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.770
I'm belaboring this.
I realize we did the same thing last time.

386
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:44.120
Essentially we did the reaction going the other direction.
Now I'm going back.

387
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.100
But uh,
but it's really important that you get this.
Okay?

388
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:54.050
Now base catalyzed,
we can do this just like with water,
right?
We bring that in.

389
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.080
May attack the Pi star yet that it takes a proton this time from alcohol instead

390
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:04.460
of from water.
And we have the Hemi Quito.
So fine.
Okay.

391
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.750
But suppose what we wanted to do was get the key towel,
not the Hemi he town.

392
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.610
Okay.
Now notice that that Proton can attack either oxygen.

393
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.010
It could either protonate Orr,

394
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.190
in which case what would happen if you then broke a bond?

395
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.620
You see which way where you're going.

396
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.910
If you protonate Oh r and then break the bond between o and c

397
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.980
<v 1>have alcohol,
leave Amy,
and you're just going,
let's go.</v>

398
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.650
<v 0>You're going right back where you started,</v>

399
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.710
but you can protonate this one as well as that one.

400
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.360
So if you protonate this one and lose water,
right,
then you can,

401
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.160
instead of reversing,
you can continue,
right?
So you,

402
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.800
you lose water and you get that stable cad ion.

403
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.810
Just like this stable cat I had accepted has an r on it instead of the age,

404
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.040
right?

405
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.760
And then you bring another alcohol in and do your trick and you got the full key

406
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:59.250
towel.
Fine.
We talked last time we went,

407
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.670
spent a lot of time going from the key towel back to the carbon eel.

408
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.640
Now we're just going the other direction,
reversing all of them.

409
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.810
Now let's try to do the same thing with basic Attallah sis.
Is it gonna work?

410
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.610
What's,
what's the first step going backwards for basic analysis.

411
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.040
If we want to start from here and go backwards,

412
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:21.570
what's the first thing that happens,

413
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.973
<v 2>Linda?</v>

414
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:30.030
<v 0>The base will pull off the Proton right here though.
The,</v>

415
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:32.910
the acid could protonate either oxygen,

416
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.920
but here when the base has to pull off a proton,
there's only one to pull off.

417
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:41.550
It can't pull it off from the R and you can't do an sn two.

418
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.530
The pulling of pulling the are off would be like doing an sn two reaction where

419
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:49.620
I drop side attacks,
the Ar and this old leaves.

420
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:52.740
But that's a terrible leaving group.
That's not a good one,
right?

421
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.020
So it can only take.
So,
uh,
the ether ethers are inert to base.

422
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:03.000
They don't undergo sn two reaction.
So it can only reverse.
It can't go on,

423
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.830
right?
So you can get a key towel by acid Catholicism,
but you can't,

424
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:12.780
you can only get a Hemi Ke Tau with base catalysis.
Right?
And furthermore,

425
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.420
not only is there no way to get the key towel,

426
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.690
but you can't attack the key towel with base either.

427
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.020
Once you've got the key towel,
it's Ah,

428
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:26.010
it won't attack with base because you can't attack ethers with the base.
Right?

429
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.840
So you,
it's,
it's the old joke.
You can't get there from here.
Right.

430
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.020
Base will not do it with the,

431
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.380
with key towels either making them or taking them apart again.
Okay.

432
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.750
Now,
uh,

433
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.150
this relates to protecting groups and I'm going to do this on the board.

434
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.430
Uh,
if I were talking about pedagogy,

435
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:50.700
I would say it's good for me occasionally to draw these things just so you can

436
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:55.080
see a human draw them rather than have them all animated there.
But in fact,

437
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:57.090
I didn't have time to do this last night.

438
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.210
So there we go.

439
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.343
<v 2>Uh,</v>

440
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.700
so let's take this off a bit.

441
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.120
<v 0>So we're going to look at key towels as protecting groups.</v>

442
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.120
Just a couple of examples.
There are plenty of examples in the book.

443
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.233
<v 2>Okay.</v>

444
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.150
<v 0>Now are particularly interesting.
Compound is glucose.</v>

445
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:32.983
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.360
<v 0>Which is an Aldehyde and an alcohol.
In fact,
it's a,</v>

447
00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:42.790
it has many alcohol groups.
It's got Oah.
Oh,

448
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:47.560
a chair.
Oh,
a chair.
Oh,
H here.

449
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.510
Now remember the,
uh,
the,
uh,

450
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:01.590
key towel or Hemi Aquis towel is formed by reaction of an alcohol with the

451
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:05.650
Aldehyde.
But now we don't have to add an alcohol.

452
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:10.270
We've got alcohols in there already to react with the Aldehyde.
Right.
In fact,

453
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:14.860
we got plenty of them.
And the question is,
which one right now,

454
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.450
if we were to react this oxygen to make a ring with this carbon,

455
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.740
then how many Adams would be in the ring?
How big a ring would it be?

456
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.870
It would have the oxygen,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven.

457
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.670
It would be a seven membered ring.

458
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:35.950
Seven membered rings are not so easy to form because they pucker up and things

459
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:40.030
on opposite sides run into one another.
Right?
So that's not so good.

460
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.900
Obviously if you use this one to attack the carbon,

461
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:46.390
it would be a three member during.
That's bad.
That's strange.

462
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:47.830
This one would be a four membered ring,

463
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.070
but this one would be a five membered ring.
That's not so bad.

464
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:53.230
This one would be a six membered ring and that's good.

465
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.300
So let's see how we could do that.
If we,
if we made a Hemi Aquis towel,

466
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.870
we could have,
uh,
see,
uh,

467
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.980
uh Oh h h a s c o h.

468
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.930
Coh.
I'll just draw it that way.
C O h I'll draw that way.

469
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.440
See and now and down here,
ch,

470
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.440
two o h and now this,

471
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.750
this oxygen has to go to there.
So I could draw it this way.

472
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.270
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

473
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.560
<v 0>but nobody thinks,
I'm trying to draw what it actually looks like.
In fact,</v>

474
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.440
it's a six membered ring.
It would look like a cyclohexane,

475
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.030
but just for purposes of showing what's bonded to what it's often drawn that
way.

476
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.530
Okay.
So that would be a Hemi key towel.
And it's six membered ring

477
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.320
six ring.
And that thing is called appearances

478
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.650
<v 2>when it's a six membered ring.
Right</v>

479
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.050
<v 0>now if it were this carbon,
then we would have c,</v>

480
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.100
h o h and we'd come down here and we'd have ch two o h and we'd have,

481
00:32:19.111 --> 00:32:20.100
Ooh,
here.

482
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:27.560
And we'd have c h o here coming out.
Oh,
here.

483
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.023
<v 2>Okay.</v>

484
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.880
<v 0>And we'd have o,
h and o,
h and this would be one,</v>

485
00:32:34.881 --> 00:32:36.950
two,
three,
four,
five membered ring.

486
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

487
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.970
<v 0>And that's called a fewer no's.</v>

488
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:44.983
<v 2>Uh,</v>

489
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.043
okay.

490
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.840
<v 0>It could go either way.</v>

491
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.920
And they're reversible still because we know that with either acid or base,

492
00:32:59.171 --> 00:33:03.670
catalin says you can go back and forth between Hemi key towels.
And,
and,

493
00:33:03.671 --> 00:33:07.060
and the carbonyl group.
Uh,
okay.

494
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:10.960
Now how could you find out which rings size it is?

495
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.700
Well,
the way it's actually done nowadays is by Nmr.
Right.

496
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.920
But in the old days when they didn't have an Emr,

497
00:33:22.921 --> 00:33:26.100
they had to do chemical transformations to figure out what was what.

498
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.470
So chemical degradation.

499
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.193
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

500
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.790
<v 0>So one thing they could do would be to treat it with acid</v>

501
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.230
and alcohol,
say method hall.

502
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:59.290
So acid can protonate an ooh and then lose water to leave at cad.

503
00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:04.340
I am right.
But it turns out that only one of the,

504
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.930
that one of the ox of the ohs reacts much more rapidly than the others.

505
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:15.050
Which one is easy to protonate and,
and,
and lose water.

506
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:18.050
So as to generate a stable cad.
I,
okay.

507
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:21.410
If we say we protonated this one,
for example,

508
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.070
we generate a secondary cad.
I am protonate this one secondary cad.

509
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:30.020
I listen secondary cad,
I and this and primary cad.
I am not so good.
This one.

510
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:34.880
What would happen if we protonated that won
and lost water?

511
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.950
I'll write it down below here.
So we had uh,

512
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.980
Oh h h this,
oh down here,

513
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.153
et cetera.

514
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.860
Suppose I protonated this one and lost water

515
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.643
<v 2>right</v>

516
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.280
<v 0>here is the cat eye and I would,</v>

517
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.163
<v 2>yeah.</v>

518
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.560
<v 0>And then I could bring methanol in to put the oxygen on there,</v>

519
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:09.010
lose the proton from methanol and I would have made what?

520
00:35:09.011 --> 00:35:13.480
Functional group if I now have,
oh,
instead of,
Ooh,

521
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.010
up here I have och three.
Everyone sees how I did that,
don't I?

522
00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:21.370
It's the same thing we've been doing all the time.
You protonate lose water,

523
00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:25.120
put the alcohol on Louis Proton that replaces Ooh,
with LR.

524
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.620
Why did it do it there and not do it at all these other places.

525
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.070
What was specially good about this cat?
I am

526
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.190
that the others didn't have

527
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.273
<v 1>Chris.</v>

528
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.890
<v 0>Let me draw,
I'll draw the cat eye in here.
Uh,
are here.</v>

529
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.570
So the cat eye and has an o on it,
an h on it,

530
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.410
a carbon on it.
Plus what's good about and this,

531
00:35:54.411 --> 00:35:57.990
this one goes down then to the bottom.
What's good about that cat ion,

532
00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.990
<v 1>Chris?
Pardon me?</v>

533
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.070
<v 0>It's secondary.
If you want to consider an oxygen as if it were carbon,</v>

534
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.500
but so were all these other secondary,
right?

535
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:11.340
If you protonated those in lost water,
what's especially good about this one,

536
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.920
<v 1>if you have an electrode was dry.
Is that good?</v>

537
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.630
<v 0>The cad ion,
if you have something that's electron withdrawing,</v>

538
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.130
that means it's already positive.
It doesn't want to get more positive.

539
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.870
So the electron withdrawal by the oxygen is going to be bad for this,

540
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.660
but there's something that makes a good Brandon,

541
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.490
<v 1>right?</v>

542
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.110
<v 0>The unshared pair on the oxygen is stabilized by this vacant orbital,
right?</v>

543
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:44.010
You can draw a resonance structure that puts a double bond here and plus on the

544
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:47.750
oxygen.
Okay,
so this one is the one that's,

545
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.760
that's reactive to make a key towel,
right?
This thing is a key talents.

546
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.650
Got Two o our groups on it,
right?
And that one,

547
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:59.610
we could make a key towel too up here,
of course,
and not the other places.

548
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.600
So we can make a key towel right now.
Uh,

549
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.110
it's possible under those circumstances to do reactions with alcohol's right.

550
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:14.730
Do Chew up the other alcohols but not chew up this one,
right?

551
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.640
Because that alcohol is,
is now in the form of och three,

552
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.410
right,
if you will.
We're talking about reactions next class,
right?

553
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:29.580
That involve reactions of alcohols,
oxidation,
for example.
Okay,

554
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.910
so this is protecting that particular carbon from being reacted by having a full

555
00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:39.140
Ke Tau there.
Now,
then you can take it,

556
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.660
take it apart again by treating it with acid and water,

557
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.210
get it back and see what compound you have.

558
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.800
Which of the oxygens in that chain got oxidized and which ones were not

559
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:50.491
oxidized?

560
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:55.110
Compare with known compounds and you know what the size of the ring was because

561
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:56.700
uh,
uh,
it,

562
00:37:56.701 --> 00:38:01.701
because notice that this not only did this group keep this,

563
00:38:02.341 --> 00:38:05.790
Ooh,
keep from getting oxidized.
This o h

564
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:12.120
that is this.
Ooh,
didn't get oxidized on this side,
right?

565
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:16.050
And this o h didn't get oxidized there.

566
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.090
So the protection protects not only the Aldehyde from being oxidized,

567
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.640
it also protects the alcohol.
Professor Ziegler,
who,

568
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.960
who we've mentioned,
do teachers come to 20 often is a synthetic chemist.

569
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:33.420
And always when he teaches a class in synthesis,

570
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:37.090
he always points this out that people have tunnel vision.

571
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.630
Often they think of key towels as something that protects the carbon eel,

572
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.670
but it also protects an alcohol at the same time that's tied up as an ether and

573
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:49.180
won't do the reactions that the alcohol would do.
So you can,

574
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.540
so you not only protect the carbon eel,

575
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.690
you also protect the Roa h and a particular example of that is what's called a

576
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.440
THP protection.
So,
um,

577
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.750
so this compound,

578
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.520
<v 1>all right</v>

579
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.180
<v 0>can be reacted with Roy h</v>

580
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.340
and acid ketalysis

581
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.830
<v 1>right?</v>

582
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.040
<v 0>So how's it going to start out Derek?
You tell,
tell us</v>

583
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.530
<v 1>where are you going to protonate this.
You can pro</v>

584
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.790
<v 0>just so you could broaden it.
This whole</v>

585
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:37.190
<v 1>all right.
Either hurting particularly good.</v>

586
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.700
<v 0>There's actually another place to protonate.
That's very good.</v>

587
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.320
Can anybody see Arbonne?

588
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.180
<v 1>The carbon carbon double bond where?
Top or bottom?</v>

589
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.800
Nope.
Huh?

590
00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:01.510
<v 0>Okay.
If we put the h plus here,
right?</v>

591
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.830
Why is that good?

592
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.120
Got The h here.
There are now two H's there.

593
00:40:11.121 --> 00:40:12.770
Of course there was one there already.

594
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.830
What's good about that cat iron that,

595
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.120
yeah,

596
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.170
you could say that's what everybody always says that it's stabilized by the lone

597
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:27.160
pair on the oxygen.

598
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.690
But actually what it does is stabilize the lone pair on the oxygen,

599
00:40:31.691 --> 00:40:35.260
which makes the molecule more stable.
You're right.
That's what everyone says,

600
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:40.360
that it's stabilized by the lone pair,
but in truth it stabilizes the lone pair.

601
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.600
Okay,
so we got this,
now we got Roy h.
What's it going to do,

602
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.190
<v 1>John?
What's the Roa to do now</v>

603
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.640
and then what?

604
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:02.903
Proton,
right?

605
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.660
<v 0>So we got this and what functional group is this that we now have?</v>

606
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.450
Does anybody recognize this functional group?

607
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.890
<v 1>It's familiar.</v>

608
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.810
Li Ke Tau,

609
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.570
<v 0>right?
To ethers on the same carbon.
Right?</v>

610
00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:32.550
But we didn't make it from a carbon eel.
We made it this way.
Right?

611
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.480
Okay,
so now we could do reactions.
Suppose this our heads,

612
00:41:37.481 --> 00:41:40.460
something else coming off that was going to react,

613
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:42.920
maybe a double bond and we wanted to react that,

614
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:45.560
but we didn't run a react the alcohol,
right?

615
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.280
That the ether keeps the alcohol safe.
Right?

616
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:53.720
We do the reaction down here.
Now we need to get the alcohol back again.

617
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:56.300
Having done what we wanted to do down here,
how are we going?

618
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.740
How are we going to get it back?

619
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.690
How can we remove this stuff?

620
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.510
We can protonate
protonate the Oh,

621
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.250
lose this,
generate this nice stable cad.
I,
and again,
go back.

622
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.220
We'd just go back and forth,
right with water this time.

623
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.720
Go back with water so we can make with,

624
00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:26.630
so this is a protected group for an alcohol.
Keep it from reacting.
Uh,

625
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.570
uh,
I'll mention one other protecting group for Alpha halls here.
Uh,

626
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.880
because they mentioned it in the textbook that many of you have,

627
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.460
which is called t dms.

628
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:41.790
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:45.020
<v 0>It's t butyl dive.
Methyl silo.</v>

630
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.220
So t beautiful die methyl silo.

631
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.350
And you start with the chloride.

632
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.860
Right now the chloride has a bond strength.

633
00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.640
This bond of 90 kilocalories per mole.

634
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.090
<v 2>All
right,</v>

635
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.910
<v 0>but you could react it with Roy H.
Yeah.</v>

636
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.210
And the unshared pair will react to form a bond with silicon,
right?

637
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.680
So now the silicon has five things attached to it,
right?

638
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.360
But then the chloride can leave.
It's not an sn two reaction.

639
00:43:24.361 --> 00:43:29.361
It's an association followed by dissociation because silicon down in the next

640
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.680
row of the periodic table has vacant orbitals that can make a bond with that,

641
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.260
<v 2>huh?
All
right.</v>

642
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.250
<v 0>So now we got t beautiful SEI math,
all math.</v>

643
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.760
Oh are right.
And the,

644
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.770
the strength of the Sio bond is 110 kilocalories per mole.

645
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:04.580
So this is downhill and energy.
Okay.
Now,

646
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.100
so now you can do what you want to do.

647
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:11.630
Other things in the Ar group without touch with a,
it's not an alcohol anymore.

648
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:13.910
It's like a little bit like an ether,
right?

649
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.930
But the neat thing is that there's a special way to take it apart.

650
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:24.070
You can take it apart by treating it with a touch or a methyl ammonium methyl

651
00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:28.580
for n plus assault.

652
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.680
But the business end is fluoride

653
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.740
because fluoride can attack the silicon the same way the unshared pair out

654
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:42.180
oxygen did here.
And then you can lose protonate and lose the or.

655
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.290
Right?
So this is,
uh,
the nice thing,

656
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.180
the product from the silicon is now as which you don't really care about is the

657
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:55.170
s I f and the Sif bond is a fabulous bond.

658
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.640
It's a 135.

659
00:44:58.410 --> 00:44:59.640
<v 2>Okay.
Cows from,
all</v>

660
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.123
right.

661
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.570
<v 0>So Plus,
plus,
now you're,</v>

662
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.580
you're a r o h once you've protonated,

663
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:14.290
right?

664
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:18.790
So the nice thing about this is there not that many things that react with Fluor

665
00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:22.900
ids easily.
It's a terrible nucleophile generally.
Right?
So,

666
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.290
so now you have something that's very selective that will,

667
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:30.280
that will only do that and take this protecting group off and not mess up other

668
00:45:30.281 --> 00:45:32.320
things that's in your art group.
Right?

669
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.680
And this was invented in the 1970s by a professor at Harvard who got the Nobel

670
00:45:38.261 --> 00:45:43.210
prize in synthetic chemistry,
Professor Corey.
Uh,

671
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:49.420
so that's those things and now it means,

672
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:54.510
and their derivatives and the role of electron pair repulsion and Alec

673
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:55.930
Stabilization.

674
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.710
So I'm going to just introduce this here and we'll finish it next time.

675
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

676
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.720
<v 0>So we have a carbon eel.</v>

677
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.580
I know we've been reacting it with alcohols or water,
right?

678
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.520
But let's consider reacting with an mean.

679
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.153
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.650
<v 0>Which actually is certain
similarity to water.
Of course,</v>

681
00:46:23.651 --> 00:46:27.220
it's got the unshared payer and protons on the nitrogen.

682
00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:32.110
The way alcohol has protons on the oxygen.
So this can react.

683
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:41.780
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

684
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.640
<v 0>of course.
That can lose a proton here and it could put a proton on there.</v>

685
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.310
It's probably not the same proton.

686
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.753
<v 2>Okay,</v>

687
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.660
<v 0>and this is called a carbonyl.</v>

688
00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.613
<v 2>I mean,</v>

689
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:07.740
<v 0>what's the analog when when you have a high oxygen instead of night instead of</v>

690
00:47:07.961 --> 00:47:10.050
an h in there?
What functional group is it?

691
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.370
If this were just an o instead of an n h,

692
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.050
what would you call this functional group?

693
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.753
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

694
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.190
<v 0>I see you all bored.
It's a heavy key towel,
right?</v>

695
00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:28.570
That's what we've just been talking about.

696
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:33.040
But the carbonyl amine is the amine analog.
Now you could do,

697
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.350
because you have this hydrogen here,

698
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:42.040
you can do something special,
right?
You can lose this.
Ooh.

699
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.370
Say protonate and lose.
It helped out by this

700
00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.240
<v 2>and we get this</v>

701
00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.830
right and water.

702
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.990
<v 0>Okay.
Pardon me?
It would be originally an h plus one.</v>

703
00:48:06.991 --> 00:48:09.870
We use the unshared pair,
but then we could lose the H.
Plus.

704
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.480
So now we have this functional group,

705
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.420
which is called an eme.
Yeah.

706
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.530
<v 2>All right.</v>

707
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.720
<v 0>Which is rather like a ketone,</v>

708
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.043
<v 2>right?</v>

709
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.891
<v 0>So we got,</v>

710
00:48:24.891 --> 00:48:29.780
we got rid of the oxygen and a replaced that with an ar and the oxygen became h

711
00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:34.280
two o by the same kind of stuff we've been doing.
Right.

712
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:39.590
So these,
uh,
ear means,
uh,
turn out to be very important,

713
00:48:39.591 --> 00:48:42.800
not only in organic chemistry,
but also in biology.

714
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.440
And we'll continue with that next time.
Or actually,
yeah,
we'll,

715
00:48:46.441 --> 00:48:47.810
we'll continue with that.
But this,

716
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:52.610
there'll be no more on the exam on Friday than what we've done today.
Okay.

717
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.970
Pardon me.
Oh,
forget,
forget the amines.
Okay.
Just do that.

718
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.780
The key thousand heavy key towels.
It means I'll be on the final.
