00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:06.536
&gt;&gt;Ahmet: Project-based learning

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:10.236
at School 21 is put right
at the heart of education.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:12.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Here, put that
one there on the wall.

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:16.176
&gt;&gt;Ahmet: Art brings knowledge,
stories, facts alive,

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.816
so you get engagement from students.

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.976
You get students caring
what they're learning about.

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:26.586
&gt;&gt;Student: Much better!

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:27.556
Let's do it one more time!

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.566
&gt;&gt;Peter: I think one of the
big messages of this school is

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.316
to do things in greater depth.

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:39.246
We are passionate here about
crafting work until it is beautiful.

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:42.396
And my Rule of thumb for the
products that we create here is,

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:44.996
"Are you surprised that a
student that age has done that?"

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:45.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So did you make it?

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.426
&gt;&gt;Peter: I think project-based
learning is a very powerful way

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:53.836
of getting quality work, and
makes a real impact on learning.

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:55.416
&gt;&gt;Oli: The model that we've come

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:58.216
to in project-based learning is we've
linked together what you might call

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.706
knowledge rich subjects,
History and Science

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.216
with performative subjects,
Music, Drama.

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:07.326
&gt;&gt;Joe: Our cross-curricular
projects I usually want long.

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.776
And so between 12/15 weeks.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:14.446
And they will have 300 minutes per
week in-between the two subjects.

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:17.726
&gt;&gt;Joe: Your assignment
is to create a three-

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:21.076
to five-minute immersive
theater performance,

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:24.106
which is based around the
French or Russian Revolution.

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.486
So you are responsible in your
groups for writing the script,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.986
for making the set, for
directing your own performance.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:34.926
&gt;&gt;Matilda: So I think the first thing
is we just need to run through it.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.726
&gt;&gt;Student: We need to also
get props and everything set.

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:40.606
&gt;&gt;Joe: Project-based learning, to me,
is a backwards planning structure.

00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:43.706
So I go, "Right, what's going
to drive this whole project?

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:45.166
And what are we going
to produce at the end?

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.696
And who's it going to be for?"

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:48.926
Then once you have that,
we then say to them,

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.426
"Here are all the mini-deadlines
on the way."

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.226
They work in teams, they work
individually, they have problems

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:56.766
to solve, they have information
to gather.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.806
&gt;&gt;Matilda: I really how we get a
lot of independence in our projects.

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:04.716
Our play is about the soldiers, how
poor the conditions were for them,

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:06.966
and so how appealing the
prospect of communism was.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.326
&gt;&gt;Student: [yelling] Get in,
and fall in the right hand side!

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:10.726
Right now!

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:13.026
&gt;&gt;Zaid: To fit all those key
events that happened in history

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:15.976
in a five-minute play
is quite difficult.

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:17.336
&gt;&gt;Student: [yelling at masked soldiers]

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.436
&gt;&gt;Zaid: We were new to the fact
that it was immersive theater,

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:21.256
and the fact that the
audience could not speak,

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.166
but to feel that they were part of this.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:27.516
&gt;&gt;Student: We're approaching Russia
where everybody will be free!

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:30.226
&gt;&gt;Matilda: One of the things this
school values a lot is craftsmanship.

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:33.046
So we keep on redrafting
everything that we do.

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.986
We've been receiving
critique to help improve that.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:37.966
&gt;&gt;Student: It's kind of rushed.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:41.696
So I think they should slow it
down, or space it out a little.

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:45.676
&gt;&gt;Ahmet: It points them to the
direction of what needs to be improved,

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:48.906
what's not quite clear, where
they need to add more knowledge.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.386
&gt;&gt;Ahmet: Great guys,
really nice comments.

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:51.916
I would like you got go and get--

00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:54.616
&gt;&gt;Emily: I'd argue that the
arts is project-based learning.

00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:58.516
Students are constantly
working towards an end product

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:00.196
that will have authentic audience.

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.356
&gt;&gt;Emily: We are a week
away from Exhibition.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:07.036
So what we're going to do today
is make sure that all the aspects

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:11.356
of this project is completely prepared,
edited, critiqued and ready to go.

00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:13.726
&gt;&gt;Emily: It's the first time we've
brought Music and Science together.

00:03:14.206 --> 00:03:18.056
The essential question of the project
is "What Does Sound Look Like?"

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:21.546
&gt;&gt;Heather: We've mapped out the
Science that we could include in that.

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:26.476
So students have learnt about
sound, soundwaves, how it's made.

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:30.406
&gt;&gt;Emily: Over the course of the project
there we team teach all 40 students

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.986
together; and there'll be other
times we divide them in half.

00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:36.726
&gt;&gt;Heather: And I can't say the kids
would have learnt the Science as well

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:39.516
as they would have done if
it weren't for the music.

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:43.026
It's so much more real, and it
becomes a lot less theoretical.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:46.406
&gt;&gt;Heather: Which of these bars are used
to describe the waves getting bigger?

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:50.376
&gt;&gt;Aman: I think it's quite fascinating
how science can actually be used

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:50.946
to make music.

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:54.656
I admit, I would get bored of
just reading a book about science.

00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:57.536
We learnt how you can be active
and learn at the same time.

00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:01.216
&gt;&gt;Emily: We wanted to find a way
of making a physical performance.

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:04.586
So we constructed the Boomwhacker.

00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:10.026
&gt;&gt;Heather: So they were looking at
measuring different lengths of tubes

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:11.496
to find out how that affected pitch.

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:16.546
&gt;&gt;Emily: They were color-coded, Red
is C, Orange is D, Yellow E, etcetera.

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:20.926
They can then see the visual
representation of how frequency works

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.556
by the number of hertz when
they hit that Boomwhacker.

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:26.326
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two, three, four, boom!

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:28.526
&gt;&gt;Emily: Just to make it a
little bit more exciting,

00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:31.376
we discovered these amazing
Makey Makey devices,

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:35.706
provided students are holding the
conducting part of the circuit,

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:39.246
you can play notes through it.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.716
[notes being played] It also works
through water, which we've color-coded.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:48.366
&gt;&gt;Aman: So when you touch the water,
a sound comes out from the laptop.

00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:49.816
[notes played by touching
the water] We've been practicing

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:50.866
for a really long time.

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:55.006
And I want to see how it turns out.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:58.286
&gt;&gt;Matilda: We have Exhibition
Night at the end of every term.

00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:01.006
It's a night where all the projects
we've been doing have come together

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:03.896
and we show them to our
parents, to visitors,

00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:05.976
experts in the areas we're studying.

00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:09.376
&gt;&gt;Student: [yelling] What are you doing?

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:11.646
Why are you killing these
innocent people?

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:12.616
They don't deserve to die!

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:15.756
&gt;&gt;Matilda: Having a real
audience is really important.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.266
It definitely helps you keep motivated

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:18.706
when you know you're
doing it for a reason.

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:21.826
&gt;&gt;Aman: After all of that hard work
in the term, you get to like show it

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:23.976
to the community, and
be proud of your work.

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:38.556
[whistle blows; music]

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.886
&gt;&gt;Emily: Bringing the arts into
project-based learning is great,

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:45.676
because students can express the
content in a creative and physical way.

00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:48.746
&gt;&gt;Peter: I think the students, once
you've crafted something beautiful

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:50.716
for the first time, then
you never look back.

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:53.196
They're getting a sense of
what excellence looks like.

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:57.096
They're getting all those qualities of
resilience and perseverance of thinking,

00:05:57.096 --> 00:06:01.786
"Well, actually, I really
have gone on a journey."

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.500
[music; applause; cheering; crowd noise]
