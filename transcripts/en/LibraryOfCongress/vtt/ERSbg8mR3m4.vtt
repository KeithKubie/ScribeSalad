Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:20.110
[ Silence ]

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.790
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady: I'd
like to welcome all of you

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.150
to the European Division.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.810
My name is Kenneth Nyirady.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.160
I am the specialist for Hungary.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.580
Grant Harris, the head
of the Reading Room,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.730
regrets that he can't be here
today to introduce the speaker.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:44.920
Born in Vienna, Austria,
[laughter] Kurt Bednar graduated

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.170
from the University of Vienna
Faculty of Law in 1974.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.130 position:56%
He has found employment with
governments and chambers of commerce

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130 position:56%
as well as entrepreneurial positions
in fields such as databases,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.650
data protection, and
company pensions.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.310
He graduated from the University
of Vienna a second time in 2012

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.990
with a doctorate from the
Faculty of Philosophy Department

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.270
of History based on a
thesis entitled "Emigration

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.440
from Austria Hungary to the
U.S.A. between 1900 and 1930."

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.350
This work will appear in book
form by the end of this year.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880 position:56%
He has published books on
computing and construction industry,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.220
data protection laws,
and company pensions.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.550
And two of his books are available
here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.630
And their titles are in German, and
I won't dare try to pronounce them.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.160 position:56%
He has written numerous articles
dealing with law and related fields.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.980
He has published his first
book review last year.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.780
He is also a member of the
scientific advisory board

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.210
for the House of Austrian History
to be established in Lower Austria,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.740 position:56%
and to be opened by the end of 2017.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.480 position:56%
The title of this presentation today
is "Frederic Courtland Penfield,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.410
Last and Undervalued US Minister

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.430
to Habsburg Vienna in
Crisis, 1913 1917."

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.510
It is my honor to introduce
to you Dr. Kurt Bednar.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.440
[ Silence ]

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.790
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Thank you very
much for coming and Mr. Nyirady

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.450
with the map of the
monarchy long gone.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.860
We quickly changed to
the man of this hour,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.100
Frederic Cortland Penfield.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.770
When Woodrow Wilson, President
of the United States of America,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.970
wrote a letter to Franz Joseph
the First, emperor of Austria,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.000
dated July 29, 1913, he
announced the arrival

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.520
of Frederic Cortland Penfield
to reside near the government

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.020
of his majesty as ambassador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.500
He had chosen this distinguished
citizen as well informed

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.460
of the relative interests
of the two countries.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.930
As a matter of fact, Penfield
had been Wilson's second choice.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.360 position:56%
His first choice, Egan, had
refused to accept the post in Vienna

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.050
since life in Vienna
would be quite expensive.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.900
In fact, Penfield was chosen
because he was a Catholic,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.600
and he had no idea
what he was up to.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.060
As soon as Vienna learned of the
probable nomination of Penfield,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.950
Austrian Ambassador Dumba
was asked to look around.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.760
He had New York Consul
General Nuber inquire,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.610
as Penfield at that
time lived in New York.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.690
The information Vienna
received was pleasing enough.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.680
According to Nuber's telegram,
Penfield, 58, was a journalist,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.930
explorer, writer, of distinguished
appearance, and, due to studies

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.230
in Germany, mastering German.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.230
His wife was also Catholic
and wealthy.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.580
Some 30 million U.S.
dollars, which had resulted

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.870
in the richest contribution to
the latest Democratic ticket.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.870
A footnote is in the German
speaking New York "Staats Zeitung"

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.220
at that time a relatively
high, a large number

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.180
of newspapers was published
in German of June 26,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.370
speculated that as he was wealthy.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.750
He ought to be able to become
the most radiant diplomatic

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.740
representative of the new U.S.
administration, which, of course,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.020
pleased the Vienna court eager
for splendor and recognition.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.510
In 1916 Penfield complained
to Wilbur Carr,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.260
Director of the Consular
Service at that time,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.660
that he paid 24,000 U.S. dollars
for his residence of 60 rooms,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.670
among them a dining room
hosting up to 60 guests.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.870 position:56%
The American embassy in Vienna even
furnished Austria's Foreign Minister

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.470
Count Berchtold with some sort
of curriculum vitae of Penfield.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.610
This one page document also
registered the awards showered upon

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.370
him by countries like England,
France, Turkey, and Serbia.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.610
The official Dictionary of American
Biography described his public

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.580
character, "It has brought
him to London and Cairo

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.540
where he must have spent
the high time of his life,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.020
as has his two books, 'Present
Day Egypt' and 'East of Suez,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.470
written in the 16 years
between Cairo and Vienna,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.430
deal with that oriental country."

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.220
Earlier he had already
earned his living by writing.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.040
He spent his junior years in the
staff of a Hartford newspaper.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.860
There are not many
sources on Mrs. Penfield,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.000
but the few available
mark her as an open minded

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.940
and generous personality.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.910 position:56%
During her stay in Vienna she took
German lessons in Baden near Vienna.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.980
Her teacher, Gustav Brown [assumed
spelling], Louisen Strasse 22,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.380
was proud portrait
with this prominent

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.580
and obviously ambitious pupil.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:31.900
When reading the thank you card
no problem one wonders how good a

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.770
teacher she picked, as he signed
as her "sprachlerer," if you look

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.720
at the last one, without
an h [laughter].

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.110
Back home Mrs. Penfield
excelled as a generous donator,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.570
not only to the Pennsylvania
Historical Society.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.070
Upon the death of her husband
in 1922, she received a letter

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.730
from Colonel House in which
the formerly trusted advisor

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:04.730
of Woodrow Wilson expected that
history will do him justice.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.910
This history has failed to happen.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.880
Among other authors, Rachel West,
in particular, accuses Penfield,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.180
described as an ambassador
elsewhere, of several flaws.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.420
First of all, Penfield
is conceited to a fault

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.930
and could strut sitting down.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.670
But this is hearsay.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.510
The source, Grew, who had
worked in Vienna before,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.990
probably didn't like him.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.810
In the end we will hear why.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.380
Secondly, Penfield never lost
his fondness for boasting.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.180
Finally, West deplores the
bad quality of his reports,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.540
mocking topics like cholera
and the health of the emperor,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.740
especially that he did not
foresee the coming disaster.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.360
In truth, as we all know,
the war caught Penfield,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.310
like most of other U.S.
representatives in Europe

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.390
and many other people, by surprise.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.190
His first job now was to
support Americans getting

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.860
out of the country
if they so wished.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.240
All together, it's estimated

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.990
that about 50,000 Americans
stranded in Europe in 1914.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.300
In that era, passports were
the exception of the rule.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.030 position:56%
His staff had to identify Americans,
issue proper travel papers,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.930
and provide sojourners with cash.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.750
Obviously enough ships
were available

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.400
in Europe to return all Americans.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.670
Several months into the
war, Penfield suffers

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.890
from a growing shortage
of personnel.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.100
A young Austrian, age 25, with
the name Leo Threschel [phonetic]

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.420
from Mistelbach, north of
Vienna, was called to the colors.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.940
He happened to be working for
Penfield as second gardener.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.560
After the ambassador had
already lost seven servants

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.420
to the Austrian army, he contacted
Berchtold, the foreign minister,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.260
stating, "I can't very
well live in Vienna

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.420
as an ambassador unless
allowed some servants."

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.560
Penfield also put in a good
word for his chief gardener,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.020
Johann Prohaska [assumed
spelling], 35, his chief butler,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.590 position:56%
Ernst Weininger [assumed
spelling], 38, they're all mentioned

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.960
in this paper, and
the house servant,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.580
Albert Urschinger [assumed
spelling], age 24.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.950
Him he regarded as too tall
and fragile to make a soldier.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.780
"And Threschel is so
nearly stone deaf

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.020
that I am sure he would
make a poor warrior.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.060
He's, however, a good
worker in my glass houses,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.180
and I wish the war ministry
would send him back."

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.260
Minister Berchtold
supported the desire.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.030
As the U.S. kept a difficult
course of neutrality,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.590
America was approached
by belligerents

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.640
to represent their interests
towards respective hosts.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.180
Thus Penfield had to inspect
prisoner camps in Austria on behalf

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.040
of Italy, which had declared
war on Austria in May 1915.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.620 position:56%
On February 28, 1916, he did inspect
Katzenau, a site in a Linz suburb.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.610
Frankly speaking, I
haven't had learned before

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.980
of this place before I
came across this document.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.400
Typical Viennese would say.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.370
Penfield was in the company of two
of his staff, Naval Attache Graham

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.850
and his private secretary,
Karl Daser [phonetic],

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.250
and the Baron Freitental
[phonetic] Austrian Ministry

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.810
of Foreign Affairs.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.900
Katzenau, at that time only
sheltered civil prisoners,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.880
enemy aliens, camp director Baron
Reiche [assumed spelling] was also

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.180
a civilian.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.060
According to the report of March
14th, U.S. inspectors checked menus

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.970
and daily rations as
well as tasted the milk,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:39.420 position:56%
"sweet and of good quality" produced
by some 50 cows near the camp.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.440
The whole food supply was
managed by a committee

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.290
of five selected among
the detainees.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.510
Any inhabitant was free to
grab food somewhere else.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.760
There was a canteen and private
Austrian shops on the ground.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.490
But alcohol was restricted
to one liter of beer

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.630
and half a liter of wine per day.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.900
What a restriction [laughter].

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.790
All together, the camp's capacity
was estimated up to 5,600 persons.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.850
On the day of inspection
Katzenau had 4,300 inmates,

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.490
3,300 of which were Italians.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.600
Sanitation and cleanliness
were observed

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.080
by medical [inaudible] named
Bertolini [assumed spelling],

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.310
obviously of Italian background.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.030
The doctor testified
to the U.S. group

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.050
that no contagious diseases
had occurred recently.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.310
Money was not allowed in Katzenau.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:35.470
Instead of cash, which landed in
a depo, people received Lagergeld,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.210
camp money, and that currency
worked everywhere in Katzenau,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.120
but nowhere outside, thus keeping
inmates from trying to escape.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.200
Overall, the report resumed
no serious complaints.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.550 position:56%
From the beginning of the conflict,
Penfield had sent voluminous reports

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.060
from his office in Vienna to
U.S. Secretary of State Lansing

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.600
and Colonel House in Washington
and New York, respectively.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.710 position:56%
On January 28, 1915, he sent a
report to Bryan when still Secretary

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.150
of State about the first
six months of the war.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.920
Penfield's central observation was
a lack of impartial information

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.900
since authorities installed
censorship

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.570
and forbade foreign newspapers.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.870
What is striking in
his, is his finding

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.410
of early war wariness
in the population.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.820
Vienna itself was full of disabled
soldiers and fleeing civilians.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.510
Quite importantly, Penfield
already seemed to have good context

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.250
with the court, as the new Foreign
Minister Czernin kept the American

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.150
informed about the good
health of the emperor.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:43.230 position:56%
His report referred to four American
military observers at the front,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.050
two of whom, Major
Fort [assumed spelling]

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.810
and Captain McIntyre [assumed
spelling] narrowly escaped

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:53.140
from Belgrade when it was
taken over by the Serbs again,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:13:01.700
a third being in Galicia, which is
up, up north, and the fourth active

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.060
in Pula, which is the,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.920
was the Austrian naval
center in the Adriatic.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.930
The first war loan in
Austrian raised good money,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.830
if at an interest rate
of five percent; however,

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.390
at international markets Austria
would have to pay interest

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.340
up to ten percent, sorry,
five three quarter and up

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.960
to ten percent they would
have paid on the free market.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.170 position:56%
Penfield deplored the lack of
social life in the Austrian capital,

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.530
although the well noticed character

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.600
of the Viennese coffee house
as yet could be upheld.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.150
People abhorred French and English,
and Americans had a hard time

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.770
to explain that they are
different from perfidious albion.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.040
The city seemed, this is quote
from, "The city seemed to be able

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.010
to keep normal supply
with food, however.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.670
Private cars had disappeared also

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.050
because tires could
not be found anywhere."

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.290
In the document in the Vienna
state archive you can find several

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.100
requests from Penfield
for tire and for gasoline.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.550
And sometimes he got some,
but he had a hard time.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.580
Penfield thought most Americans
had left Austria, with just 200

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.330
and 250 persons staying by their
own choice or for business,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.600
sojourning in Tyrol or
studying theology in Innsbruck.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.950
I didn't find out who it was.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.060
A truly comprehensive document
followed by a report titled,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.660
"Austria Hungary After a Year
of War" dated July 29, 1915.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.950
What is remarkable is
a receiver of this.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.090
The envelope was addressed to Mrs.
Richard Meyers in Philadelphia

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.520
who was Mrs. Penfield's
favorite niece.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.470
The report had several sections.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.280
Italy's entrance into the
war, the estimated number

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.170
of soldiers fighting for Austria
Hungary, human care of prisoners,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.560 position:56%
evidences of racial differences of
opinion, controlling the consumption

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.660
of staple foods, expedience for
raising war necessaries, warning,

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.590
waning supplies of cotton and
rubber, and war's crushing costs.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.630
Meanwhile, Lansing
had replaced Bryan

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.420
and obviously introduced
his own idea of reporting.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.930
Intervals shortened, different
structure, compulsory.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.970 position:56%
Papers include Penfield's summations
dated November 11, November 25,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.710
December 9, all in
1915, to be followed

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.600
by a document of January
2nd of 1916.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.980
The last report in the files of the
Pennsylvania Historical Society,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.190
addressed, "My dear Mr.
Secretary," but not printed,

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.300
not printed in the Lansing papers.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.810
It completely covered
the Ancona affair

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.990
and displayed the functionary aware

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.080
of the practice of
Austrian bureaucracy.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.360
I'm sure you're, if you're
not aware, Ancona was the ship

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.060
that was torpedoed by
an Austrian submarine.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.810
It was actually a German
submarine, but it was under the,

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.270
under the Austrian war flag.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.120
On November 19, 1915, Penfield
questioned the new foreign minister

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.820
Burian, who insisted that Austria
had a right to sink enemy ships

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.370
but also promised to inquire
internally for more effects.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.050
After five days, November 25th,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.900
the American already suspecting
official procrastination,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.370
asked again to see Burian.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.850
When Penfield referred to his
instructions regarding promptness,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.530
Burian again asked
for a few more days.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.020
When Penfield wanted
assurance that it was, indeed,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.090
an Austrian submarine that sank
the Ancona, Burian weakly admitted

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.970
that this, in a wake manner,
continuing that the war could be

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.530
over would not America ship
munitions to the allies.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.250
Penfield, who set a sort of
ultimatum on December 1st,

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.250
in the meantime had received a
note of protest from Washington

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.120
to deliver to the foreign
ministry in Vienna.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.720
At the next meeting, December 9, he
handed over the first protest note.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.440
Around Christmas of 1915 it looked
like severance of the relations

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.530
between both states, and
Penfield even issued a call

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.140
to all U.S. diplomats
in the monarchy

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.380
to get prepared for departure.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.260
Penfield, however, stayed for
another year and continued

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.140
with his reports from Vienna.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.980
These came in two versions.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.850
Shorter, both by length
and by interval to Lansing,

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.260
whereas comprehensive half year
summations were addressed mainly

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.290
to Colonel House with whom he
developed a warmer relationship.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.610
His first memo in the
collection of House papers

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.640
at Yale was dated January 28, 1916.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.640
It carried the title, "Austria
Hungary After 18 Months of War,"

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.310
and would be succeeded by two
war memos of the same structure

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.840
and description covering two
years of war, dated July 28, 1916,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.910
and 30 months of war,
dated January 28, 1917.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.520
Subsequently, reports from
Vienna were not possible,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.500
as the relations were broken up.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.320 position:56%
Stovall, the U.S. Legation in Berne,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.710
continued with memos
about the monarchy.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.550
Penfield's first reports
printed in the federal records

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:14.350 position:56%
of foreign relations of the U.S.,
called FRUS, dated November 4, 1915,

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.400
pursuant to your request
for frequent confidential

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.100
and personal letters, contained one
significant piece of information,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.970
one very material piece
of information, indeed.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.810
Vienna was not going to
nominate a successor of Dumba,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.350 position:56%
who had been expelled, all too soon,
so long as private communication

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.210
with Vienna was impossible
to send an ambassador

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.230
to the Washington would
be worse than useless.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.870
This topic repeated itself in the
later message of June 15, 1916,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.170
when Penfield assumed this
government will take no action

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.300
in that direction until
the war is over.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.840
Three times Wilson himself reacted
to the reports shown by Lansing,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.780
but his comments probably
reached Lansing only.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.210
On July 27, 1916, on the
report dated July 3, 1916,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.940
Wilson finally spent praise
on his ambassador in Vienna.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.100
"He always says something that
is useful to keep in mind."

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:16.360
The late January 1916, memo from
Vienna, not fit to print in FRUS

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.190
to House, commenced
with the conclusion

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.070
that even 18 months could
not starve the monarchy,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.980
thus contradicting earlier
hints of war wariness.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.060
Food seemed to be distributed
effectively,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.000
although people did suffer
from potato and meat shortage.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.430
Two days a week meat was
not allowed to be sold,

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.760
and butter has become
a luxury of the rich.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.940
Outlook to future harvests
and transports

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.500 position:56%
from Romania and Hungary looked dim.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.600 position:56%
Women and children, but also Russian

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.470
and Serbian prisoners
of war, had to help out.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.330
The 24 page memo closed with
a short paragraph titled,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.600
"Good health of the emperor."

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.340
Foreign minister Burian
had just assured Penfield

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.390
that the majesty was never
better in his 86th year.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.200
Franz Joseph still began his
work at 4:00 in the morning

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.380
and took the keenest interest
in every phase of the campaign.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.720
Further reports from Vienna
contained even more pages.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.460
July 28, 1916, two years of
war, consisted of 34 pages.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:25.380
January 28, 1917, and of 30
months of war, even of 44 pages.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.720
With Penfield leaving
town in April 1917,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.090
he strangely disappeared
into oblivion.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.750
The inquiry, the group set up
by Colonel House upon request

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.220
by President Wilson,
set up to prepare

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.970
for a peace conference did
not bother to interview him.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.510
On August 18, 1917, Penfield
claimed to receive confidential

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.560
and extremely reliable
information from Vienna.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.740
In a reply of August 28, 1917,
Colonel House, who was responsible

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.670
for the inquiring, thanked earlier,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.260
for earlier letters
Penfield had written to him.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.720
House considered that the ex
ambassador had said about Austria,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.070
what the ex ambassador had said

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.230
about Austria exceedingly
interesting and referred

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.000
to a meeting with Lansing, who
would have passed the message

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.860
on to the President himself, to
whom you have given the benefit

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.260
of your views, maybe, maybe
they got together in September,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.210
when the Houses would have been
running up for a day from New York.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.590
In the meantime, the
Penfields had settled

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.290
down in Mamaroneck
in upstate New York.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.000
But one can read between
the lines, he was gone.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.620
Nevertheless, between the two men,
the under valued writer turned

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.560
into diplomat and the
eventual alter ego

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.330 position:56%
of the President himself must have
existed out of a kind of friendship.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.030
In the House papers collection
at Yale, one may find corresponds

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.690 position:56%
from February 13 until fall of 1917.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.910
It begins with a performance
of Seraglio [assumed spelling]

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.080
at the Metropolitan Opera.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.880
Penfield, living on Fifth
Avenue, invites House,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.960
35th Street, for dinner at 7:00.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.880
The invitation closes with a remark
that he promises not to appear

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.670
in the attitude of a candidate
for a place in the cabinet.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.540
Was Penfield under discussion
to become a minister?

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.370
Certainly House would
have been the man

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.930
to influence the newly elected
Woodrow Wilson, re elected,

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.500
when forming his first
cabinet, no elector.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.860
Sorry. On July 23, 1913,
Penfield thanked House

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.070
for his good wishes upon his
appointment, formally on July 28,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.590
to the ambassadorship in Vienna.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.310
Which, so he claimed, "It is
the position I most coveted."

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.900
Admitting that it might have helped

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.910
that the ambassadorial
couple was Catholic.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.860
He was received by Franz Joseph
only in September because he was,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.580 position:56%
Penfield was vacationing in Carlsbad
in the summer, and Franz Joseph,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.150
as usual, was in Bad
Ischl, of course.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.020
Not before January 18, 1915, do
we meet another correspondence,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.260
House announces yet another trip
to Europe, sailing on the Lusitania

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.470
on January the 13th, which was
four months before it sank,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.670
was torpedoed, which by
now has become a war area.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.430
House asks for information from
Vienna sent to his first stop,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.010 position:56%
London, as it might become opportune
for him to travel to Vienna.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.670
Penfield obviously had no
idea of House's mission,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.880
replies on February 11,
actually warmly commending Vienna

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.500
as the most normal yet tensest
of all the war capitals.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.070
It houses 50,000 wounded soldiers,
150,000 refugees from Galicia,

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:46.620 position:56%
and 1000 Russian prisoners, but the
kaiserstadt is comfortable and safe.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.010
As we know, House never made it to
Vienna, but on March 20 in a note

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.040
from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin,
House invites Penfield to come

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.220
over to him since he refers
to important reasons not to go

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.370
to Vienna, and on the other hand,
he welcomes Penfield's advice.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.470
Another letter of House
to Vienna, March 9 or 10,

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.640
with news from Washington about
another reshuffle in diplomacy

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.440
as Morgenthau leaves Constantinople

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.210
to be replaced by a
man called Elkus.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.330
Penfield reacts with
a letter of April 13,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.050
commenting on the situation
in Constantinople and hoping

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.880
for a stopover of Elkus in Vienna
on his way to Constantinople.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.110
Finally, he reclaims that our
efforts and labors are recognized

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.190
and appreciated not
only there but also

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.940
by governments he's representing
in Vienna due to the war.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:40.810
Thus, thus far, we seem to
have made not one mistake

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.770
to steer a great embassy
in this exacting capital

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.720
where our neutrality is often
doubted is a task admitting

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.020
of no neglect.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.670
On April 15, 1916, Penfield
uttered a confidential

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.030
and surprising request
to switch to Paris.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.000
If the ambassador there,
Sharp, retired.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.150 position:56%
House must have given him this idea,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.660
according to his word
to this writing.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.290
Did he build up his story
in the letter of April 13?

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:13.240 position:56%
It took house until May 11 to answer
both April messages from Vienna.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.780
Wilson and Lansing seemed not
to appreciate a direct switch

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.210
from one belligerent to another.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.650
Next, June 5th.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:26.500
On the last page of an unusually
long letter did Penfield recall the

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.060
intended switch to Paris and
admits [inaudible] is perfect,

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.140
and it was my idea all the time.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.550
Before Penfield wrote
about mediation.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.390
"Our President may not
be the best mediator.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.900
Austria prefers the King of Spain.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.800
And if that does not work,
him together with Wilson.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.910
Even the Pope wouldn't
do, as people here prefer

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:57.590
as peacemaker a potentate whose
influence is more than spiritual."

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.150
Austria does not feel
comfortable with Wilson's ideas,

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.630
especially the right of
every race to govern itself,

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.110
which might conflict
with the interest

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.100
of a monarch ruling Austrians,
Hungarians, Bohemians,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.470
Slavs, Croats, and other races.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:15.130
Penfield's next letter
of September 19 deals

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.490
with the financial contribution
to the election campaign,

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.880
but you need make no
accounting of it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.940
Only one day later, one may find
yet another three page message

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.160
to the colonel covering Penfield's
experience with the new ambassador

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.740
to Constantinople, Elkus, who
did accept his invitation to stop

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.220
over in Vienna on his way
to the Ottoman capital,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:41.830
joyful as he was an event dragging
ten people and 50 trunks with him,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.280
joining his host at the Vienna
Opera as well as at a chat

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.520
with Austrian's Foreign
Minister Burian.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.190
On the other hand, against his
advice, Elkus gave interviews both

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:56.360
in Vienna and Budapest, Budapest.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.360
His campaign contribution is
acknowledged by House in his letter

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.000
of October 25, together with a
promise that it will not appear

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.320 position:56%
until the final summary in November.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.620
Then the election.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.520
Penfield, on November 22, indulges
in schadenfreude that all papers

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.230
in this monarchy for two days
paraded the news of the election

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.340 position:56%
of Mr. Hughes, and certain important
Vienna journals let loose afresh

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.730
their floodgates of Wilson abuse.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.060
Meanwhile, the emperor has
passed away, and Penfield claims

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.480
to have received probably his last
picture taken shortly before his

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.040
death and presented to him with
an affectionate inscription.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.500
Penfield claims not only the
new kaiser and his wife Zita

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.620
as close friends of himself
and Mrs. Penfield but also

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.250 position:56%
and specially ex minister Berchtold.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.370
"Perhaps my closest
friend here who now works

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.670
in the staff of the new emperor."

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.990
In another correspondence,

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.240
we meet the influential
Chicago industrialist Crane.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.960
Crane was very important.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.910
He brought, he brought Masaryk

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.280
and Wilson together,
was very influential.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.180
On April 26, 1916, he answers
Charles Crane on behalf

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.730
of Alice Masaryk for whom
he has intervened, April 22.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.880
Penfield even interviewed with
Foreign Minister Burian on behalf

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.780
of her and received the
following information.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.160
"She's being held here on
a charge of high treason."

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.750 position:56%
Half a year later, Crane contributes
1,000 U.S. dollars for Penfield

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:33.490 position:56%
to spend on her comfort and show her
courtesies or see that they occur

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.950
without embarrassing
Penfield officially.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.060
Quite a job.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.220
Penfield was quite talkative
towards Maurice Bunsen,

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.830
whom he was acquainted
with from the time

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.730
when Bunsen represented
India at the Viennese court.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.220
But, of course, since Austria
and England were at war now,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.490
this letter was sent to London.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.290
Penfield deplored the activities
of one British journalist

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.870
with the name Aubrey Stanhope,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.020
who wrote for Vienna's
Neue Freie Presse.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.970
But Mr. Ambassador, Mr.
Penfield, was an effective

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.030 position:56%
and efficient letter worker,
befriended with the owner and editor

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:13.770
of the paper and even received his
apologies when Stanhope described

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.570
in an article Lansing as a lawyer
of mediocre abilities and Wilson

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.840
as a weak doctrinaire
of Scotch decent.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.640
Finally, when Stanhope
planned to write about the idea

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.650
that Wilson deliberated the entry
of the U.S. into the war because,

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.110
in that case, the election
would be cancelled

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.940
and his term automatically
prolonged, Penfield succeeded

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.600
in banning this man from
further publishing in this paper.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.810
There is still more Penfield
correspondence available.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:48.540
One recipient is journalist
friend Henry Watterson at the

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.620
"Courier Journal" in
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.790
On March 24, 1916,
obviously [inaudible] please

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.680
for the postcards.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.070
Penfield is delighted how well
his work seems to be regarded

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.380
in this monarchy never
too friendly with America.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.930
There are also vacation
postcards of October 3, 1915,

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.680
with a war photograph on the back
side, "Unsere Truppen im Felde"

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.420
and of October 22, 1914, with a
pretty view of Traunsee, Gmunden,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.310 position:56%
Schloss Ort in lovely Salzkammergut.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:26.960
Further down, probably,
or further up.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.390
Sorry. There it is.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.160
You might, some might recognize it.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.780
Both stamped in Vienna, one
respectively nine days later.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.450
The card of 1914 must
have been further delayed

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.870
because of two factors.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.450
It was directed via Italy

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:50.140
and it carries the
censorship stamp "uberpruft."

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.660
Another friend corresponding

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.770
with Penfield is John Bassett
Moore, also Republican.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.030
The file in the Library of
Congress Moore papers commences

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.170
with a would be the
best moment right now,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:07.550
I would like to thank the
Library of Congress for, for the,

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.850
for this service they provide.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.330
It's astonishing, and
it's really unbelievable.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.470
European Reading Room,

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.170
past manuscript division,
really everybody.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.470
Thank you.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.160
The file in the Library
of Congress commences

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.980
with a Penfield letter
of January 4, 1915.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:27.530
Penfield admits of homesickness,
lack of men and women of our class,

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.400
not enough appreciation and
encouragement from the department.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.750
"War broke into violence that might
have swept novices from their feet,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.160
but we rose to the occasion.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.460
A lot of expenses due to
circumstances of the war,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.340
and for 17 months I have not
been absent from my post."

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.750 position:56%
Penfield is naturally getting little
of the poetry of diplomatic life,

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.940 position:56%
and as we know from other occasions,
from other writing occasions,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.200
I have never had a press clock.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.660
On December 2nd he reiterates
the public, publicity stigma.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.710
"At times I fear I have
been too conservative

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.730
in not encouraging publicity.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.730
It was my promise to Wilson
not to be much in the papers.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:14.100
If I have failed at all, it is in
permitting the Stars and Stripes

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.410
to be taken down over the
American bar at the Bristol Hotel

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.410
and the Bulgarian flag
substituted there for it."

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.990
A convent in a Vienna
suburb shelters a kind

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.690
of farm I couldn't find out
which one it was a cow and hens

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.280
on behalf of the embassy.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.900
Of course, on Thanksgiving three
or four of them lost their being

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.560
for a dinner at the embassy
with music afterwards.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.550
Where else may one find anything
about America's last ambassador

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.190
to the ailing court of Vienna?

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.530
One U.S. dissertation deals

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.590
with American embassies
in belligerent Europe.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.590
Bell, the author, 1983,
University of Iowa.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.770
It has a prominent
supervisor, Lawrence Gelfend,

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.830
author of the only
book on the inquiry.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.740
The group of experts Wilson in the
early '17 asked House to gather

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.330
in preparation for the
upcoming peace conference.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.900
Chapter 9 of this dissertation has
the title "Frederic C. Penfield

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:21.840
and the Vienna Embassy, 1914
to 1918," which is, in itself,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.590
questionable, as relations
were terminated in 1917.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.920 position:56%
And unfortunately, not the only bug.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.180
What Bell describes as the
most blatant reporting error

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.660
that there will be fewer
small governments in Europe

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.680
when the war is over, actually
results from his earlier comments

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.360
which were quite common
thoughts at that time.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.770
That Austria, on a federalist
basis, would integrate most

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.170
of the small Balkan states.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.090
To be true, the ambassador
was less sensitive

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.040
to dissensions among the
nationalities which made

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.920
up the Habsburg domain,

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.350
but he noticed intensified
conflicts among the minorities.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:03.240
What he did neither noticed nor
report was any threat to breaking

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.190
up because of war generated
racial tensions.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.100
On top of all, Bell would
have liked Penfield to meet

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.580
with dissident ethnic
leaders in Austria.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.730
Vienna would have been delighted
to be offered such an opportunity

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.950
to take revenge for
Dumba's expulsion.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.740
The term ended in a rift.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:27.950
Penfield seemed to have
assured Czernin of,

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:31.410
Austria's foreign secretary,
of Tarnowski's reception,

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.170
that was the designated
new ambassador,

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.810
Tarnowski's reception by Wilson.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.420
He never was received by Wilson.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.970
When this idea was turned
down and Penfield recalled,

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:46.940
he had only disconnected the two
moves but spoke openly, not only,

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.780
to the local press,
thus saving his face.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.430
With him, embassy and
cultural staff with many pieces

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:57.490
of heavy luggage, left
town and country.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.520
A further approved list of 48
American citizens with 70 items

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.610
of luggage went on the
embassy's official train,

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.990
among them a private couple
named Stonborough, here listed.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:16.460
Of course, Margaret Stonborough is
the sister of Ludwig Wittgenstein.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.480
With two sons and servants, as
well as one group of Red Cross

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.420
and another of YMCA people.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.340
At that moment, the U.S.
entertained a network of diplomats

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.010
in eight locations scattered
over the dual monarchy.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:37.770
Consulate in Budapest, but also a
consulate in Carlsbad, for example.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:48.810
In a handwritten note to
Czernin dated April 8, 1917,

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:54.850
the U.S. embassy, represented by
Grew, acknowledged the receipt

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.770 position:56%
of the Austrian note of the same day

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:00.930
by which relations broke
up and of the passports.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.350
The U.S. exodus from Vienna was
painted in a quite different light

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.770
by a journalist, Schreiner
[assumed spelling],

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.030
of the "Dearborn Independent."

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.950
First, Penfield [inaudible]
because of Tarnowski's mishap,

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.230
then he orchestrated his
departure as a simple recall,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.760
and finally he avenged
himself on Grew

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.250 position:56%
by having him pick up the passports.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.670
According to Schreiner,
the Department of State

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.910
by then only trusted two persons

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.170
in the Vienna staff,
Stuart and Bingham.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:34.300
On the other hand, it was a
recent [inaudible] of my research,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.850
just for one week, a
special envoy took launch

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.120 position:56%
in Vienna whose single duty might
have been to wrap up things quickly,

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.010
at least luring Drasal [assumed
spelling], he's also in this list,

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.730
just for one single week.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:52.110
He was later to play an important
role in Germany and Berlin.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.090
Rumors had it that
Grew was connected

00:36:55.090 --> 00:37:00.160
to the pro ally Morgan clan and
destined to replace Penfield.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.710
It cannot come as a surprise, then,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.100
that Grew characterized
Penfield as described by West.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.740
Is it possible that
Penfield's meager refuse derived

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.420
from his political stigmatization?

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.740
He was considered the
political appointee,

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.790
but even then he may have
been doing a good job.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.020
Did it just have bad luck being
sent to dead end street Vienna?

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.710
The monarchy played a small role in
the conflict right at the beginning

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.500
and at the end when it collapsed.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:34.960
Remarkable was a lack of reports on
national disputes in the monarchy.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.470
Overall, Mr. Penfield
must be evaluated at least

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.440
above average of America's envoys.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.240
His widespread correspondence
proves diplomatic abilities,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.080
financial generosity, and fine,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.760
almost British humor
in addressing issues.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.510
What else can one expect?

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.310
Thank you.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:38:01.050
[ Applause ]

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.350
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady: Okay.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.650
We have time for questions.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.490
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about the postcard

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:10.980
that had the word uber something
the word censored on it.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.280
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Uberpruft.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.580
&gt;&gt; Uberpruft.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.880
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Checked.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.940
&gt;&gt; How extensive was the censorship
bureaucracy of the Austrians,

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.360
or was this just a wartime
measure that they had?

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.090
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Basically
a wartime measure.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:30.430
As soon as the war started they one
thing that this mostly overseen is

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:36.230
that the Austrian parliament was
not sitting when the war started,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.040
but it was not because
of censorship or anything

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.030
but because the parliament,
as Mark Twain has reported

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.990
from Vienna some years ago,
was a tumultuous arena,

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.790
so the emperor just closed it

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:54.080
down in March 1914
because it didn't work.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.760
But it was not, nothing else.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.620
But I didn't recall the parliament
for the operating of the war.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.100
It's another issue.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.870
But no, the, it was, it was
basically a war measure.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.500
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.010
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Harsh, but.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.840
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady:
Any other questions?

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.400
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.470
I didn't hear very much
about the communication

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.110
of Vienna's government[inaudible]
to the Kaiser [inaudible] you know,

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:27.910
did the U.S. perceive
what was going on?

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:33.910
Is there documentation on that or,
I mean, is there correspondence

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:42.200
between different diplomats
or is this not available?

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.650
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Well, Penfield was
not very popular in Washington,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.670
wasn't trusted by Lansing too much.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.100
They did have a difficult
relationship,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.300
so whenever there was something
going on between Washington

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.440
and Vienna, they tried to talk

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.430
to the Austrian representatives
in Washington.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.280
Mr. Tredennick [assumed spelling],
he was an Austrian representative

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.970
at that time when Dumba
was expulsed.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:12.980
He had a good relationship
with Lansing,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.170
so Lansing mostly turned
to Tredennick.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.480
And the Americans also
liked Tarnowski.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.550
But when Tarnowski came
in the spring of '17,

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.360
the Germans started the
unlimited submarine campaign,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.670
and so there was no way they would,

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.680
Wilson would receive
Tarnowski anymore.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:38.590
There was one moment when Penfield
could have risen to some importance

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.960 position:56%
in the, in the history of the war
when the Americans tried desperately

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.140
to separate Austria from
Germany and there were, I think,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.480
four secret meetings
between Penfield

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.890
and Foreign Secretary Czernin.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:55.780
But in the longer version of the
paper I had it in more detail.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.030 position:56%
But Penfield was not well informed
by Washington why, what was the goal

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.600
of the meeting, and
Czernin suspected

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:10.380
that the Americans were abused
by the British and the French

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:16.940
for a proposal to come to separate
peace, but it, that was not true

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.100
because it was a genuine American
initiative and not supported by,

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.230
supported but not initiated by
the real enemies of Austria.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:29.080
I mean, there was no, there was
no real war between the U.S.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.690
and Austria Hungary,
as you might be aware.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.350
Just in the end, there were
a couple of shots were fired

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.730
on the western front
when the Americans,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.240
when the Germans asked the
Austrians to move some troops

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.680
from the southern and eastern
front to the western front.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.390
In a document I found in the
state archive in Vienna, Czernin,

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:49.850
the Austrian foreign secretary
muttered in this paper that we are,

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.820
what we are doing with America
is a paper war, papierkrieg.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.900
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady:
Any other questions?

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.350
&gt;&gt; Yes. How did you get interested
in this particular matter,

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.780
or are you covering more
thoroughly the relationships

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.720 position:56%
between this country and the empire?

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.000
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Not
anymore, not anymore.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.480
I must my wife is American.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.010
She's from Minnesota.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:23.110
And that, what, I chose the topic
of emigration in the first place

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.760
in dealing with the
emigration thing, then it more

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:32.480
or less gradually, I passed on the
interests of the first world war

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.080
because what was so astounding
is, if you go, for example,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:43.740
we went to the office in town
hall in New Ulm, Minnesota,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.770
to check immigration papers.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.240
And you saw all kinds of people
from Bohemia, Upper Austria,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.670
Lower Austria, but
there wasn't Austria

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.850
as such when the people came in.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.030
So it makes you think.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.060
I'm sure you're aware of the
refugee crisis in Europe right now.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.100
So how do we treat
those people that come?

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.030
How were the Austrians
treated 100 years ago

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.620
when they came to Ellis Island?

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.170
And all, so it circled all around
in the end to what I'm doing now,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.200
the relationship between the
U.S. and Austria Hungary.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wish you would have another
talk on that whole immigration thing

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.910
at that time, and, you know

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.210
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Maybe.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.510
Yeah.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.720
&gt;&gt; like you said, until 1930,
because I have met so many people

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.240
from all of the various countries.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.660
And invariably, you know, where
your parents are from doesn't come

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.940
up in a discussion about Austria
Hungary, but it just comes

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.990
up like what is your background.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.980
Oh, we were Austrian Hungarian.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.560
Well, really Czech, but
we were [inaudible],

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.310
and then somebody else would say.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.710
Oh, I went to the dedication of
the Hungarian chapel last year,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:50.070
and I met an old Franciscan coming
down the driveway, and I said,

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.370
"Were you at the dedication?

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:52.670
Are you Hungarian?"

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.020
Oh, no. I'm Slovakian,
but we've all [inaudible].

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.320
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Yeah,
sure [laughter].

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.620
&gt;&gt; That's what he said.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.950
He said we all knew Hungarians.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.730
So it was very impressive.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:06.480
So it's interesting to me how these
people did identify themselves

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.290
as Austria Hungary, even though we
hear about all of the conflicts.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:13.630
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Yeah, they
happened in the monarchy.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.870
Supposedly some happened
in the States as well.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.650
That's why the government wanted
the, didn't like the [inaudible],

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.950
they didn't like these
[inaudible], as you know.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.770
And in the end, the first
[inaudible] the bridge

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.210
between migration and
the current topic is

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:34.170
because actually the first world
war helped to cover up this problem

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:39.110
because there were, as you know,
Russians chose, I don't know,

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.410
Germans, Irish in America.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.380
And the war covered everything up.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.340
Sorry. Somehow, yeah.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.860
And my question was at the end

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.540
of my thesis was I hope
we don't need another war

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.840
to solve this problem.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.630
&gt;&gt; Yes. That's a good one.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.380
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Not a good one.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.720
No.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.830
&gt;&gt; A good point.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.750
&gt;&gt; I confess I'm not a
scholar or an academic.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:06.020
I'm just an ordinary American and
don't often have a chance to speak

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.910
to an Austrian historian.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.930
So I hope you allow this question,

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.350
which is a little broader
than the topic.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:17.420
You spoke of the friendship of
Ambassador Penfield and his wife

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.280
with the new emperor Karl
and the Empress Zita.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.820
At St. Mary's Church in
Chinatown here in DC is a shrine

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.890
to the Emperor Charles,
who was beatified

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.190
by Pope John Paul years ago.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:31.490
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: That's right.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.790
Yes.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:38.430
&gt;&gt; I wonder how that
event, that beatification,

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.550
was looked on in Austria,
and I also ask your opinion.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.230
I wonder whether or not you
consider the Emperor Karl

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:51.770
to have been an admirable figure.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:55.400
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: [Laughter]
how long do you [laughter].

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.860
Well, he was an unhappy
figure, wasn't he?

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.200
I mean, unhappy, very unhappy.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.090
He could have achieved so much, and
he achieved practically nothing.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:11.910
So he was not well prepared
enough to take over.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.600
He was, he was good will, had good
will, and he wanted peace and stuff

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:22.340
like that, but how he tried to make
it was not professional, probably.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.910
It's difficult to answer
this question.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:30.690
I don't know if beatification
is a good idea, anyway.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.720
I've been raised as a Catholic, but
I left the church a long time ago,

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:39.290
so it's no use to talk about
Catholic things like that.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:40.890
But where is this church?

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.190
I would like to go there.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.490
Where is it, and?

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:44.790
&gt;&gt; It's at the corner of 5th and H

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.090
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Oh, yeah.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:49.180
&gt;&gt; which is about halfway between
the Capitol and the White House.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.090
It's next to the General
Accounting Office,

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.950
which covers that whole
block with the corner.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.250
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Fifth
and H. I'll go there.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:56.550
I'll go there.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's a German language, was
founded as a German language church.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.900
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Okay.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.330
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Thank you.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.470
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady:
Any other questions?

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.460
&gt;&gt; I think I have a comment to
make related to your comment,

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:19.060
and that is in the United States
when people come from abroad,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:23.790
the question often
is, are you a Czech?

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.870
Are you a Serb?

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.830
Are you a whatever?

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:37.600 position:56%
So I came to the U.S. when I was 16,
and I did consider myself Yugoslav.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:45.410
So when I arrived here, I
would say I'm from Yugoslavia.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:52.780
And the next question was
always, well, are you a Serb?

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.080
Are you a [laughter].

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.230
And so I think this is
something that is a legacy

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.780 position:56%
of immigration to the United States.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:04.660
People come here because, perhaps,
earlier generations have come

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:09.220
because of wars, because
they, you know,

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.380
did not agree with
some other nationality.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:21.930
But people in Europe may
have a different take

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.230
on who they are in general.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.530
Just a comment.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:25.830
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Okay.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.130
&gt;&gt; Than people here.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.430
Than people here, yes.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:29.730
&gt;&gt; Kurt Bednar: Okay.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.030
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady:
Any other questions?

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.330
Well, I'd like to thank the
speaker for a wonderful,

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.630
very interesting and
enlightening talk.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.930
[ Applause ]

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.230
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
