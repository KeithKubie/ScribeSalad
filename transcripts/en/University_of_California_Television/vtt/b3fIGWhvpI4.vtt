00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.019
(upbeat music)

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:23.982
- I just wanted to say a few things.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:28.305
Certainly for me, this has
been an amazing afternoon,

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.143
and I really wanna thank all the speakers

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.160
for brilliant talks,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.420
most of which I could understand.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.202
You know, we've heard
about brain circuits,

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.564
how experience can change these circuits,

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:41.024
leading to changes in behavior,

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.143
both during normal development

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.143
and also when development goes awry.

00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:48.863
And we heard a number of themes

00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:50.323
that weave through the talks,

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:51.749
that have been weaving through the talks,

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.913
including sensitive
periods, critical periods.

00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:59.231
We've heard something
about speech and language,

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:03.398
stress, parenting, abnormal
experience, the teen brain,

00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:08.792
which is, we've learned,
not like any other brain.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:12.125
Autism, schizophrenia, adaptation genes.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:16.957
I thought it was really interesting

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:21.558
that Matt said that genes
are not fate, which is,

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:23.147
and we've learned something about that.

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:25.409
The idea that you could come

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.744
and take advantage of
the inherent plasticity

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:30.026
that remains in the brain,

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:32.819
even sometimes in diseased brains,

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.825
and engage that for
treatment or, you know,

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.088
for therapy, in a way.

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:41.537
And we actually heard that from April

00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:44.674
in terms of being able
to maybe even predict

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:47.757
and maybe even intervene in behaviors

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.198
that have to do with learning
and audition and language.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:59.517
But I think Terry, in a
way, already summarized

00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:01.760
what's left of the big challenges.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.135
Basically, we don't know anything.

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.789
It's a really fantastic
time to be a neuroscientist

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.097
and to be a clinical neuroscientist.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.811
There are so many challenges that remain.

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.061
There are lots of tools
that are being built,

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.023
and I think, you know, even today,

00:02:17.023 --> 00:02:20.074
what you heard from all of us as we spoke

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:22.698
is that there's this enormous gap

00:02:22.698 --> 00:02:24.871
in the scales of knowledge

00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:28.454
between what we know
about the human brain,

00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.359
both in health and disease,

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.825
and the fact that we see that human brain

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.872
on a scale that, in many
ways, can give us hints,

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:41.459
but really can't tell
us much about mechanism.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.282
And on the other side of the coin,

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:46.484
we see the mouse brain or animal models

00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:48.726
and we see them, those brains,

00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:51.085
at the level of molecules.

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.043
And the challenge is
really to get to the point

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:56.335
where we can bridge these gaps in scale.

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:59.363
And my dream, actually, would
be not just to understand

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:03.582
and see the neurons all
active in these circuits

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.986
as we saw in the science fiction pictures

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.875
that Terry showed us of the human brain

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.816
and also those real pictures
of the zebrafish brain,

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.555
but the challenge would be
that we actually get to see

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.895
all the synapses and what they're doing,

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:20.358
because that's where a lot
of the action is happening,

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.100
and that's another order of magnitude,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.767
if you remember, in Terry's list

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:28.971
from molecules to circuits of behavior.

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:33.805
So I think with that, it's
time to have some questions

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:35.406
and hopefully some answers.

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.713
So, Terry, why don't you come

00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:38.573
and start with the
first sets of questions.

00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:39.641
- Okay.

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.128
So we got some really good questions,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.767
and I'm gonna start
out with one for April.

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.977
So you should queue up here.

00:03:44.977 --> 00:03:48.644
So, "Dear April."
(laughter)

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:54.911
Okay, "There are individuals
with great intelligence

00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.951
"who may not be so acoustically sensitive,

00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.413
"like deaf people."

00:03:58.413 --> 00:03:59.246
- Right.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:03.413
- "So are there other
stimuli that may be critical

00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:08.273
"for development of
understanding and language?"

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:10.537
- Well, that's an excellent question,

00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:12.483
and of course we know

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:16.650
that you don't need audition
to develop language, per se.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.215
And I'm using that as a
way to get into language,

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:22.194
but we were just talking about

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:24.464
different sorts of mechanisms.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:28.047
I'm actually a, on a
dissertation committee

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.123
for a young man at Gallaudet

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:35.506
who's studying basically the timing

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:39.673
of these sign language and
how it develops across time,

00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:43.774
and I'm very interested in how,

00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:46.180
I'm really more interested in timing,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.716
as Terry was just talking about,

00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:51.738
and how the inputs have to
come in in a particular order

00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:55.278
in order to engage the areas of the brain

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.385
that are going to be developing language,

00:04:57.385 --> 00:05:01.302
and we know from the
research in the deaf world

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.339
that it doesn't need to be auditory input.

00:05:09.062 --> 00:05:11.229
There's also the idea that

00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.942
there can be a lot of
coordination among the senses

00:05:14.942 --> 00:05:17.192
as the child is developing.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.540
If they're hearing and they
have their other senses,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.440
we were just talking
about how do you look at

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.393
how input into one sense

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:29.418
affects all of the other
connections in the brain,

00:05:29.418 --> 00:05:33.585
because we know that language
is extremely connected,

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:37.881
and that all of these different,

00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:40.115
if you look at what's happening

00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:41.570
in people who are deprived of one sense,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.882
you see taking over
another part of the brain.

00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:46.619
It'll repurpose it,

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.234
but there is also this
coordination that happens,

00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:54.051
and we're very interested in
looking at how that happens.

00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:55.886
- Great, thank you.

00:05:55.886 --> 00:05:59.275
So the next question
is for Catherine Dulac.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.966
"Does your work relate to changes

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.489
"from homicidal, genocidal behavior

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:08.406
"in people who have lived
previously at peace?"

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:16.505
- So I'm not really sure
how this applies to humans,

00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:20.338
but I think genocide or
aggression in general,

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:28.014
different circuit, I think,

00:06:28.014 --> 00:06:32.014
and in order that I have
not had time to discuss

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:35.031
and that I will discuss, I think,

00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.849
in the private session tomorrow.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.269
We actually have found set of neurons

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:42.067
that are responsible,
or at least involved,

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:44.551
in infant mediate aggression.

00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:46.444
So the type of infanticidal behavior

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:48.294
that you've seen in mice.

00:06:48.294 --> 00:06:50.031
Interestingly, these neurons are present

00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.742
both in males and females,

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:57.208
and in males, these neurons
are active in virgin males

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.818
and then become silent.

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.053
And in females, these neurons are related

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.770
to the stress pathway,
which is very interesting,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.986
because we know that stressed
animals, stressed females,

00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:09.986
tend to cull their pups,

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:15.333
so it's very well-known
that females in nature,

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:18.175
when there's too many,
there are too many predators

00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:21.691
or there are not enough food,
will kill their infants,

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:25.097
because basically they don't
want to spend resources

00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:28.344
on nurturing infants that
have no chance to grow up.

00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:30.986
Now, let me get back to humans.

00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:33.736
There is no infanticidal behavior

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:38.153
in the same way as in these species.

00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:41.504
I think part of it, evolutionarily
speaking, as I mentioned,

00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:43.703
there is not the competition happening

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:47.212
between a dominant male and
all sort of subordinate male

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:50.733
that doesn't give access
to subordinate male.

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:55.384
In monogamous species, the male
and the female are together,

00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:58.008
and both taking care of infants,

00:07:58.008 --> 00:08:00.631
so there is no need for this aggression,

00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:04.214
and in essence, you
can understand monogamy

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:09.627
as being the evolutionary
response to infanticide.

00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:12.448
So one way to escape infanticide,

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:15.297
which is an enormous waste of resources,

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:19.110
is actually for a couple to stay together

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.391
and both nurturing infants.

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:24.103
Now, what is quite interesting, though,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.603
is that there are two types of infanticide

00:08:30.658 --> 00:08:32.914
that are observed in humans.

00:08:32.914 --> 00:08:36.279
One is related to mental illness,

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:39.362
and I mentioned postpartum psychosis.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.595
That's one of them, and
it's extremely rare.

00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:47.958
And the other one is a
cultural infanticide.

00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.037
It has been the case
in many, many cultures,

00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:55.204
including European culture,
Asian culture, African culture,

00:08:56.319 --> 00:09:00.486
that infant were killed for
one reason or the other,

00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:05.749
and there even a book that
an undergraduate student

00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:09.166
mentioned to me that describe infanticide

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.538
that was systematically practiced

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:14.584
in the northern of Japan

00:09:14.584 --> 00:09:18.534
from I think the 16th century till 1950.

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:21.103
And that was just done
very systematically,

00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:23.842
as soon as infant, as soon as a family

00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:25.578
had more than two children,

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:28.031
and it was done in this
entire part of Japan,

00:09:28.031 --> 00:09:32.943
and it was very well recorded
by the bureaucrat, et cetera,

00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:35.272
and then it disappeared.

00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.953
But this clearly has nothing
to do with aggression.

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:42.071
Now, relate to genocide
or aggression in general,

00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:45.463
the neurons that we found
that seems to be involved

00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:49.866
in premeditated aggression
are actually not activated

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:51.771
during other types of aggression.

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:54.825
So male-male aggression
or maternal aggression.

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:58.848
These tics are handled by
other type of neuronal segue.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.951
So I hope I answer the question.

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.368
- Very nice, very nice, okay.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:08.573
BJ Casey, this is your question.

00:10:10.702 --> 00:10:12.785
If you choose to take it.

00:10:14.236 --> 00:10:16.715
"Does prenatal maternal stress

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:19.715
"affect the developing fetal brain?"

00:10:22.046 --> 00:10:23.559
- So I think in my presentation,

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:26.343
I was a postnatal chauvanist,

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:30.110
and focused only on
changes during that time.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.148
But we know that earlier in development,

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:36.129
there are a number of
environmental factors

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:38.796
that can impact the fetal brain,

00:10:40.989 --> 00:10:43.572
and so the answer would be yes.

00:10:45.864 --> 00:10:48.051
And I could expand on that more

00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:52.558
if there was a specific
place you wanted to go,

00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:53.484
whoever asked that.

00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:54.680
- [Audience Member] Cortisol.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.483
- [Audience Members] Cortisol levels.

00:10:57.483 --> 00:10:59.339
- Cortisol levels.

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:00.405
- [Audience Member] In the mother.

00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:01.330
- In the...

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.163
- [Audience Member] Mother.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:03.661
- In the mother, right.

00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.177
- [Audience Member] Stress.

00:11:05.177 --> 00:11:06.010
- Right.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.889
So that can have an impact, too.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.396
We haven't looked at
it in our own research.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:13.137
We've looked at that more
at the level of the children

00:11:13.137 --> 00:11:17.007
who were stressed by
growing up in the orphanage,

00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:19.691
but there are a number of
factors that could impact.

00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:21.730
- [Terry] What about drugs, alcohol?

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.801
- So alcohol can have
drastic effects on the,

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:26.198
there are a number of factors

00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:28.746
that can impact the developing brain,

00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:30.129
particularly fetal development,

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:33.072
which was why it was so
important for our studies

00:11:33.072 --> 00:11:37.072
when were looking at the
stress of the orphanage

00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:41.903
to have a model in which we could control

00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:43.804
other environmental factors

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.725
and control other genetic factors

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:48.150
that are just impossible to do in a human

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.674
to sort of show the
role of this experience.

00:11:50.674 --> 00:11:53.794
But of course it's not gonna
be experience or genetics,

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.433
we're far beyond that.

00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:57.406
It is the case that these
are always interacting.

00:11:57.406 --> 00:12:01.085
Experiences can turn on and
off genes and their expression,

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:02.821
and so that's very
important to keep in mind

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:04.488
in all of this work.

00:12:05.332 --> 00:12:07.060
- Okay, very good.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.310
Okay, here's a curveball for Jay Giedd.

00:12:11.494 --> 00:12:12.327
Jay, where are you?

00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:14.096
There, okay.

00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:17.804
"My husband behaves like the
teenager that you describe.

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.419
(laughter)

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:23.129
"Is this a case of delayed adolescence?"

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.379
(laughter)

00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:29.105
- You need to be patient.

00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:32.523
I mean, I guess fundamentally,

00:12:32.523 --> 00:12:34.744
the other question, you know, is delay bad

00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:38.719
in term of kind of,
quote, "late bloomers"?

00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:40.838
And particularly in education,

00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:43.218
there's a very strong
bias, earlier is better.

00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:47.969
Read early, you know, the
sooner you meet milestones,

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:49.951
the farther you'll go.

00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:52.499
And that's actually
pretty weakly supported.

00:12:52.499 --> 00:12:56.589
There's many examples, probably
in this room, even, as well,

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:58.609
of kind of tortoise-and-hare
type of phenomenon,

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:03.418
where the rules for child
prodigies is they do okay.

00:13:03.418 --> 00:13:05.832
So actually we looked at prodigies

00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:07.837
in the Hopkins Center for Talented Youth,

00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:11.612
and they're not jobless
on the street and stuff,

00:13:11.612 --> 00:13:14.043
but usually people catch up.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:17.347
A few kind of notable examples.

00:13:17.347 --> 00:13:21.575
But I think that there's very
entrenched in our culture,

00:13:21.575 --> 00:13:22.683
you know, the husband
(speaks indistinctly)

00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:24.746
sort of to get away from this notion

00:13:24.746 --> 00:13:26.786
of earlier is always better,

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.642
you know, Tiger Woods, or those examples,

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:32.524
you know, they did great
things at very young ages,

00:13:32.524 --> 00:13:35.625
but there's so many
exceptions to that rule

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.304
of people of high achievement

00:13:37.304 --> 00:13:38.699
that weren't always meteoric,

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:42.495
they weren't always the top
of their grades all the time,

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:45.495
that people sometimes wandered a bit

00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:49.915
before they engaged in their passion.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:52.298
And I've been surprised in terms of

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:53.539
if we're looking at extremes,

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:55.963
like how often that is the case,

00:13:55.963 --> 00:13:58.898
and that people tend to have
strengths and weaknesses

00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:02.056
and the environment matters a lot.

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:05.841
But it's a more seriously
interesting question

00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:08.659
for children of illnesses that,

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:10.608
as long as they're improving slightly,

00:14:10.608 --> 00:14:12.613
you know, like how long should a parent

00:14:12.613 --> 00:14:15.738
sort of be very encouraged
and hang in there,

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:18.817
even if the progress is slight.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.900
And I think, clinically, a long time.

00:14:22.817 --> 00:14:25.186
I mean, I think that that's
a good mentality to have,

00:14:25.186 --> 00:14:27.440
is don't look at the calendar so much,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.241
but, you know, is your child learning

00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:31.040
and are they still progressing, you know,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.024
are they moving toward independence.

00:14:34.024 --> 00:14:37.191
Because that sort of time of no return

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.207
keeps getting extended.

00:14:41.207 --> 00:14:42.379
It used to be, you know, like,

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:45.564
a child by five, and
they're gonna be a criminal

00:14:45.564 --> 00:14:48.585
or a saint or, you know, kind of things,

00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:50.628
that we keep seeing examples of that are,

00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:53.032
the plasticity and the advantage,

00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:54.324
I should have emphasized this again,

00:14:54.324 --> 00:14:57.149
it's not enhanced during adolescence,

00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:58.915
it's just still there.

00:14:58.915 --> 00:14:59.886
The younger, I think,

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:02.797
it's not like there's
a surge in plasticity,

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:05.312
and it never, I think,
goes away completely,

00:15:05.312 --> 00:15:09.479
but I think that for parents
and for spouses and stuff

00:15:11.851 --> 00:15:14.351
that to look more in terms of,

00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:19.726
is progress still being maintained.

00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:21.976
But it's definitely a case.

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:26.683
Some people never grow up in terms of,

00:15:26.683 --> 00:15:28.664
in terms of executive function and stuff,

00:15:28.664 --> 00:15:29.604
they remain impulsive,

00:15:29.604 --> 00:15:32.777
they are every bit
indistinguishable, almost,

00:15:32.777 --> 00:15:35.787
and some young people are incredibly,

00:15:35.787 --> 00:15:38.591
delayed gratification, you
know, forward thinking,

00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:42.307
and that's really a big
part of the challenge.

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:45.211
There's so much individual variation.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:49.798
So for a legal system to
try to use these metrics,

00:15:49.798 --> 00:15:53.148
I think that's part of the
fun and to tell them, like,

00:15:53.148 --> 00:15:56.571
what accounts for this huge variation,

00:15:56.571 --> 00:15:58.504
and what can we do about it?

00:15:58.504 --> 00:16:00.922
But even something as basic as puberty,

00:16:00.922 --> 00:16:04.279
so adolescence starts in
biology, it starts at puberty,

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:08.494
it ends in societal
independent functioning.

00:16:08.494 --> 00:16:11.502
But it's like eight to 15 is normal.

00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:13.112
That's a bizarrely long range

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:15.015
for something that's a big deal

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.085
in your world and in your environment.

00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:21.002
So I think there's so
many unanswered questions

00:16:22.224 --> 00:16:25.179
about trajectories, but I think

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:27.916
that the fundamental
one is that, you know,

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:30.249
earlier isn't always better.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.495
So I know that won't help
the marriage very much,

00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:35.522
I have a feeling.
(laughter)

00:16:35.522 --> 00:16:37.461
Earlier but, yeah, early on (mumbles).

00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.794
- Okay, so this is a question for Carla.

00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:43.148
"I was surprised to hear

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:45.775
"that there are these
immune molecules on neurons.

00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:49.584
"Does this mean that the
activation of the immune system

00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:52.462
"in the rest of the body
can affect the brain?"

00:16:52.462 --> 00:16:54.129
- Oh, cool question.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:58.889
Actually, I have a
question for Terry, too.

00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:01.516
You can look at it.

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:04.183
Yeah, so both Beth Stevens and I

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:09.666
talked about kind of
new roles for molecules

00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:14.698
that were really thought to
be exclusively functioning

00:17:14.698 --> 00:17:16.316
in the immune system,

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:19.398
and I think this is
gonna be a major theme,

00:17:19.398 --> 00:17:22.565
and what's really interesting is that,

00:17:23.927 --> 00:17:26.183
so this immune molecule that we study,

00:17:26.183 --> 00:17:27.949
and we study a few of them,

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:30.605
they're all located at synapses,

00:17:30.605 --> 00:17:32.211
and they're made by the neurons.

00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.869
So the first point is just that

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:38.090
the immune system doesn't
own these molecules.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.951
They have to share with
the nervous system.

00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:44.748
But the second point, which
I think is really exciting,

00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:48.195
is that it means that the immune system

00:17:48.195 --> 00:17:50.940
and the nervous system
have a common language.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.695
So the immune system and immune cells

00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:58.163
can actually interrogate
the neural synapse directly

00:17:58.163 --> 00:18:01.502
because molecules that it recognizes

00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:03.669
are at the neural synapse.

00:18:04.693 --> 00:18:09.178
And I think this really
opens up a new world

00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:12.214
about thinking about
how the nervous system

00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:14.888
and the immune system interact,

00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:18.635
and I think it's just the
beginning of that world.

00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:20.389
- So here's a question

00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:23.027
that doesn't have any specific person

00:18:23.027 --> 00:18:24.710
that it's directed at,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.466
but maybe anybody who wants
to field it can come up.

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:32.633
"What happens in the brain when
the Zika virus infects it?"

00:18:34.908 --> 00:18:36.075
Good question.

00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:39.863
Okay, Rusty is taking the bait, okay.

00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:42.747
(laughter)

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.642
- So it turns out that the Zika virus

00:18:45.642 --> 00:18:48.642
has an affinity for primitive cells,

00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:52.902
so that it can infect neurons,

00:18:52.902 --> 00:18:55.288
and the mechanism by which it does it,

00:18:55.288 --> 00:18:57.440
we don't really understand,
but it kills the cells,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.295
so it has a very high
affinity for periphery cells,

00:19:01.295 --> 00:19:03.878
so even, it turns out, in adults,

00:19:03.878 --> 00:19:06.667
and this was demonstrated
in a paper recently here

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:09.612
from some colleagues in,
at Scripps, I believe,

00:19:09.612 --> 00:19:10.861
showed that even in the adult,

00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:13.186
there's certain cells
that are still dividing,

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:16.004
and they're vulnerable to
the Zika virus as well,

00:19:16.004 --> 00:19:19.319
so that's why you see
these articles coming out

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:21.960
that the virus can affect
older people as well,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.313
not just the fetus.

00:19:23.313 --> 00:19:25.146
It's very interesting.

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:30.282
- Okay, so the next question

00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:33.434
has to do with mathematics.

00:19:34.442 --> 00:19:36.768
"Most mathematicians and
theoretical physicists

00:19:36.768 --> 00:19:39.058
"do their best work at a young age,

00:19:39.058 --> 00:19:40.499
"less than 30 years.

00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:41.332
"Why?"

00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:44.143
I think this is a good
question for Terry Sejnowski.

00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:46.393
(laughter)

00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:54.005
It is true.
(laughter)

00:19:55.175 --> 00:19:58.507
That, in mathematics,
that there is prodigies,

00:19:58.507 --> 00:20:00.467
and these are people who can do things

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.770
that are at a very early age

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.327
that you would have expected somebody

00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:05.840
with a lot more experience.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.687
Well, the reason why you find that

00:20:07.687 --> 00:20:10.588
in math and music and a
few other areas is that

00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:12.995
in math, you don't need
a lot of experience,

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:16.810
about the real world, because
math is its own world,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.805
and you can learn the
assumptions and the theorems,

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:25.879
and your brain absorbs it
because it's, you know,

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:29.991
in a prime state, in some cases,
still in a critical period.

00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:34.188
We find these prodigies who are teenagers.

00:20:34.188 --> 00:20:37.107
However, the converse isn't true,

00:20:37.107 --> 00:20:39.248
which is that even if you're old,

00:20:39.248 --> 00:20:41.532
you can make an important contribution.

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.782
(laughter)

00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:47.711
And here's why.

00:20:53.049 --> 00:20:56.442
I once saw a film called
Strangeness Minus Three,

00:20:56.442 --> 00:21:00.545
and it was about the
discovery of omega minus,

00:21:00.545 --> 00:21:01.998
which is an elementary particle

00:21:01.998 --> 00:21:03.764
which has strangeness minus three.

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:05.717
And they were interviewing Yuval Ne'eman,

00:21:05.717 --> 00:21:07.754
who was one of the Nobel
Prize winners, got the,

00:21:07.754 --> 00:21:10.576
you know, for doing the theory,

00:21:10.576 --> 00:21:12.285
and they asked him, they said,

00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:16.452
"You know, you're in your late
30s when you did your work.

00:21:17.991 --> 00:21:21.780
"Isn't that a little bit late
for a theoretical physicist?"

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.112
And he says, "No, no, no, no, no.

00:21:23.112 --> 00:21:27.432
"I attribute it to the traffic in London."

00:21:27.432 --> 00:21:29.522
And here's the story.

00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:33.689
So he was working on general
relativity in Israel,

00:21:34.988 --> 00:21:39.155
and wanted to do his postdoc
with someone in London

00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:41.069
at Imperial.

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:45.388
But he was also an attache
at the Israeli embassy,

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.521
which was on the other side of the city.

00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:49.203
So he realized this wasn't gonna work.

00:21:49.203 --> 00:21:52.003
He was gonna be, he'd like
to be able to pop in and out,

00:21:52.003 --> 00:21:54.643
you know, for a few hours,

00:21:54.643 --> 00:21:56.502
and if you know anything about London,

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:57.405
you can probably forget it

00:21:57.405 --> 00:21:59.356
if you have to drive across the city.

00:21:59.356 --> 00:22:03.218
So what he did instead was to go to UC,

00:22:03.218 --> 00:22:05.527
which was in the same
neighborhood as the embassy,

00:22:05.527 --> 00:22:07.149
but there were no general
relativists there.

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:10.297
So he said, "Well, I'll
work on particle physics."

00:22:10.297 --> 00:22:12.380
So he was in his mid-30s,

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:18.063
and starting from scratch in
terms of a whole new area.

00:22:18.063 --> 00:22:19.552
And he had a brilliant idea.

00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:20.913
And so here is his theory.

00:22:20.913 --> 00:22:23.110
His theory is it's not how old you are,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.705
it's how long you've been
thinking about a problem.

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:30.872
So, and that you have 10
years to have a new idea.

00:22:32.054 --> 00:22:33.658
And it doesn't matter when you start

00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:35.230
as long as you still have
the energy and the time

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.882
and make the effort.

00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:39.427
And I have to say, I
actually lived through this,

00:22:39.427 --> 00:22:41.501
because Francis Crick,

00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:43.114
who I mentioned at the very beginning,

00:22:43.114 --> 00:22:46.473
changed careers halfway through, right?

00:22:46.473 --> 00:22:48.937
He was in his, well, I'm
not sure how old he was,

00:22:48.937 --> 00:22:51.020
when he came it was 1977.

00:22:51.979 --> 00:22:53.866
Could you calculate that, Rusty?

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:56.116
(laughter)

00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:01.170
So he was probably, oh,
I know how old he was,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.110
because he was getting
kicked out of Cambridge.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.693
He was probably 65.

00:23:05.585 --> 00:23:08.918
But he wanted to change to neuroscience,

00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:13.546
and he realized that it
would be difficult to do that

00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:15.876
unless he changed his environment.

00:23:15.876 --> 00:23:20.043
And so he had the most amazing
conversations with him,

00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:23.589
because he was coming at it as a neophyte,

00:23:23.589 --> 00:23:25.676
as someone who doesn't know anything,

00:23:25.676 --> 00:23:27.726
and asking these great questions.

00:23:27.726 --> 00:23:31.893
And he would have, he would
invite eminent neuroscientists

00:23:33.213 --> 00:23:35.932
and neuroanatomists to come
tell him about the visual system

00:23:35.932 --> 00:23:37.823
and he spent a couple days
just chatting with them

00:23:37.823 --> 00:23:39.554
and it was clear that he was,

00:23:39.554 --> 00:23:41.925
had a Socratic dialog that was going on,

00:23:41.925 --> 00:23:44.494
and it was really an amazing process,

00:23:44.494 --> 00:23:45.853
and I think at the end,

00:23:45.853 --> 00:23:47.961
he knew more about the
anatomy of the visual system

00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:49.540
than any living person

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.375
because of the fact that
he was so omnivorous,

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:53.403
he just wanted to know, he wanted to know.

00:23:53.403 --> 00:23:56.941
And didn't get to the finish line.

00:23:56.941 --> 00:24:00.726
He picked a really tough
one: consciousness.

00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:03.314
And there's a story there, too,

00:24:03.314 --> 00:24:06.317
that when he was young, his
mother asked him, you know,

00:24:06.317 --> 00:24:10.490
young Francis, "What do you
wanna be when you grow up?"

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.654
And he said, "I want to be a scientist."

00:24:12.654 --> 00:24:15.287
And his mother said, "Well,
what kind of scientist?"

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.514
Well, there's only two questions

00:24:16.514 --> 00:24:18.058
that are important enough to study,

00:24:18.058 --> 00:24:20.915
and the first one, what is life?

00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:24.188
And the second one, what is consciousness?

00:24:24.188 --> 00:24:26.564
So he solved the first one,

00:24:26.564 --> 00:24:29.425
and then was going on to the second one,

00:24:29.425 --> 00:24:32.979
and it illustrates that
it's really important

00:24:32.979 --> 00:24:34.755
to ask a good question.

00:24:34.755 --> 00:24:36.079
Okay, so we're going to turn it over now

00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:38.496
to Carla for the second part.

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.401
- Okay, I have a few more questions.

00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:46.178
First of all, for Matt State.

00:24:46.178 --> 00:24:48.712
Actually, two questions related.

00:24:48.712 --> 00:24:50.462
So, come up, come up.

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:54.507
"Why does there seem to be

00:24:54.507 --> 00:24:57.337
"an explosion of people with
autism spectrum disorders?"

00:24:57.337 --> 00:24:59.226
This is a good question, common question.

00:24:59.226 --> 00:25:00.929
The related one is,

00:25:00.929 --> 00:25:03.628
"Is there hope for autism to be cured

00:25:03.628 --> 00:25:06.312
"by genetic intervention?"

00:25:06.312 --> 00:25:08.524
I'll leave them here so you can remember.

00:25:08.524 --> 00:25:09.524
- Thank you.

00:25:10.502 --> 00:25:11.335
Thanks.

00:25:11.335 --> 00:25:13.164
So, first question.

00:25:13.164 --> 00:25:14.965
Why does there seem to be an explosion?

00:25:14.965 --> 00:25:17.923
There are multiple
explanations for the explosion.

00:25:17.923 --> 00:25:21.347
So I think the one that accounts

00:25:21.347 --> 00:25:23.822
for the largest proportion of that

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:26.149
has to do with a way
that we've had changes

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.998
in diagnosing what autism is,

00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:30.637
so we've gone from autism,

00:25:30.637 --> 00:25:33.853
which looks very much like the video

00:25:33.853 --> 00:25:35.922
that I showed you at
the start of my break,

00:25:35.922 --> 00:25:37.583
but over time, over the last 40 years,

00:25:37.583 --> 00:25:41.112
the spectrum has expanded considerably,

00:25:41.112 --> 00:25:43.468
and so that makes
comparisons to where we were,

00:25:43.468 --> 00:25:45.499
even 20 years ago, quite problematic,

00:25:45.499 --> 00:25:47.699
and accounts for a very large proportion

00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:48.732
of the increase.

00:25:48.732 --> 00:25:50.777
The best epidemiological studies suggest

00:25:50.777 --> 00:25:52.318
that even when you account for that

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:55.360
that there does appear
to be some true increase

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.487
in the rate of autism that
maybe twofold, threefold,

00:25:58.487 --> 00:26:00.587
potentially even fourfold
increase in risk,

00:26:00.587 --> 00:26:03.985
which is small compared what's
purported to be the change,

00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:05.828
but still not at all trivial.

00:26:05.828 --> 00:26:08.757
And we don't fully understand that.

00:26:08.757 --> 00:26:11.384
I would say that one of
the things that we've found

00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:13.582
in our work on de novo mutation

00:26:13.582 --> 00:26:15.201
and many other labs have found

00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:18.869
is that in fact the rate of
new mutation increase with age,

00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:20.540
particularly in fathers,

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.359
and anything that increases the potential

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:26.419
for de novo mutation would
then also potentially increase

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:28.233
the rate of risk for autism.

00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.934
We can quantify that,
and it's quite small,

00:26:30.934 --> 00:26:32.725
that contribution of paternal age,

00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:34.088
but it opens up a way

00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:36.234
of thinking about studying the interaction

00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:39.549
of genetic mutation with
environmental inputs

00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:41.271
that might give us more of an answer

00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:43.612
about why we're seeing increased risk.

00:26:43.612 --> 00:26:46.912
So those would be two of the answers.

00:26:46.912 --> 00:26:50.231
And then with regard to the prevalence,

00:26:50.231 --> 00:26:51.840
and is there a chance for autism

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.765
to be cured by genetic intervention?

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:56.447
I think the basis for the
strategy in our laboratory

00:26:56.447 --> 00:27:00.459
was to identify genes as a
way of understanding biology

00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:03.718
with the thought that if
you can understand biology,

00:27:03.718 --> 00:27:07.094
and ultimately, if you
think about it broadly,

00:27:07.094 --> 00:27:11.278
how to manipulate that
biology environmentally,

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:12.925
that that was always going to be easier

00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:14.568
than trying to change genes.

00:27:14.568 --> 00:27:17.829
So the notion is that it's the first step

00:27:17.829 --> 00:27:19.558
in understanding something fundamental

00:27:19.558 --> 00:27:21.365
that then allows you to
do the kinds of things

00:27:21.365 --> 00:27:23.960
that you've seen to intervene

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.198
at a different level of analysis,

00:27:25.198 --> 00:27:27.522
and we've talked about that a bunch today.

00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:30.291
And I think it's certainly not impossible,

00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:33.457
now we're being able to both
read and write the genome

00:27:33.457 --> 00:27:35.737
in ways that even a few years ago

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.208
I would have told you was a long way off,

00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:39.850
and we're able to do that.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.827
So there are new technologies
that are allowing us

00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.343
to manipulate the genome in ways

00:27:43.343 --> 00:27:45.798
that are quite surprising.

00:27:45.798 --> 00:27:48.214
I do think, though, that ultimately,

00:27:48.214 --> 00:27:52.032
it's more likely that these
are gonna lead to interventions

00:27:52.032 --> 00:27:53.592
and even potentially cures

00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:55.636
by understanding the
process and targeting that

00:27:55.636 --> 00:27:57.787
in a way that is more tractable

00:27:57.787 --> 00:27:59.747
than trying to get in very early

00:27:59.747 --> 00:28:02.080
and change genetic material.

00:28:06.174 --> 00:28:07.540
- Thanks, Matt.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.373
Okay, this one is addressed to me,

00:28:11.526 --> 00:28:15.801
but I think Mark, you
ought to come up, Bear,

00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:17.869
and we should, we can tackle it together.

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:19.536
This is sort of fun.

00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:22.639
"What is the potential for increasing

00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:25.817
"and directing plasticity
in the adult brain

00:28:25.817 --> 00:28:29.198
"to permanently enhance
cognitive function?"

00:28:29.198 --> 00:28:33.365
So this would be the cognitive
enhancement question.

00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:38.450
- Cognitive enhancers.

00:28:40.663 --> 00:28:44.745
Well, there already are
cognitive enhancers, actually.

00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:45.578
But I...

00:28:47.656 --> 00:28:50.433
It's a very difficult question to address,

00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:52.508
because there are many
aspects of cognition

00:28:52.508 --> 00:28:56.356
that could be targeted pharmacologically.

00:28:56.356 --> 00:28:58.822
One is a process of so-called
memory consolidation,

00:28:58.822 --> 00:29:00.699
where the synaptic modifications

00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:03.555
that are laid down through experience

00:29:03.555 --> 00:29:05.578
themselves have a short lifetime,

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:07.824
unless a process called memory
consolidation comes along

00:29:07.824 --> 00:29:09.641
and cements those into place.

00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:11.914
And that's a step that we
are already quite aware

00:29:11.914 --> 00:29:14.107
that we could target pharmacologically

00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:16.524
to make memories last longer.

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:20.819
I will say that, you know,

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:23.135
those of us who've come through this

00:29:23.135 --> 00:29:25.337
by studying early developmental plasticity

00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:28.412
are very influenced by this
critical period concept,

00:29:28.412 --> 00:29:30.393
that is that the brain is immutable,

00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:32.131
or parts of the brain,
anyway, are immutable

00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:33.677
after a certain age.

00:29:33.677 --> 00:29:35.959
I don't think that concept is,

00:29:35.959 --> 00:29:37.594
I mean, I think we've
challenged that concept

00:29:37.594 --> 00:29:39.203
considerably in the last few years.

00:29:39.203 --> 00:29:42.540
So my feeling, and I think
Carla would agree with me,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.448
is that the plasticity is
present in the adult brain.

00:29:46.448 --> 00:29:49.479
What's changed is how
readily it's accessed.

00:29:49.479 --> 00:29:51.031
And I think we have better understanding

00:29:51.031 --> 00:29:54.989
of how to access, gain access
to the plasticity mechanisms.

00:29:54.989 --> 00:29:57.315
We're going to find
that the brain's capable

00:29:57.315 --> 00:29:59.398
of remarkable plasticity.

00:30:01.402 --> 00:30:02.384
- Thanks, Mark.

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:05.037
I think that last point is probably for me

00:30:05.037 --> 00:30:09.526
the most salient, that
actually, in the adult brain,

00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:12.461
some of these mechanisms that
are present during development

00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:14.907
are still there, but
they're kind of braked,

00:30:14.907 --> 00:30:17.787
and by figuring out how
to take off the brakes

00:30:17.787 --> 00:30:20.571
might be quite a natural way.

00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:22.194
Might be dangerous also.

00:30:22.194 --> 00:30:23.526
That's the other thing we don't know.

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:24.771
So I have one more,

00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:28.455
and it's another one for Catherine Dulac.

00:30:28.455 --> 00:30:30.073
And I'm gonna ask her to answer it

00:30:30.073 --> 00:30:33.441
because I wanted to ask
you this question, too,

00:30:33.441 --> 00:30:36.114
or I maybe had reworded it.

00:30:36.114 --> 00:30:39.595
"What characteristics do
you see or expect to see

00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:44.158
"in these galanin neurons
to take in mothers, fathers,

00:30:44.158 --> 00:30:46.491
"with postpartum depression,

00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:49.912
"or another way to put this, really, is,

00:30:49.912 --> 00:30:53.901
"can you connect the
galanin neurons in the mice

00:30:53.901 --> 00:30:55.984
"to the human condition?"

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:01.841
- So I think what is very interesting

00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:06.050
about the position of
these galanin neurons,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.014
they are in this area of the
brain called the hypothalamus,

00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:11.161
in this major perioptic area.

00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:14.929
And this is an area in
which a number of neurons

00:31:14.929 --> 00:31:17.537
have been identified,
different type of neurons,

00:31:17.537 --> 00:31:21.094
that each control
something very important,

00:31:21.094 --> 00:31:23.927
such as sleep or eating or thirst,

00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:27.397
so extremely important function,

00:31:27.397 --> 00:31:29.230
and then there is this new set of neurons

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.483
that control parenting behavior.

00:31:31.483 --> 00:31:33.720
And so what we need to understand, really,

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.051
is what regulates the
function of these neurons,

00:31:36.051 --> 00:31:40.218
in particular, do they express
particular type of receptors,

00:31:41.204 --> 00:31:45.234
receptors to hormones or
receptor to neuropeptides

00:31:45.234 --> 00:31:49.067
that could either, that
are involved in either

00:31:50.128 --> 00:31:53.182
increasing or decreasing their function.

00:31:53.182 --> 00:31:56.849
And so what, we are
doing these studies now,

00:31:57.952 --> 00:32:00.702
and if we find ways to manipulate

00:32:01.757 --> 00:32:04.439
using small chemicals or neuropeptides,

00:32:04.439 --> 00:32:08.351
then this is certainly
something that could be used

00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:12.663
or exploited in case of
postpartum depression

00:32:12.663 --> 00:32:14.233
or postpartum psychosis.

00:32:14.233 --> 00:32:17.528
Obviously, what we would
like to know as well,

00:32:17.528 --> 00:32:19.516
or what we should know, try to know,

00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:22.648
is what actually is
happening to these neurons

00:32:22.648 --> 00:32:26.731
in human condition such
as postpartum depression.

00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:30.067
Obviously, it's way more difficult to do.

00:32:30.067 --> 00:32:33.317
We would have to use postmortem brains.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.590
But that might be possible.

00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:40.670
There are brain banks, and that suddenly,

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.988
the relationship between
what's happening in human

00:32:42.988 --> 00:32:44.560
and mouse is very interesting.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.810
Thank you for the question.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.902
- Well, thank you, everyone.

00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:50.819
Terry, yes?

00:32:53.045 --> 00:32:54.834
- I wanna answer the question, too.

00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:55.670
- Oh, oh, oh.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.920
I'm not sure, is that okay?

00:32:59.604 --> 00:33:02.088
- Actually, this is,

00:33:02.088 --> 00:33:05.291
an experiment was done
here at UCSD at the VA,

00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:08.893
and it was specifically
with postpartum depression,

00:33:08.893 --> 00:33:10.832
and what they did was
they brought the women in,

00:33:10.832 --> 00:33:12.668
and they sleep-deprived them,

00:33:12.668 --> 00:33:16.541
so that, you know, they
would stay up all night,

00:33:16.541 --> 00:33:18.362
or part of the night.

00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:21.862
And in the morning, the depression lifted.

00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:26.830
And this just seems
bizarre because, you know,

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.499
these depressed states often,

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:31.005
they typically last for months and months

00:33:31.005 --> 00:33:32.575
and years or forever, right.

00:33:32.575 --> 00:33:34.551
It's really a difficult problem.

00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:39.506
And, but the flipside was
if they went and took a nap,

00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:43.934
even for 10 minutes, their
depression would reoccur.

00:33:43.934 --> 00:33:47.513
So you have to choose
between sleep and depression.

00:33:47.513 --> 00:33:50.890
But then they did another study,

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.170
which was to look at in the brain imaging,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.753
particularly using
activity-dependent FMRI,

00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:04.586
and discovered that change in state,

00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:09.403
they had actually tracked a
particular part of the cortex

00:34:09.403 --> 00:34:11.333
called the anterior cingulate,

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:14.888
which is part of the limbic cortex.

00:34:14.888 --> 00:34:18.832
And, interestingly, it was low in women

00:34:18.832 --> 00:34:20.196
who had postpartum depression,

00:34:20.196 --> 00:34:22.668
and if they stayed up overnight,

00:34:22.668 --> 00:34:23.915
the activity would go up,

00:34:23.915 --> 00:34:26.244
and by the way, it does
that in normal people, too,

00:34:26.244 --> 00:34:28.854
causing a form of euphoria.

00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:32.071
So it suggest that there is
something going on there,

00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:34.470
it's a circuit problem,
it's not, you know,

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:36.284
that form of depression isn't necessarily

00:34:36.284 --> 00:34:38.082
a problem of molecules and synapses.

00:34:38.082 --> 00:34:41.455
Maybe it is, but, you know, you can be,

00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:43.291
if you can readjust the level of activity

00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:47.394
one way or another, you're
gonna help that patient.

00:34:47.394 --> 00:34:51.561
And this also led to
experiments by Helen Mayberg,

00:34:53.944 --> 00:34:56.579
this is much later, where she stimulated,

00:34:56.579 --> 00:34:59.170
put a depth electrode into
the anterior cingulate,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.826
and lo and behold, and these are patients,

00:35:00.826 --> 00:35:02.659
either drug, you know,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.561
they weren't able to be treated by drugs

00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:09.263
and in some of the patients,
under some circumstances,

00:35:09.263 --> 00:35:10.778
you get this very fast flip

00:35:10.778 --> 00:35:12.591
where they suddenly, things lift,

00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:15.731
and things that were horrible and suicidal

00:35:15.731 --> 00:35:19.180
suddenly are getting more normal.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.623
So I think this, I think there are,

00:35:21.623 --> 00:35:23.071
there's a real hope, you know.

00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:23.985
If we understand the circuit,

00:35:23.985 --> 00:35:26.482
we have mechanisms for
going in and rebalancing it

00:35:26.482 --> 00:35:30.569
that we might be able to
help some of these patients.

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:33.075
- Yeah, and the last set of studies

00:35:33.075 --> 00:35:36.281
was performed on patients with depression,

00:35:36.281 --> 00:35:38.013
not postpartum depression, correct?

00:35:38.013 --> 00:35:39.023
- [Terry] No, no, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:35:39.023 --> 00:35:40.359
- Yeah, just, this was going back

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:43.692
into another interesting and hard topic.

00:35:44.668 --> 00:35:47.285
All right, well, I think
that what I'd like to do now

00:35:47.285 --> 00:35:50.535
is turn the final part of our day today

00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:56.444
over to Rusty Gage, and
he can make final remarks.

00:35:56.444 --> 00:35:59.514
And meanwhile, I just wanna
again thank all the speakers

00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:01.681
for a wonderful afternoon.

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.220
- Thank you, Carla.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.588
(audience applauds)

00:36:07.588 --> 00:36:11.189
Okay, so, my role in
this is to thank people.

00:36:11.189 --> 00:36:12.890
This is on behalf of making myself,

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.543
this has been an experiment for us.

00:36:15.543 --> 00:36:18.815
This is our first
symposium in this series,

00:36:18.815 --> 00:36:21.173
and I look forward to your response

00:36:21.173 --> 00:36:23.441
in determining whether or not
it's been a success or not,

00:36:23.441 --> 00:36:26.796
but I think we can see that it is.

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:29.397
Symposia chair, you two, thanks very much

00:36:29.397 --> 00:36:32.115
for putting this together
and helping to bring together

00:36:32.115 --> 00:36:35.964
a really great group of
speakers on this topic.

00:36:35.964 --> 00:36:37.394
Obviously, the speakers.

00:36:37.394 --> 00:36:40.748
Thanks for traveling out this
lonely place on the west coast

00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:43.160
and the southwest coast
during this time of the year,

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.685
but it's great to have you all here.

00:36:45.685 --> 00:36:48.210
And, of course, the stalwarts out there

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.111
that have stuck out the whole time.

00:36:50.111 --> 00:36:51.539
I want to thank the audience very much

00:36:51.539 --> 00:36:55.883
for their attendance.
(applause)

00:36:55.883 --> 00:36:59.280
And I wanna have a special
thanks to the interpreters,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.197
the ASL interpreters, they've gone,

00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:05.132
but we thank them for their help.

00:37:05.132 --> 00:37:07.800
KMB staff, in particular, Ingrid, Kate,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.550
Kristen, Linda, Jesse, and Janet,

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.475
who have done just an
absolutely terrific job

00:37:13.475 --> 00:37:15.660
of putting all this organization together.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.589
So I wanna give them, please.

00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:21.040
Okay.
(applause)

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.738
Kent is up there and has been helping

00:37:22.738 --> 00:37:25.393
throughout the time with videos,

00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:27.784
and many of you come in contact with him,

00:37:27.784 --> 00:37:30.354
but also Rich, Matt, Marci, and Jacob

00:37:30.354 --> 00:37:32.784
have been outstanding
in the filming category,

00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:34.602
so thank them as well, please.

00:37:34.602 --> 00:37:36.033
(applause)

00:37:36.033 --> 00:37:38.116
And finally, to keep you,

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:43.182
we'll be able to watch
this again, or better yet,

00:37:43.182 --> 00:37:45.874
get your colleagues, your relatives,

00:37:45.874 --> 00:37:47.831
to have a look at this.

00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:50.046
And take your time and see it again,

00:37:50.046 --> 00:37:52.200
and get some of those
pieces of the material

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.948
that you didn't get before.

00:37:53.948 --> 00:37:57.017
And so try to join us next
year for the next one,

00:37:57.017 --> 00:37:59.152
and we look forward to
any suggestions and topics

00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:00.444
that we could handle.

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:01.635
Thank you all.

00:38:01.635 --> 00:38:04.143
(applause)

00:38:04.143 --> 00:38:06.726
(upbeat music)
