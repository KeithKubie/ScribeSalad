00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.900
So here's the dimensionality trick.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.709
All right?
And the notation that I've,

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.558
I'm showing you here comes
directly from the paper Turk and

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:10.240
Pentland I'll mention later
that does eigenfaces.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.120
But it'll be clear.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.150
Let's suppose each this
cap phi i is a face image.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.281
So it's really long, all right,

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:25.751
d long, and by the way let's
assume we subtracted the mean.

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:30.320
Okay, so we've actually removed the mean
from all the pictures that we have, and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.708
so, we're,
we've got the mean at the origin, fine.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.494
All right.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:39.371
So now let's define
a new matrix called C,

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:44.537
which is just the average
of AA of phi of

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:48.250
the sum of phi phi transpose.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.910
Okay, this is the sum of
all the outer products and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.040
in fact this can be written
as AA transpose if A,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.496
this is just what it says here, is just
the stacked up face images, right?

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:06.720
So A, as the stacked up face images,
its going to be d, really big,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.730
by M,
M is however many face images I have.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.180
So its huge by reasonable,
that's what A is.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.580
And that means AA transpose, so if I
take d by M times M by d, I get a what?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.330
d by d, all right, d by d,
that is a really big matrix, okay?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.160
So if d was 10,000,
this would be a 10,000 by 10,000 matrix.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.346
How big is that, Megan?

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:30.344
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:31.730
&gt;&gt; That's a lot, exactly.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.850
That's a, a, a, a hundred million.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.576
Okay?

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:35.209
So if it,

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.970
if it was a million long vector, a d by
d would be a million times a million.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.540
Which would be a million million,
which is a big number.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.255
That's a thousand billion,
which is a trillion.

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:48.150
That's a lot,
you wouldn't ever want to do that, okay?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.341
The idea of trying to
find the eigenvectors of

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.960
a ten thousand by ten thousand matrix
is painful, even on today's computers.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.280
And of a million by a million matrix,
is even more painful.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.890
But fortunately, you don't have to.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.770
So C equal to AA transpose
is a huge matrix.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.730
But now, instead of considering AA
transpose, consider A transpose A.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.860
That's only an M by M matrix, right?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.960
because remember, A is d by M,
so A transpose A is M by M.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.742
Finding the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that, pretty easy.

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:30.740
Well, suppose I've got some
eigenvector v i that's an eigenvector

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.210
of A transpose A.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.680
So if it's an eigenvector
of A transpose A,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.080
that means when I multiply
A transpose A times v i,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.665
I just get some multiplier,
lambda of v i, the eigenvalue.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:46.740
Premultiply that equation by A.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.000
When you do that,
now I got AA transpose, and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090
I made this blue to make
the difference clear.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.610
A v i, and by the way I just pulled
the lambda out on the right hand side,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.610
it's just a scalar, I can do that.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.620
Look at that equation, what do you see?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.140
What do you see?

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.460
What do you see?

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.350
What you see is that the A v i's
are the eigenvectors of AA transpose.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.480
Remember AA transpose is that big,
ugly matrix, C?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.870
So all we needed to do
is to find the v i's,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.655
which are the eigenvectors
of the A transpose A,

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:28.830
premultiply them by the matrix A and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.550
I now have the eigenvectors
of AA transpose.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.190
All right.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.910
So what this basically meant was we took
the we took the eigenvectors of an n by

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.120
n matrix and created
The eigenvectors of a d by d matrix,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.560
without having to explicitly
compute the eigenvectors of d by d.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.370
This is much easier to compute.
