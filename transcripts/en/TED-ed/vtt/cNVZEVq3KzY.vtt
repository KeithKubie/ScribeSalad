00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:10.812
There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together,

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:14.574
when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives.

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:17.128
But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:20.048
relied on lightning to cause forest fires,

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:23.303
from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks.

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:26.673
Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land,

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:29.638
and became central in many rituals
and traditions.

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:33.472
So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing,

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:37.520
ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.515
Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:46.117
Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves,

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.920
however counterintuitive that seems.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.723
In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers,

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:55.353
need fire to survive.

00:00:55.353 --> 00:01:00.319
But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it?

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.427
The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow.

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:07.786
In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America,

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.546
lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun.

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:14.411
Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground,

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:18.337
which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light

00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:21.140
by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.556
Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:29.573
form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below.

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:33.243
But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds,

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:36.874
this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future.

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:39.963
Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:42.639
created by their towering parents.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.540
These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.457
There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously,

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:53.135
and another type called serotinous cones,

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.447
which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.796
Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands,

00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:03.374
and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch.

00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:06.875
Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:11.706
Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:15.441
But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open.

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.559
Let's see that in action.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.397
Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire

00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:23.362
typically spreads something like this.

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:27.319
Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir,

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.893
a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive

00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:32.789
under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.431
The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:39.385
to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines.

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.384
That ignites a tremendous crown fire

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:45.215
reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.398
That's well more than the 115-140 degrees

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:52.392
that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed.

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:55.320
At those temperatures,
the cones burst open,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.253
releasing millions of seeds,

00:02:57.253 --> 00:03:00.982
which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests.

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:05.336
After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.831
help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance.

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:13.920
From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.722
Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole.

00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:22.715
Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear,

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.934
and so would the many creatures
that depend on them.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.147
And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning,

00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:31.914
that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze,

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:34.583
which could destroy a forest completely,

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:37.356
not to mention people's homes and lives.

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:41.030
That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.109
to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay.

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.819
They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature,

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.872
but wildfires are also vital

00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:54.743
to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems.

00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:56.252
By coming to terms with that,

00:03:56.252 --> 00:03:59.022
we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:02.365
while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix,

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:04.970
to rise reborn from their own ashes.
