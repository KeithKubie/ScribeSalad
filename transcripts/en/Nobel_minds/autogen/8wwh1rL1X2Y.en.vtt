if you can imagine that you were going

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
if you can imagine that you were going

if you can imagine that you were going
to go to school and you were going to

to go to school and you were going to
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.690
to go to school and you were going to
take the bus and the bus showed up but

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
take the bus and the bus showed up but
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.550
take the bus and the bus showed up but
there was no sign on that bus to tell

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
there was no sign on that bus to tell
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.439
there was no sign on that bus to tell
you where it was going to take you all

those signs on the bus has disappeared
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.089
those signs on the bus has disappeared
so you'd get into the bus without having

so you'd get into the bus without having
 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.370
so you'd get into the bus without having
any idea of where it might take you it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
any idea of where it might take you it

might take you to your parents workplace
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and
that's a little bit what this process is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
that's a little bit what this process is
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.550
that's a little bit what this process is
because of this process the passengers

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560
because of this process the passengers
 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.830
because of this process the passengers
the cargo they get to the right place

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
the cargo they get to the right place
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200
the cargo they get to the right place
the school at the right time so you're

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
the school at the right time so you're
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150
the school at the right time so you're
not late and you don't end up at the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
not late and you don't end up at the
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040
not late and you don't end up at the
playground or at your parents workplace

supposed to be so this whole process
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.940
supposed to be so this whole process
helps the cell sort proteins so the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950
helps the cell sort proteins so the
 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.510
helps the cell sort proteins so the
information is moved to the right place
