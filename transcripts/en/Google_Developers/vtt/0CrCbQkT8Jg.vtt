00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.070
ARJITA SETHI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.190
Welcome back to Public Speaking
Pro Tips with Speechless,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.920
presented by Google Developers.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.610
We help people turn the
mundane into memorable.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.360
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Challenges into insights.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.499
ARJITA SETHI: And presentations
into performances.

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.540
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And we
do that with something we

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.010
call improv thinking.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's jump into today's tip.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.424
Get ready to fall in love.

00:00:31.424 --> 00:00:32.215
ARJITA SETHI: What?

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.650
But I'm already married.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.816
CLAIRE SLATTERY: No, no, no.

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:35.840
Not that kind of love.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.420
The kind of love
I'm talking about

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.380
is the love that
can only be shared

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.610
between a presenter and her
favorite spot in the room.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.440
ARJITA SETHI: How romantic.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.290
CLAIRE SLATTERY: This exercise
is called I Love My Spot,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.990
and it's a great
way for presenters

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.060
to get comfortable in the venue
before they take the stage.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.690
ARJITA SETHI: I love this game.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.800
It always helps settle
my nerves to play this

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.489
before a big presentation.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.530
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Exactly.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.910
So let's play and show
them how it's done.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.340
First, walk around the room,
and find a spot that feels good.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.640
And you can be picky.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.280
Remember, you need
to fall in love.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.180
ARJITA SETHI: Found it.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.138
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:21.870
Now repeat this simple phrase.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.690
I love my spot.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.620
ARJITA SETHI: I love my spot?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.250
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I love my spot.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.252
ARJITA SETHI: I love my spot.

00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:31.210
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.270
So now once you've
found your spot,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.740
really own it, and tell
me what you love about it.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.710
So Arjita, why is
your spot so great?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.530
ARJITA SETHI: I love my
spot, because the lighting

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.860
is great from here.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.370
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Yeah, it is.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.150
And any other reasons?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.900
ARJITA SETHI: I love
my spot, because this

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.720
is the spot from where
I'm going to give the most

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.986
important talk of my life.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:52.860
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Wow.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.605
That is the best
reason I've ever heard.

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:55.480
ARJITA SETHI: Thanks.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.854
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Well, I hate
to break it to you, Arjita,

00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:00.370
but you're going to need to
find another spot to love.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.990
ARJITA SETHI:
Claire, I couldn't.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.504
CLAIRE SLATTERY: You must.

00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:04.295
ARJITA SETHI: Fine.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:08.970
CLAIRE SLATTERY: So yeah.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.389
Just mill about the space.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.630
Find another spot
that feels good.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.460
ARJITA SETHI: OK.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.490
Found it.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.840
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I love my spot.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.340
ARJITA SETHI: I love my spot.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.000
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I love my spot.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.432
ARJITA SETHI: I love my spot.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:22.640
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Well, great.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.580
Why?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.310
ARJITA SETHI: Well,
it's just brought me

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.800
closer to my audience.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.722
I can connect to them more.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:29.680
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.260
Which spot do you love more?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.640
ARJITA SETHI: I think
I love this one better.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.200
CLAIRE SLATTERY: All right.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.220
Now it's your turn.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.920
Go ahead and make a
video about a space

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.266
that you have to speak
from and why you love it.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.640
This will help
you take ownership

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.680
of the space and
your talk, leading

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.671
to a more confident and
grounded presentation.

00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.420
ARJITA SETHI: Take
your video, and post it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.404
to Social with the
hashtag, #DevelopYourVoice.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.570
