00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.920
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.860
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.150
We'll be talking about
Interesante.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.910
Did I get that right?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.285
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yep.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:21.660
Perfect.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
let me introduce

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.590
our hosts and guests.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.490
In the studio, I have
Jeremy Walker.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.180
How are you doing, Jeremy?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.250
JEREMY WALKER: I'm doing
pretty well.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.230
I'm doing pretty well.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.830
How are you doing?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.040
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
I'm doing good.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.330
I think I am quite excited that
we have this show up and

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.650
running now that we
had some technical

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.910
difficulty getting started.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.980
JEREMY WALKER: A couple
technical difficulties, yep.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.440
And then on my left,
Antonio Altamirano.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.710
How are you doing, Antonio?

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.105
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Good.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:46.500
Good.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.180
Thank you.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.950
Thanks.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.303
And then, in the studio, we
also have Jochen Kumm.

00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:51.766
JOCHEN KUMM: Hi.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.640
Nice to meet you.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.710
Great to be here.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.750
And then, we will have Pablo
Gamboa joining us live as well

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.880
on the Hangout from Argentina.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.804
Can you hear us, Pablo?

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:05.286
PABLO GAMBOA: Yeah.

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:05.768
Perfect.

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:06.250
Hi Jarek.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.410
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.650
PABLO GAMBOA: Nice to be here.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.370
So let's get started.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.790
So Antonio, tell us a little
bit about your company.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.010
How did you come up with the
idea and what is the problem

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.200
you're trying to solve?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.070
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Well first,
thank you very much for

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.600
having us here.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.140
It's a very, very exciting
to be here.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.650
The idea of Interesante came
from the fact that we saw a

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.660
major, major need for the Latino
market in the US and in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.210
Latin America to be served by
a tool that is culturally

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.890
sensitive and culturally
aware, as well as

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.180
geographically aware.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.000
So we all used the tools that
are out there for social

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.830
networking.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.960
And what we were lacking is
that connection to our own

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.790
culture, to where we come from
and to the things that matter

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.800
most to us Latinos and
to the way that

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.330
we communicate online.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.070
So the tools that exist right
now work, but they don't take

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.160
into consideration the fact that
we have different needs

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.570
in terms of communication and
in terms of interest.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hence
the name, Interesante?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: My Spanish
isn't all that good but I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.380
figured that one out.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.730
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yeah.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.240
Yes.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.470
So Interesante comes
into the picture.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.275
It's an evolution of
a prior product.

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:31.480
So what we did is we wanted to
share our interests, our

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.700
favorite quotes online.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.060
So we started just developing
this and we realized that a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.390
lot of people were coming in
and connecting with what we

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.570
were doing because we were
targeting this particular

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.200
population.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.200
We were doing it for us,
and a lot of people

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.250
connected with that.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.410
So we saw this, but the brand
name did not make a lot of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.890
sense at that point.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.010
It was called Proverbio and it
was too narrow of a set.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.020
So what we did is we were
thinking about a word that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.990
will unite interest across
South America.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.400
So what we wanted to do is we
wanted a word that is easy to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.340
understand, it's playful, and
is understood by everyone.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.070
Because people that are watching
this show, they will

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.290
know that there are many
differences between the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.950
Spanish that is spoken in
Argentina versus the Spanish

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.370
that is spoken in Mexico, but
the word interesante brings

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.620
all of that together.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.000
So that is what we stand for.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.030
We want to be the place where
Latinos can find their

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.100
interests online
and on mobile.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds like
you performed a proverbial

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.010
pivot and became Interesante.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.660
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yes.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.860
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.760
Very interesting history.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.500
So I was thinking, perhaps,
rather than describing in

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.120
words of what the product does,
maybe you could give us

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.960
a little demo?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.350
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yes.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.890
Completely.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.230
Yeah.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.930
Maybe we'll--

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.580
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO:
I would love to.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
--try the demo.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.360
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Great.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.160
So this is the landing page
and I want to show you the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.470
landing page so that there
are a few steps--

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.220
Interesante is very
easy to use.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.320
So basically what you have to do
is you have to create your

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.970
account and you start to see
this interests that are

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.140
relevant to you.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.605
So as you roll over, you see
this button that says mi

00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:22.510
interessa and if you're
interested in that interest,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.730
then you click and we classify
it automatically.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.670
So and you can see that the
collection is automatically

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.340
set and that we categorize
that collection.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.850
So you can select from a wide
variety of interest.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.700
And here you can see that
Android is very popular in

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.960
Latin America so that's a very
popular item in Interesante as

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.810
well as travel for places that
are not found in sites like

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.350
Expedia or anything like that.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.950
This is just very localized type
of travel that this is

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.770
growing exponentially
in Latin America.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.530
Then with that--

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if you
want to find a destination

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.580
that isn't popular yet but
it's cool, you go to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.050
Interesante.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.200
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.880
Yes.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.170
Exactly.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.100
So then with that, we take that
and we Johen here that

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.040
will speak more about that, but
we have algorithms that,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.180
as I said, they're culturally
aware and we help you discover

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.760
new interests.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.480
So for instance, if because I
am into Interesante, then I

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.160
see this mug with the logo
of Interesante on it.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.670
And also, as an addition to
that, you can collect them.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.050
So you can collect this interest
and you can select

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.620
your own collection, but the
point here is that we don't

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.150
want people to be worrying too
much about what they have to

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.800
do, where they have to put it,
so we built the intelligence

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.350
in the back-end and we take
your interests we auto

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.445
categorize them, and we use
that so that we can serve

00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:50.670
better interests to you.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.870
And of course, we're
in mobile as well.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.660
And we'll be showing
that later.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.040
If you want, I'm going to go
really quickly to one of the

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.170
actual screenshots
of the product.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.190
So for instance, this is an
interest that many people--

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.460
this is in Spanish so basically
it says that these

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.340
are not bags under
my eyes, they're

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.195
just accumulated ideas.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:23.450
That's perfect for you.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.980
So you see that eight people
have collected that.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.210
You have access to those
people, but most

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.580
interestingly, you have access
to all the interests that

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.480
relate to that particular
thing.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.000
So and we're doing the
same with video.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.470
So again, this is something
that is very popular.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.870
This is Sofia Vergara is very
popular in our site.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.630
I hope we're live there now.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.000
Let me talk about the
integration with YouTube, in

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.250
particular.

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:05.750
Let me just get to the right
URL so that I can share.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.980
OK.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.720
So in this case, we have this
video that basically talks

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.750
about how difficult it is
to understand Spanish.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.640
So it goes through like 10
different words and explains

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.240
the different meanings in
different countries.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.380
So this also supports the fact
that we need a place where we

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.520
can collect our common interest,
not only our

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.340
differences.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.790
So what we did is we integrated
with YouTube and

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.940
you can see all of this
recommendations that we get

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.200
directly from YouTube.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.240
And the moment that you click
on one of them, then it

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.130
creates another interest on
Interesante so that you

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.280
continue to build your database
of interest that is

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.820
personal to you and we can do
a better job at suggesting

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.250
things to you proactively.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.250
And that is using the Topic API
that we'll talk about a

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.605
little later--

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.120
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --with
Pablo about.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.940
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yes.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.020
And then, you also have
a mobile app, right?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.390
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Correct.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Actually we
tried to look at the mobile

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.560
app as well.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.120
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yeah.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:13.100
So what we did in the mobile
app is we wanted to have a

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.970
different utility because mobile
is such a different

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.150
platform that we wanted to make
it quick for our users to

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.170
be able to find their
interests.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.880
So for instance, right now we're
in the category section

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.230
and what we do is we take into
consideration the activity

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.530
that you have and we
suggest interests.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.549
For instance, what we're showing
right now on the

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:37.700
screen, is their entertainment
category and you can just

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.770
swipe through all of them and
see what's interesting to you

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.140
and what is not interesting
to you as well.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.810
So in the top right hand corner,
you'll see a counter.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.020
So that counter just basically
tell you, hey, you've done

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.240
this much today and we're going
to tell you how you

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.340
stand versus other users.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.570
So you can also discover
other users as well.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.210
But mainly what we focus on is
what is interesting to people

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.960
and through that, it is a
channel for discovering

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.880
interests more than
people themselves.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.830
So you remove a lot of the
friction between who is the

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.240
person who is recommending me.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.620
We're going directly into what
is interesting to the people.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the idea
here is I may have many

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.410
different interests and someone
may not be all that

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.000
interested in me, but they
might be interested in a

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.380
particular area that I'm--

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:31.800
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --collecting
information about or may be

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.080
curating videos and so forth.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.320
Right?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.390
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So then they
would actually follow that.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.110
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Yeah.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And just
subscribe to it.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.750
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: And the
cool thing is that I don't

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.430
have to actually go to
your profile and

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.600
choose what I like.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.250
The system will tell me, oh,
because you like add

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.950
technology or because you like a
certain topic and because of

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.120
your activity, then we're going
to take one of your

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.610
interests and suggest it to
[INAUDIBLE] for instance.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.060
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.890
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: So then
it's built in within this

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.230
discovery and the experience
of the app.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:08.020
So now I know Jochen works on
figuring out exactly the

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.790
mathematics behind the interest
accommodations and

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.660
then we also have Pablo on the
Hangout so why don't we talk a

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.810
little bit more about the
technical aspects of this

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.540
integration.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.270
Let's see if we can bring
in Pablo online here.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.520
JEREMY WALKER: Can you
hear us, Pablo?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.100
Great.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.600
Can you talk a little bit about
how the integration with

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.850
the app came about?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.430
PABLO GAMBOA: Well something
Antonio said, our man use of

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.130
the YouTube API was to get
related media on Interesante.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.660
And the user has the opportunity
to create

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.360
interests with YouTube videos.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.480
So when another user opens the
video on Interesante, what we

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.560
have done is to comb YouTube's
API and also use the Freebase

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.070
topics that they provide to get
related videos that we can

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.920
recommend to that user.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.490
So this provides the users with
a lot of more content

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.480
that maybe interesting
for him.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.260
And also, with just a couple
of clicks, the user can add

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.295
those new YouTube related videos
to his collection on

00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:25.380
Interesante.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.950
So it's like we are having
two features.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.410
One is recommendations and the
other is letting the user add

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.430
this content to his interests
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.030
That feature is live on
Interesante.com now, and we

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.080
have another feature that is
still in beta, we are still

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.470
working on it which is basically
the possibility to

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.530
import your playlist, uploaded
videos, favorites [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.795
from your YouTube account or
from another [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:01.130
account.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.490
But this is still beta.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:07.330
We don't have this feature
on production right now.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.200
JEREMY WALKER: So let's go back
a little bit because you

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.590
said something that I'm
really interested in.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.350
Our new version of the data API,
which launched recently

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:20.310
and Jarek posted it, uses one
of the new features is the

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.190
Topic's API which uses Freebase
a little bit.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.780
So I know, and we want to get
into this with you, if you

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.130
could talk a little
bit about that.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.740
So it sounds like you're
importing and you're using

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.990
that portion of the data API to
kind of get recommendations

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.780
from other people and kind
of categorize them.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.890
Is that correct?

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.675
PABLO GAMBOA: Yeah,
that's correct.

00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:45.750
Technically, what we are doing
is once we tapped the video we

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.925
get the video in and we query
the API to get topics related

00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:52.610
from Freebase [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.840
release that [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.320
And once we get that topics,
with our [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.520
we find which topics we are
going to get to use and then

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.100
query again the API to get
those related videos.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.810
So it's pretty important to
query that Freebase topic now.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.985
JEREMY WALKER: And did you want
to add anything to that

00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:18.150
because I know you really
jump into the

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.990
details of all that stuff?

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.110
JOCHEN KUMM: Yeah, I'll talk
about the algorithms without

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.940
talking about the algorithms.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.650
I think when I came to
Interesante that the question

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.290
was, is there something unique
about Latinos, in the most

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.450
general sense?

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.420
Having lived there, I think
I know there is, but the

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.470
question was can we capture
that and what's the point?

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.440
So the idea was you have
two extremes here.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.040
You can go and look at everybody
in the world and try

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.200
to understand everybody
in the world.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.960
What happens is you lose
your resolution.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.970
On the other extreme today, you
can probably track someone

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.740
as a person and get to know them
very well but that wasn't

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.750
what we were after because we
want to show them, we bring

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.160
them into the world.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.040
So Interesante is right
in the middle.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.050
We're trying to find the
community that you're part of

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.430
so you don't have to look at the
whole world and just get

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.690
lost, but you're not limited
to your own little world.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.730
So we are about finding Latino
communities that emerge

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.405
naturally from the data.

00:14:15.405 --> 00:14:18.970
And so one more point here, we
have two things going on.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:25.240
We have algorithms that create
communities algorithmically by

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.270
standard Markov-based
sampling algorithms.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.950
And there's an interesting
phenomenon which I want to

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.000
think Pablo for and the whole
Interesante team, the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.360
interface is designed
and it was working.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.810
So in addition to algorithmic
community, we have

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.370
self-organizing communities
in Interesante.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.440
And it is just a wonderful sort
of in order out of chaos

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.910
emerging in Interesante.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.140
From an algorithmic point
of view, lots of people

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.380
interested in self-organizing
community and Interesante is a

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.960
great example for it.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So are you
modeling that in your basement

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.360
right now with Markov
chains and such?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.460
JOCHEN KUMM: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This show
amazes me because it's been a

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.990
long time since I had to read
about Markov chains and this

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.620
was not my favorite
topic in school.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.870
JOCHEN KUMM: But it's so cool.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.680
Well I'm really getting to
know Latinos [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.910
Mexico and the United States
and finding out what their

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.080
communities are and they're
very diverse.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.720
I mean, we've had Guatemalan
writers, schoolteachers, the

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.720
Red Cross, everybody stepping
in, self-organizing, and then

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.550
we can support them behind the
scenes with our algorithms

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:35.820
which is sort of a socially
aware way of using algorithms.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.260
And hopefully we can do some
statistical something that

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.640
makes a difference.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.360
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: And just
to add something, you

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.690
mentioned the Red Cross.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.510
So the Red Cross right
now is in Mexico.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:52.640
They have these great
videos about social

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.070
responsibility, basically.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.090
But they didn't have a good
way to get the word out.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.020
So they're using
us to do that.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.260
And the advantages that by using
the integration that we

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:09.520
have with YouTube and their own
videos, they don't focus

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.110
only in one video, in one
message, they have an audience

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.030
that comes in and then they
see that there are other

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.190
relevant topics that they can
learn about that is related to

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.200
the Red Cross and what they're
doing in Mexico.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.480
And there's a lot going
on in Mexico--

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.530
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: --that is
being communicated via video

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.240
and what is lacking
is a good platform

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.235
that connects everyone--

00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:30.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.460
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO:
--culturally.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:31.796
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:34.430
I think we talked about that
about pivoting earlier on this

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.640
show and I think that one of
the ways in which I see you

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.390
using the API is that by user
sharing the video, you can

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.610
actually find what's related and
have them actually explore

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.220
things that maybe they
didn't know existed--

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.390
ANTONIO ALTAMIRANO: Exactly.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --and this
uses the Topic's API and then

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.710
the Freebase on the back-end
to figure out all the terms

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.340
that might be related.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.780
JOCHEN KUMM: Yeah.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.250
Freebase is pretty amazing.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.920
It gives us a look into the
whole world and it made our

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.190
algorithmic development so much
faster because that's our

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.650
starting point and refining is
much easier than trying to

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.140
build Freebase from scratch
so we love Freebase.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.059
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Do you find
that Freebase's coverage of

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:15.640
the Latin America Spanish terms
this is adequate for

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.890
your use case?

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.200
JOCHEN KUMM: In a way I have to
say the Latino community is

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.210
under-served a little bit.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.619
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:27.220
JOCHEN KUMM: So what we're
finding is in addition to

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.850
switching existing content,
Interesante is continuously

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.330
creating content that wasn't
on the web before.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.330
So that is not in Freebase yet
and we'll have to figure out

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.810
ways to ultimately
bring back to the

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.960
community what we are gathering.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm sure that
the Freebase folks will

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.430
be happy to have it.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.820
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.530
They'd love to hear
about that.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.490
But just quick, to jump back in
the technical end, Pablo,

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.090
can you tell us a little bit,
if you can, about--

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.250
I'm always curious what you
used on the back-end, what

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.195
language you actually used to
do your implementation.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.220
PABLO GAMBOA: Well I can brief
you something about our

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.770
technical aspect.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.700
In the back-end, we are using
like three different

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.160
We are using PHP and Python for
the main core of the web

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.760
application and our API that
uses the application and also

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.470
the iPhone application
that you've seen.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.690
And we are also using Ruby
on Rails for our

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.860
recommendation engine.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.420
And everything is connected
to MySQL in database.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.010
And that's for the
back-end now.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.360
The front end is pretty simple,
a lot of Javascript,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.300
jQuery precisely.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.006
And we are using Twitter
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:49.006 --> 00:18:51.090
framework also up front.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.370
So that's the main thing which
is that we are using now.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.060
The decision to use these
languages are related to the

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.530
way that we work.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.750
It's a lean start-up that's
how we define us.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.590
We always try to move quickly
on implementation and try to

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:15.575
deliver fast to the production
server so that's what we are

00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:18.030
using right now.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.670
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.760
I'm always curious, did you have
any surprises when you

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.820
were integrating with
the YouTube API?

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.490
Anything that you weren't
expecting?

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.210
I'm always just curious
when you were

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.830
integrating with our APIs.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.580
PABLO GAMBOA: I don't if
surprise is the word, but we

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.520
were really happy because it
was really simple for us to

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.540
understand and incubate
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:52.420
I mean, as I told you, we try
to work fast and try to

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.410
deliver fast what
we are doing.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.300
And I think the main feature for
recommendations went very

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.570
well, went pretty quick, and
that's because the API is

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.870
really intuitive.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.950
And also the [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.650
of the new API is
also excellent.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.510
You have examples there.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:17.820
You have all you need to know so
it was really simple for us

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.490
to do that and in a
really short time.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.432
So that was surprising for us.

00:20:23.432 --> 00:20:26.378
I mean, something that you
think that may be will be

00:20:26.378 --> 00:20:30.600
difficult to do was
very simple.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.550
JEREMY WALKER: That's
great to hear.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.560
That's great to hear.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.930
Do you have any features that
you wish were part of the API?

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.130
Like anything on
your wish list?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.970
PABLO GAMBOA: I think that
it's pretty complete now.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.460
I was checking all the other
features that we didn't use

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.580
yet and it's pretty complete.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.490
I would like to see how it's
going to be more integrated

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.285
with Freebase.

00:20:55.285 --> 00:20:59.460
That is really important
for us.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.650
That's more.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.510
JEREMY WALKER: So deeper
integration with Freebase.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.910
PABLO GAMBOA: Yeah.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.140
Deeper integration with that.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.535
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:21:05.535 --> 00:21:06.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.080
All right.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.530
So let's check to
see we have any

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.840
questions in the moderator.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.290
I see one question that I think
might be addressed at

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.520
you, Jeremy.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.090
And the question is, is YouTube

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.270
Developer operations hiring?

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.940
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.570
We're always hiring.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.070

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:38.840
that are available.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.110
So please check that out.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.180
I think this is it.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.000
