00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:01.935
 In this video I want to take a look 

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.907
 several examples of data presented in different ways, 

00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:07.670
 and to think which one is the best. 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.921
 Or which one can help us answer different questions. 

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.779
 Let's see the first example. 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.984
 A statistician recorded the length of each one 

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.623
 from the first 14 films of Pixar. 

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:21.757
 He made a point chart, each point being a movie, 

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:23.961
 histogram and box-type diagram, 

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.423
 to show movie length data. 

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:30.254
 Which way of exposing the data can be used, 

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:31.531
 to find the median? 

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.572
 Let's look at these modes of presentation. 

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:38.171
 Here we see the point graph. 

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.400
 We have a point for each of the 14 films. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.996
 One movie lasts 81 minutes. 

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:44.882
 We see that there. 

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:47.064
 Another had a duration of 92. 

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:50.083
 Third - 93. 

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.544
 We see that one was with a duration of 95. 

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:55.841
 And two had a duration of 96 minutes, 

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.931
 and so on, etc. 

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.042
 I say that I can use this to find the median, 

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.875
 because I can list each of the lengths 

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:05.941
 of movies, I can arrange them 

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.503
 and then I can find the median. 

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:08.565
 I can literally make a list. 

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.234
 I can write 81 and then 92, 

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:14.927
 then write 93, then 95, 

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.947
 then I can write 96 twice, 

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:19.302
 and then I can write 98, 

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:20.430
 then I can write 100. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.682
 I think you understand where the things are going. 

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.540
 I can write the whole list 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.537
 and then I can find the value in the middle. 

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:31.134
 So I can use the point chart to find the middle. 

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:32.574
 But what about the histogram? 

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:35.313
 Here's the histogram. 

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:38.146
 Here the way to find the median is 

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.415
 just to work 

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:41.722
 with a list of numbers. 

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:45.089
 Here is a movie, 

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:47.410
 which is between 80 and 85 minutes, 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.339
 but I do not know its exact duration. 

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:52.101
 Its duration may have been 81 minutes, 

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.608
 or it may have been 84 minutes. 

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:58.299
 Here I do not know and I can not actually list myself 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.111
 of the length of the films 

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.504
 and find the median. 

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:02.683
 No, I do not think I can 

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:04.609
 to do it by using a histogram. 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.586
 On box type diagram here ... 

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.164
 So I will not mark the histogram. 

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:11.721
 On the box type diagram here 

00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:14.358
 I may not be able to list all the values, 

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:17.781
 but the box-type chart clearly shows me what the median is. 

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.428
 The vertical line in the box 

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.168
 shows us the median. How is this? 

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:26.744
 If this is 100, this median is 99. 

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:29.832
 So it's 95, 96, 97, 98, 99. 

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:32.061
 It clearly shows us that the median is 99. 

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:34.894
 This is actually the easiest way to calculate the median. 

00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:36.287
 So I will choose the box type diagram. 

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:38.353
 For me, the histogram is useless, 

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:40.001
 if I want to calculate the median. 

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.929
 Let's solve some of these tasks. 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.808
 We have a place with used cars. 

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:46.596
 He checks the mileage of the cars 

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:49.127
 and records how many kilometers they have been driving. 

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.936
 He then creates a histogram and a box-type diagram, 

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.268
 to provide the same data, both of which are shown below. 

00:02:55.998 --> 00:02:58.194
 Which data representation can be used, 

00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:00.889
 to find out how many cars have been driven 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.139
 more than 200,000 kilometers? 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.158
 So, how many cars have been driven 

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:09.525
 more than 200,000 kilometers? 

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:13.264
 It seems here in this histogram 

00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:16.700
 I have 3 cars that were between 200 and 250, 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.415
 then I have 2 cars that are between 250 and 300. 

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.158
 It seems quite clear that there are 5 cars, 

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:26.105
 three that ranged between 200,000 and 250,000, 

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.938
 and then I have 2 that have passed 

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:30.115
 between 250,000 and 300,000. 

00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:31.507
 Now I can answer the question. 

00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:36.368
 5 cars have gone over 200,000 kilometers. 

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:40.036
 I can say that the histogram is quite useful. 

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:42.915
 But let's prove that the box-type diagram is not so useful. 

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.029
 I want to know how many cars are spinning 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.141
 more than 200,000. 

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.880
 Well, I know that if we have more than 200,000, 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.943
 we will be in the fourth quarters, 

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.194
 but we do not know how many values ​​there are, 

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:01.583
 just by looking at this data here, 

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.671
 so this will not be useful to answer this question. 

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:06.227
 Let's look at the second question. 

00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:07.690
 Which presentation can be used, 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.518
 to find the value of the median, 

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:11.478
 which mode of presentation can be used to find, 

00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:12.478
 that the value of the median 

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:15.420
 is approximately 140,000 kilometers? 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.744
 To find the median, 

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:18.716
 you can basically list all the numbers 

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:20.250
 and then find the number in the middle. 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.315
 And here we can not count all the numbers. 

00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:25.405
 I know there are 3 values ​​that are 

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:27.541
 between 0 and 50,000 kilometers, 

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.585
 but I do not know who they are. 

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:30.792
 There may be 10,000, 10,000, 10,000. 

00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.483
 There may be 10,000, 15,000 and 40,000. 

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:37.020
 I do not know what they are, so if I can not list them all 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.142
 these things and sort them, 

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.228
 I will really have difficulty in finding the value of the median. 

00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:45.392
 The value of the median will be 

00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:47.783
 in this range somewhere here, 

00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:49.687
 but I do not know exactly how much it will be. 

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:50.964
 The histogram is not useful, 

00:04:50.964 --> 00:04:53.918
 because we have put all the values ​​in these groups. 

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.258
 While chart-type box clear, 

00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.116
 directly shows us the value of the median. 

00:04:58.116 --> 00:05:00.508
 This line is here inside the box 

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.737
 shows us the value of the median, 

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:05.034
 and we see that the value of the median here, 

00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:08.425
 is 140,000 kilometers. 

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.341
 This is 100, 110, 120, 130, 

00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:16.011
 140,000 km is the median value of the distance traveled by the cars. 

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:18.808
 So the box-type diagram 

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:23.242
 clearly shows us this data.
