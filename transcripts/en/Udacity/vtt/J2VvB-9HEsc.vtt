00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.166
Just like we knew that x squared equals 3 had the solutions plus or minus the

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.320
square root of 3, here x is equal to plus or minus the square root of negative

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.466
1. However, we know that the square root of negative 1 has a different name.

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:16.527
It's just i, the number we've been talking about. So either positive i, or

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:21.128
negative i can multiply by itself to equal negative 1. However, we said that the

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:26.274
positive version of the square root of negative 1 is equal to I. And logically

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:30.265
then, the negative version is equal to negative I.
