00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.970
Why do we care about scientists’ Nobel efforts?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.120
Hello everyone, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.180
When someone wins the Nobel prize, everyone
instantly knows they’re kind of a big deal.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.750
Winners not only get a shiny medal but 8 million
Swedish Krona, and of course they're respected and revered.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.210
But it’s far from the only prize recognizing
contributions to the advancement of humanity.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.660
So why is the Nobel prize held in such high
esteem?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.669
Maybe it’s because of the prize’s past.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.719
The Nobel prize has existed for over 100 years
and has been given to some of the most recognizable

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.879
names in history, like Albert Einstein -- the
relativity guy, Ivan Pavlov -- the dog guy,

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.280
and Werner Heisenberg -- no, not the meth
guy.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.390
It was established by Swedish chemist Alfred
Nobel, who made a considerable fortune off

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.109
his invention of dynamite.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.299
In 1895, he secretly drafted his will to set
aside the bulk of his estate for prizes in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.789
5 fields: physics, chemistry, physiology/medicine,
literature, and peace.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.760
Economics was added later by Sweden’s central
bank, though technically it’s not a Nobel

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.830
Prize, it’s just named in honor of Alfred
Nobel.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.229
Nobel passed away in 1896 and in 1901, the
first prizes were handed out.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.000
At first, the press was only interested in
the peace and literature awards, as the sciences

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.270
were thought to be a bit too niche for the
general public.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
But when Marie Curie and her husband were
awarded the 1903 prize in physics, along with

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.079
Henri Becquerel, their story captured the
public’s imagination.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.700
The idea of the poor Curie’s scraping by
in a laboratory while they revolutionized

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.710
our understanding of atoms made for great
headlines.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.580
They became celebrities, and the scientific
Nobel prizes started getting recognition.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.270
Now the Nobel prize has become a shorthand
for greatness, though the awards are not always

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.679
given out controversy free.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.130
Part of the problem is Alfred Nobel stipulated
only 3 people could share the award and the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.909
cash prize that comes with it9.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.240
The cutting edge of science today requires
a lot of collaboration, and sometimes people

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.850
who do valuable research are left out.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.509
Other times they’re straight up snubbed,
like Joycelyn Bell Burnell.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.349
She was the first person to observe radio
pulsars, but the 1974 prize in physics was

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.830
given to her doctoral thesis advisor.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.930
Talk about a No-Bell prize.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.709
It’s important to remember the winners are
selected by committees and so, of course they’re

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.709
fallible.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.090
Their members are appointed by the Royal Swedish
Academy or the medical university Karolinska

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.120
Institutet.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.959
Except for the peace prize committee; Alfred
Nobel stipulated that they have to be Norwegian

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.459
for... some reason.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.590
Anyway, the committees invite thousands of
people respected in their respective fields

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.110
to nominate winners and narrow it down from
there.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.260
When it comes time to announce the winners,
they don’t always make the most perfect or most

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.770
obvious picks.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.650
Usually they do select scientists who have
made lasting impacts their field, like Peter

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.650
Higgs.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.060
Higgs had to wait almost 50 years for his
prize, because he proposed the Higgs boson’s

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.459
existence in 1964, but it wasn’t confirmed
until 2012.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.439
In 2013, the Nobel committee recognized that
he made this massive contribution (pun intended)

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.890
to particle physics.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.860
Because of the delay between a scientist's
work and its visible influence, the Nobel

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.159
Prize has become something of a career award.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.420
That doesn’t mean nobel laureates are resting
on their laurels and calling it a day once

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.650
they’ve won though.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.799
Four scientists have won the nobel prize twice,
including the aforementioned Marie Curie.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.299
She’s not only the first woman to win it,
she remains the only person to win a Nobel

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.579
Prize in two different scientific categories.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.349
We can’t do episodes like this without our
sponsors.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.260
If you listen to music and podcasts and are
looking for a new Bluetooth speaker, check

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.129
out Monster’s reimagined boombox, the Monster
Blaster.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.719
It’s available for monthly payments starting
at $25.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.560
The Monster Blaster has the power to bring
music to life indoors and out.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.340

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.980
Higgs’ proposed boson took so long to find
because we had to build the most powerful

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.550
atom smasher ever to look for it.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.140
I actually visited; you

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.560
can go see that video right here.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:16.540
Do you 
guys keep track of the Nobel prizes?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540
Do you care?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.540
Are there any that blew your mind?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.380
Let us know in the comments, make sure you
come back every day for more DNews and thanks

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.880
