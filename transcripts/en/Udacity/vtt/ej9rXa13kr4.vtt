00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In the last question involving this data structure,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we want to create a dictionary that contains the hexamesters as the keys

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the values as a list of each course a given person is involved with.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So let's look at Dave.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For April 2012 he's involved in 2 courses:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
cs101, his intro course, and cs387, the Applied Cryptography course.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And the dictionary continues on, but the structure stays the same,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where the key is the hexamester and the value is a list of courses

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
for which that person is involved.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
So 1 question you may be asking yourself, what does it mean to be involved?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And if we go back to our data structure, what we're going to do

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is look at the name value pairs associated with the course.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So if we're looking for Steve, Steve is associated with his class, cs253,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the Web Engineering - Building a Blog.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
And so that's what we're going to do.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
We're going to go through each course, looking at the value in the name value pairs,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and if the value is what we're looking for,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
then we're going to add that course to our dictionary

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
associated with the key of that hexamester.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It sounds a little convoluted, and the answer is a little long,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but it's really a simple idea.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The first thing I'm doing is creating the output dictionary.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're going to go through each hexamester.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're going to go through each course in each hexamester.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We're going to go through each key in the name value pairs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If the value associated with all this is the person we're looking for,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then we're going to update our output dictionary.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If we've already added this hexamester as a key to the output dictionary,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
then we're just going to append this course at the end of the list

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
associated with that hexamester.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Otherwise we're going to create a new list for which the course is the sole value,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and once we're done with all these for loops, we're going to return our output dictionary.
