00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.620
Good morning, Library
of Congress colleagues

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.790
and our very special guest.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.390
My name is Jane Sanchez
and I'm told

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.170
that I'm the 25th Law
Librarian of Congress.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.790
It is my honor to
welcome you today

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.160
to the Law Library's annual
celebration of Law Day.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.410
This year's Law Day
program is entitled "Justice

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.660
through the Perspective
of an Eye-Witness Artist".

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.690
And we're doing this in
conjunction with the opening

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.030
of the Library of Congress'
exhibit, "Drawing Justice:

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.980
The Art of Courtroom
Illustrations.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.820
Today's program is sponsored
by the Law Library of Congress

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.860
and the Library of Congress
Prints and Photographs Division.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.320
We are honored today to
bring together a panel

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.270
of three artists to talk about
their work, Marilyn Church,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.320
Pat Lopez, and Bill Robles.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.490
To begin, just a few
words about Law Day.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.280
It was first proposed

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.570
by the American Bar Association
President Charles S. Rhyne

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.870
in 1957.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.330
Mr. Rhyne envisioned
Law Day as a way

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.550
to celebrate America's
legal system.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.070
In 1958, President Eisenhower
issued the first presidential

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.690
proclamation designating
Thursday,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.940
May 1, 1958 as Law Day.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.710
And I quote, "It was to be
a day of national dedication

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.540
to the principle of
government under laws."

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.770
In 1961, Congress passed Public
Law 8720, establishing May 1

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.890
as Law Day USA in perpetuity.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.990
Since 1961, presidents have
issued annual proclamations

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.630
calling on all Americans to
celebrate Law Day and our system

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.870
of government and laws.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.300
Before our panel
begins this morning,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.600
I have a couple housekeeping
announcements.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.980
Can you switch off
your mobile phones,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.960
if you can, to silent mode?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.870
And please note that this
program is being videotaped

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.540
and later will be available
on the library's website.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.280
After today's program,
we invite everyone

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.660
to visit the exhibition,
Drawing Justice:

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.600
The Art of Courtroom
Illustration.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.520
The exhibit is in this building

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.170
on the second floor
south gallery.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.360
Before we get started, a
couple thanks are in order.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.470
To Mr. Tom Girardi for making
this exhibition possible,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.880
to Thomson Reuters
for their generosity

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.460
in supporting today's
program, to the Library

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.140
of Congress Prints and
Photographs Division,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.230
our cosponsor, and to the
friends of the Law Library

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.210
of Congress, thanks
to all of you

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.630
for your many contributions
making this event possible.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.740
And now, I would like to
introduce Sara W. Duke,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.140
Curator of Popular and Applied
Graphic Art in the Library

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.280
of Congress Prints and
Photographs Division.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.510
Sara came to the
library as a wee baby

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.390
in 1991 as a junior fellow.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.830
As a curator, she
acquires cartoon art,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.090
documentary drawings,
and ephemera.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.450
Sara will introduce
today's panel

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.520
and she will moderate our
panel discussion today.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.320
Sara?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.490
[ Applause ]

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.280
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Thank you, Jane,
and thanks to everyone else

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.110
who made this day possible.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.620
It's very exciting to have
98 courtroom illustrations

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.060
on the walls of the
Library of Congress.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.740
I have three artists
that I've brought

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.270
in for this discussion today.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.670
We'll start with Marilyn Church.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.680
She earned a BFA from Pratt
Institute in Brooklyn, New York

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.020
and attended graduate school
in the University of Virginia.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.330
She returned to New
York intent on a career

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.870
in fashion illustration, but
found herself falling in love

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.250
with the best dramas in town,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.220
the ones that happened
in the courtroom.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.560
In 2009, the Library of
Congress acquired her archive,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.290
a generous gift of over 4000
drawings from her family

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.190
which includes such trials of
famous defendants as John Gotti,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.900
Martha Stewart and
Robert Chambers

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.080
and the late blind militant
leader, Omar Abdel-Rahman.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.720
Second, and I'm doing this

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.420
in alphabetical order,
is Pat Lopez.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.740
Pat began her career with a
lengthy Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.680
in 1979, almost immediately
after graduating

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.530
from the Southwestern of
Oklahoma State University,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.230
where she studied art
education and commercial art.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.610
Known for her distinctive
representational style,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.460
she has traveled over-- all
over the United States to cover

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.560
such well-known travels--
trials as Terry Nichols

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.430
and Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma
City before their trials got

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.500
separated, the Waco
Branch Davidian co-trials

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.380
in San Antonio, Texas,
and Citadel v. Faulkner

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.670
in Charleston, South Carolina.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.660
And you can see all of
those drawings upstairs

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.710
after this discussion.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.710
The library acquired a small
archive of Ms. Lopez' work

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.150
through a combination
gift purchase.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.120
Finally, last but not least,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.530
Bill Robles is a Los Angeles
based courtroom artist

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.520
who earned his BA from the
Art Center College of Design.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.560
After working as an
advertising illustrator,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.250
CBS Evening News hired him
to cover the 1971 trial

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.880
of Charles Manson
and his family.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.190
What a way to begin
a career [laughter].

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.980
Walter Cronkite led
off the Evening News

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.500
with his drawing the
day Manson attempted

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.400
to stab the judge with a pencil.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.530
And you can see both Mr.
Robles' drawing as well

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.560
as Cronkite's Evening
News broadcast upstairs

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.590
in the exhibition.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.050
He has worked in
courtrooms ever since,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.850
covering the Los Angeles
trials of O.J. Simpson,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.050
Michael Jackson, and
litigator, Thomas Girardi,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.790
but traveling further
afield is needed.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.600
The library acquired a selection
of Robles' work as part

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.350
of the Thomas v.
Girardi collection

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.080
of courtroom illustration
drawings.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.730
And with that, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.610
I'd like to invite you
to come up to the stage

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.460
so we can begin our discussion.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.120
How many of you have
been in a courtroom

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.200
and seen an illustrator at work?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.750
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, really.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.690
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: OK,
so a few of you.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.300
I guess since the
majority of the people

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.590
in this room haven't
seen you at work,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.100
why don't you give
the audience a sense

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.630
of about how you get hired and
what it takes to get yourself

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.780
into the courtroom
to draw a trial.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.250
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
Shall I start?

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.550
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Ladies first.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.350
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Please,
please go first.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.650
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
Ladies first [laughs].

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.810
It's so difficult from getting

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.490
in the door sometimes
a long waiting line

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.820
for a high-profile trial, and
you're lugging heavy supplies.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.380
And when you do get in, you're
often fighting for a seat

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.140
with the reporters who
also want a front-row seat,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.440
they want to hear.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.740
You want to see another artist.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.840
Everybody wants the
best viewpoint.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.640
And we draw with our supplies on
our laps, a pad and it's crowded

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.600
with other artists, and
you're balancing every thing,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.000
sometimes water, sometimes
trying not to make noise,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
trying to pull out your
binoculars to see when you're

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.340
in a very dark space and the
defendant may be backlit.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.690
It's all kinds of obstructions
from morning till you finish.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.230
And sometimes, you have a
very short time to finish,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.000
like sometimes less than an hour
or 20 minutes in an arraignment.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.620
So, I could go on and on
about how difficult it is,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.980
but I'll leave some for you.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.280
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: OK.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.640
Well, as Marilyn said, the
same experience with me.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.400
We're always looking for the
best seat in the courtroom

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.070
but so is everyone else,
especially the attorneys.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.460
And sometimes I have to bargain
with them to get the best seat,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.610
which means, oh, I'll put a
little more hair on your head

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.080
until you give me
that seat [laughter].

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.100
But not only that, it
was because we were

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.640
in the best seat, we were the
first to see forensic evidence,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.150
the first to see all the
drama that would happen.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.460
In fact, we had to
have-- we had to sort of--

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.990
I did, anyway, had to
build my intuitive sense

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.560
or radar of the courtroom.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.310
If something were
going to happen,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.170
you could almost feel
it before it happened.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.610
In other words, if I were here
drawing what the goings-on

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.220
in the well of the court
and a family member,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.080
as happened in the Oklahoma
City bombing case that I did,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.360
a family member stood up and
started screaming or crying

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.860
or whatever, that
would be the story.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.080
Then I had to grab
a new sheet of paper

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.890
and instantly start drawing it.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.700
So, not only fighting for
our seat, but keeping it

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.150
by getting the story
when it happened.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.450
Bill?

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.750
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Again,
seating is everything.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.050
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yeah.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.630
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Getting there--

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.710
It depends, there are so
many high-profile trials

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.360
in Los Angeles that you
have to get there early.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.070
And it's a call-in thing.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.630
The TV station just phoned and
they get the name on a list.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.040
And artists kind of have a
priority, but it's no guarantee

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.070
that you're going to get in.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.370
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.630
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Sometimes
the-- If there are two artists,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.520
there's a flip of a coin
and whoever gets it goes in.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.830
But in most high-profile trials,
they only allow one artist.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.240
So, the other artist and
myself usually flip a coin

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.550
and whoever wins
goes in the first day

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.890
and then we alternate days,
so that kind of works out.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.480
But I remember during
the Menendez--

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.000
Remember the Menendez
Brothers trial?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.480
The judge did not like the media
and he did not allow cameras,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.070
but he let the artists
in, but he put the artists

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.050
in the corner of the courtroom.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.080
So it was really very difficult.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.060
That's where your drawing
skills have to play in.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.860
And like you said, arraignment
sometimes 10 minutes, they're in

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.170
and they're out, and boy, you've
got to capture it like that.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.350
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And you see
mostly the back of their heads.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.650
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.750
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: You pray
that they'll turn sideways

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.050
and say something to--

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.560
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: We love the
side views and we love beards

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.010
and mustaches, big hair.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.610
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.910
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: It makes it
a lot easier, doesn't it?

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.210
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.510
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: It does.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.470
Right. I think the shortest
amount of time, I don't know,

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.920
when you said short,
I mean short.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.770
I remember during the Jasper
dragging death, this was a trial

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.690
in Jasper, Texas,
a very small town,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.410
and the courtroom was probably
a century old, beautiful.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.710
I had to stop myself
from engaging

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.900
in so much time drawing all
the beautiful carved woodwork

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.200
and the old fans.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.950
They even had brass batons
at the bottom of the--

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.960
but I had to sit next to it
because it was the best seat.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.700
Anyway, during that trial, Dan--

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.320
At that time, I was working
for CBS, I was a contractor

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.850
for whoever called
first, so freelancer.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.880
They had told me that
Dan was on the front lawn

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.140
with his entire crew, they
were doing a live shot,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.990
it was at the end of the trial.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.880
And yet, I had work to do.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.350
The trial wasn't over but
everybody left to go see the--

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.770
you know, all the
goings-on on the lawn.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:13.140
I was one of the few people
left in the courtroom and I knew

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.360
that I was waiting for the most
important piece of the trial,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.800
the chain that these
people had had hooked

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.030
on to the victim's
feet, James Byrd

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.640
and they drug him to his death.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.400
Well, this chain
hadn't showed up

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.990
yet in the courtroom
as evidence.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.290
I waited and waited.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.120
And finally, they brought it

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.730
out when the courtroom
was near empty.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.810
But they forgot, I was
still there, so I--

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.250
they brought the chain out.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.990
He held it up and held
it for maybe two minutes.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.420
I got it. The drawing
is downstairs.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.720
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Good.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.740
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: So, you've all
had long careers as artists.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.980
How did your technique
evolve over time?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.000
Did you change the
materials you used?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.480
Did you start out
looking like somebody else

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.020
and developed your
own distinctive style?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.200
Or did you always have
your distinctive style?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.560
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: There
was really nobody else.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.550
I mean, it was kind of
started way back just part

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.990
of the Manson trial.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.340
This is almost-- Well,
it's 46 years ago.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.760
This August will be 47 years.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.760
But, I had never set foot
in a courtroom in my life.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.870
I was a fairly successful
illustrator for 10 years

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.270
and then the murders came
up and one of my classmates

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.960
from Arts Center
became the art director

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.030
at the CBS station
in Los Angeles.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:52.040
So, I always had an interest
in news as a kid, newsreels.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.490
So I approached them
as to who to see

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.470
at CBS, show them my work.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.800
And they liked me and they hired
me as their freelance artist.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:07.330
And I've been freelance for
all those thankful times, but--

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.440
so that's all that came about.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.670
Right place, right time with
the right qualifications, so--

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:23.980
And, you know, that started
the whole career, you know?

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.840
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And I
was a fashion illustrator

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.540
when an attorney friend of mine
told me about this trial going

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.490
on in the Queens courtroom.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.780
And right away, it just sounded
such an exciting thing to do.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.560
And one of the things

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.510
about doing fashion illustration
is you have to draw very fast

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.380
and you're drawing a lot
of-- the whole figure,

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.800
so you have that background
which was good to go

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.400
into the courtroom with.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.400
And I think, you know,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.530
my courtroom career spanned
almost 50 years or 45.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.770
So, naturally, you grow
as an artist, you know?

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.290
I-- There's some very early
drawings of me downstairs.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.870
There's many techniques
down there.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.250
There's watercolor,
there's black and white pen.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.990
And gradually, over the years,
also the difficulty of drawing

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.690
in court makes you perfect what
you bring to court, what's going

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.920
to be quiet, fast,
efficient, not going to smear,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.120
you have to be ready at a
moment's notice to wipe out part

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.780
of your drawing and start over
or just pack up and get out.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.200
They change courtrooms
mid-trial.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.170
Suddenly, you have to go
somewhere else, or just flying

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.800
out to get your work
videotaped outside.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.040
You have to be mobile.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.900
So, all of that affects the
technique that you end up using.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.030
And I think also, the artist
that you sit with, you know,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.850
most of the art that
I did over the years,

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.970
we were on high-profile trials,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.580
there could be seven
artists there.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.160
There wasn't one or two artists.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.460
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, I know that.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.760
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
There were many.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.020
And so, there was a lot of
sharing, I think, of ideas,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.330
looking at other artists
work, seeing what they use,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.810
if it was easier and
adopting from each other.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.110
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Mm-hmm.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.410
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.710
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: As a matter
of fact, I agree with you,

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.010
always looking at
other artists work.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.900
When I had great artist
in the court with me like,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.960
Bill and one time with Marilyn,
I was-- I could feel it.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.760
It helped my work to be better
because they were there.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.660
The level was so high.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.680
But I began because I
watched artists on television.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.550
The one artist that really
impressed me was Howard Brodie.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.670
And he was a sketch artist who
used mostly black and white ink,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.960
but he was-- or I think pencil.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.770
Anyway, I saw his work and
was just so impressed with it.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.180
And I knew that I could do it,
somehow I knew I could do that.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.160
I just graduated from
college, I went--

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.910
I was at my mother's house

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.510
when I saw Howard Brodie's
work on television.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.480
So I took a chance and
picked up the phone

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.750
and called the local
CBS station and I said,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.020
"Do you need an artist?"

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.080
And it just so happened
that the man who picked

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.130
up the other phone was in
Oklahoma City at the time

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.800
for some other reason.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.870
It was Ed-- Let's see,
Ed-- not Ed Turner.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.060
Ted-- Ed Turner, yes Ed-- Ted
was the other guy, Ed Turner

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.430
and he was at CNN at
the time and he said,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.730
"Can you draw people?"

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.820
And I said, "Yeah."

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.060
Well he used an expletive
that I won't repeat here,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.700
but I said, "Yes, sir, I can."

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.230
"Get down here right now."

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:57.180
So I did. He had me demonstrate
by drawing the anchor

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.680
who was giving the noon
news live in the studio.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.580
I was scared to death.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.100
So I did the drawing
and he said,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.340
"You walked in off the street?"

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.120
So, I was hired.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.770
My first drawing, I had
to do the following Monday

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.590
in the Denver circuit court

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.490
because Oklahoma was
impeaching its governor.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.790
That's how I began.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.470
It was with Howard
Brodie guiding me in.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.460
His son is back there,
he looks just like him.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.580
I just want to cry.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.470
But the way-- The
reason I'm here is

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.510
because his father looked at
my artwork, I asked him to look

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.350
at it and tell me, am
I doing anything wrong?

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.880
Is this-- And he looked at
it long and hard and said,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.580
"Kid, you've got talent.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.650
You can do this but you have
to work at it every day.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.840
And then you could
be one of the best."

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.140
So, here I am.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.940
Thank you, Howard

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:56.590
[ Applause ]

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.040
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: So, all of
you have an art background.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.700
Bill mentioned a love of
journalism, newsreels.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.020
But you're journalists
as well as artist.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.000
And Pat mentioned the
need to train her eye.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.500
So how did you train yourselves
to pay attention to the news,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.620
to pay attention to
elements of the courtroom,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.700
because you decide

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:27.830
for television viewers what's
important in any event?

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.780
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: The
main thing you've got

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.610
to get the person that's
involved in the trial,

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:38.680
whether it's an arraignment
or a trial going on,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.200
but number one, you've
got to get in.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.180
I try to compose the
situation, so it's--

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.400
graphically tells a tale without
a lot of superficial stuff.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.870
So, mine is more of
a vignette style.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:58.740
But, you know, the media
wants it fast, fast, fast.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.250
I remember years ago,
I was doing something

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.510
and the reporter literally
took an unfinished drawing

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.250
out of my hand and says, "Well,
listen, we need it on the air."

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.490
You know, it's so exaggerated
because it wasn't that critical.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:18.390
But he took the drawing
without being finished, so.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.890
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I
feel that happens almost

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.610
with every drawing, it goes on
before I consider it finished.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.940
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Especially
today, right?

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.040
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
Yeah, out of your hands.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.970
Yeah, but-- Wait a
minute, what was your--

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.630
oh, your question was--

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.250
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: How did
you train yourself to--

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: The--

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.750
It's really important
that you know the story,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.960
and what's important
in the courtroom.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.990
You know, the most-- the
witness they're waiting for.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.300
And so, you do try to arm
yourself with that information

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.920
and talk to the reporter.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.510
Hopefully, the reporter is
sitting next to you and can kind

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.310
of signal, "You know, the next
one that's coming is the one I

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.460
want," but many times,
you're isolated.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.020
And you have to know.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.320
So you really have

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.580
to be following the same time
what's going on in the story,

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.310
and planning, you know,
leaving room in your drawing

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.200
or being able to adapt it
and completely change it

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.900
or start all over very quickly
when that news breaking--

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.780
I mean, the thing that's going
to be the top of the story.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.640
And I think you also want
your drawing to make sense,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.780
because it's on the
television a very short time,

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:40.680
so viewers should be able to
look at it quickly and able

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.490
to absorb the story
of what's going on.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.270
So that's a challenge too,
I think, to make it clear.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.300
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I think she's
correct and I will add,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.410
it's not-- the average time
I was told by a producer

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.060
in very sharp tones one day,
the average time that it--

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.090
because I wanted to complete
a drawing and she wanted

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.230
to have it right then, that she
said, "They just see it for 13

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.660
to 20 seconds," I'm sorry,
but that's how she said it.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.960
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.280
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: And I thought,
well, it doesn't matter.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.350
It tells a story and it has
to have all of the story

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.210
in the picture, I can't
just put part of it.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.780
So I totally agree.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.590
It was oftentimes a trial
to try and get everything

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.390
in that you needed to get
in, in the time that you had.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.070
And I wanted to say
something else too.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.180
In terms of having limited
time and knowing the story,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.720
you have to know every part of
that story, every defendant,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.040
every witness, every victim,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.890
even the families
in the audience.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.190
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right, yeah.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.750
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: So that you
knew who was standing up

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.830
and shouting, or whatever
it is you needed to do.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.310
There were-- I even made
a habit, and this is going

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.000
to sound strange,
but it helped me.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.300
Sometimes, I would go to the
crime scene and that helped

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.510
to introduce a different
level of emotion for me,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.670
the Jasper dragging
death was a good example.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.160
I actually went to the actual
scene, so I could know--

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.740
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: -- what that was
and what the family endured

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.450
when they heard the story.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.510
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: So, Pat and Bill,
especially, but Marilyn too,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:28.720
your trial drawings cover this
breadth of the United States.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.260
So, how do you get hired and
how fast do you have to react

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.730
and how do you get from
place to place to cover?

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: What do you
mean from place to place?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.710
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Like if you're
not in your home city.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.010
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Right.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.840
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Who
pays for you to travel

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.280
and how do you get there and
how fast do you have to react?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.330
Like, when do you find
out that you're traveling

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.210
to another city to
cover a trial?

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.940
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: You know what,
when the Unabomber was arrested

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.120
in Helena, Montana,
you remember him?

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.890
CBS called me, "You got to
get down to the airport.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.080
You're going to go
to Helena, Montana."

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.510
So I gathered the stuff
as quickly as I could,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.180
got in the car, got-- went to
the airport, missed the flight.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.800
And a radio reporter from Los
Angeles also missed the flight.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.750
So, we flew to Spokane,
he rented a car,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:35.840
and we drove all night
through the Rockies, snow,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.570
and he would-- the reporter
would stop every hour

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.870
to make a phone call to call

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.010
in his story all
the way over there.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.320
We got there at 7:00 in morning,
got to the hotel, showered

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.470
and shaved, and got to
court in time to see him.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.670
But that was the only
time that happened.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.210
Usually, I have advanced
time, but that was--

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.740
and with LA traffic, you
know, it's [laughter]--

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.130
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: We know.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.020
Usually, you get a day's notice,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.490
if you have to travel,
but not always.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.860
There-- I have those
stories too,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.540
where it was all
the last minute.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.110
I remember the-- when
they caught Bernard Goetz,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:23.720
who was the one who shot
the kids in the subway

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.020
that were trying to rob him.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.320
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, yeah.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.390
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And it
was going to be up in Maine

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.560
and there was no time to get
a regular flight and we went

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.450
by helicopter with reporters.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.760
So, that was anything to get
there and get the drawing.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.720
And again, an arraignment, went
all the way to Maine and it was

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.460
like over in 15 minutes.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.200
But you have to have
a variety of drawings

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.110
and sometimes not just one.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:59.060
And also after-- I wanted
to say after I was at the--

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.810
when I was first starting out,

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.150
almost my first trial
was the John Mitchell,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.560
the attorney general
who was part

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.100
of the Nixon administration
on trial in New York.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.870
And I really was new at it

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.120
and the other artists
were much more expensive--

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.120
much more experienced
[laughter],

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:26.190
and probably getting a lot
more money than me too.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.330
So after I've been there
just a bout a month,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.510
the New York Times
called me and asked me

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.530
to come in with my portfolio.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.380
And I saw other artists there
too that had left samples.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.950
Somehow, they gave
that assignment to me.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:50.160
It's really hard to know
why, but I felt so fortunate

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.990
about it, but that's
how that happened.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.140
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: In my
experience, as I was--

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.230
mostly my niece was
the heartland,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.160
the middle of the nation,
although I did come

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.070
to New York once or twice
and I did work with Bill once

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:10.420
or twice or-- well, not in
California, but in Texas.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: In
Texas and Oklahoma City.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.360
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes,
Oklahoma City.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.690
In fact, Oklahoma City, because
I lived in the heartland,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.150
my family was there
also and many

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:26.520
of the trials somehow
affected my personal life.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.790
To give you an example, the
Oklahoma City bombing happened,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.350
I was at home in
Austin that morning.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.730
I received a phone
call, turned on the TV.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.030
I turned on the TV.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.450
I could see the Murrah
building going up in flames.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.730
My sister parked her car
in the Murrah parking lot

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.930
and worked a block away.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.720
As I was dealing with that, CNN
said, "We have a private jet.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.190
Get on it now."

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.340
So I got on it to
go to Oklahoma City.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.310
We sat in an RV in
front of the building.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.810
They're still searching
for people.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.380
I was there within an hour.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.930
I didn't know if my sister
was alive and had to wait

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.100
until they had someone to--
they thought they were going

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.340
to arrest someone
immediately, but they didn't.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.850
So I just sat there
in that RV, waiting.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.420
I didn't know until
later that evening

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.410
that my sister had survived,

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.880
but that was a very,
very difficult thing.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.990
There were oftentimes
that I had to go to trials

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.290
that would affect someone I knew

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.830
because it was in
Oklahoma or Texas.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.600
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: After
you make your drawings,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.320
I know there are sometimes
issues with controlling them.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.110
I know you ended up
suing for the right

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:49.680
to prevent another agency
from selling your work.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.700
So, how assiduously do you
have to guard your copyright

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.970
and your images once
you make them?

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
Intimately [laughter].

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.110
It's true.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.840
You know, sometimes when all
the cameras are outside lined

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.070
up to shoot your work,
there'll be some small station

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.060
that doesn't have a big
budget coming over, you know,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.000
and shooting and sometimes, you
don't even know it's happening.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.180
And sometimes, they
see my work on--

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.030
I saw several shows
on Oprah Winfrey,

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:31.280
I saw it on Saturday Night
Live, never got any compensation

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.680
for that and would put
in bills afterwards.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.810
So sometimes it worked
and sometimes it didn't.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.560
I mean, I don't want to
hire a legal defense and try

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.070
to get my fee, but
yeah, that happens.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.870
You do-- You have
to be vigilant.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.160
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes,
unfortunately.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.760
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I had
to be very vigilant.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.920
I was in the middle of
working a very large case

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.490
when infringement happened

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.230
and it was critically
important that I stop it.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.400
I was under contract
with another entity

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.700
and my work was being used.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.170
I could have lost my career.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.730
So that's how that--
all of that happened.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.440
Not a happy thing,
copyright [laughs].

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.740
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.300
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: It's-- I
remember one high-profile trial.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.990
There were a media
frenzy as usual.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:31.230
And it was Lindsay
Lohan, her appearance

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.900
at Airport courthouse.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.700
It was like insane and
so many, many people.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.110
Anyway, coming down the
stairs, I had a drawing of her

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.910
and I was going out to--
I do for multi-stations,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.150
if you're lucky, you can get--

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.780
if you're the only
artist allowed,

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.730
you can do for everybody.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.290
I'm coming down with a
drawing upside down heading

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:59.760
for the truck for them to shoot
and there was a photographer

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.840
that was running
alongside with me

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.190
with a camera trying to shoot.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.290
And you have no control
over that.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:07.590
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.890
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: I
saw a drawing I did--

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.520
I think it was a major
trial, I happened to--

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.290
I was flipping to see channels
over the evening and came

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.510
across a Korean station with
my drawing on [laughter].

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.380
And they had never purchased it.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:30.260
So I tracked them down and
they had to pay the fee.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.590
So occasionally, you're lucky.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.190
During the O.J. trial, I had
a jury drawing that appeared

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.020
in News Week, a double page.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.910
A German newspaper ran it.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:47.040
A friend of mine happened to
be married to a German girl

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.010
and she worked for German
media magazines in Los Angeles.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.270
And she told me about it.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.380
So, long story short,
I contacted them,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.790
they ended up paying $3000.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.480
And they were here.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.050
And of course they wanted less,
but I stuck with my guns and--

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.320
Occasionally, you're luckier
like that but most of the time,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.860
people steal stuff and you
have no control over it.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.570
And now, they can literally
take drawings off the internet,

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.950
you know, and do what they want
with them, make prints and--

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.270
you know, so you're
really at their mercy.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.600
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: That's true.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.940
Even today, I can see my work
elsewhere that I don't know

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.760
where they received that.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Yeah.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.580
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: So, I do have a
copyright attorney I work with.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.880
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: You do?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.180
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes, I do.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.480
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: That's good.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.780
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: In fact,
he'll be here tonight

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.080
at the dinner [laughter].

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.380
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: OK.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.680
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I had
to thank him somehow.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:57.400
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: So, you all
have a distinctive style.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.910
I feel like I've broken it down,
but I ask these three people

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.210
because they have what I would
call the California style,

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.710
the Midwest style, and the New
York style, which was also--

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.420
the New York style and the
Washington style aren't

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.100
that far part.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.400
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Are
not that far apart.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.700
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Yeah, I think
they're both influenced

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.000
by each other.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.370
So how did that evolve, that
each region of the country has--

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.670
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: That's true.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.970
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: -- such
a distinctive style,

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:29.330
or you've never thought
about it before?

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.090
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I really
think it had a lot to do

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.460
with who was sitting
in court with you--

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.760
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Absolutely.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: --

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.360
influencing each
other, I really do.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.820
I think the drawings
talk to each other

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.990
and the artists absorb
the culture around them

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:48.090
and I think that's
a big part of it.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.390
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I think
she's right.

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:52.740
I think I will add that
in the Midwest, of course,

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.800
is way different than the East
Coast or even the West Coast

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.730
in terms of the community, the
people who are-- the viewers.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:10.150
And I called my stuff mom and
pop drawings because if I was--

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.320
if I were to draw--

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.780
for instance, I did the
Kobe Bryant rape hearings,

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.080
it had to look like Kobe.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.150
It had-- And it couldn't be
quick and it could-- I'm not--

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.440
these two are very, very
gifted in doing quick drawings

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.130
and they can make
great likenesses.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.430
I can't do that, you know,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.910
I have to do something
that's really,

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:33.800
really almost like a portrait.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.380
And I think that the family
or the mom and pop idea came

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.250
from mostly my family.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.360
My mother was my biggest critic.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.820
And if it didn't look like
someone, she'd tell me.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.270
So I tightened up my
style because of that

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.380
and learned how to
do that quickly.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.430
But that's the only way I can
do it fast is to do something

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.830
that has a tighter image.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.310
I can't do this expressive
stuff that--

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.580
the beautiful stuff that the
two of you do so quickly.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.880
But I can do it.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.300
If I do it tight, I
can do it quickly.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.670
It took a while to do that,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.430
but with my mother behind
me, I did it [laughter].

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.800
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: It's very
difficult to get quality

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.890
when you're limited
by time, you know,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.630
when things are done
[inaudible].

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.670
Sometimes, you hate
to let a drawing go

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.170
because it's not
perfect, you know?

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:29.430
But, you know, capturing
the likeness is key I think.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.170
And everybody is going to know
if the person does not look

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.350
like the person depicted on TV.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.800
The whole-- The public
is going to know it.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.160
So that's one of the
big pressures, I think,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.550
in trying to capture
the likeness.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.200
You know, it's very important,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.920
and very difficult,
very difficult.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.640
Added pressure of
course, speaking of that,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.140
it's a very difficult just
to do and we're all seasoned

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.410
so we know how to deal with
all the shortcuts and tricks

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.610
and so on, and experienced
and skilled.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:15.510
But I've had artists that I
knew tried courtroom drawing

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.170
for another station and
they couldn't handle it.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:24.350
One of them went out and threw
up because of the pressure.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.820
So it's really a very
difficult grind and you have

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.480
to be dependable, you know,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.360
television relies
on your deadline.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.110
And, boy, that's
a lot of pressure.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.350
But, you know, you deal with it.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.870
I think you have to have
the mentality for it.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.170
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: You
know, I don't know how it is

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:47.650
in California and the Midwest
in terms of how many men,

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.040
women in New York,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.710
it's practically all
women all the time.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:57.680
There was Joe Papin, years ago
and there were a few men early

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.230
on but they really--
it's women under this--

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.540
it always fascinated me why
women ended up being able

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.700
to stand that pressure
better than men.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.980
I mean, it's not that they're
better artists or better

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.460
under pressure is
all I can think and--

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.250
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Probably, yeah.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.550
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I believe--

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.380
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Is that true
on the coast and in the Midwest?

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.680
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.980
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: More
women than men doing this?

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.750
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes, well,
I was pretty much, I mean,

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.660
there were men-- couple of
the men, Gary Myrick, and--

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.150
but for-- but I was the
only woman that I know of,

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.730
there was a few others who
do it on a local level,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.270
but not on a national level.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.320
I was the only one who did
it on the national level.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.170
And I will add to that
that I agree with you.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:46.760
I think women on-- in general,
because we raise families

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.140
and we do 15,000 other
things while you're changing

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.680
that baby's diaper, right--

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.980
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: That's true.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.600
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: -- we
learn to hold so much

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.210
in terms of multitasking.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.320
I think that's an issue--
that's probably why--

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.660
In fact, I now am a therapist
to counsel in art therapy

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.190
with the Jemez tribe
in New Mexico.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.660
And I've learned a great deal
about women of all cultures.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:19.180
And that's true, multitasking
is women do that so very well.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.480
Maybe that's why.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.780
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Maybe.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.730
I'm sure it's a factor.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:28.730
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Matter of fact,
my other competitor, I guess,

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.620
other artists in Los Angeles,
there's basically two of us

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.480
and we handle the whole
thing, is a woman, so--

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:41.200
and I've known her for years
but, you know, it's a tough gig.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.500
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: It is.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.590
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: It is, yeah.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.250
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.200
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: And people
think it's very glamorous

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.820
and there is a lot
of glamour to it.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.440
I mean, you see celebrities,
you see important people,

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.290
and you're drawn to the--
something you read about all

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.570
of a sudden, there
you are-- there--

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:00.870
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.420
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Like these
gentlemen sitting here,

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.990
they're that close to you.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.030
It's fascinating.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.050
And that's one of the great
things I love about it.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.200
And you can express your drawing
the way you want to do it.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.100
Nobody is telling
you how to do it.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.400
You do it.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.180
They hire you because
you do it a certain way

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.320
and that's what they like.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.130
So, that's the plus side of it.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.680
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: But I have-- I had
to struggle to get to that place

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.430
where no one would tell
me how to do it, Bill.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.610
I mean, and I don't know why,

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.930
maybe it's because
I was a woman.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.980
I could tell you in the Midwest
when I first started out,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.070
I had producer after
producer and news director

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.600
after news director saying,
"Well, you need to put him

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.080
over here and I need
so and so in there."

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.120
But that didn't happen that way.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.920
Yeah. I don't know why.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.060
It took probably
the first 10 years

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.840
of my work before I was
honored enough, respect--

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.680
my work was respected enough
for no one to art-direct me.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.580
And I don't know if it was
the middle of the nation,

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.890
the culture, the community,
I don't know what that was.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.280
But it took a good 10 years

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.020
until I could do
whatever I needed to do.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.860
And they would shoot it
no matter what it was.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.880
Was that your experience?

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.030
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Well,
I would say it mostly is.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.970
But I'm mostly was able
to accommodate reporters

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.910
with what they wanted.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:23.870
But I-- No, there was
not a lot of direction

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.780
from producers or
reporters, some.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.090
That's one of the wonderful
things about this work is

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.940
that you are able to have
a lot of self-expression.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.240
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.540
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: You
have a lot of control

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.040
over how that drawing looks.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.890
And it's doing art in
a place that's live.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:48.150
It's happening in front of
you with all that drama.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:53.110
It's a very special
privilege to do this work.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:57.900
Difficult though, it is.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.200
Yeah.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.500
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: There's
one other thing.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.800
And I don't know-- I know

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.290
that you've had this experience
before, you too, Bill.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:09.550
The audience around you, there
are times you're there, right,

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.140
to do a job and you're doing
your best, but we do make noise,

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.210
we do work quickly, we have
our board, we have our paper,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.090
other things around us.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.940
And somebody right behind
me might be very interested

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.240
in my work.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.940
So he is leaning over, breathing
down my neck and the person next

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.310
to me is very interested
in looking.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.410
Then they start talking to you.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.710
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chruch: Yeah.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.010
Yeah.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.310
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Oh, how
did you get out of that?

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.610
I mean--

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.910
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Oh,
that's a very difficult thing

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.210
to deal with.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.970
Also, some of the-- sometimes
the family is sitting there

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.130
in the court and objects to
the way you're drawing the.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.430
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes, oh.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: It happened
to me at the Gotti trial

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:55.290
where his fellow gang members
are sitting right in the--

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.580
here is the artist
row and there is the--

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.500
and they coming over
to check the hairline

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.460
and the facial expression
and saying, "Hey,

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.690
John's got more hair than that."

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.990
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh [laughter].

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.290
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.000
Yeah. I get that a lot.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.940
And I heard it from
Bess Myerson and some

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.120
of the women defendants
too would come

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.470
and not appreciate the
way you were drawing them.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.420
So, sometimes it
can be intimidating.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.720
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yeah.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.010
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Even at
the John Gotti trial actually,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.770
he was in the well of the court
so he couldn't tell me directly

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:40.800
about how he was drawing, but
I saw him as I was drawing

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.540
in court and looking at
him through by binoculars,

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.000
I see him making a motion,
pointing to his neck,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.880
and he is waving like this at me

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.810
and I thought he
couldn't be talking to me.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:58.250
But I look behind me and the CBS
reporters got their head buried

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.370
down and she's not noticing.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:05.090
And he is saying, he's
motioning yes, you.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:09.200
And then he points to his
neck and makes a motion

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.930
like better not go there because
I was drawing his neck fat

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.350
[laughter] and so, I was speedy.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.640
And I knew that John
Gotti was very conscious

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.430
of how he was being
covered in the press.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.970
And he was reading all the
news report and he know

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.810
which artist was
covering from where.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.530
So, that happens too.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.910
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Was
he in custody?

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.210
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
He was in custody.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.230
He couldn't come after me.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:40.560
But all his gang
members could have.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.660
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Well, I did
have a similar situation

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.490
that wasn't-- it was in Dallas.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.750
I can't remember the
trial, it's been so long,

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:55.490
that was about skinheads, you
know, the skinhead community.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:59.480
And they had several
young men there on trial.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.780
And I drew them and
I also drew some

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.080
of their family sitting
behind them.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.380
One of them had a wife
and a couple kids.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.680
And I remember going to lunch
that day, and it's weird

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.980
that I really got a lunch.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.280
I had to work through
lunch often.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.580
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.880
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Put my work
down and went to lunch,

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.180
I had 15 minutes, I thought,
well, I'll grab a bite.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.480
As I got into the
elevator to go downstairs,

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.780
there were three skinhead
members in the elevator

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.080
and you could tell-- oh,
even now it chokes me up,

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.380
you can tell they were
very unhappy with me.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.680
And they stood behind me and
made threats, basically said,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.980
I wouldn't make it to my
car that night if I did--

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.280
if I put that drawing
on the air.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.580
As soon as the elevator opened,
I stepped back, they got off.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.880
I punch the button, went
back upstairs, and I talked

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.180
to the court officer, we
always have a police officer

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.480
in the court, and
he took me back

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.780
to the judge's chambers
immediately.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.080
I told the judge what happened.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.380
These people weren't
allowed to come back

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.680
to the courtroom,
they were arrested.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.980
And for the rest of the trial,
I was escorted out to my car.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.280
So, it can be very
scary at times.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.580
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Dangerous
country over there.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.880
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Well, it's Texas.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.180
They're serious in
Texas [laughter].

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.480
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: So,
objectivity is like an issue.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.780
How do you remain objective?

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.080
How do you try to
maintain that in your art?

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.380
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
That is a challenge.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.680
That's a challenge because
you get emotionally affected

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.980
by the testimony.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.280
There were a lot of times
like the terrorism trial,

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.580
the World Trade Center
bombing trial, the first one.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.880
That was very hard.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.040
That courtroom was filled
with supporters of, well,

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.970
people sympathetic to
some of their defendants.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.330
And it was so distressing,
listening to that testimony

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:01.550
and looking at these defendants
and trying to draw them.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:05.430
And I'm sure some
of the emotions,

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:14.150
some of the terror I
felt about it got in.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:23.910
And as a matter of fact, the
artists were sitting in the jury

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:32.460
in that trial, which is--
sometimes we get lucky.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:42.510
And we can actually see
the faces we're drawing.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:47.720
But I know my drawing was
in the New York Times,

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.760
on the front page
and other artists,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.240
all our drawings
were being shown.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.330
And at one point, the attorney
for one of the defendants came

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:09.840
over to the artists
and the jury and said,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.830
"My client objects the
way you were drawing him.

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.100
You're making him look
like a terrorist."

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.400
And--

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.700
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Sorry
about that [laughter].

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.400
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah that
was answered but, you know, I--

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.980
it was-- again, it's
frightening.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.690
And you do try to think,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.170
I remember also the
Central Park jogger trial,

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.570
those four black teens
that were accused

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.750
and later found to be innocent.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:42.250
It was really difficult
because their words,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.300
all their confessions
played for us on the TV

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.570
and they were very
surly in court.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.750
They were not schooled in
how to look in a courtroom.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.050
And that's what I drew.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.930
And I know the mothers would
come up to me in the hall

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:01.170
and plead with me, don't
draw my son like that,

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.040
you know, he's really innocent.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:10.270
And years later, when they
were acquitted, I felt very bad

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.500
about the way those
drawings did look.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.390
Yeah. But I really do try.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.960
I think we all try to
be objective about it.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.890
Someone's life is on the
line and you want to be fair.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.100
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Do you ever
have a defendant that kind

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.300
of tries to conceal himself?

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.600
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.900
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Covering the--

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.200
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yeah.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.500
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Martha
Stewart was very good at that.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.800
She kept pushing her hair down.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.100
The blond hair was--

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:42.310
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Sooner or
later, you get them though.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:43.610
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.700
That's the name of the game.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.940
You always get them
no matter what.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.320
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Well, that's why I
didn't eat lunch a lot of times.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.620
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:03.570
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Because I knew
at some point they'd have

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:08.450
to get up to go to lunch.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:18.980
And I just sat there until they
moved and then I could see them.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:24.150
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah, if
they stayed in the courtroom.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.250
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: If they stayed
in the courtroom, yeah.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:38.330
There's-- Well, there's things
you can do, as you well know,

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:50.700
to find out where they
are and, you know,

00:49:50.700 --> 00:50:00.290
if they're not in the courtroom.

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:04.820
I call the security officers
that are in every federal court,

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.430
I call them my donut buddies
for good reason [laughter].

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:11.820
They would always
let me know, yeah,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.230
what would be happening
with the defendant.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.810
And if I needed to see
his face in the hall for--

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.070
I just needed a split
second, something--

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.370
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:22.670
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: -- anything.

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:24.350
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.430
Yeah.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.960
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Are there any
questions from the audience?

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:47.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:54.050
&gt;&gt; -- others was in a courtroom
in the US-- oh, thank you.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.350
Did you hear?

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.650
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Yeah.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:59.120
So the question is, do any of us
know the first time somebody was

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.420
in the courtroom in the US?

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.510
Now are you talking about for
television or for newspapers or?

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:10.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.640
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Do we
know the first time what?

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.340
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Somebody worked
in the courtroom in the US.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Oh,
oh, oh, oh [inaudible].

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:26.330
What I can remember-- Oh,
I can't-- William Sharp.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:27.830
It's probably not the first

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:32.070
but I can remember being a very
young child seeing his courtroom

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.070
drawings in like magazines and--

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.370
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Whose?

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.000
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: William
Sharp, such a good artist.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.300
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Doesn't
ring a bell.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.600
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I
wish his work was here.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.900
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Courtroom art?

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.200
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
Courtroom art, William Sharp.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.020
But it probably goes back to--

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.920
well, the way I always
heard it was--

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.230
there were artist drawing
before the Lindbergh trial.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:55.460
And during the Lindbergh trial,
they got evicted because--

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.760
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Yeah.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: -- they
were making such a commotion.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.360
So who were those artists?

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.660
I should know.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.960
I would like to know that.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.260
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I would too.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.560
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Well, there
were artists during the

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.440
Nuremberg trial--

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.740
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.040
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: -- in
Germany after World War II,

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.280
they were fantastic
illustrators.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.510
And old Sickles was one of them.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.830
I didn't hear that.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:21.130
I'm sorry.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.430
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: He said

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:23.730
that Daumier was the
first courtroom artist.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.030
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh,
that was in France.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.330
Yeah.

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.630
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Yeah.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:29.570
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: But he
wasn't covering as a journalist.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.870
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: No, right.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.820
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I mean
he was doing his drawings

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.920
because he liked to be there.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.180
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: He
didn't have a deadline.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.480
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: I mean--
[laughter].

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.190
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I like
to be there as an artist.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:43.700
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: We happened
to have some sketches

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.940
from the Haymarket trial
from the 1880s by--

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.240
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, yeah?

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.540
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: -- a man named
Art Young who later went

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.660
on to become-- who's a
moderate Midwestern conservative

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.510
when he drew them and
he drew them guilty

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:58.170
and when he later became a
socialist, he felt baldly

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.380
about how he had drawn them.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.770
But we-- At the Library
of Congress,

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:04.630
we don't have a great
selection of kind

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.950
of pre-television era drawings

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.250
so we didn't include
them in the exhibition.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: But also,

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:11.210
artists like Winslow
Homer did draw--

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.510
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
-- for newspapers.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.110
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.410
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And I'm sure
if there was a courtroom trial,

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.710
they-- maybe not Winslow
Homer, but probably artists--

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.010
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: They had someone.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:20.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: -- at
the time went into court.

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:21.610
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Sure.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:22.910
Right, right, to draw, yeah.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.210
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Well,
they had artists

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:25.510
in the Civil War
that were doing--

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:26.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: That's right.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.110
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: --
sketches for newspapers.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.410
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Right.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:30.710
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: That's true.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.010
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Right.

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:33.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: But
that's not courtroom art--

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:34.610
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: No, right.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:35.910
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
-- particularly but--

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.210
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Well, in many
ways, you are the people

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.510
who inherited that
tradition of--

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yes.

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.110

&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.310
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: So it's
been going on but--

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.610
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And we
always wished it was the--

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:48.910
in more than just the courtroom.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:50.210
You know, as it used to
be, I mean artist were--

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:51.510
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Right.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: But this
is the last bastion, right?

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:54.110
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: I think we have
one more question up here.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.940
&gt;&gt; Well, I find the
discussion fascinating

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.950
and your work is
just remarkable.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.070
I was interested in one of the
questions that were posed to you

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.220
by the moderator, the
one about objectivity.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.120
First of all, what's the--

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:16.310
is there a duty of
objectivity for your work?

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.230
You said that you have
the freedom as an artist.

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:25.830
So where does this requirement
to be objective comes from?

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.770
And secondly, you noted

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.420
that sometimes you were drawing
characters in the courtroom

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:38.200
and afterwards you were
sorry for way you drew them.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:44.920
Was there any experience that
you had in which you disagreed

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:51.330
with a judgment made by a judge
that you covered the courtroom?

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.740
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
You mean the--

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.400
what the jury-- the verdict?

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:02.320
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Oh, yeah
lots of times [laughter].

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.350
Well, actually, not
so many times.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:13.250
Certainly the O.J.,
but I can't remember.

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:15.120
I don't know.

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.420
Do you want to--

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.750
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Nor can I.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.050
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I mean,

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.070
I think it's a very
difficult thing to come

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.250
up with a verdict sometimes.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.210
I've struggled myself,
what would I do,

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:30.170
you know, in this case.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.620
Well, how would I vote?

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.390
It's really hard.

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:39.240
And we also hear a lot
more that the jury does.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.540
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: We see
stuff that can't go into trial.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, absolutely.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.660
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And
we know background,

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.830
we know other charges that
the jury doesn't know.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:56.170
So, I can't think of a better
system that's everybody says,

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:59.510
right, than what we have but--

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:10.590
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.170
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: I
didn't quite hear it.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.790
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Do you have
an ethical requirement

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.090
to be objective?

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:19.410
Is there a requirement to
be objective in your work?

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.710
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: May I?

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.010
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Sure.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.920
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I don't understand
how you can ask an artist,

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.650
any artist to be objective.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:32.950
This is art even though we do
our best to be fair, right?

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.390
I don't know any other--

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.910
but I think objective is the
wrong term because I'm not sure

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.920
that I could be objective
drawing anyone of you right now.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.220
You know what I'm saying?

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.520
This is what I feel.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.820
What I see is what I see.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.120
You may see something different.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.590
She would do a completely
different drawing than I would

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:52.080
if we were drawing
the same person.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.380
I don't know.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.680
Does that make any sense?

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.980
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Absolutely.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.600
But I always have it in mind
too that you are a reporter too.

00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.900
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.200
Yes, that too.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.630
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And not
to be inaccurate about--

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:03.930
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Right.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.230
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
-- what's going on.

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.330
Not to make somebody angrier
than what was happening--

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:08.630
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: That's true.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:09.930
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: -- or--

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:11.230

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.830
more hysterical than
what was happening.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.380
Although news reporters tend
to want to push that angle--

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.680
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yes.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.980
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
-- so you are.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.670
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: But I
think that's different.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:20.970
Being--

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.270
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.570
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: --
accurate is different

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:24.870
than being objective, right?

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:26.170
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
No, I agree with you.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.340
You have to let the
emotions feel you.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.640
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Absolutely.

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.010
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: I think that
makes a good courtroom drawing,

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.850
actually, that you are
present and listening

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.970
and feeling what's
going on and that's--

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.420
those feelings do
get in the drawing.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.210
Yeah? I think so.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:46.510
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Microphone.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:49.370
&gt;&gt; Actually.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:51.770
This actually was kind
of on the same subject.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.780
It was really [inaudible]
already.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:58:01.330
But how do you especially in a
very viscerally disturbing trial

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.340
that goes on for weeks.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:09.690
How do you manage absorbing that
emotion day after day and trying

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.320
to still do the rest
of your life

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.520
and walk back in
and do it again?

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.020
I realize you're
all professionals,

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:23.320
but how do you mediate that?

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.930
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: That maybe why I
became a therapist [laughter].

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:30.230
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: It's true.

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:34.910
I've had nightmares about some
other trials listening too.

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:38.530
Sometimes it parallels
things in your own life.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:42.120
You know, your son may be the
same age is the defendant and,

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.680
you know, it can really-- you
do have to distance yourself.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.980
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Absolutely.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.280
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.580
Its--

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: We hear a lot
of gory stuff I'll tell you.

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.360
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yup.

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.970
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Terrible
stuff but you have

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.240
to put it behind you--

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.540
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.070
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: -- and
not let it affect you.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.950
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: It-- However,

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:09.000
I know you can't really
put some things behind you.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.300
It does affect you--

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.600
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.900
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: -- when you're
sitting in that courtroom.

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:17.150
In my case in the Oklahoma City
bombing case there were friends

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.640
of my family who had
died in the bombing

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.400
and their family was behind
me and that was difficult.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.130
But I had to maintain a very--

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.430
I had put up my walls

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:31.290
and maintain a very focused
stance and do my work.

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:32.590
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yup.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:34.110
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Then it
wasn't until after that case

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:38.130
that I did seek my own
therapy for a little while

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:40.180
to release, because you have to.

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.630
You can't hold on to this.

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.930
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.970
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: We have
one more question.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.050
&gt;&gt; You're all classically
trained artists.

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:08.580
So you're sketching with ink,
you're sketching with pencil,

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.880
you're sketching with whatever.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.250
How has technology
changed the way

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.730
that courtroom artists has done?

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:22.320
I realize that everybody that
has an iPad can take a photo

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.250
and there may be issues there.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.550
But in general,

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:31.540
how is technology changing
things one way or the other?

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.170
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Are you
talking about how it affects us?

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.430
&gt;&gt; Courtroom artists.

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:39.050
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh, we still do
what we do but I've noticed--

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.510
I mean, since I started,
everybody

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.120
and their brothers had
a laptop, you know.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.070
Every-- I was at
the Robert Durst,

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.520
the New York millionaire
that's accused

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.230
of killing his wife
in Los Angeles.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.200
They have a pretrial
thing going on.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.110
And everybody in the
audience, all the media,

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.030
they all had laptops and
all the lawyers had laptops

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.990
and they walk around
the court with laptops.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.830
And here we're still doing--

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:06.130
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.430
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: -- what we do.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.730
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Yeah.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.030
And which is wonderful.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.330
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Yeah.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.630
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Cameras for
the most part are not allowed

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:13.930
at least on the federal
level into courtrooms

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:16.750
which is the only
reason we have a job, so.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.930
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Well, a lot of
lawyers don't want the camera

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.470
in high-profile trials.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.770
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: Right.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.070
But there's some that do.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:24.370
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Some do.

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:25.670
OK.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.970
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: But so far,

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:28.590
the judges have ruled
against it.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.820
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: I think it's--
This is a true art form.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.080
It's none-- like nothing
that I learned in college

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.610
but this is a true art
form, to be able to do this

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:45.130
in a limited amount of time
and try to remain as true

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:48.790
and accurate as you can
to the scene or the story.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:52.430
So I don't want to see it die,

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:54.280
but I know that the
media is changing

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.580
because of the technology.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.970
They don't cover trials
like they used to.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.130
And I wish they'd go back to it.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.070
Anybody listening?

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.400
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: One way it's
changed though is artists take

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.560
their own photographs after the
trail, which didn't use to be.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.860
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Really, yeah.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.160
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yeah.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: They used
to have a crew out there.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.760
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: I
forgot about that.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.060
&gt;&gt; Pat Lopez: Yeah.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.360
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And it's
added another layer to our work.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.810
You know, its not only that
you have to do all the art,

01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:23.160
you also got to take the
photograph and get it back

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.570
to the station or the
newspaper on time.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: I did that
last Tuesday with the Durst.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.360
I had-- They didn't have a
camera crew or reporter there

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.800
so I had to shoot the drawing--

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.100
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church:
So you were it.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.400
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: --
and ship it back.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.700
You know, it's more work.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.920
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Church: And sometimes
they even ask you what happened.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.490
They do. They do sometimes.

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:46.990
If there was no reporter
there, and so--

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.970
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Oh, I think
we've run out of time.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.490
So I want to--

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:53.170
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: One
more question I think.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.470
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: No, I think
we've run out of time.

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.770
&gt;&gt; Bill Robles: Oh,
OK [laughter].

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:59.620
&gt;&gt; Sara Duke: Cut it off
from the back of the room.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.800
I want you to all join me

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.510
in thanking Bill
and Marilyn and Pat.
