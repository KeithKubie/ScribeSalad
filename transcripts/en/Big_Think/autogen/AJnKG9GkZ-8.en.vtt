constantly replicated with the result
that we can anticipate so there's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
that we can anticipate so there's
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249
that we can anticipate so there's
something about it that's a little

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
something about it that's a little
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
something about it that's a little

couched in metaphors and so I studied a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540
couched in metaphors and so I studied a
 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.010
couched in metaphors and so I studied a
variety of methods people always make

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
variety of methods people always make
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.570

fun of me in acting school because I was
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.710
fun of me in acting school because I was
always taking notes I was very

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720
always taking notes I was very
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320
always taking notes I was very
interested in what is this how is it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330
interested in what is this how is it
 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330

again that people can change before my

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
again that people can change before my
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.050
again that people can change before my
eyes and along the way of my studying

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060
eyes and along the way of my studying
 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.590
eyes and along the way of my studying
acting and also my teaching acting I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600
acting and also my teaching acting I
 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.740
acting and also my teaching acting I
began to see that my students sounded a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
began to see that my students sounded a
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.930
began to see that my students sounded a
lot alike and so I wanted to show them

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
lot alike and so I wanted to show them
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.210
lot alike and so I wanted to show them
that no human being talks like another

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
that no human being talks like another
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.610
that no human being talks like another
human being there are people who are

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
human being there are people who are
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.699
human being there are people who are
identical like you can have an identical

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
identical like you can have an identical
 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.460
identical like you can have an identical
twin of your voice like there are people

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
twin of your voice like there are people
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.520
twin of your voice like there are people
who sound exactly like a sibling in the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
who sound exactly like a sibling in the
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.670

tone of voice but nobody talks alike and
so I thought that one place to study

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
so I thought that one place to study
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.430
so I thought that one place to study
identity would be in the actual speech

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
identity would be in the actual speech
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640
identity would be in the actual speech
of a given person

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.979
originally I was going around

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989
originally I was going around
 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.410
originally I was going around
interviewing people because I wanted to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
interviewing people because I wanted to
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.240
interviewing people because I wanted to
teach something about that about

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
teach something about that about
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.119
teach something about that about
individuality as it is captured and in

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129
individuality as it is captured and in
 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.630
individuality as it is captured and in
the actual physical physiological

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640
the actual physical physiological
 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.149
the actual physical physiological
mechanism of making sounds we are

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159
mechanism of making sounds we are
 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.860
mechanism of making sounds we are
linguistic animals and then along the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870
linguistic animals and then along the
 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.649
linguistic animals and then along the
lines of doing that I developed this

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659
lines of doing that I developed this
 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.259
lines of doing that I developed this
method through which I make plays which

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
method through which I make plays which
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.830
method through which I make plays which
is that I interview people I take

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840
is that I interview people I take
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.929
is that I interview people I take
something that they said and then I

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939
something that they said and then I
 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.289
something that they said and then I
attempt to say exactly what they said

done something wrong so we have these

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.170
done something wrong so we have these
 

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.860
done something wrong so we have these
things these past experiences that begin

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:42.870
things these past experiences that begin
 

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:48.150

to almost predict for us how we're going

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160
to almost predict for us how we're going
 

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.630
to almost predict for us how we're going
to behave in any given situation and I

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:51.640
to behave in any given situation and I
 

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.449
to behave in any given situation and I
think it's very hard to recraft them and

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:57.459
think it's very hard to recraft them and
 

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:00.060
think it's very hard to recraft them and
I'm very interested in how people either

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.070
I'm very interested in how people either
 

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.759
I'm very interested in how people either
succeed and re crafting those things or

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:02.769
succeed and re crafting those things or
 

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:05.740
succeed and re crafting those things or
not

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.750
 

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.650
well actually in terms of listening to

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:08.660
well actually in terms of listening to
 

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.160
well actually in terms of listening to
stories of the listening part I think I

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.170
stories of the listening part I think I
 

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.900
stories of the listening part I think I
have less of a problem with that because

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:13.910
have less of a problem with that because
 

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.520
have less of a problem with that because
you know I've been doing it for a very

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:15.530
you know I've been doing it for a very
 

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.150
you know I've been doing it for a very
long time and you know as I say I sit

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160
long time and you know as I say I sit
 

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.829
long time and you know as I say I sit
down with somebody and they could tell

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839
down with somebody and they could tell
 

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:25.000
down with somebody and they could tell
me you know the ceiling is falling and

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.010
me you know the ceiling is falling and
 

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.270
me you know the ceiling is falling and
I'm mostly listening to how they said

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.280
I'm mostly listening to how they said
 

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.800
I'm mostly listening to how they said
the ceiling was falling and I'm missing

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:29.810
the ceiling was falling and I'm missing
 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.540
the ceiling was falling and I'm missing
the point that the ceiling is falling so

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.550
the point that the ceiling is falling so
 

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.480
the point that the ceiling is falling so
I've really conditioned myself to go in

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.490
I've really conditioned myself to go in
 

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.400
I've really conditioned myself to go in
and listen for what I'm listening for

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.410
and listen for what I'm listening for
 

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.580
and listen for what I'm listening for
and so in that way I have to say I

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:42.590
and so in that way I have to say I
 

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.730
and so in that way I have to say I
really people always ask me sort of you

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:45.740
really people always ask me sort of you
 

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.470
really people always ask me sort of you

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.080
know how do I not judge people in blood
that is becomes irrelevant for me

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.090
that is becomes irrelevant for me
 

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.120
that is becomes irrelevant for me
because I'm listening to such a specific

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.130
because I'm listening to such a specific
 

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.190
because I'm listening to such a specific
thing when I go in I think what's harder

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200
thing when I go in I think what's harder
 

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.120
thing when I go in I think what's harder
is how do I train myself out of my

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.130
is how do I train myself out of my
 

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:06.160
is how do I train myself out of my
habits in order to inhabit them and take

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.170
habits in order to inhabit them and take
 

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.560
habits in order to inhabit them and take
on on their habits and that's hard and

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:08.570
on on their habits and that's hard and
 

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.620
on on their habits and that's hard and
that comes from repetition it just has

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:11.630
that comes from repetition it just has
 

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.450
that comes from repetition it just has
to be you know my grandfather told me

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:13.460

know my acting technique in a sentence

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:21.620
know my acting technique in a sentence
 

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.200
know my acting technique in a sentence
is this belief that if I take someone's

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.210
is this belief that if I take someone's
 

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.360
is this belief that if I take someone's
words and repeat them over and over and

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:28.370
words and repeat them over and over and
 

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.420
words and repeat them over and over and
over and over and over again eventually

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:31.430
over and over and over again eventually
 

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.660
over and over and over again eventually
those words are going to hit my psyche

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:34.670
those words are going to hit my psyche
 

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.960
those words are going to hit my psyche
in a place that I understand who they

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:37.970
in a place that I understand who they
 

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.150
in a place that I understand who they
are really understand it which I

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160
are really understand it which I
 

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.740
are really understand it which I
wouldn't understand from reading it or

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:41.750
wouldn't understand from reading it or
 

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.840
wouldn't understand from reading it or
hearing it the first time so I would say

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:43.850
hearing it the first time so I would say
 

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.990
hearing it the first time so I would say
the work that's really calls for that

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000
the work that's really calls for that
 

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.380
the work that's really calls for that
has to do with reenacting more than

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.390
has to do with reenacting more than
 

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.580
has to do with reenacting more than
listening for the first time
