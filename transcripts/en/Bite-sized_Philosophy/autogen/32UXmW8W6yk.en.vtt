and then behind those two things behind

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
and then behind those two things behind
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.640
and then behind those two things behind
the shadow and the anima and the animus

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
the shadow and the anima and the animus
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.559
the shadow and the anima and the animus
there's a final archetype which is the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
there's a final archetype which is the
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.350
there's a final archetype which is the
archetype of the self and that's Jung

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
archetype of the self and that's Jung
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.419
archetype of the self and that's Jung
believed that the self was what you were

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
believed that the self was what you were
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.990
believed that the self was what you were
as a totality and that's a hard thing to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
as a totality and that's a hard thing to
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.330
as a totality and that's a hard thing to
understand but but you could think about

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
understand but but you could think about
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070
understand but but you could think about
it this way you could think about the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
it this way you could think about the
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.310
it this way you could think about the
self as the as the total of what you are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
self as the as the total of what you are
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.490
self as the as the total of what you are
now plus the total of all those things

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
now plus the total of all those things
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859
now plus the total of all those things
that you could still be so it would be

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
that you could still be so it would be
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.349
that you could still be so it would be
you as a reality plus you as potential

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
you as a reality plus you as potential
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.410
you as a reality plus you as potential
and that's a strange idea right because

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
and that's a strange idea right because
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.479
and that's a strange idea right because
we don't really know how to understand

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
we don't really know how to understand
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.610
we don't really know how to understand
the idea of potential as modern

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
the idea of potential as modern
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.270
the idea of potential as modern
empirical people because potential

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280
empirical people because potential
 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.069
empirical people because potential
virtually by definition is not yet

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
virtually by definition is not yet
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.729
virtually by definition is not yet
manifest and also not a straightforward

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
manifest and also not a straightforward
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220
manifest and also not a straightforward
thing to either measure or conceptualize

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
thing to either measure or conceptualize
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.090
thing to either measure or conceptualize
by the same token everybody acts as if

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
by the same token everybody acts as if
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.540
by the same token everybody acts as if
they're they have potential unrealized

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550
they're they have potential unrealized
 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.779
they're they have potential unrealized
potential

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
potential

potential
and so you generated up a category to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
and so you generated up a category to
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.090
and so you generated up a category to
account for that which he felt was

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
account for that which he felt was
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760
account for that which he felt was
expressed in all sorts of symbolic way

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
expressed in all sorts of symbolic way
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.780
expressed in all sorts of symbolic way
so for example the wise old man like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
so for example the wise old man like
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000
so for example the wise old man like
like the Wizards in in the movies that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
like the Wizards in in the movies that
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160
like the Wizards in in the movies that
all of you have seen in the last five

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
all of you have seen in the last five
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200
all of you have seen in the last five
years it's always the same Wizard

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
years it's always the same Wizard
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.929
years it's always the same Wizard
sometimes it's even the same actor it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
sometimes it's even the same actor it's
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490
sometimes it's even the same actor it's
like that's an archetype of the wise old

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
like that's an archetype of the wise old
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.539
like that's an archetype of the wise old
man and for young Christ was an

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
man and for young Christ was an
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090
man and for young Christ was an
archetype of the self as well and I told

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
archetype of the self as well and I told
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980
archetype of the self as well and I told
you why that was to some degree and it's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
you why that was to some degree and it's
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100
you why that was to some degree and it's
partly because the Phoenix is also an

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
partly because the Phoenix is also an
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.420
partly because the Phoenix is also an
archetype of the self because the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
archetype of the self because the
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.160
archetype of the self because the
Phoenix is something that can die and be

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
Phoenix is something that can die and be
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170
Phoenix is something that can die and be
reborn and so the Phoenix stands for the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
reborn and so the Phoenix stands for the
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300
reborn and so the Phoenix stands for the
part of your personality that can let

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
part of your personality that can let
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.060
part of your personality that can let
one thing go one part of you which is in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
one thing go one part of you which is in
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730
one thing go one part of you which is in
the live part can let that go and burn

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
the live part can let that go and burn
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010
the live part can let that go and burn
up so to speak so that something new can

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
up so to speak so that something new can
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.100
up so to speak so that something new can
be born because you very seldom gain

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
be born because you very seldom gain
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740
be born because you very seldom gain
something before you let something else

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
something before you let something else
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.499
something before you let something else
go because that's partly because what

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
go because that's partly because what
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.010
go because that's partly because what
you already assume can be the worst

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
you already assume can be the worst
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560
you already assume can be the worst
impediment that you have to work to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
impediment that you have to work to
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270
impediment that you have to work to
learning something new and it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
learning something new and it's
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130
learning something new and it's
complicated because sometimes what you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
complicated because sometimes what you
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.400
complicated because sometimes what you
know worked in the past you know so you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
know worked in the past you know so you
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.869
know worked in the past you know so you
can think about that maybe you're a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
can think about that maybe you're a
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.670
can think about that maybe you're a
perfectly well adapted 11 you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
perfectly well adapted 11 you
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.259
perfectly well adapted 11 you
and you're still acting that way when

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269
and you're still acting that way when
 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.649
and you're still acting that way when
you're 15 it's like well it's hard to

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
you're 15 it's like well it's hard to
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.300
you're 15 it's like well it's hard to
let that go because it worked and you

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
let that go because it worked and you
 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.550
let that go because it worked and you
put a lot of effort into it but unless

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
put a lot of effort into it but unless
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920
put a lot of effort into it but unless
you let it go the new personality isn't

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
you let it go the new personality isn't
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.259
you let it go the new personality isn't
going to be able to manifest itself so

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
going to be able to manifest itself so
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.630
going to be able to manifest itself so
you have to stop being a child before

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
you have to stop being a child before
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.220
you have to stop being a child before
you can be an adult and there's a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
you can be an adult and there's a
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.809
you can be an adult and there's a
sacrifice that goes along with that it's

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
sacrifice that goes along with that it's
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.460
sacrifice that goes along with that it's
also a sacrifice that parents have to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
also a sacrifice that parents have to
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.860
also a sacrifice that parents have to
make right because in order for a parent

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
make right because in order for a parent
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.640
make right because in order for a parent
to encourage you to adopt the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
to encourage you to adopt the
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.589
to encourage you to adopt the
responsibilities of an individual they

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
responsibilities of an individual they
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.789
responsibilities of an individual they
have to allow you as a child to die and

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799
have to allow you as a child to die and
 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.899
have to allow you as a child to die and
Freud's observation on that phenomena

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909
Freud's observation on that phenomena
 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.530
Freud's observation on that phenomena
was that many parents and he believed

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
was that many parents and he believed
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.390
was that many parents and he believed
this was particularly characteristic of

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
this was particularly characteristic of
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.860
this was particularly characteristic of
mothers because of their tight bond with

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
mothers because of their tight bond with
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.809
mothers because of their tight bond with
their children and the dependency that

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819
their children and the dependency that
 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.479
their children and the dependency that
that implies that it was particularly

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
that implies that it was particularly
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.610
that implies that it was particularly
difficult for a mother to let her child

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620
difficult for a mother to let her child
 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.860
difficult for a mother to let her child
die so that an adult could manifest

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
die so that an adult could manifest
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.660
die so that an adult could manifest
itself in that child's place and that's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670
itself in that child's place and that's
 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.050
itself in that child's place and that's
fundamentally in many ways the oedipal

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
fundamentally in many ways the oedipal
 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330
fundamentally in many ways the oedipal
complex okay so now I'm gonna show you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
complex okay so now I'm gonna show you
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280
complex okay so now I'm gonna show you
some of these things again because the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
some of these things again because the
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.520
some of these things again because the
thing about young is that it's not easy

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
thing about young is that it's not easy
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.670
thing about young is that it's not easy
to understand what he has to say and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680
to understand what he has to say and
 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.500
to understand what he has to say and
it's not a simple thing to explain it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
it's not a simple thing to explain it
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.890
it's not a simple thing to explain it
and his books are complicated although I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900
and his books are complicated although I
 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.509
and his books are complicated although I
don't think they're any more complicated

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519
don't think they're any more complicated
 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.610
don't think they're any more complicated
than they have to be like I don't think

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620
than they have to be like I don't think
 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.069
than they have to be like I don't think
young is obscure I think he's just

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079
young is obscure I think he's just
 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.680
young is obscure I think he's just
difficult and then beyond difficult he's

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
difficult and then beyond difficult he's
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.990
difficult and then beyond difficult he's
actually frightening so there's lots of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
actually frightening so there's lots of
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.739
actually frightening so there's lots of
reasons that people don't like you
