BILL BILODEAU: I
just wanted to spend

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.600
a couple minutes talking about
partner developer relations.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.730
We are your developer
advocates, so we

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.610
work with partners, hence
the term partner developer

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.510
relations.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.050
So partners meaning game
developers like you.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.647
And we're all engineers.

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:30.230
We're on the technical
side of things.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.890
We're not on the
business side of things.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.840
And all of us--
pretty much all of us

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.240
have worked with game
companies before in the past,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.840
so we have some understanding
of the difficulties

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.030
that you have to go through.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.290
We're located around the
world in various locations

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.810
in North America,
India, and APAC.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.060
And as I mentioned, we
work closely with partners.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.060
Sometimes we make
visits to partners

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.580
and actually work on-site
to help with performance

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.590
or help debug problems.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.530
We also have meetings
and emails with partners.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.510
Also, you should consider us
your first point of contact

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.350
for technical questions.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.380
Another thing we do
is to tell developers

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.730
at events such as this
about new technology related

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.200
to games from Google.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.920
And one of the most
important things that we do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.640
is gather feedback
from developers on how

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.390
we can improve our products.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.250
So I encourage
you to all give us

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.320
honest feedback on how
you think we can improve,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.180
and feel free to do it today,
especially, is a good time.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.417
Go ahead and ask questions
or make suggestions

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:52.500
during the meetings today.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.650
One of the things we've
been doing recently

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.560
is focusing on high
fidelity games.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.620
And this is because we're
seeing this trend because

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.100
of the improvement
in mobile hardware

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.009
that's capable of running
games that traditionally

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.180
are on consoles or PCs.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.750
And the thing is, this
really stresses the system,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.100
requires a lot of the system.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.260
And so things like Vulkan
are important for rendering

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.056
to get the most performance.

00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:26.680
So one of the things
I did was I looked

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
and saw how many devices
actually support Vulkan.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.590
And you can do this
by going into the Play

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.490
Store in the device catalog.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.755
And you can see there's
about 400 devices--

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:41.290
there's probably more now--

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.680
and those are device
models that support Vulkan.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.680
And this turns out to
be about 427 million,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.140
getting close to half
a billion devices now,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.540
that support Vulkan.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.690
Now, this doesn't mean
all of those devices

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.010
are capable of
running your game.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.730
There could be problems where
the hardware isn't fast enough,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.180
or there could be problems
with the driver quality.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.520
So this is something that
you would need to test.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.190
As I mentioned, these
high fidelity games

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.890
are really pushing the
limits, and so our job

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.290
is, we want to improve
that ecosystem,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.250
make things better
for developers

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.630
of these types of games.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.240
So today, for example,
in these sessions,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.720
we're going to be talking about
Vulkan, Samsung, and Crytek.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.250
We're going to be talking
about their experience

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.180
of working with Vulkan
and trying to optimize.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.440
And then, because these games
are more complex than, like,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.650
a casual game, they
require good tools

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.780
for debugging and profiling.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.860
And so we have sessions
on Android Studio,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.170
and GAPID, and Systrace.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.710
These are tools for
debugging and profiling.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.530
We recognize that these
are important to have,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.365
and we're going to continue
to improve these tools.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.960
Also, because of the wide
variety of devices out there,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.880
and capability of devices,
and driver quality,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.560
testing is very important
for these types of games.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.850
So we have a session
on automated testing

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.330
by Netease, which
should help improve

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.610
the time required for testing.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.490
And also, Plarium
is going to talk

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.910
about using device catalog
in the Play Console

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.880
for helping them to select which
devices to run their games on.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.090
Last thing I want
to mention is we

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.410
are going to have office hours
this week during I/O, Wednesday

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.810
and Thursday.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.320
I have a QR code here.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.480
You can grab that.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.500
This will link to a site where
you can schedule office hours

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.560
with us, one-hour slots.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.780
Also, you can check your email.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.880
I think I sent out something
about office hours.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.000
And on the event website,
there's a link to it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.010
Or you can just
talk to me and I'll

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.390
schedule something for you.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.970
It'll be held at a building
on Crittenden Lane, which

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.960
is right across the street
from Shoreline Amphitheatre, so

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.136
not too far from I/O.
