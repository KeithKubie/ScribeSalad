TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.633
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.240
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.930
Now that Nougat has
begun to roll out,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.590
it's a good time to review
the many security enhancements

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.370
included.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.239
Check out the post for info on
direct boot encryption, media

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.400
stack and platform hardening,
apps security improvements,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.760
and more.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.830
We're now taking applications
for the third class

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.350
at the Launchpad Accelerator.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.780
If you're a late stage
apps startup from Brazil,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.180
India, Indonesia, or
Mexico, check out this post.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.770
Applications are
open until October 24

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.540
for the equity-free program
that begins in January

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.970
and includes two
weeks of all expense

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.880
paid training at the new Google
Developers Launchpad space

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.770
in San Francisco.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.120
If you're about to launch
a new holiday campaign,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.350
you could, for example,
use TrueView ads

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.520
on YouTube along with banner ads
on the Google Display Network

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.460
to drive brand awareness
and more holiday sales.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.434
To make it easier for
you to track and forecast

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:56.850
the performance
of these campaigns

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.860
against your
advertising goals, we're

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.070
introducing campaign groups
and performance targets.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.500
More info and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.760
Beginning with Chrome
56 in January of 2017,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.380
we'll mark HTTP sites that
transmit password or credit

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.080
cards as nonsecure as
part of a long-term plan

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.740
to mark all HTTP
sites as nonsecure.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.000
HTTPS is easier and
cheaper than ever before.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.310

details on our upcoming change

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.200

Cloud Tools for
PowerShell is a collection

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.650
of commandlets for accessing
and manipulating GCP resources.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980
It's currently in beta
and already allows access

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.130

Cloud Storage, Google Cloud

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.410
