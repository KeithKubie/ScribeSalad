NICK FARMER: So I'd like
to welcome everybody here

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.430
to another Talk at Google.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.416
With us today, we have
Naren Shankar, Mark Fergus,

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:16.294
two of the show runners
for Syfy's "The Expanse."

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:17.252
NAREN SHANKAR: Hello.

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:18.210
MARK FERGUS: Thank you.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.700
NICK FARMER: So I'd just
like to jump in and ask you

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.960
guys, what do you think
makes "The Expanse"

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.680
different from other
science fiction shows?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.330
NAREN SHANKAR: Hmm,
well, the low quality

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.924
of the writing on which
is was based, obviously.

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:43.640
No, I think everybody had the
same reaction to the material

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.450
when we read it.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.020
It's a different look at space.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.880
It is about the small people.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.370
It's not about the
admirals, and the people

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.250
who are in charge of starships.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.460
It is a more intimate, it's
a more boots on the ground

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.760
version of it.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.266
You should--

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.807
MARK FERGUS: Yeah,
I think, again, we

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:07.120
had all responded to the
same things in the novels,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.260
but we felt like Syfy
the genre had always

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.440
skipped over the first couple
of years of colonization.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.470
What we consider the real
interesting story is how did we

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.900
claw our way off the planet?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.390
How do did get out to the
Moon, Mars, the solar system,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.620
bringing all our
daemons with us,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.680
all our cultural
baggage, everything,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.460
and show how we forge the way
to "Star Trek" and "Galactica"

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.950
and all these other
classic shows,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.080
where technology was sorted out,
and aliens had been contacted,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.180
and we were dealing with them.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.410
The first couple of centuries,
we kept thinking of it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.920
as the railroads coming
to America's story, where

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.770
the landscape changed
because of technology,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.700
and let's just
bring that to space.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.510
That was the
fascinating story to us,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.819
and nobody had told it
particularly well until we read

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.360
"The Expanse" books, and we were
like, this is the show we've

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.704
always wanted to see.

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:04.210
Let's go make that
show, as opposed

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.900
to thousands of other properties
that were really cool too,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.880
but this is a story that
we've been dying to see.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.160
NAREN SHANKAR: It was
also unique in that space

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.780
was a character in the show.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.360
All of the things that
people ignore usually,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
things like gravity,
and oxygen, and air,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.820
and the things that make
space such an inhospitable

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.390
environment for
human life, those

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.330
are whisked away in most
shows, with transporter beams

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860
and artificial gravity
plating, and the fact that you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.440
can have instantaneous
communication anywhere

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.470
across the galaxy.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.740
This show was different.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.080
It allowed us to have space
become a real character

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.660
dramatically in the series,
and we tried to exploit that.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500
MARK FERGUS: And just
following up on that,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.210
space battle becomes
hard and difficult,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.610
the way old ship battle used
to be, submarine battle.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.300
It was slow.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.270
It was anticipatory.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.650
It was like playing chess rather
than vast and instantaneous

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.210
distances, are vast
like crossing an ocean.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.360
Communication takes--
you call someone on Mars,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.170
and it takes a half
hour to get a response.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.535
And so we're back to pre-cell
phone kind of communication,

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.120
not where battles--
and things have

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.360
to happen where by the
time you say something

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.040
to the field of a battle,
by the time it reaches you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.030
and you get a message
back, the battle's over.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.113
So you have to think in
an entirely different way.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.370
And yes, space is a character.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.850
It's vast.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.410
It's huge.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.326
The speed of light is
only the speed of light.

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:43.025
Only, there's limitations that
we put back on storytelling

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:44.650
that most sci-fi
says, oh, don't worry.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.480
Technology solved all that.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.744
The engine is dead.

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:48.910
Everyone's still in gravity?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.360
Don't ask why?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.659
It's just part of the deal.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.450
And we're like, no.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.014
If you stop moving, and
your thrust is gone,

00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:56.430
you're going to
start floating up.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.340
And that becomes a
really cool thing

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.380
that we weave into the
story that we get to use,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.826
instead of just
brushing over it.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.700
And the books are full
of that kind of thing.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.930
I think that's what
we responded to.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.100
That's a space story
we haven't seen before.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.170
NICK FARMER: And so what's it
from a creative perspective

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.209
that you're writing
these things?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.300
What are the challenges
that you've come up with?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.180
NAREN SHANKAR: So many.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.550
It's a very ambitious show.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.400
I mean, first of all, all
these things like zero gravity,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.350
they're traditionally
not often done,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.030
and the books are full of them.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.140
It's got a very big scope.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.340
It's got a lot of
different characters.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.190
The show was originally sold
really as "Game of Thrones"

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.307
in space, and it has
that quality to it.

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:51.640
And that's certainly something
that we've tried to play,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.310
but it means you've got to
build a lot of big sets.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.000
You've got to create
these environments.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.333
You've got to build space ships.

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:00.650
You've got a tremendous
amount of visual effects work.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.846
It is as complex a show as
I've ever been involved in.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:08.220
MARK FERGUS: And then we had
talked about it earlier too.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.790
There's things that
are on the page,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.100
like Belters are tall and
light because reduced gravity

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.580
changes the cartilage,
changes the bone structure,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.220
changes the physicality,
which we love,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.970
because it's
essentially technology

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.550
leads to us going
out into space.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.180
And as a result of that,
a new race of humans

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.234
is created by environment.

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:31.650
They're still human, and yet
they're completely different.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.520
They can never go
back to full G planets

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.184
and live, because their
bodies have grown up.

00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:37.600
Production-wise,
how are you going

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.880
to get hundreds,
thousands of seven

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.012
foot tall, very skinny
great actors as well?

00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:44.970
NAREN SHANKAR: The answer,
of course, is money.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.185
MARK FERGUS: Right.

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:50.630
So in the absence
of that, we decided

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.020
to create the full spectrum of--
this was an adaptation problem.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.290
On the page it's easy
to say everybody looks

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.205
like this on the screen.

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:02.580
Unless we're an
animated film, we

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.170
have to do this in a smart way.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.090
So it ended up becoming a
great opportunity to say,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.800
yes, there are extreme
belters with the full range

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.590
of physicality.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.740
In essence, the poorer you
were, the more difficult

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.970
your economic upbringing,
you're on zero G ships,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.200
you're way out in the system.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.040
The more difficult your
economic situation is,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.850
the more Belter you
would be, because you'd

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.410
be in harder conditions.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.934
And we did the full spectrum,
so you could have race traitors.

00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:31.600
You could have people
hiding, pretending

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.725
they're an Earther, when
they're actually a Belter.

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.452
You can have extreme Belters,
who are looked down on.

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:39.165
You have Earthers
slumming it, wanting

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.290
to pretend they're Belters.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.990
You have a whole
range of stuff now.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.620
We can put that in
the story as opposed

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.192
to that monolithic kind
of-- Ty had always called it

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:49.560
the thing of a lot of sci-fi.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.077
A race of people looks the same.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:51.910
They speak the same.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.155
They have the same
attitude about everything.

00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:59.505
They're a race, and that
wouldn't-- I feel that for this

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:01.630
show, that would have gotten
boring really quickly.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.255
So I'm glad that we
had the constraint,

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:08.330
because it came to, I think,
a cooler solution, definitely.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.230
NICK FARMER: So for
those who may not know,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.760
Ty Franck and Daniel
Abraham, the authors

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.040
who combine to make the
pen name James SA Corey,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.594
have an unprecedented
level of participation

00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:22.760
in the creation of the show.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.570
And what's that like for you,
to work with the authors,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.090
to have them with
you at all times?

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.380
NAREN SHANKAR: When I was
brought onto the show,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.460
and Mark and his writing
partner Hawk Ostby,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.700
they wrote the pilot, and
I was brought in later,

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.710
after it was sold to Syfy.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:48.290
And I was told, you start
the show, and here we go.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.540
I'm going to go do the series.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.680
And by the way, the two
writers who wrote the book

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.890
are going to be in the room.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.130
And I was, are you sure
that's a really good idea?

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.874
Because usually authors can
be very precious with what

00:07:59.874 --> 00:08:00.540
they've written.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.080
They don't want to
change anything.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.180
But very quickly we
found that Ty and Daniel

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.350
were incredibly open to
truly adapting the material

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.280
to a different medium.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.370
It's like things that they
do in the book would not

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.060
have lent themselves
to the story the way

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.360
we're portraying it
dramatically on television.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.900
The first book is
two characters.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.360
It's told from two perspectives.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.980
The chapters alternate
between them.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.250
We had to bring in other
elements to the show,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.530
and so they were
incredibly open to it,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.214
and we actually started
pulling in material

00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:39.130
that they had written.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.450
They had written novellas
to support the material,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.240
and we started bringing those
in, characters from books

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.320
further along in the series.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.180
And what it enabled us to do
was truly adapt the material.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.590
It's a slightly
different thing, but it's

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.290
remained incredibly true
to the source material

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.720
all along the way.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.350
And with Ty and Daniel there,
we don't break anything.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.470
There have been times when we'll
go, oh, what if we do this,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.900
and they're like, well, you're
going to totally ruin book 5.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.825
And we're like, OK, we
won't do that, then.

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:13.783
And so we figure out a
different way around it.

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:18.720
And also at times, we'll
be looking for, well, gee,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.560
can we do something in this
episode that illuminates

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.660
a part of Belter culture?

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.160
It's like, if only
we had something,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.780
and Ty will say, well, what if
you did this thing that I've

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.150
got three books down the line?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.410
We're like, that's perfect.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.160
Let's put that in.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.980
And so they allow us
to stay on target.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.790
They exploit the scope of the
world that they've created,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.876
and we're just the
beneficiaries of that.

00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:44.650
MARK FERGUS: Yeah.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.690
NICK FARMER: Just a
light hearted question.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.150
If you were to pick a
faction for yourselves,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.460
would you be Earthers,
Martians, or Belters?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.280
MARK FERGUS: I think the Belters
are really what the books are

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.430
about, ultimately.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.710
I feel like definitely,
because that's

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.710
where all the drama is
going on, and that's

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.382
where all of the
passion in the story is.

00:10:11.382 --> 00:10:14.970
They're these scattered
tribes of people flung out

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.340
of into the solar system,
trying to figure out

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.710
some identity for themselves,
to collect together,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.260
to stay as tribes, to survive
out there in a new environment.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.220
You've got the
empires, fighting over

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.450
who's going to be the top dog,
and of course, the Belters

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.360
are at the shit end
of that, usually.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.450
The people who built the
apparatus for the empires

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.720
to exist out in the
solar system then become

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.820
exiles out in space,
and they're forgotten.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.570
And that's where all the
really cool grist is,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.670
I think, in this story.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.485
And I think they're
also the coolest

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:51.360
and the most interesting
people in the story.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.300
The Earth is the old the
new empire, old, empire

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.540
thing, which I think
human behavior seems

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.110
to always go that way, anyway.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.980
So one of the things we
loved about the stories too,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.360
it's just the endless
cycle of rising and falling

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.690
and building, and
oppressed class, empire,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.410
leading to crusty old empire
that falls into the sea.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.750
The other one becomes
the crusty old--

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.040
it's just the way we're wired,
and the story in a larger

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.402
sense, what happens?

00:11:21.402 --> 00:11:22.860
Is there any way
out of that cycle?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.610
Is there any technological
or spiritual way

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.040
out of that endless cycle?

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.060
So to make a short answer to
the question, it's Belters.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.280
I think I wandered from
the-- which I will do.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.649
Just got to go, get
back, get back, get back.

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:40.440
NAREN SHANKAR: As a
humorless technologist,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.810
I'd probably be a Martian.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.320
I've definitely
noticed from the fans

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.360
that even though the
Martians haven't appeared

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.010
so much in season
one, a lot of people

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.420
really like the idea of
having the sleek ships

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.670
and the big guns.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.660
MARK FERGUS: They
got the cool stuff.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.618
NAREN SHANKAR: They do.

00:11:57.618 --> 00:11:58.770
They have the cool stuff.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.020
MARK FERGUS: Belters rocks.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.810
NICK FARMER: Yeah,
well, that works too

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.060
under the right circumstances.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.143
MARK FERGUS: That's right.

00:12:04.143 --> 00:12:05.610
And cargo containers
with engines.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.960
NAREN SHANKAR: Exactly.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.410
Spoiler alert.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.520
NICK FARMER: I'm a little
partial to the Belters myself.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.270
MARK FERGUS: Understandably.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.540
You made the language.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.790
NICK FARMER: Yeah, I mean, it's
because I'm over six feet tall.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.904
MARK FERGUS: You made
the language too.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.240
That's true.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.500
NICK FARMER: So you have a PhD
in physics and engineering.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.250
Can you tell us a
little about your story,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.660
going from that to Hollywood?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.700
NAREN SHANKAR: I had
an odd trajectory.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.870
I started as a humanities
student in medieval studies.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.230
NICK FARMER: Gasp in Google.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.990
NAREN SHANKAR: Yeah, I know.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.880
Medieval studies,
French literature, but I

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.056
had always loved
science and mathematics.

00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:49.430
And I think in my
sophomore year,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.130
I realized that the
chance of actually getting

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.010
a job with the degrees
that I was looking at

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.080
were probably quite slim.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.480
So I transferred
into engineering.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.110
And it's also cultural.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.771
First generation Indian is like
doctor, lawyer, businessman,

00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:04.270
engineer.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.270
That's what you've got to do.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.070
And so I transferred into
engineering, and I stayed.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.990
And I stayed all the
way through to my PhD.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.430
But as I was finishing
my dissertation,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.130
I started-- I mean, the things
that I loved were history,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.980
and so I started taking
more and more courses

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.860
in the liberal arts college.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.930
And I think it just
got to the point

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.580
where I had that moment
where I was coming out.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.910
I was taking a
course in the history

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.190
of American foreign
policy taught

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.230
by this amazing
professor at Cornell.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.940
And I came out of this terrific
lecture about Aaron Burr,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.640
and I was walking
back to my lab.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.727
And I could see it down
at the end of the street,

00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:44.810
and I was like, oh my god.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.210
I can't do this anymore.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.070
And it was not I didn't
love engineering.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.685
I did it.

00:13:49.685 --> 00:13:54.570
It was I felt myself becoming
more and more of a specialist

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.900
in a smaller and smaller
corner of the universe,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.430
and that just wasn't
my personality.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.730
And I finished the dissertation,
and I told my parents

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.370
that I was going to go to
Los Angeles and be a writer.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.680
And to their credit, my
parents were adorable.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.260
They were very supportive.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.130
And I started
college really young,

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.160
and so they figured I had
a couple years to burn.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.180
And I drove, and I'd come to
my senses and get a real job.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.069
But as I was driving
away 10 years later,

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:25.360
my mother told me, as soon
as my car went out of sight,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.820
she burst into tears.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.080
But it worked out OK.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.905
It worked out OK.

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:32.010
That's the long story.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.010
NICK FARMER: I've
heard a story that tied

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.690
into why you were graduating
from college young,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.877
a you were little bit ahead,
and you had a briefcase.

00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:46.010
NAREN SHANKAR: God damn it, Ty.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.540
Yes.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.160
Yes, I own this story.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.100
When I was in like sixth
grade, my parents, who

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.750
were immigrants,
they thought it would

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.600
be awesome to give their son
a briefcase to take to school.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.670
And like a good son,
I took it to school

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.290
for like the next four years.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.522
And let me tell you, that was
a chick magnet, a briefcase.

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:08.605
No, I had a good friend,
who actually every day we

00:15:08.605 --> 00:15:10.510
would come back from school,
he would kick the shit out

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.360
of the briefcase.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.352
And in my sophomore year of
high school, it exploded.

00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:16.060
Almost everything went
all over the snow,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.997
and I was just done
with the briefcase.

00:15:17.997 --> 00:15:19.330
NICK FARMER: No more briefcases?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.746
NAREN SHANKAR: No
more briefcases.

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.716
MARK FERGUS: That's [INAUDIBLE]
I'm just picturing it.

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:26.924
NAREN SHANKAR: It was so sad.

00:15:29.352 --> 00:15:30.810
NICK FARMER: Well,
I mean, I wonder

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.476
if any of those people
who tormented you

00:15:32.476 --> 00:15:34.405
are watching your shows.

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:36.830
I mean, you probably
have some fans who

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.560
don't even make the connection.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.060
NAREN SHANKAR: Yeah,
screw those guys.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.880
I hope they are.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.550
NICK FARMER: So I'd like
to give everybody time

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.060
to think about their questions.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.140
We're setting up
a mic over here.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.000
And make sure that
when you line up

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.230
that you are lined
up behind each other.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.730
I'm a linguist,
and I can't talk.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.837
NAREN SHANKAR: I
was going to say.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:03.670
NICK FARMER: I know.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.110
Well, this is why you guys
had to hire a voice coach,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.940
and you couldn't just have
me work with the actors.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.814
I mean, I would go in
there, and I would just

00:16:09.814 --> 00:16:11.544
mess up my own language.

00:16:11.544 --> 00:16:12.710
NAREN SHANKAR: That was fun.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.543
Mark did a lot of that
with the voice acting

00:16:14.543 --> 00:16:16.880
and the coaching of the Belters.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.350
MARK FERGUS: Yeah, well, I
worked for an entire year

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.150
on a show, where Nick
created an entire language

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.000
for the Belters.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.332
And we probably would have
worked countless hours.

00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:31.021
I literally met him for the
first time two days ago,

00:16:31.021 --> 00:16:32.520
and spoke to him
for the first time,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.500
even though we did
a show together.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.265
But yeah, it would be
lines going to Nick.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.890
He would create the language,
then it would come back.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.910
We would bring them to our
dialect coach, essentially.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.660
He would teach people how
to act and say and inflect

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.920
in a completely created language
with a very specific accent.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.750
And some actors dove into that.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.570
Other actors were terrified
to not only learn your lines

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.320
and feel it, and swim in
it, and get all the subtext,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.290
but also learn a new
language and a new accent

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.430
now, and be ready tomorrow.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.150
It was a little frightening.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.316
NAREN SHANKAR: It was a
great thing in the show too.

00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:12.910
Because one of the
things in the book

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.220
was that humanity had
gone out into the Belt.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.099
It wasn't just white Americans
going out into space.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.930
It was the Russians, the
Chinese, the Indians.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.720
And so the Belt was
this polyglot mix

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.170
of different cultures
and language styles

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.610
and little pieces of them.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.080
And the Martians had different
strains in their language

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.900
as well.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.260
And it's just been a
really interesting thing,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.230
because when you start
feeling those little threads,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.730
you start feeling
those little bits

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.324
and pieces of human culture
in this different place,

00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:46.740
it was just a unique thing in
the show that I really like.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.820
I really loved that.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.861
MARK FERGUS: It was cool.

00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:50.850
I don't know who-- was
it Ty's or your analogy

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.920
of the Mediterranean
fishing village.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.330
Space is just considered
all these different factions

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.500
coming to work in space, and
coming, going, transporting.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.580
And what happens to
language and culture

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.425
over hundreds of years in that
kind of transitory environment?

00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:10.060
And that's where the
language came from.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.380
And it was great,
because we could

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.946
do anything we wanted
with it, but we

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:15.570
wanted to stick to
structure and rules,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.550
so it didn't feel like bull.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.655
It felt like a real language
with a history and a structure.

00:18:20.655 --> 00:18:22.180
NAREN SHANKAR:
Even the gestures.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.490
MARK FERGUS: Yeah.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.730
NAREN SHANKAR: It's described
as a gestural language,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.690
and Ty and Daniel are saying
that it was derived from people

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.520
in space suits who spoke
different languages not being

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.170
able to talk to one another.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.750
So they adopted some very broad
signaling, gestural signaling,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.170
with their hands so they could
look at each other in space

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.190
and understand it.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.630
And over time, that
concept had boiled

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.430
down into a very expressive
hand gestures along with Belter.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.090
And so that was
part of it as well,

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.200
and it's lovely when you
can pull details like that

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.290
into a show, because it
just grounds the world.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.890
It makes it all feel very real.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.204
MARK FERGUS: So
thank you for that.

00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:05.120
AUDIENCE: So you touched
on this a little bit,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.980
talking about the
Belters height and stuff

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.130
and having to change a
little bit from the books.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.470
But I had a question about
doing practical effects

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.490
for the low gravity
areas, like Ceres.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.180
Because you have the drones
flying around in the shots.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.290
And I haven't finished
the show, so maybe there's

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.132
something like this in a later
episode, but showing somebody.

00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:25.840
Picking up something
impractically heavy,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.040
or having an
occasional object not

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.800
fall as fast as
you would expect,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.290
or anything like
that, because it's

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.706
a little offputting
for them to be

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:36.430
talking about how it's
gravity, and then everything's

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.240
like heavy.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.170
MARK FERGUS: Yeah,
we had to choose.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.800
I think we had to create-- We
had talked about this earlier,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.190
as well.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.890
Ceres is a third G
environment, and it

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.780
would affect lots of
areas of behavior,

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.660
how Earthers would walk and
be too ahead of themselves.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.840
They'd be jumping all the
time, objects falling.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.570
I think what we tried
to do is tell the story,

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.840
make sure that people understood
this is not normal gravity.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.210
But then don't let it get
in the way of every scene.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.240
Otherwise, you just
can't tell the story.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.406
And so we put things like
a bird flapping its wings.

00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:10.222
AUDIENCE: The budget, I realize
you can't put everybody on a--

00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:10.478
NAREN SHANKAR: I'm sorry.

00:20:10.478 --> 00:20:10.676
What was that?

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.440
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, I realize

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.398
you don't have the budget
to film every episode

00:20:13.398 --> 00:20:15.110
on the vomit comet.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.026
MARK FERGUS: No, even
so, it would be--

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:19.650
NAREN SHANKAR: When
we talked about it,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.670
it was ultimately those things
would get normalized out

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.740
very quickly, and Ceres would
be like, even though everything

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.210
was maybe not as heavy
as a similar object would

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.760
be on Earth, relative
to Ceres, everything

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.950
would be accounted for.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:38.170
So the number of times that you
can actually show differences

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.600
were actually fairly small,
because it's how do you

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.200
show weight on television?

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.510
It's very tough.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.470
So what we did is we
picked a couple of things.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.530
Coriolis is one of them,
in that in different parts

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.660
of the station, if you pour
a fluid, the deflection

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.140
of the fluid relative to
where you were in the station

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.090
and the spin gravity
causes it to deflect.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.850
So you see that when Miller is
pouring from his scotch bottle.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:04.020
Instead of going like this, it
goes like that into the glass.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.470
When you see a bird, the sparrow
that he flips a little peanut

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.260
to or whatever on his
balcony, that bird

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:19.104
was meticulously animated so
that the beating of the wings

00:21:19.104 --> 00:21:21.270
is a little bit different
than it would be on Earth.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.010
So the smaller
moments where you can

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.360
establish a different gravity
situation were more effective.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.364
We tried, and one thing
we completely failed

00:21:31.364 --> 00:21:32.780
at doing-- there
are two things we

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.150
failed at doing
in the pilot, was

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.730
a bicycle stunt-- oh my god.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.990
What a nightmare--
In the pilot to try

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.030
to show a reduced gravity flip.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.930
It was misconceived.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.160
The director hated it.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.210
We made him shoot it.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.230
We spent half a
fucking day-- sorry.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.730
And a day--

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.105
MARK FERGUS: No,
that's worth it.

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:55.450
NAREN SHANKAR: And we cut it
out of the pilot entirely.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.490
MARK FERGUS: It
just didn't work.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:57.340
NAREN SHANKAR:
And the other one,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.270
we had one scene that we
could never make work,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.853
because we all thought
it was comical.

00:22:00.853 --> 00:22:03.880
It was Miller has an
Earth partner who's come

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.430
to Ceres for the first time.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.740
And we thought it would
be interesting if there's

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.700
a chase, to do a chase.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.230
And the Earth guy,
because he hasn't quite

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:19.660
acclimated to Ceres, he runs
so hard that he goes up.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.112
Because he's much stronger, he's
does a Superman kind of a jump.

00:22:24.112 --> 00:22:26.070
And we wrote it into the
script a couple times,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.140
and the director was
just going, guys, it's

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.846
going to look stupid.

00:22:29.846 --> 00:22:31.530
MARK FERGUS: That's the thing.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.190
If it doesn't feel
like part of the show,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.010
it will just look like
the guy's an idiot.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.930
And the bike trick looked like
a stupid bike trick on Earth,

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.430
really.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.630
NAREN SHANKAR: In that
case, we were idiots.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.162
MARK FERGUS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:45.360
But the bird, you see
the wings flapping

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.830
a third of the amount of time,
and the bird hovering aloft.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.700
It's one way, and Coriolis.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.550
There's a few things
that actually landed,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.850
and hopefully we
paint enough points

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.110
that you realize the
whole environment.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.320
But use ones that are
visual and distinctive.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.407
NAREN SHANKAR: One that
worked really well,

00:23:02.407 --> 00:23:03.990
this is towards the
end of the season,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.620
is one of our
characters, they're

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.500
trying to get out of the
station, an asteroid station.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.470
They're not sure which
direction they're going.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.570
And so she takes a little bit
of dust, and she drops it.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.340
And by the way it spins,
she understands which way

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.370
they're moving, spinward or
anti-spinward on the station.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.570
And so she's able to
actually understand

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.010
where she is relative to that.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.110
And it's not
commented on at all.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.924
I mean, it just exists
there, and so it's

00:23:27.924 --> 00:23:28.840
an interesting moment.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.680
AUDIENCE: So I realize
that you don't really

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.970
have a chance to know
how far out the show is

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.100
going to keep going.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.300
NAREN SHANKAR: Forever.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.800
AUDIENCE: Well,
that would be great,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.360
because I'm really enjoying it.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.790
But I'm curious.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.930
How do you structure
things in terms

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.770
of like, this is
where we're at, this

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.070
is where the books are
going, this is where we want

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.720
to end the season, which may
or may not coincide directly

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.530
with the end of the book, and
thinking like how far ahead do

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.520
you think on that stuff?

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.030
I know you've been picked
up for the second season,

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.990
and the books, obviously,
are going on for a while,

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.520
and there's more books planned.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.350
And so I'm really curious how
the structure of the TV seasons

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.470
and the structure of the books
are combined in a show running

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.329
sense.

00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:22.870
MARK FERGUS: I mean,
we're just going

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.579
with our gut in terms
of each season needs

00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:30.230
to be a complete experience, a
complete story, like a 10 hour,

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.844
13 hour movie with
its own structure.

00:24:34.844 --> 00:24:37.010
Then we fit that into a
larger structure of seasons.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.270
I think we're just
going toward what

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.040
is the next big
evolution of the story.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.790
It doesn't always
coincide with the books,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.780
because we don't have
to it's crazy to go

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.860
as fast as the books.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.490
To cram it in, we'd be losing
so much great material.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.116
So one of the things we had to
learn, Hawk and I, from Naren

00:24:56.116 --> 00:24:57.370
is slow down.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.730
Stop burning through the story.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.620
Stop trying to get to a fixed
point because the book did.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.530
And you're going to have to
blow past all this amazing stuff

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.820
to get to a point.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.070
So I think we've
adjusted our pace

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.957
to learn to tell the story,
bring the novellas in, bring

00:25:11.957 --> 00:25:12.540
characters in.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.400
Let the thing evolve
at its own pace,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.510
and each big chunk of
it, if we're lucky enough

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.090
to keep going, will just
find the next great turning

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.530
point and the next great--

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.750
The first season, we
would have ideally loved

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.190
to get through the first book.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.240
It wasn't feasible
for a lot of reasons,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.420
and not even advisable.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.090
So we picked a great
turning point of the book

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.090
to be the season end,
and we could get there

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.840
at a pace that was appropriate.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.500
So it's a hard
question to answer,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.650
but every block needs
to feel like-- I always

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.024
think of it as to feel like its
own contained, awesome season.

00:25:48.024 --> 00:25:49.440
Whether or not you
get a next one,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.590
you end on a really
amazing point

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.900
that feels like the
characters have evolved.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.760
The story has evolved.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.860
We've opened up the
universe that much more,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.690
and then hopefully, we'll be
back to fill in more stuff.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.610
NAREN SHANKAR: In both
season 1 and season 2,

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.330
we started the year by a few
weeks of just discussion,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.991
really, about what that very
broad structure of the show

00:26:10.991 --> 00:26:11.490
was.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.110
And season one was 10 episode.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.520
Season 2 is going to be 13.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.570
You have these books that
have a really strong, well

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.530
delineated plot framework.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.130
And so there's probably
several points in book one

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.590
that we could have chosen
to end the season at.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.270
We picked one in particular,
and the same thing

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.830
is happening as we're
going into book 2.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.620
But what you get is,
once you understand what

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.270
the pace of the show is, once
you get a broad idea of where

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.260
you want to go, it
starts to lay down,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.660
and you start to
see episodically

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.040
what the events are.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.335
And yeah, we're very
tightly serialized,

00:26:51.335 --> 00:26:53.043
so you can watch the
whole thing through,

00:26:53.043 --> 00:26:54.740
and it's telling you a story.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.920
But if you watch the
individual episodes,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.910
there's usually some sense of
completeness, episodically.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.740
And so those first few
weeks of the season

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.150
is where you really
talk that stuff through,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.730
and pretty quickly, you get
to an understanding of how

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.650
the season wants
to lay itself down,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.220
and the story that
you want to tell.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.400
It's usually there.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.090
You just have to find it.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:25.850
And I think that when
we come into the season,

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.190
somebody will say, well, hey,
what if we ended it here?

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.610
And everybody's like, that's
a great place to end it,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.150
and just seems very natural.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.550
And so I think that's at
least our plan going forward

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.712
to continue that.

00:27:35.712 --> 00:27:37.170
AUDIENCE: I thought
where you chose

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.397
to end the first season
a good stopping point.

00:27:39.397 --> 00:27:40.230
NAREN SHANKAR: Nice.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.850
All right.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.990
Thank you.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.900
AUDIENCE: That worked well,
as far as I was concerned.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.750
NAREN SHANKAR: We
had some arguments

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.179
with the network about that.

00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:46.720
NICK FARMER: The
funny thing is, when

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.810
I got the ebook for "Leviathan
Wakes," the first book, it came

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.100
packaged with one of
Daniel's other books,

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.770
from a fantasy series.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.590
And so I knew that at some
point that this book was not

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.490
900 pages long,
so it had to end,

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.820
but I didn't know quite where
it was in the page count.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.940
And actually, as
I was reading it,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.090
I thought, OK, pretty soon
the Daniel's fantasy book

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.840
is about to start.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.390
And then I'm like, oh wait, no.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.740
There's a much longer--

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.906
NAREN SHANKAR: There's a a
bunch of spots like that.

00:28:15.906 --> 00:28:17.732
NICK FARMER:
There's a coda here.

00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:18.940
AUDIENCE: A couple of things.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.830
One is I was really impressed
with the casualness with which

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.730
Miller, particularly, operated
his various bits of media

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.590
technology.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.520
I mean, it was a
steadied casualness.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.680
I haven't really seen that
in a sci-fi show before.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.440
The other, two things.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.410
One is a I noticed a lot
of the sci-fi set dressing

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.710
has elements of contemporary
technology in it,

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.580
flat screens and so forth.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.490
And I'm wondering,
is that just part

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.350
of the hurdle to
get a show done,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.390
that you don't try to do one off
special versions of everything?

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.740
Well, that'll be
fine for this milieu,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.600
or if it was more of
an aesthetic choice.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.210
And the other question, which
is a little more involved

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.040
is, right now, you guys are
funded by a large television

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.560
network, but you
were saying you'd

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.620
like to have this go on forever,
but you're living and dying

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.930
at the whim of Syfy or
some other network type

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.490
organization.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.022
Do you see a show of
this kind of scope

00:29:19.022 --> 00:29:20.730
becoming something
that could be produced

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.080
as an internet only
show over time?

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.520
NAREN SHANKAR:
Internet only show?

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.994
You mean like a Netflix show?

00:29:27.994 --> 00:29:29.160
AUDIENCE: Like a fan-funded.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.830
For example--

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.045
NAREN SHANKAR: Fan-funded?

00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:31.920
That's a lot of fans.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.310
AUDIENCE: I purchased
your show directly off

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.157
of, whatever, Amazon, right?

00:29:37.157 --> 00:29:38.490
Don't have to watch commercials.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.864
I've got I've got a little
bit more money than free time,

00:29:40.864 --> 00:29:43.250
so I do it that way.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:48.102
And I'm wondering if you see
that kind of thing happening

00:29:48.102 --> 00:29:50.560
enough to where the economics
would work out that you could

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.081
produce without this sort
of large advertiser-driven

00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:53.580
business.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.390
NAREN SHANKAR: If
somebody asked me

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.140
that question outside
of this place,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.300
I would say go ask Google.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.190
Because I suspect you have
far better metrics on that

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.045
than I do.

00:30:03.045 --> 00:30:04.670
AUDIENCE: I'm asking
for your gut, man.

00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:08.930
NAREN SHANKAR: I mean,
it's a good question.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.900
The business is going over the
top in so many different ways.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.890
I mean, Netflix
has clearly shown

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.520
that there's a
subscriber-driven basis

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.980
to make high quality
entertainment.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.640
So fan-funding is
another thing entirely.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.955
I don't know what the most you
know expensive fan-funded--

00:30:25.955 --> 00:30:27.955
AUDIENCE: Maybe that was
a poor choice of words,

00:30:27.955 --> 00:30:31.440
but consumer-funded would
be another way of saying it.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.370
I want to watch, so
I'll pay you some money.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.870
NAREN SHANKAR: Listen, you're
asking a really interesting

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:35.369
question.

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:37.470
It's a very interesting model.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.600
And I think that
probably it's partially

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.660
dependent on discovery
and targeting.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.850
Because I think that
for this type of show,

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:46.880
if the fans were
given that option,

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.100
and you were able to
reach all of them,

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.440
could each person put
$2.50 in an episode?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.560
You're buying a latte
at Starbucks every day

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.410
to watch that.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.850
The answer is probably, yes.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.860
But can you get can you drive
that kind of money to the show?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.270
That's another
question entirely.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.500
I don't know.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.004
With regard to the stuff,
the props and stuff?

00:31:09.004 --> 00:31:10.420
AUDIENCE: The
actual set dressing.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.270
MARK FERGUS: I think
it's a bit of both.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.686
NAREN SHANKAR:
It's a bit of both.

00:31:13.686 --> 00:31:17.410
MARK FERGUS: I mean, to
create these one off objects

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.610
is incredibly expensive and
incredibly time consuming.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.290
So some of it had to be
done a little more broad,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.420
because you had so much
of that everywhere.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.360
But also, I think
aesthetically--

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.026
NAREN SHANKAR: We're
a little retro too.

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:31.306
We're a little retro.

00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:32.040
That's aesthetic.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.289
MARK FERGUS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:36.870
And I think the idea
that to make a statement

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.830
about technology, that's why
we bashed up Miller's screen

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.020
to have a big in the middle.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.624
NAREN SHANKAR: A
nice crack in it.

00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:47.130
MARK FERGUS: There's
only two, technology

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:52.110
rises and eats us story,
or technology saves us.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.560
Tech in sci-fi is
always one of the two.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.570
It's a paradise, or it rises
up and robots kill us all.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.260
And what I loved about the
books, they're like, who cares?

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.850
Technology is there.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.150
It's awesome.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.330
It's in the background.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.660
Human behavior is still--
it didn't save us.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.500
It didn't eat us.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.400
It's there, and it didn't
really solve our problems.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.929
There's tons of advanced
tech in these books.

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:18.470
It's mentioned when
it's interesting,

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.960
or when it matters to the story.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.482
And weirdly, it feels
like they've ignored it,

00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:23.190
and it's just no.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.606
They put it in its place, which
is it's in the background.

00:32:25.606 --> 00:32:26.940
Who cares?

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.580
And I love that about the
books, that it's not about will

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.920
technology destroy us?

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.030
Will it save us?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.070
It's kind of neither.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.020
We're still people.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.895
We're still out there,
fumbling around trying

00:32:36.895 --> 00:32:39.930
to figure out the human
condition kind of crap.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.070
And technology is
there, and it exists.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:48.490
And the way you would always
tell them your car analogy.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.445
NAREN SHANKAR: I stole
that analogy from Ty.

00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:52.320
MARK FERGUS: Well, you
don't get in your car,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.430
and say, what an amazing
transportation apparatus

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.930
this is.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.470
NAREN SHANKAR: I am fan of the
internal combustion engine.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.960
Nobody says this.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.410
MARK FERGUS: And they put
tech in the books on that par.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.070
There's amazing medical
advancements in the books.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.680
There's amazing robotics, AI.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.980
Everything, it's just
so in the background,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.730
because it's just part
of normal life now.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.919
So to make the stories about
that would kill what's--

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:16.710
NAREN SHANKAR: There's
a show I won't name,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.270
it was a broadcast show, but
it had a whole scene where

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.400
it was about a drone that
took your garbage out

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.080
from your kitchen
to the driveway.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.142
It was so ridiculous.

00:33:28.142 --> 00:33:29.820
And that was the whole scene.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.090
Technology in our world has
gone into the background.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.580
And you made the comments
about Miller gesturing

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.285
and how fluid it was.

00:33:37.285 --> 00:33:40.600
What we told the actors
was, do whatever you want.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.020
Because the idea was
that the technology

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.980
would respond to you.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.796
You don't have to make
a specific gesture,

00:33:46.796 --> 00:33:48.170
that things are
listening to you,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.470
and watching you, and
understanding you in context.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.710
So there's this beautiful
scene in episode 5,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.750
where Miller's
manipulating a star map,

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.660
and it's really gorgeous.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.050
Thomas Jane did
whatever he wanted to.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.040
He was doing deliberate
things, but then our animators

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.170
animated to it.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.420
And nothing was choreographed.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.389
He simply just did
what he felt was right.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.170
He understood the
moments in the script,

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.190
because they were scripted.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.614
But the actual visual effect was
created to match his movement,

00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:19.030
and that's why it
feels very real.

00:34:22.497 --> 00:34:23.330
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.590
Thanks a lot for
coming out today.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.510
Naren, if it makes
you feel any better,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.010
I didn't have a
briefcase, but I had

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.380
one of those rolling backpacks.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.645
NAREN SHANKAR: Right, you
know what I'm talking about.

00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:31.900
AUDIENCE: I used to get
the crap beat out of me.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.639
NAREN SHANKAR: See, I'm a little
older, so I didn't have that.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.100
MARK FERGUS: Technology.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.002
NAREN SHANKAR: No, no wheels
then, not for the children.

00:34:40.002 --> 00:34:42.210
AUDIENCE: Guys, I have a
question more on the writing

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.670
side.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.969
I'm curious to hear from
you how much actors had

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.239
an influence on the writings.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.500
NAREN SHANKAR: As
little as possible.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.066
AUDIENCE: One can hope.

00:34:54.066 --> 00:34:55.940
But I mean, obviously
there's a character arc

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.880
you have to follow, a story
arc for every character,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.790
and the books give you
guidance, but after seeing

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.060
what the actors could
do, how much did that

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.820
influence your writing,
based on their own qualities

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.710
and limitations?

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.800
MARK FERGUS: I mean, certainly
once the actors start

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.230
to own the character, and you
get tuned to their rhythm,

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.610
and you see the way they're
burrowing in, what they resist,

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.470
what really unlocks
their inner greatness,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.470
you start to see
what works for them.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.560
Thomas Jane, for example,
he's a very emotional actor,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.580
but he plays it
with the emotions

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.850
bubbling under the surface.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.620
If you give him an
opportunity for that,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.720
he sinks his teeth into a scene.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.010
If you want him to
play overtly emotional,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.050
and weepy, and over-the-top,
that shuts him down,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.840
because it doesn't really
tap into what he's great at.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.200
So it's our job not to
change the story based

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.270
on everybody's ideas,
because then you have chaos,

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.830
but to listen to what's
working, to really

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.700
start shaping it for that
actor, and then listening.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.900
They start to have
ownership over these people,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.170
and they start saying,
hey, you know what?

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.503
I'm a little uncomfortable
with this moment or whatever.

00:36:04.503 --> 00:36:06.150
And then make them
feel safe to be

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.660
able to bring their
thoughts and ideas

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.600
and keep it open like that.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.205
So it ended up
working both ways,

00:36:12.205 --> 00:36:16.766
but we try to really
commit to story choices.

00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:19.793
But then the texture
of it, the way into it

00:36:19.793 --> 00:36:25.272
align, I think we've been really
happy the more it engages them,

00:36:25.272 --> 00:36:26.730
the more we want
to hear from them.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.940
And it's been a really
great relationship.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.030
NAREN SHANKAR: We
also, in our process,

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.630
the way we develop the season,
we have a lot of material

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.400
at the script stage
going into a season.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.960
And so the actors get big
chunks of material at a time,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.680
and when they are
able to read it,

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.080
when they see it stretched out
over a story arc or a character

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.946
arc over several
episodes, I think

00:36:50.946 --> 00:36:52.320
it gives them a
lot of confidence

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.400
that the people who are
writing the material

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.270
know where they're going.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.370
And actors get
concerned when they

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.120
feel like things are
happening at random

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.300
or for no reason, or
capriciously, or arbitrarily.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.680
That's when they get weird.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.004
But when they see that the
story is actually happening,

00:37:08.004 --> 00:37:09.920
and there's meaning
behind what they're doing,

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.003
then they get comfortable.

00:37:11.003 --> 00:37:13.460
And that's been our experience.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.000
They will chime in.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.635
Things get shaded a
little differently.

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.260
There's an interpretation
that maybe we

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.510
didn't see that we're
certainly happy to dig into.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.020
But by and large, they've
stayed on the page.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.770
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.310
Thanks guys.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.070
AUDIENCE: So I really
enjoyed the first season,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.700
and I got a ton of
questions, but I

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.010
think I narrowed it to two.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.087
One of them is about whole
treatment of sound in space.

00:37:40.087 --> 00:37:41.920
I'm just curious how
you guys feel about it,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.670
because right now, we're
seeing a lot of people

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.730
going for the soundless effect.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.867
And I appreciate both
versions in the right context,

00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:53.450
but I was just wonder
whether you guys

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.594
had thoughts about that.

00:37:54.594 --> 00:37:56.260
NAREN SHANKAR: I
should tell this story.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.780
We talked about that.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.452
MARK FERGUS: Let's
put it this way.

00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:06.318
This has been a very
important decision

00:38:06.318 --> 00:38:08.469
and an important discussion,
so it was not made--

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:10.260
NAREN SHANKAR: No, it
was not made lightly.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.570
A couple of things.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.320
Every show has done things
a little bit differently.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.460
"Galactica," for example,
they took a muffled soundscape

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.190
in space, and so
they crunched things

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.380
down a little bit sonically.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.360
It was interesting.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.890
When we started developing
the sound design for the show,

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.860
we had some guys who
were like, we really

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.510
want to use these
contact mics on things,

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.260
and they were hitting
things, because they

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.500
wanted it to sound like the
astronauts in their suits

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.370
on the ISS.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.690
Oh, isn't that going to be
really neat and everything?

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.580
And so they did
all of this work,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.810
and they put these
sounds in the show.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.440
And we're watching it,
and we go that sucks.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.650
It's like you have people
walking down a creepy corridor,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.980
and you're hearing something
that goes dun, dun, dun.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.200
It just sounds like they're
stepping on plastic.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.230
And so there's no tension.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.040
There was no scare.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.730
And so even though
that was the real sound

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.230
of what was happening
and probably

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.900
what would be conducted
through your spacesuit

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.700
when you're hitting something
in a vacuum, it didn't matter.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.230
What it was doing
was dramatically

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.390
it was ruining the
goddamn moment.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:23.880
And so what happened
was we made the decision

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:30.150
to go big, to go gut wrenching,
and things that are moving fast

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.900
and have a tremendous
amount of mass,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.510
make them feel big and
heavy, and fast and scary.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.180
It's an aesthetic choice.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.800
I mean, we would
sit in the mixes,

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.580
and I'd be going scare
the shit out of me!

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.750
It's like, turn the thing up.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.910
And it's half of
what you perceive

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.370
as entertainment is sound.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.350
it's an incredibly, incredibly
important element to it.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:56.080
And they've done tests
where they'll show audiences

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.200
the exact same film.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.010
And one version is a crappy
mix, and the second version

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.410
is an amazing mix.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.430
And the perception
from the audience

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.870
is that the one with a good
mix has a better picture.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.270
It's an amazing thing.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.850
It's just how we
perceive the world.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.900
So the story I like to
tell is that years ago, I

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.280
was doing a show called
"The Outer Limits,"

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.420
and it was an anthology
science fiction show.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.856
And we were filming in a cave.

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:26.730
I mean, it was like we
were doing a cave set,

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:27.490
and there's lights.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.610
And I was going, oh my god.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.420
What are these
lights coming from?

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.128
It's in the cave.

00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:30.930
This is dark.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.830
And the DP on the show
told me this story

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.450
about an old movie, the
'50s, James Mason, "Journey

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.670
to the Center of the Earth."

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.554
The director had a breakdown
during the filming,

00:40:41.554 --> 00:40:43.220
because he suddenly
realized, oh my god.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.050
We're inside the Earth.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.341
Where is the light coming from?

00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:46.700
And he's freaking out.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.450
And the DP goes, it's
coming from the same place

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.012
as the music.

00:40:51.012 --> 00:40:53.417
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:57.265 --> 00:40:58.590
MARK FERGUS: Absolutely.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:59.423
AUDIENCE: I like it.

00:40:59.423 --> 00:40:59.923
Cool.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.460
MARK FERGUS: Sound, I
think sound is the language

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.485
of the subconscious, the heart.

00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:11.710
It is so much more primal than
visual and any other element

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.892
that we've got going.

00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:16.580
And to leave that off the
palette to tell your story,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.330
it's just not realistic,
and it's one of those things

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.630
you have to let go, because
we're telling a story here,

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.200
and we're taking so
many of our colors away.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.400
And the subconscious stuff
that makes you see differently

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.130
because you're hearing
differently, to lose that

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.952
is hobbling everything
we're trying to do.

00:41:33.952 --> 00:41:35.410
So you've just got
to say screw it.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.680
NICK FARMER: And just to insert
a comment on that, certainly

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.930
with the language
part, there's nothing

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.770
so viscerally foreign
as hearing a language

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.430
that you don't understand.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.700
And that's because there's
just some parts of your brain

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.490
that are so keyed into that.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.280
MARK FERGUS: It's why
music can wreck you.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.120
A great song or a song
that brings you back

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.050
to your childhood,
or a song that

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.799
hits the right-- it
holds, and then it lets

00:42:05.799 --> 00:42:07.590
go, and you feel like
you're going to weep.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.920
No one can figure that out.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.530
NAREN SHANKAR: It's the lizard
part of your brain, honestly.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.150
MARK FERGUS: You've got
to grab every bit of that.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.870
And in a box that
we have 42 minutes

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:21.460
to tell a story with
all these elements,

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.920
sound is so, so important.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.650
I appreciate the question,
because it's one of those ones

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.180
that we really did not--
we're a science-based show.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.005
We tried--

00:42:33.005 --> 00:42:34.380
NAREN SHANKAR: We
really did try.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.040
AUDIENCE: You guys got
a lot of good details.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.046
MARK FERGUS: That one, screw it.

00:42:37.046 --> 00:42:38.379
NAREN SHANKAR: It sucked so bad.

00:42:38.379 --> 00:42:41.390
It was so bad.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.460
AUDIENCE: I liked
it, though, thanks.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.600
The second question
is, between how

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.380
you have a book series going
on and you have a television

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.430
series, you've got these
two separate things.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.390
And book, television often
will take some liberties

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.410
from the books, but
is there any moment

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.707
where you feel like, I just
want to take the lead now.

00:43:01.707 --> 00:43:03.040
Do you ever think it catches up?

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.500
Kind of like the
Marvel universe,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.942
how the movies are now
influencing the comics more.

00:43:09.942 --> 00:43:11.900
I know the authors may
have rights to all this,

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.970
but do you ever think,
I got an idea for this,

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.894
how it should go?

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.060
NAREN SHANKAR: I don't know.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.170
I think that the problem
is when you take it out

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.320
of the imagination and
you put it on the film,

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.520
you're stuck with those faces.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.920
You're stuck with that world.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.760
And I mean, that's really a
question for Ty and Daniel,

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.279
because they're the ones
who are writing the books.

00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:35.570
MARK FERGUS: We're not going
to catch up any time soon.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.528
NAREN SHANKAR: No, we're
not going to catch up,

00:43:37.528 --> 00:43:40.450
but it's an
interesting question.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.710
You need to send it to them.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.610
Are they being influenced on
the writing side novelistically

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.710
by what they're seeing
in the television show?

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.340
And I don't know
what the answer is.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.040
Because we're
following their lead,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.044
and we're trying not
to change too much.

00:43:55.044 --> 00:43:56.460
We're trying to
stay real faithful

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.310
and make it a real,
true adaptation of what

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.910
they've written.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.040
But I think it may be inevitable
to have some cross talk.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.660
MARK FERGUS: I wonder if just
the visuals of the actors

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.470
we've chosen who really
own-- Naomi Nagata was very

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.110
specifically
described in the book,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.350
and our actress Dominique played
exactly what's on the page,

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:25.720
except she put all the pain
inside, instead of wearing it

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.080
on her sleeve, and the
character in the book more

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.980
wore her-- she would shut down.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.010
She would hide, and
Dominique doesn't do that.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:38.774
But you can tell there's a ton
of pain and anxiety, and joy,

00:44:38.774 --> 00:44:40.440
and everything else
going on underneath,

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.660
but she lets it out in
a tough kind of way.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.450
And I don't know
how you can not get

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.540
infected with her version of the
character writing her forward.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.810
I don't know if those
guys get tainted by that,

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:55.450
or were affected by that.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:59.200
But we'll certainly have
to read the new books

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.327
and see if we're
having any effect.

00:45:01.327 --> 00:45:01.952
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:45:01.952 --> 00:45:02.800
Thank you.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.730
NICK FARMER: So we have time
for one last quick question.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.480
AUDIENCE: It's pretty
quick, but thank you

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.827
for coming, first of all.

00:45:08.827 --> 00:45:10.050
MARK FERGUS: Thank you.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:15.010
AUDIENCE: When I saw your pilot,
the sci-fi geek side of me

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.300
said what technological
advancement happened

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.310
in the history of
the show that allowed

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:24.940
so many people and so much
material to get up into orbit?

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.137
Did you guys talk about that?

00:45:27.137 --> 00:45:28.470
NAREN SHANKAR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.970
AUDIENCE: How do
you explain that?

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.080
What was your idea on that?

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.413
NAREN SHANKAR: It's not my idea.

00:45:31.413 --> 00:45:33.520
It's Ty and Daniel's idea.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.660
It's a fusion drive.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.450
It's an efficient
fusion drive that

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.380
allows colonization
of the solar system,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.970
and really compresses
the time it

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:45.900
takes to get to Mars, the
Belt, and to the planets.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.765
That's really it.

00:45:47.765 --> 00:45:50.270
And everything stems from it.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.870
And they wrote a
lovely novella called

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:57.160
"Drive," about the
discovery of what's

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.210
called the Epstein Drive.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.510
It's Solomon Epstein,
the guy who finds it.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.740
And we're actually finding a
way to incorporate that story

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.910
into season 2, so
you'll actually

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.200
get a nice little explanation.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.230
AUDIENCE: That would be very
satisfying, intellectually.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.896
NAREN SHANKAR: I think
it will actually.

00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:16.202
Because it's really is one of
my favorites of the novellas.

00:46:16.202 --> 00:46:17.452
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:46:17.452 --> 00:46:19.060
NAREN SHANKAR: Sure.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.710
NICK FARMER: Very, very last.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.780
AUDIENCE: Well, thank
you very much for coming.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.910
I love your story about coming
from a science background.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:32.390
But my question is that when
you have such an enormous power

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.580
to reach the public by
your writing and putting it

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.250
on a TV series, with a
subject that is futuristic,

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.465
and of course involves a lot
of technology and science,

00:46:45.465 --> 00:46:49.060
and given that this is
a hot topic these days,

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:54.950
the scientific communities,
whether film and TV series can

00:46:54.950 --> 00:47:01.060
be a tool for enhancing public
understanding of science

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.750
and so on, for this
particular show,

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:09.806
have you come across the debate
whether we should have science

00:47:09.806 --> 00:47:12.190
advisors on the team
or, or whether this

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:18.200
is a good place for enhancing
public understanding

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.800
of science,

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.430
how would that affect our
ratings or the type of audience

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.230
in terms of demographics?

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:30.030
And I haven't watched the show,
but understand that technology

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.510
is in the background,
and it's not

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.090
the main purpose of
the show, but have

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.154
you have you had
any talks about it,

00:47:36.154 --> 00:47:37.570
or discussion about
how would that

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.170
affect the ratings,
or the audience,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.086
and possibly the
collaboration with

00:47:43.086 --> 00:47:44.210
the scientific communities.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:45.668
MARK FERGUS: I
think audiences have

00:47:45.668 --> 00:47:47.900
loved the-- when I say
tech in the background,

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.710
I mean the idea that we'd
be focusing on robotics

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:52.360
or whatever.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.151
But what people have
been really responding

00:47:54.151 --> 00:47:57.810
to is the science of what
happens to the human body

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.990
when you go really
fast across space?

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:01.830
You have the ability to do it.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.120
The only problem is the human
body can't withstand it,

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.860
so you have to go through
a very painful drug regimen

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.470
to convince your body not to
die while you're going 20 Gs.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.510
And then the ship
will flip halfway

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.270
through the journey
and start burning

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.570
in the opposite direction.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.380
It will break for half
the journey as it sped up.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.840
People are loving the
mechanics of travel,

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.180
that we're showing how
this might feasibly

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.400
get a ship of massive
mass and density

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.060
across a huge ocean of space.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.000
And we're showing
you how it gets done,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.740
and we're showing how
gravity, when thrust stops,

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.564
or directionality.

00:48:42.564 --> 00:48:43.980
People are standing
in the ceiling

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.810
if their engines
over here, and we're

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.970
showing how directionality
in sci-fi is all wrong,

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.140
and when you stop thrust or
acceleration, you lose gravity.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.680
All that stuff, people are
digging that about the show.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.470
So I think it's we're seeing
tons of reaction in the public

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.360
to how cool is that.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.110
So we feel like it's really
distinguishing the show rather

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.940
than becoming a
hindrance in any way.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.890
NAREN SHANKAR: You
know what it is?

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.700
With these novels,
Ty and Daniel,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:15.320
they really did a tremendous
amount of research,

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.570
and they put a lot of science
into the books already.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:22.250
And so what was great
about it was they

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:25.650
found ways to express that
science in dramatically

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.680
interesting ways.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.200
And so that's what
we're doing in the show.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.299
So we don't have a
science advisor around,

00:49:32.299 --> 00:49:34.090
because generally we
don't really need one.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.590
I mean, I had science advisors
and technical advisors

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.440
on "CSI," but that
was a forensic show,

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.010
and that was incredibly
important for that.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:46.020
But here, the situations and
the problems that come up

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.720
are already well
thought through.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.010
We did an episode where we have
two of our characters running

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.290
across a catwalk towards
to try to escape,

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.030
and in the middle of their
run, the ship's main thrust,

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.510
main engine goes out,
and so they lose gravity.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:04.190
And as they're
running, their momentum

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.170
carries them up into the air.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.410
And the only way
they can get back

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:12.200
is one of the guys clips a
tether onto the other person,

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.410
flips around as they're
floating up, pushes her up,

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.340
which pushes him down, slams
him back on the catwalk.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.630
He attaches to it, and then
that allows him to come back.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:26.740
It's a beautiful illustration
of the third law,

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.670
but we don't say we're
going to teach you

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:34.020
about action and reaction,
but it's really interesting.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.790
But that's how we're
doing science in the show.

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:40.080
There's another sequence in that
same episode, actually, where

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:44.300
our people are in a compartment,
and the gravity goes out again.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.330
Thrust goes out.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.960
And a rail gunshot comes through
the cabin instantaneously,

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.400
and basically
vaporizes a guy's head.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.260
And so the air rushes
out of the cabin.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.660
The guy's still bleeding
in zero gravity,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.450
so the blood forms
this little blood head

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:03.650
over where his real head was.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.460
They finally seal
the compartment

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.670
in zero G. The
gravity comes back on,

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:13.710
and then the blood head goes--
just splashes on the ground.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.197
One website did a
whole calculation.

00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:18.780
They did a mass flow calculation
on the whole thing, and said,

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.946
well we got it pretty right.

00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:21.020
We were off by about 20%.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.603
It's like, OK.

00:51:21.603 --> 00:51:24.190
20% drama means 100% right.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:29.990
But that's the fun
of the show, is

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.790
that you're showing science in
a dramatic way without really--

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:36.630
we're not teaching.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:37.510
It's not school.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.720
It's not a textbook.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.870
What people are really
responding to, as Mark said,

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:45.010
is that they understand
it, because it feels real.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:46.620
And they're seeing
something that

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.470
is being portrayed in a way
they really haven't before.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.820
And I think in that
respect, it's really nice

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.330
to be able to do
that in the show,

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.730
because you're
expressing science.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:01.990
You may not be teaching it, but
you're being faithful to it.

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:05.560
NICK FARMER: Well, thank you
guys for coming and giving us

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.254
this wonderful discussion.

00:52:07.254 --> 00:52:08.420
NAREN SHANKAR: Our pleasure.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.378
MARK FERGUS: Thank you.

00:52:09.378 --> 00:52:12.070
