Oh

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730
 
 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.960
 
my personal interest in autism dates

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970
my personal interest in autism dates
 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.330
my personal interest in autism dates
from when I was a child and I had a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340
from when I was a child and I had a
 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.180
from when I was a child and I had a
friend whose brother was quite strange

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
friend whose brother was quite strange
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.470
friend whose brother was quite strange
and when I was in medical school I

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480
and when I was in medical school I
 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.160
and when I was in medical school I
realized that he had autism he was

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170
realized that he had autism he was
 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.410
realized that he had autism he was
actually well actually Asperger's he was

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420
actually well actually Asperger's he was
 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.720
actually well actually Asperger's he was
a very bright kid never looked you in

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730
a very bright kid never looked you in
 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.300
a very bright kid never looked you in
the face constantly was throwing his

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310
the face constantly was throwing his
 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.210
the face constantly was throwing his
arms up like like that as though he'd

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220
arms up like like that as though he'd
 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.280
arms up like like that as though he'd
made some great discovery and knew

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290
made some great discovery and knew
 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.600
made some great discovery and knew
everything about baseball statistics and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
everything about baseball statistics and
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.009
everything about baseball statistics and
so I made an imprint on me at an early

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019
so I made an imprint on me at an early
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.649
so I made an imprint on me at an early
age and it was sort of a wonderful it

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659
age and it was sort of a wonderful it
 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:42.729
age and it was sort of a wonderful it
was sort of a wonderful thing to see

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
was sort of a wonderful thing to see
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.780
was sort of a wonderful thing to see
this fellow who actually grew up I think

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790
this fellow who actually grew up I think
 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.219
this fellow who actually grew up I think
to have a successful career as a disc

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229
to have a successful career as a disc
 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.729
to have a successful career as a disc
jockey

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739
 
 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.869
 
so I was always always interested in

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879
so I was always always interested in
 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.600
so I was always always interested in
autism and and because I come from a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
autism and and because I come from a
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.009
autism and and because I come from a
family that's somewhat left-wing always

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019
family that's somewhat left-wing always
 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.479
family that's somewhat left-wing always
looking for ways I can do something

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489
looking for ways I can do something
 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.390
looking for ways I can do something
that's a benefit to society and it

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400
that's a benefit to society and it
 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.560
that's a benefit to society and it
struck me that autism was not a disorder

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570
struck me that autism was not a disorder
 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.230
struck me that autism was not a disorder
that was studied by the scientific

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
that was studied by the scientific
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.429
that was studied by the scientific
community very deeply but it in the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439
community very deeply but it in the
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.429
community very deeply but it in the
worst cases it was as tragic for the

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439
worst cases it was as tragic for the
 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.760
worst cases it was as tragic for the
families that had an autistic child so I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770
families that had an autistic child so I
 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.279
families that had an autistic child so I
was motivated in by both of those things

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289
was motivated in by both of those things
 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.230
was motivated in by both of those things
to have an interest in autism and when

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240
to have an interest in autism and when
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.620
to have an interest in autism and when
we began to study cancer which was in

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630
we began to study cancer which was in
 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.830
we began to study cancer which was in
the early 1980s I knew at the time they

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
the early 1980s I knew at the time they
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.239
the early 1980s I knew at the time they
were studying cancer that the tools that

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249
were studying cancer that the tools that
 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.529
were studying cancer that the tools that
we were developing could later be

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539
we were developing could later be
 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.910
we were developing could later be
applied to genetic disorders not the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
applied to genetic disorders not the
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.260
applied to genetic disorders not the
kind of genetic disorders where you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
kind of genetic disorders where you
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.730
kind of genetic disorders where you
inherit something from your parents but

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
inherit something from your parents but
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.679
inherit something from your parents but
the kind of genetic disorders that arise

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689
the kind of genetic disorders that arise
 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.499
the kind of genetic disorders that arise
spontaneously because of mutation in the

an example of those kinds of mutation

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319
an example of those kinds of mutation
 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.660
an example of those kinds of mutation
that everybody is familiar with its Down

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
that everybody is familiar with its Down
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.950
that everybody is familiar with its Down
syndrome or trisomy 21 I guess is the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
syndrome or trisomy 21 I guess is the
 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.730
syndrome or trisomy 21 I guess is the
politically correct way to refer to it

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
politically correct way to refer to it
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.899
politically correct way to refer to it
these are new mutations you don't

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909
these are new mutations you don't
 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.849
these are new mutations you don't

people who thought about it that the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
people who thought about it that the
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.039
people who thought about it that the
human genome is not static it changes

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049
human genome is not static it changes
 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.830
human genome is not static it changes
over time that's how we evolved and most

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.550
over time that's how we evolved and most
of those change

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
of those change

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
genetic asaurus I was interested in the
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.660
genetic asaurus I was interested in the
other kind of genetic disorders that

other kind of genetic disorders that
 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030
other kind of genetic disorders that
result from new mutation and new

these children are so different from

these children are so different from
their parents it seemed to me that it

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830
their parents it seemed to me that it
 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.870
their parents it seemed to me that it
was likely just a priori that autism was

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
was likely just a priori that autism was
 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.870
was likely just a priori that autism was
the result of new mutation in the

look at this we did so and so it was a

look at this we did so and so it was a
combination of opportunism because we

combination of opportunism because we
