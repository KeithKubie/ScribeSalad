open-source development and growing my
 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.220
open-source development and growing my
own business is to combine those two

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230

things so when I work on open source

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510
things so when I work on open source
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.810
things so when I work on open source
development it's usually for myself I

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820
development it's usually for myself I
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.779

wonderful thing about open source is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
wonderful thing about open source is
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.810
wonderful thing about open source is
that if we all do that if we all just

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
that if we all do that if we all just
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.550
that if we all do that if we all just
work on our own problems and our own

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560
work on our own problems and our own
 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.349

desired features and then share them

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359
desired features and then share them
 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.240
desired features and then share them
with each other we'll get something

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250
with each other we'll get something
 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.700
with each other we'll get something
amazing that's exactly what rails is in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710

once that's no longer true once you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860
once that's no longer true once you
 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.710
once that's no longer true once you
start working on features for other

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720
start working on features for other
 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.440

people and designing for other people

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450
people and designing for other people
 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.270
people and designing for other people
and imagining what they might need and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280
and imagining what they might need and
 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.730
and imagining what they might need and
imagining how they might use it that's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740
imagining how they might use it that's
 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.610
imagining how they might use it that's
hard it's really hard to design for

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620
hard it's really hard to design for
 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.650
hard it's really hard to design for
other people like that it's so much

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660
other people like that it's so much
 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.900
other people like that it's so much
easier to design for yourself and when

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910
easier to design for yourself and when
 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.700
easier to design for yourself and when
you design for yourself you know exactly

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710
you design for yourself you know exactly
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.780
you design for yourself you know exactly
when it's right

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790
when it's right
 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.060
when it's right
you know when the grip is just perfect

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070
you know when the grip is just perfect
 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.999
you know when the grip is just perfect
you know when the sharpness of the blade

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009
you know when the sharpness of the blade
 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.730
you know when the sharpness of the blade
is just right not too sharp not too dull

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740
is just right not too sharp not too dull
 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.030

just there you can't get to that point

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040
just there you can't get to that point
 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.110

of excellence by approximation it's very

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120
of excellence by approximation it's very
 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.190

very hard to just try to envision what

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
very hard to just try to envision what

the good thing is if you can't feel it

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909
the good thing is if you can't feel it
 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.110
the good thing is if you can't feel it
on your own body so for me there's no

when I need it and when I need it it
 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.789
when I need it and when I need it it
makes perfect sense to do it and it's

makes perfect sense to do it and it's
 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.710
makes perfect sense to do it and it's
sort of a byproduct of that then I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720
sort of a byproduct of that then I
 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.840
sort of a byproduct of that then I
didn't get to share it I'm gonna be no

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850
didn't get to share it I'm gonna be no
