If I add the x terms together, I get 3x. And if I add positive y and negative y,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.399
those sum to 0, negative 11 plus 26 equals 15. If you have trouble thinking

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.649
about that, try 26 minus 11, that would also b 15. Without even realizing it,

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:21.473
you've actually already performed elimination. We've eliminated the y variables,

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:22.563
they added to 0.
