00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.950
Summer is on it’s way and that means more
sun, more heat, and unfortunately, more ticks.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.309
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.090
Lyme disease is weird, mysterious, and can
be pretty stubborn.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.449
Every tick season 300,000 Americans will become
infected according to The U.S. Centers for

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.740
Disease Control.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.470
The symptoms are similar to a flu like fever
and aches, so a lot of cases go untreated.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.460
Only 30,000 cases get reported each year.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.349
But other symptoms can get worse.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.349
much worse.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.360
Like chronic debilitating joint pain.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.500
You can get lyme disease from the bite of
a blacklegged (deer) tick.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.020
But not all ticks carry the disease.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.261
According to Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology
and surveillance activity at the CDC, one

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:49.150
out of every four or five ticks might be infected
in areas where the disease is very common.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.500
There are a lot of misconceptions about lyme
disease.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.650
Some people think that everyone who gets the
disease will get a telltale bulls eye redness

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.650
around the tick bite.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.100
But that’s not always the case.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.390
The CDC says around 70 percent of people get
the mark, but it can vary by region.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.360
But lyme disease doesn’t vary too much,
it’s been reported in every state except

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
Hawaii.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.960
The disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia
burgdorferi.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.780
This bacteria is old.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.310
Like really old.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.040
Researchers from Ohio State University found
ticks infected with it trapped in amber in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.360
the Dominican Republic.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.460
In a study published in the journal Historical
Biology, they found they could be around 15

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.480
to 20 MILLION YEARS OLD.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.659
Basically as long as people have been getting
bit by ticks, there’s been lyme disease.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.690
You know that famous Ice mummy otzi?

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.890
Yeah, he might’ve had Lyme disease.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.159
In analyzing his genome, scientists found
fragments of the bacteria’s genetic material.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.659
At 5,300 years old, that could be the oldest
case ever found of the disease.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.799
Otzi, like others, would have suffered some
of the nasty symptoms like pain.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.440
Most of the symptoms are caused by the way
the disease targets the immune system.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.350
It triggers inflammation and can attack the
peripheral nervous system, causing pain spreading

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.430
from the back to the arms and legs, and hands
and feet.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.600
One study published in the journal The American
Journal of Pathology found that this inflammation

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.210
can also affect the central nervous system,
causing headaches and fatigue and even scary

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.680
symptoms like memory loss, learning disability,
or depression.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.859
Lyme disease can be cured if it’s caught
early, but it’s often misdiagnosed.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:15.769
So sometimes these symptoms persist becoming
chronic and debilitating in about 10-20 percent

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.769
of patients.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.359
It’s estimated that about a million Americans
live with what’s called post-treatment Lyme

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.359
disease (PTLD).

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.549
A recent study published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy found why it’s just

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.430
so hard to get rid of.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.590
Even though lyme disease is caused by bacteria,
antibiotics often don’t work to treat the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
pathogen.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.689
So the bacteria forms what’s called dormant
persister cells which evade antibiotics.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.769
And just like their name suggests these guys
aren’t killed by antibiotics.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.029
They lie dormant.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.049
Then might wake up after a round of treatment
and wreck havoc on the nervous system.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.650
But the researchers also identified two potential
treatments for PTLD.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.540
One is a treatment for cancer called Mitomycin
C, which wiped out all cultures of the bacteria.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.930
But the treatment is pretty toxic, so probably
not the best way to go.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.809
Another way involves multiple doses of antibiotics.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.110
In what’s called “pulse dosing” the
researchers repeatedly dosed the bacteria.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.870
In the first round, some cells died, but those
dormant persister cells didn’t.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.959
They woke up and tried to establish a population.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.659
But before they did, researchers hit them
with another round of antibiotics.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.879
After four rounds of treatment, the bacteria
were all eradicated.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.329
But this was only in a testtube, so more research
is needed.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.569
IF you’re worried about lyme disease and
tick bites, the CDC recommends knowing where

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.090
deer ticks are commonly found, wearing protective
clothing and insect repellent if you go into

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.930
those areas and to do daily checks of your
body if you’ve been outside, even in your

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.930
own backyard.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.590
If a tick is attached to your body for less
than 24 hours, your chances of getting the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.999
disease is small.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.940
Speaking of tiny things that could potentially
harm you, have you ever wondered what a virus

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.940
is?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.190
I’ve got the short &amp; sweet answer for you
in this episode of my new show, Test Tube

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.190
101.
