Stolen Valor!

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.071 align:end position:100%
These great videos
on the internet

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.073 align:end position:100%
called Stolen Valor videos--
have you seen those?

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:08.074
Uh, no.

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.075 align:start size:72% position:28%
You should Google them,

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.376 align:end position:100%
because there are
these people,

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.045 align:end position:100%
and they have the most
audacity you can imagine.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.113 size:88% position:56%
They're wearing the uniform,
pretending to be soldiers.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.281 align:end position:100%
(man)
Why you wearing the uniform?

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.449
Because I like to.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.117 align:start position:0%
(man)
Are you really
recording this guy?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.452 align:end position:100%
Yes, it's called
"Stolen Valor."

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.453
(man)
Can I see your ID?

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.487
That's Stolen Valor.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.588
(man)
The next Stolen Valor

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.723
right there.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.191 align:end position:100%
You know that's called
Stolen Valor?

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.426
- No, it's not.
- It is a federal crime

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.794 align:end position:100%
for you to be wearing
that uniform right now.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.162
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.330
What you can do is get out
of my face right now, before I--

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.032
'cause I'm a military
police officer also.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.102 align:end position:100%
Yeah?
Where's your MP badge?

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.103
MP badge?

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.104 align:start size:13% position:88%
Yes.

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.105
It's in my car.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.773 align:end position:100%
Get the [bleep]
out of here

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.442 align:end position:100%
and stop pretending
to be a [bleep]...

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.810
You're gonna go run
around your--

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.011 align:start size:31% position:69%
Navy SEAL.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.447
(man)
Stolen Valor!

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.115
Can someone check
if there's also a law

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:52.085
about soldiers slapping
the [bleep] out of civilians?

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.087
Those were real soldiers
confronting people

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.421
pretending to be soldiers.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.256
Stolen Valor!

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.758
Sure, technically
it's a felony,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.360
but I say those imposters
are still heroes.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:05.364
Fake boobs don't make me
any less horny than real ones.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.700
They're out there risking
possible embarrassment

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.703
just to get free appetizers
or a chick's number.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.205
That's courage in my book.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.040
What are the real soldiers
even fighting for,

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.210
if not for our freedom
to impersonate them?

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.546
Haven't you ever heard of
dressing for the job you want?

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.049
That's why I'd like to award
these next guys

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.885
with the highest honor
the fake military can bestow:

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.520
the Golden Chicken Heart.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:30.022 align:end position:100% line:0%
(man)
So the cover says "U.S. Army."

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.024 align:start size:28% position:72% line:0%
Stay put.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.026 align:end position:100% line:0%
The uniform says
U.S. Air Force,

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.095 align:end position:100% line:0%
and you said you were
in what branch?

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.930
- Army.
- Army.

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:39.098 align:end position:100%
And your name
is Ronnie?

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.099
Yeah.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.734 align:end position:100%
What rank were you
in the Army?

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.438
What rank?

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.441 align:end position:100%
Yeah, what rank
were you?

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:49.609
Sniper?

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start size:56% position:44%
You were a sniper?

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.712
Pause, pause.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.047
This situation is FUBAR.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.216
Get your story straight,
Ronnie.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.819
Be all you can pretend to be.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:03.422 align:end position:100%
You got a Marine Corps emblem
on your wallet.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:07.593 align:end position:100%
You got an Air Force uniform on
with no name tape, no rank,

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.762 align:end position:100%
and you're wearing a frickin'
U.S. Army cover,

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.765 align:end position:100%
go-fasters, and you've got
frickin' headphones in?

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.635 align:end position:100%
People are gonna think
I made this [bleep] up, Ronnie.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.138
Air Force shirt, Army hat,
and a Marine wallet.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.473
[bleep] you, Navy.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:23.876
Nobody wants to pretend
to be a sailor.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.378 align:end position:100% line:0%
So you were in
2nd Bat Rangers?

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.546 line:0%
Yep, there it is.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.214 align:end position:100% line:0%
Where's your
combat patch at?

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.715 line:0%
Gave it to a little kid,
ago--

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.717 align:end position:100%
All right, why's your flag
so low on your shoulder?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.719 align:start size:66% position:34%
It should be up here.

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.621
Got me on that one, bud.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.657 align:end position:100%
Stolen Valor
at its finest.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.660
Listen, if a meatball sandwich
can be called a hero,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.495
then so can this guy.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.996
I'm pretty sure
he just finished

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.799
12 tours
at the food court.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:47.967 align:end position:100% line:0%

You're in the Army?

(Daniel)
Yeah, man.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.522
Make that homeless guy
take off his clothes.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:13.092
He's had it too good
in this country for too long.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.428 line:0%
(man)
I actually recently
got out of the Army,

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.430 line:0%
and it's called Stolen Valor;
it's--

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.098 align:end position:100% line:0%
I am not stealing
anybody's valor, sir.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:20.333 align:start size:47% position:53%
I swear to God,

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.134 align:end position:100%
if I had any other thing
to put on this morning,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.302 align:start size:66% position:34%
I would have done it.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:24.637 align:start size:78% position:22%
It was 4:00 this morning.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.772 align:end position:100%
I went into my son's--
my stepson's closet,

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.441 align:end position:100%
I grabbed some [bleep],
I threw it on,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.109 align:end position:100%
and I slept
all the way to the--

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.344
(Daniel)
Yeah, see?

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.845
It was laundry day;

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.180
he had nothing else to wear.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.749
Troops don't have a monopoly
on camo.

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:38.251
It's very fashionable.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.585
He didn't even realize

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:42.588
he was wearing a matching
hat, shirt, and pants

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.858
until he received a free coffee
at Starbucks.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.860
I'm not brave enough
to steal valor,

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.730
but I have no issue with
borrowing it from time to time.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.566
Here is a free plate of
loaded skins for our soldier.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.734
Thank you for your service.

Hey, man, you a veteran?

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.237 align:start position:0%
Uh, yes.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
I fought for America

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.274 align:start size:72% position:28%
Who was your commander?

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.675 size:75% position:38%
Paul Revere.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.810 align:end position:100%
You realize you're wearing
a British uniform, right?

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:10.650 align:start position:0%
Yes.
Yes, I am, because I am a spy.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.652 align:end position:100%
Okay, then where's
your British accent?

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.153 align:start position:0%
You wanker.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.489 align:start position:0%
I forgot.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.991 align:start position:0%
Have some Sam Adams

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
God save the Queen.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:22.161 align:start position:0%
Yes?

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:23.863 align:start position:0%
Yay, the Queen.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.298 align:end position:100%
Light foots
have short jackets,

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.966 align:start size:75% position:25%
so why is yours so long?

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.334 align:start position:0%
I stretched it.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.336 align:end position:100%
How do you load gunpowder
into a matchlock musket?

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.505 align:start position:0%
Hmm, that's easy.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.807 align:start position:0%
Very carefully.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.876 align:start position:0%
Okay, you don't have
a sense of humor.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.379 align:end position:100%
You know your tricorn hat
is on backwards, right?

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:42.048 align:start position:0%
To rally the team.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.383 align:end position:100%
The war was over
200 years ago.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.552 align:start position:0%
Okay, listen, I'm just
trying to get some strange.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:47.553 align:start position:0%
Could you--

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:50.222 align:start size:41% position:59%
Stolen Valor!
Stolen Valor!

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:51.357 align:start size:41% position:59%
Stolen Valor!

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:53.526 align:start size:41% position:59%
Stolen Valor!

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.694
To be clear, I was not

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:55.861
pretending to be a soldier.

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.160
I was a nutcracker.
