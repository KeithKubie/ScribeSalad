00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.340
I'm getting to a point where I can really

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.720
take a step back and evaluate all the things about myself

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.180
that I don't like.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.140
I can play victim.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.180
No cats will ever cuddle with me because I'm disgusting!

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820
I can be dishonest when I'm afraid of consequences.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.020
Did you eat the last slice of pizza?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.980
What?  No!  Congress did.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.020
And if we're being real here, I can be a bitch.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.160
Dude, are you sure you're not mad?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.460
*intense music*

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.080
Yeah.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.160
I'm sure.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.700
And I'm not like that all the time.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.980
Like don't get me wrong.  I have good qualities.  I'm generous.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.280
I got you another cat!  Yay!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.240
I'm thoughtful.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.500
I thought about you a lot today.  A lot.  Naked.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.680
I'm well intentioned.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.920
I bought you your favorite sandwich but then I ate it .

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.440
But out of all the qualities I have,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.600
the one thing that I absolutely want to change

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.880
is that I'm mean to the people that I love.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.340
And I don't know why!  You know?  It makes no sense at all.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
Because you want to treat the people that you love

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.820
the best because you love them.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.300
Right?  It's like what's up with that?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.080
Is it because they're always around and you think

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.720
they're always going to be around so you kind of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.640
take them for granted.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.400
Either way, I really hate that I act like this.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.500
Hey, Anna?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.400
What?!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.600
I was just wondering--

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.680
I'm working!

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.660
I know, I just need--

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.480
I am working.  Don't you see that I am working?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.020
All right then..

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.120
Love you!

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
And the only thing I can attribute it to

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.080
and I'm sorry to call this out on the internet

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.480
but I think I learned it from my dad.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.900
And he's not like this anymore but when I was a kid he was so mean!

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.840
Hey dad?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.340
What!?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.820
I was just wondering if--

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.200
I'm working!

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.520
Yeah, I know but--

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.200
I'm working.  Don't you see that I am working?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.520
Ok.  I'll ask you later..

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.660
Love you sweetie!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300
So I was talking to my therapist about it and he said:

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.140
Being self-aware is the first step toward taking action.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.620
Now that you are aware of the problem, what you can do

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.020
is to start conditioning yourself to stop doing it.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.720
What happens is, as you catch yourself,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.620
that time between your reaction and when you realize what you've done wrong

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.960
gets shorter and shorter and shorter

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.760
until you're catching yourself before you can even react.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.220
At that point, it's just about establishing

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.100
a new healthy positive behavior.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.200
So I'm trying to remedy that.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.580
Wish me luck.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.100
I'm really excited to announce that I have two short films coming out this Summer.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.640
One is called "Loose Ends."  It's a thriller.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
It's 23 minutes long so it's the longest thing I've ever done.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.840
And it's found-footage style.  It's about two best friends

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.380
who are recent college grads.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.140
And chaos ensues!

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.540
And the second one is "Supers &amp; Associates."

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.920
It's a comedy.  I've been pitching it as The Office meets Brooklyn 99 but with super heroes.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.220
And that one is about 13 minutes now.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.320
So I'm really excited because I feel like I've come really far as a filmmaker.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.740
And I think these 2 short films are by far some of the best things I've done to date.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.520
Oh!  And I want to say thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's episode!

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.840
Someone asked me to do a Mickey Mouse voice, so here we go:

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.180
Hoh!  I really want to say thank you to Audible.com for sponsoring today's episode.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.680

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.680
Right now, I'm listening to "The Power of Habit" because I really want to change those habits of mine.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.580
Haha!

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.160
You can get that or another free audiobook of your choice

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160

Thanks Audible.  I really appreciate being able to listen to you while I'm driving

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.800
in that Los Angeles traffic.  Haha!
