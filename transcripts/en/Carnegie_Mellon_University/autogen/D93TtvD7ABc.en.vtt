orientation actually they take our
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.589

first-year seminar course called Eureka

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
first-year seminar course called Eureka
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330

discovery and its impact and so it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
discovery and its impact and so it's
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190
discovery and its impact and so it's
really about not just scientific

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
really about not just scientific
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.900
really about not just scientific
discoveries which is what a you know

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
discoveries which is what a you know
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729

again connects a lot of us its

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
again connects a lot of us its
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619
again connects a lot of us its
scientists but those personal

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
scientists but those personal
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270
scientists but those personal
discoveries of really finding that aha

and so it's until they start to hit
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980
and so it's until they start to hit
those tougher classes in their their

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
those tougher classes in their their
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960
