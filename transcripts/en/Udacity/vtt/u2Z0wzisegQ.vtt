00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.880
So, there are a couple of basic
activities of doing activity

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.969
recognition.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.610
One, I'm thinking of as model
based action recognition.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.190
So, you have some way of getting the
pose, or the appearance of a human body.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.890
And, you're going to relate these
descriptions of the change, or the pose,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.975
or appearance to some action labels.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.644
And, probably build a classifier,
or something like that.

00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:23.668
And one of the main challenges
in doing that work is,

00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:26.556
are your data that you use
from training taken from

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:31.660
a different context than the data where
you're doing the actual recognition?

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.680
These problems tend to be pretty easy.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.210
If I have training data from
the place that I actually, and

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.890
the camera,
in which I want to do the recognition.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.030
And, are much more difficult if
the training data come from a different

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.410
source.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.880
Model based activity recognition

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.930
basically assumes I've got
some low level process for

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.170
either detecting actions,
maybe probabilistically with some noise.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.639
And then, what I need to do is recognize
the overall activity by comparing it to

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.959
some, I put structural
representation of the activity,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:07.659
something that defines how the different
actions relate, one to the other.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.907
One of the reasons I sort of like
talking about it this way is it's

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:16.140
sometimes reasonable to get lots
of examples of low level actions.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.890
So, you can do our traditional
building a classifier to do that.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.440
But, harder to get lots of examples of,
the overall activity.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.200
There's some change in that lately
in terms of using large data sets.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.100
I'll talk about that in a little bit,
but

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.580
in some sense those are a some
what artificial problem.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.890
When you do this, you have this
problem of handling uncertainty.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.473
That is, your low level detections are
uncertain, and your descriptions vary.

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:42.869
And, you have to be able to recognize
the activity in the presence of this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.980
uncertainty.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.347
And, some of the major
challenges are you know, just,

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:49.665
can you keep track of
which part is which?

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:50.290
Who is who?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.630
If you've got multiple things
going on in a train station,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.080
there's lots of ambiguity and occlusion,
and being able to say what the activity

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.200
is is sometimes difficult when you're
subject to those those variations.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.870
Recently, there's been some work where
you actually don't do as much about

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.130
that, you just view activity as sort of
a big space-time pattern of some sort.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.950
So you're not actually tracking bodies,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.220
or, you don't even know
there are people there.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.200
You're basically just describing
the overall pattern of motion, and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.050
you typically train a classifier.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.120
We'll mention that
just a little bit here,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.060
but, not spend a lot of time on that.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.680
Also recently, and this was kind of,
I, I found it kind of funny,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.370
there's been doing activity
recognition from a single image.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.720
And, you might ask, you know,
how is that possible?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.190
&gt;&gt; How is that possible?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you Meagan.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.798
I didn't really want
her saying anything.

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:40.270
Yes, how is that possible?

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.620
Well look, here is a picture.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.490
Okay?

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.120
So you see that, that says, imagine
a picture of a person holding a flute.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.390
Well, you don't have to imagine it,
there it is.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.990
You could say, what are they doing?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.020
Right?
And, you could say,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.070
they are playing the flute, right?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.996
Playing a flute is an activity.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.740
So, even though I'm only recognizing
a particular pose, in fact,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.400
when I go like this, you could almost
hallucinate the flute being there.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.000
Right?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.180
Even though it's not really there, and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.330
you can think about whether that's
a vision problem,or an AI problem, or

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.870
a hallucinogenic problem.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.050
But whatever it is,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.080
the idea is that you recognize
the activity from a single pose.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.090
And, I don't really think of
that as activity recognition.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.950
What I think of that is sort of
representative image recognition, right?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.990
This is, this is sort of the canonical
image that you have in your mind of

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.420
the pose of a person
doing that activity.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.040
So, you're recognizing
the pose in the context.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.540
You're not, you might even be
recognizing the fruit, the fruit,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.880
the flute, as is here.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.570
I guess you could play fruits too,
I don't know.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.720
You can recognize the flute,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.720
and that helps you see that
they're doing flute playing.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.300
But to me, it's, it's kind of far cry
to to call that actually activity

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.210
recognition in terms of
anything like video.
