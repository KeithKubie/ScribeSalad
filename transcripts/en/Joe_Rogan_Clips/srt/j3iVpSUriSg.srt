1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,260
The Joe Rogan experience,
you should eat.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,370
So Matt, you really
should, you should eat,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,680
you should eat some animal
protein without, I mean,

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:11,700
if you oppose the moral
aspect of killing an animal,

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,170
which I totally understand and appreciate,

6
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,650
and that's what led me to become a hunter
in the first places that I was really

7
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,130
uncomfortable watching these animal
rights videos of factory farming.

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,300
I thought it was disgusting.
I'm just like,

9
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,700
I don't want to participate
in this is reprehensible.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,150
Hunting's a different thing, man.
To me, hunting is this intense.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,400
It's very spiritual in a way.
I mean,

12
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,210
people don't get it because they see you
celebrating when it's over because it's

13
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,990
very, very, very difficult
to close in on a wild animal.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,180
Mostly elk. Well, Alex, my favorite for
two reasons. One, it's very delicious,

15
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:46,320
super nutritious. Also, if I shoot one
elk, I could eat it for like eight months.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,470
What you deliver? Yeah, freezing them

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,320
breathing. So you're out
stalk in an elk on the plains.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,820
Where are you like near where you live?
You just go to our travel.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,960
How'd you can,

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,080
yeah. When you do travel on bikes,
if you're a white tail hunt,

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,290
a lot of times would go into the woods
with bikes cause they don't leave a scent

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,920
the way your feet do, you know? And um,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,500
animals don't associate the sound of a
bike the way they associate with like the

24
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,110
sound of stepping by peatal Holland.
Yeah.

25
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,920
Slapping 12 evolve, right? Oh
yeah. They see you on a bike.

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,010
They didn't even freak out
as much. Delightful. Never
seen that. Like what's that?

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,690
My brain. What are these things?
Yeah, yeah. Oh are they hurt animals?

28
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,170
So you just see like a herd.
Yeah,

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:27,561
yeah.

30
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:30,980
You see a herd of them and try to figure
out which way the wind's blowing and

31
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,350
you try to get close to them.
Is this a video of us? Yeah.

32
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:34,490
This is a video house from,

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,640
Oh yeah, that's on elk now.
The thing is you've made,

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,650
I see that elk there and I sort of
feel like I've watched too much Disney.

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,800
Um, you know, like I see that elk and
I feel I'm Bambi literally, you know,

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,040
like I don't have it. Like is that early
in the morning you look tired? Not Tired.

37
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,670
My no late afternoon actually. Can you
tell if it was late afternoon? Yeah.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,930
Like say it like I from that
position I couldn't breathe.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Like I would love the game of being able
to him because actually I've had to go

40
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,850
down.
Gun Range is,

41
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,510
it turns out I'm pretty good shot and
it's nice to see that thing come back with

42
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,480
like holes around his abdomen and
his head and I think satisfied there.

43
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,280
You've been dealt with paper man.
But, but like the ILC I couldn't,

44
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
I've got too much empathy in me that I
couldn't deal with the feeling of after

45
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,610
it was shot. I like it. They
like almost thinking about it,

46
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,460
the sentimentality of it. I've
sentimentalize it now, you know,

47
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,260
at least I don't eat
meat and stuff like that.

48
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:37,620
So it's not like I have all those feelings
of bat can handle it in a packaged

49
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:42,150
portioned off way. It's just like
feel too much like, oh that creature.

50
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,420
So what in your head when you're doing it,
when you're pulling the trigger,

51
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,610
you're not having what's
going on in your mind.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Well,
you,

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,790
you only are hunting these mature
animals that have already passed on their

54
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,624
genes.

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,590
You also are recognizing that if you're
not killing these things, they're not,

56
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,820
it's not like they're going to live
forever. They are, they live a short life,

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,040
a short life with a very violent death.

58
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,060
It's either wolves or mountain lions or
bears or something's going to take them

59
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,894
out.
Yeah.

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,650
And what you're doing is essentially
dipping your toe into the natural world.

61
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,660
And I've heard the argument that,
well,

62
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,510
this is ridiculous because
everyone can't do that. You know,

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,230
if everyone went out and hunted all the
animals, so it'd be no animals slept,

64
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,840
which is true. But, um, I'm not
everyone. And so I don't, you know,

65
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,930
I mean to use that, if everyone
did he argument, it's a
good argument because you,

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,550
if you're encouraging people to hunt,

67
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,750
it is kind of a good argument because
it's not realistic. It's not sustainable.

68
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,760
But the other thing to recognize is that
the reason why most of this wildlife

69
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,660
exist in the first place.

70
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,280
A lot of it was wiped out in
the early 20th century from um,

71
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,170
what they call market hunting
and the late, late 19th
century, early 20th century.

72
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,470
Um, they, you know, they didn't
have refrigeration and uh,

73
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,770
it was hard to get food and we didn't
have the same sort of large scale

74
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:04,150
agriculture that we have today.
And so when someone would want meat,

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,110
they would,
uh,

76
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,810
someone who would either have to hunt it
for you and you'd go to the market and

77
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,580
get that hunted food or a,
you would go out and do it yourself.

78
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,950
And they basically wiped out most of the
wildlife in North America to the point

79
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,960
of extinction, whitetail deer, elk,

80
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,450
they've been extra painted from the
majority of their range in North American,

81
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,090
only been replaced and a few other places,
but the places would,

82
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,200
they have been replaced.

83
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,950
It's all through money that was generated
through hunting tags all through

84
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,360
billions and billions of dollars. There's
a thing called the a Robertson Pickman,

85
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,450
I think that's what it's called,
act where a 10%,

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,970
if you buy hunting gear and equipment,

87
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,900
10% of that money goes to
habitat restoration. Um,

88
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,300
making sure that a rangers
and forest people get funded.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
So there's a fish and game department
gets funded and all and also population

90
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,150
conservation, making sure that
the populations are healthy,

91
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,690
repopulating certain
areas with elk and deer.

92
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,010
And this has all been done through the
money that's generated through hunting.

93
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,290
Yeah, I can see that there's an
looking at my own feelings towards it.

94
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,430
I can see that there's a,

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,580
potentially I'm bringing
a center mentality to the
idea of animals that's like

96
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,210
anthropomorphic. Yes. Like I'm not, oh
you can't kill that. It will abate babies.

97
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,800
And I mean like thinking about things
like that. Um, but what I, you know,

98
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:33,801
I live in a rural area in Britain where
like hunting is normal and I wouldn't,

99
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:38,910
and agriculture is normal and I wouldn't
get very far if I were sort of like,

100
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:41,250
you can't shoot those pheasants, look
at their feathers, they're beautiful.

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,650
You know what I mean? Like it
wouldn't, it's not a helpful attitude.

102
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,490
So whilst I like record in my cell,

103
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,670
I couldn't do that because like it
messes me up on a sort of a field,

104
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:54,090
like a very sort of deep
visceral level, you know, like,

105
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,370
but I feel like this is precisely the
kind of territory we have to look at

106
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,850
acknowledging and tolerate
indifference between us.

107
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,470
This is where I feel like the sort of
these ossified polarized positions between

108
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:10,820
right and left are starting to take root
because if someone like me who don't

109
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,810
eat meat, don't eat animal products
and wooden hunt for ethical reasons,

110
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,680
start trying to impose on other people
now you shouldn't harm because of this

111
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,390
that I've not watched Bambi,
you know,

112
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,870
like that's going to mean that people
aren't able to explore who they are.

113
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,210
And so my po,

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I've let go of judging people around
things that I don't agree with because my

115
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,710
record, I don't know everything. You
know what I mean? I'm this, this is like,

116
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:40,100
this is about my morality is about how
I behave. And if people said to me,

117
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,610
I'm thinking about going hunting, I go,
well these are my feelings about it.

118
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,580
However though I just heard
that hunting does contribute.

119
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,370
Apparently that is survival to some
species and there is an argument that it's

120
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,700
quite natural in indigenous and it's
probably a way of getting in contact with

121
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,660
who we are originally as hunt in
people is an important part of our

122
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,980
anthropological history and possibly a
lot of the condemnation of hunt in his

123
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,090
part of the rejection of who we used
to be is we become overly civilized and

124
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,490
more and more detached from
what it is to be human.

125
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,650
Whether that's sacred or pragmatic, we
don't know what human beings are anymore.

126
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,260
We reject our own sexuality, we reject
our own bodies, we reject, you know,

127
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:19,880
we're trying to turn ourselves in these
sort of cyborgs, these emotionless,

128
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,470
sexless, meaningless creatures.
Where is our passion?

129
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,230
Whereas our connection with the
sacred, they would go, hold on.

130
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,140
Only after about hunting in,
when are you going to stop talking?

131
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,810
Never gave me an in.

132
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,830
I will pummel you with my belief
system on all things like, you know,

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,110
so I don't feel like that ain't
where I get into judging people.
