1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
Now this asks fight, um, you're, you're
fighting him in July. That what does that,

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:06,840
July 6th? Yes sir. Um,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,440
when do you like how much of
a camp do you give yourself?

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
How much of like a fully dedicated,
just all in camp, all day.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,530
Every day. All Day. Every day. If
you look at them from a skillset,

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,750
Ben's not even worth waking up
before like 10:00 AM in the morning,

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,980
but I don't like to shoot man, before
my alarm goes off, I'm already awake.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,590
I want to break his fucking face,
man on a break,

9
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:34,950
his fucking rib cage and I don't want
to knock them out early on and on.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,930
I just want to hurt
towards you. That guy, man,

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,931
if I get the chance to torture him 14
minutes and 50 seconds before I stop him,

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,950
that's what I'm going to do, man. You
know, I just, I don't like to dude at our,

13
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:50,650
met him a long time ago. He's a
fucking prick man. I don't like them.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,440
There's not too many people
that I generally dislike.
He's one of them. You know,

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,330
if I was a senior right now,

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,650
probably wouldn't be too
friendly of a greeting, you know,

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,580
now do you base this on how he talks
shit and just plays around and tries to

18
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,190
hype things up? Or if you had a
like a real conversation with them,

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,260
combination and things, you
know, uh, like, um, I'm the
type of dude that, um, if we,

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,810
if we train you go to
American top team Joe and say,

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,780
I get lucky and I tap you out twice.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,310
I'm not going to ever tell nobody that
because I, that's not my glory moment.

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,770
That's just fucking training.
I don't give a fuck about that.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,940
I already forgot about that.

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,600
But there's some people they violate
that man called Jim, you know,

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,670
I went to American top team, is it
like he's that type of pussy, you know,

27
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,001
and I go,

28
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,300
he's talking about Jim Storage and he
came over to American top team after I

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,900
dumped him on his head. We kept wrestling,
he got scrambled me and he said, yeah,

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,300
you beat me wrestling with,
we were straight wrestling,

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,790
two time national champion.
You're proud of that.

32
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,900
You're telling people that you know, and,
uh, it, that just shows me his character,

33
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,360
you know, he's not, he's
not who he pretends to be.

34
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,660
And then he talked so much online and
then I could have respected them a little

35
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,820
bit if he had held to his guns.

36
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:07,230
But I see him in London and as soon as
I see him, I start walking towards him.

37
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,510
He goes, hey man, uh,
I'm going to spare you.

38
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm not going to say nothing
to after your fight, Ben.

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,930
Don't do me no fucking favors,
bro. You're not doing me no favors.

40
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,210
You say whatever the fuck you
want when you want it, you know?

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,630
And I dressed him and I went up to
talk to him and UFC got involved.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,780
He put his head down and they escorted
him out of the hotel and he never came

43
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,550
back to that hotel,
you know?

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,520
And he actually wished me good luck at
some point too, like right before, like,

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,140
why are you doing this, man?
You're not that person on, on,

46
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,790
on social media that you portray to
be. You're not, you know, so you're,

47
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,740
you're fake as fuck.

48
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,920
You're sending something to the
public that is not there obviously,

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,590
and you're a coward. Fuck it.
Let's throw that in there too.

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,110
And if people don't believe me,
tune in July six I'll show you what,

51
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,870
how much of a coward he is.
Just to play devil's advocate,

52
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,220
don't you think that what he's doing
is smart marketing to play devil?

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,880
I know you don't like it. I know you don't
like it, but to play devil's advocate,

54
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,980
but it's corny though.
I when he looks

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,370
back, it's Corny. Like
ain't nobody going, oh,

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,940
he just wants validation.
He wants to be accepted.

57
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,260
I think half of what he's doing is corny
on purpose. All that. Boom roasted shit.

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,700
Come on, man. Half that stuff is corny
on purpose. No, no, no. That guy,

59
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,620
you haven't seen him and you
haven't hung around with that guys.

60
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,180
Just fucking pony. It's in his DNA.
I like him. I liked talking to him.

61
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,960
He's a smart motherfucker. Might be
smart man, but he's a motherfucker bro.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,520
And he's this cocky for all the
wrong reasons. I just can't wait.

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,700
I love the fact that you're a purist
like this though. I really do.

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,860
I want to hurt that.
I know you do that.

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,400
When I heard that it's going
to be a great fight. It's,

66
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,480
it's one of those interesting fights
because you've got good wrestling,

67
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,060
takedown defense. You've got very
good wrestling. You've got a good,

68
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:49,870
very good takedowns yourself, but you
clearly have a big advantage and striking.

69
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes, so it's one of those, Ken, he
imposes will. Can I get ahold of you?

70
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,580
You want to get ahold
of these fucking nuts?

71
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,453
Yes ma'am.

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,010
Which we will talk to
you to me in the past,

73
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:12,580
but they'll say to my face
and minute gained respect
for. Right. Cool Bro. I'm a,

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm a punk or whatever you call. You
said it to my fucking face. You know,

75
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,150
but you say it online.

76
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:19,680
It's just the whole way it gets
said about you say it online.

77
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,630
Then when you see me, what's up? Hey,
how are you? Ain't man picture picture.

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,430
I fucking kidding me
man. Fuck. Is it weird?

79
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,760
I feel like I've been brought up from
like a twilight zone from a different

80
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:32,630
dimension.
Sometimes.

81
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,690
There's a lot of these rappers fighters
that you see acting like criminals on,

82
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,950
on the social media when they
see me. Hey, what's up bro?

83
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:43,120
Let me get a picture at all.
Fucking fanboyed out. Oh Man.

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,060
Could have sworn you were just
mentioning my name. Seen some shit, bro.

85
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,080
That's fucking nuts to me.
[inaudible] my mind. Right?

86
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,860
I'm such a simpleton. Roy just blows
my mind every time. You're a purist.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,370
I don't know if it's appears symbol.
I don't know where you want to put me,

88
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,830
but it's not simple to mind.
Just don't want to play that game.

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,460
You're not interested in that
game. It's mine. Yeah. Listen.

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,590
Khabib's on it shouldn't have fucking
game either, but he's on top of Connor.

91
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:10,610
Let's talk now. Bam. Let's talk. Yeah,
come on. Let's talk. Let's talk. Now.

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,420
I notice the same shit
purist. I love it. I do.

93
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:18,440
I appreciate when that shit
talking has consequences. Yeah.

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,060
I like some shit talking though. It's
fun. I starting when you back it up.

95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah. Back that shit up. Yeah.

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,360
Now you see me in a hallway lobbying
fucking run to security and get escorted

97
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,870
down. Who's the guy you fought in the
past you had the most beef with before you

98
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,000
actually fought?
Uh,

99
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,020
I don't know. I never really had like
real meat. No. So not like this fight,

100
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,540
like telling you went back and forth
a little bit, right? No, no, no, no.

101
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,640
We went back and forth like,
Hey, you want to fight? Yeah,
let's do it. Fuck it. Boom,

102
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:57,700
boom, boom. But we never will.
It's pretty respectful. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,220
To his occluded with man. What
about cowboy? Cowboy? I mean, yeah,

104
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,350
a little bit of beef. You know, that's in
crazy, like if I see him in the street,

105
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:07,040
we're going to start fucking
fighting or nothing. You know?

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,800
Is that what you mean by like beef for
just like we're going back and forth

107
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,390
talking shit to each other like, yeah,
me cowboy. Sure. You write me cowboy.

108
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:17,570
We're talking a lot of shit back and
forth to town, you know? Yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,390
He's coming from genuine places,
from both sides, you know?

110
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:24,380
So it was good and made it,
gave that fire, you know?
Yeah, that's definitely one.

111
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,040
It came from like a little bit of
hostility. Not like this. Ask in one.

112
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,790
I respect cab. We're going into that
fight. You know, obviously he's,

113
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,390
I think he's a fucking stud. Boon. He
proves it again by having the most wins,

114
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,540
most knockouts, submissions,
dude's a stud. I,

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,070
I don't think astrons even yet to
get a win in the UFC. You know,

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,760
I just think about it like if
I had fought Robbie Lawler,

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,930
which was a great champion and has done
amazing things in the sports and the

118
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,540
start of Robbie turnout by
like I still fighting man.

119
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,480
I remember watching him in
the UFC back back in the day.

120
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,800
[inaudible] seven and a
half with the fuck guy.

121
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,770
He came along and the half dude fucking
lean people stuck out and it looked

122
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,460
amazing. It looks, yeah,
looked fucking amazing.

123
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,190
Looks amazing physically when
he hoisted asking up the errand,

124
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,270
dumped him on his head and then started
just driving his fucking knuckles

125
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,000
through his brain.
And it shows you how tough asking is.

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,210
The dude's durable is fucked man.
He handled that.

127
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,830
He's built for survival
even by his body type.

128
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:27,240
You get told like physiologically he's
just built for a guy like me to put them

129
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:30,060
under the rate of like, oh, this guy's
not a threat. Look at him, you know,

130
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,230
but it's not going to work.

131
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,650
I already know what to do to this
guy and just fucking hurt him man.

132
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,770
Even the way he's
fucking buildings for it.

133
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,530
Patheticness let's skip the subject,
man. Let's go to somebody else. Man.

134
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:45,510
Make this guy famous on your show. Too
late, too late. Well this man will,

135
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,080
they put his picture up on the, on the
marquee. He gets a big pop. It's crazy.

136
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:53,670
People love aspirin. I, I guess, I don't
know. Haven't seen him. Loved him before.

137
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,590
He fought in the UFC too.
I had never seen that cause I,

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,330
I saw in England, in England, they
didn't fucking hated his ass man.

139
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,890
They were born him out
of the fucking stage

140
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,200
cause he looks like he belongs
there. Right? He looks like, ah,

141
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:12,760
you left us lad. He looks like
an English guy, doesn't he?

142
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,470
I guess man does not like a, what do you
do you think his nationality is aspirin?

143
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,640
He looks like he probably has
some English in him. Curly hair.

144
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,030
Want English dudes have
curly hair. Yeah, you got it.

145
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:29,770
[inaudible] who's got a
wild that's wrestling style,
wrestling style. It's funky.

146
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:32,380
Yeah, it's very unusual. Very effective.

147
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,780
You know he's going to have that
wrestling match with Jordan Burroughs.

148
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,120
She couldn't get smashed. Is that before
or after yours? I think used to be four.

149
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,600
Does that concern you or you
might get injured doing that.

150
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,020
I don't give a fuck if he does this
because he faked an injury out. You know,

151
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,880
he knows what he's doing.
He's a big boy. You know,

152
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,540
like if you're going to
fight Joe Romeo and uh,

153
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,030
one of your teammates might come up
to you and tell you like, hey man,

154
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,270
I think you should fake the injury
and the Drake what drove him?

155
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,620
I would just faked an injury and cop
out of that fight. You don't want no,

156
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,950
no problems with that guy, you know? So
that might be what he's trying to do.

157
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:00,610
Who knows?
Man.
