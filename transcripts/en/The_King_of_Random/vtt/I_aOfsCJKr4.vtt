00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.440
What's up guys, thanks for joining us today on the king of random

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.720
We are back at the dome as you can see and we've brought our flamethrower

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.440
Again today that we're not going to be shooting fire

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.980
We're going to try and experiment to see what other types of things we can squirt out of our high pressured flamethrower

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.360
I guess at that point. It's not a flamethrower. It's a whatever thrower

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.240
We're gonna mix up a giant bucket full of this

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.329
Gelatinous slime put it into the tank of our flamethrower and see if we can shoot green slime up to 50 feet

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.979
This powder is made by jelly bath, and it's what we're gonna be using today to make our green slime

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.119
I'm not exactly sure how much of this stuff you need to get it to the right consistency

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.660
So I'm going to add a couple of packets see how it does and if I need to add more

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660
I'll add a little bit more I

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.579
Think it's scented kind of smells good

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.990
What I poured in is something that absorbs the water and expands a little bit

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.799
Which is what turns it into a gelatinous blobby stuff so now

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.470
I just need to let it sit for a bit and let it absorb some of the water

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.849
You can already see getting some nice slimy ooze coming out of this. There's a slightly different shade of green but

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.899
It's all cream should work. All right. It's been soaking for a little while

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.429
I'm not a hundred percent clear on how long you're supposed to let it wait, but I'm just gonna start mixing it up

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.430
Maybe that'll help things along a little bit

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.820
Gross

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.820
Look at that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640
Slimy boozy mess

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.290
Alright, well this stuff has sort of been working. We've got a little bit of thickness

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.809
It's kind of slimy, but it's not what I was expecting

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.190
I did a test with this on a smaller scale not with the flame thrower

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.629
But just mixing some of it up last night, and I had a much more gelatinous four result

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.460
I was using this purple stuff then and I'm wondering if the green is actually a different product

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.940
So I'm gonna actually just add the purple to this as well

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.959
I don't know. What color we're gonna get but I think it will help it thicken up quite a bit more

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.509
Let's try this out

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.949
Wow you can see that reacting immediately as the little tiny beads of powder start absorbing water is just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.689
Expanding dizzy. This is like a lesson in tectonic plates right here

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.780
This is why we get earthquakes as plates expand. They hit each other they dive into each other

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.809
You can see mountain ranges are forming here. That's actually kind of cool like everything is got a pad tectonics work

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.559
Although there aren't any that I see where one is going under the others women bug

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.509
So before it was slimy and now it's a lot more of a gelatin

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.019
I'm just gonna mix it all together

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.620
Still mostly green just a little bit more subdued green color

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980
Let's let that sit for about 10 minutes

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.799
Let the purple stuff absorb as much water as it can and really stiffen up you come back and see what we've got

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.739
All right, we've had this sitting for like 10 minutes now

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.548
And I actually went ahead and just added even more because it wasn't going fast enough

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.470
Which I guess means it could eventually set so much that we can't really pour it or anything but right now

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.150
I'm at least pretty happy with this

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.429
We've got some good slimy ooze here

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.530
And I think this is gonna look great shooting out of our claim code or slime throat as it is now

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.559
Now it's like swamps line instead of Ninja Turtle slime

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.019
I'm just gonna change some gloves real quick

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.108
So I'm able to hold on to stuff while I'm pouring it and we'll fill up our tank

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280
All right, let's open up our tank

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.329
We have here the largest funnel I could find

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.599
It just barely fits in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.229
Plastic is actually doing a pretty good job of supporting that so now

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.019
I'm gonna try and pour from our giant bucket into this to help me out my friend Keith is here from Kay face TV up

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.689
Guys lift this up and see if we can pour it in without coating absolutely everything in slime

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.349
Yes victory all right so that didn't work out perfectly

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.010
And by that I mean it didn't really work out

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.299
Just puddle of who's here there. We go. I his slimy green ooze

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.259
All right this time holding the funnel in place oh

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.289
There's slime running all down this flamethrower container. It's a doozy. Gooey slime right there oh?

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.479
Man

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.130
I'll have to

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.959
Wipe that down a little bit or put it on. We'll grab some towels try and clean that off. Oh

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560
Gross

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.519
All right our tank is full like almost to the top with slime now

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.848
Let's close it off and add some pressure

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.570
We've got our co2 tank here. I'm sure we probably could use compressed air for this one where we've already got some co2 tanks

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.570
We're just gonna use them

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.250
Alright, let's open this

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.199
I'm gonna open and then close this valve again because that gave us better results with the flamethrower

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200
I'm guessing it well with this line as well

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.430
All right, there's the pressure

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.359
And I'll close this close this one

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.659
Now let's strap it on and see how it squirts all I stepped in it gross oh

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.690
I think that jelly is heavier than gasoline

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.290
Thank you

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.149
All right now the propane tank is still attached, but obviously this isn't flammable. I'm not gonna be using that this time

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.239
I'm just gonna be spraying it out and see what happens when you push

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.090
gelatin through a nozzle with 800 psi

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.939
Really great here. We go first test of our 800 psi slime thrower

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.510
3 2 1

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.300
Disgusting that's just jelly in the air

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.129
Whoo oh that's so gross looking through the air

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.029
I'm looking forward to this he's disgusting slimy ooze here we go

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.419
It's just a constant stream of slime coming out of it, and it is getting smaller and smaller as the pressure diminishes

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:56.859
now it looks like the world's fastest snail spent the day here just running around in circles still go and

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100
still go and

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.079
I ran out of slime

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.839
So that looks pretty good right at first. I was shooting about 40 feet just slime in this nice

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:18.669
Constrained beam and then it's splatters everywhere on the ground. It's kind of gross, and yeah, it really looks like a slime monster

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.239
Just died here or something. It's everywhere, so let's do it again

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.990
Boy a time travel

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.420
To the future chug

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.769
And is like that this is getting lighter bubbling swampies

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.019
I'm gonna try shooting directly onto the dome and I'm gonna try and write out the word random

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.030
We'll see how well that works out all right?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Here goes nothing

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:13.908
Probably should have written it a little smaller, but hey random in slime like I thought it's kind of hard to read but

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.199
Slide

00:08:20.429 --> 00:08:23.059
It is super easy and gross

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.440
Oh

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:36.169
That's gooey. Gooey. Gross. This really keeps going low-pressure for a while just making puddles of ooze everywhere

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.660
Well, I think we've got enough slime and enough co2 for one more round

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:48.559
But uh we have to take this to the next level. I think I'm gonna have to get slimed all right. Let's fill er up

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.280
Now we've suited Keith up he's got the slime thrower I'm gonna be against the wall

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.369
And I'm going to get slimed keith is discovering how heavy this time thrower is when it's full he's so heavy

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.490
Whenever you're ready

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.340
Endless love

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.360
It doesn't wipe off

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.909
Its just live my head's covered it so I can't really

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.470
Get rid of it

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.889
Well, I think I need a towel in the shower and then probably like six more showers after that

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:08.329
I literally like can barely open this. I just because there's lime holding it closed I

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:12.649
Literally have pockets full of slime that

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:20.689
Is a flamethrower filled with slime and shot out at about 800 psi

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:25.819
Sometimes it felt like it was about 800 psi. Well. It's getting hit that was little high pressure, but that

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.149
Was really fun kind of takes you back to the glory days of when?

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:32.599
Nickelodeon would dump slime all over people this has been a lot of fun

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.100
There's definitely some more things we want to try shooting out of our flamethrower because that's pretty entertaining

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.389
You've got any really good ideas of stuff you want to see us try and shoot out of our flamethrower

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:46.639
Let us know down in the comments. Thanks for joining us to this project and we'll see you the next one talky then

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:54.318
Guys in the shot we don't know who he is just wandering on set actually have this step two which is designed to dissolve

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.380
What you mixed up before?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.110
I'm pretty sure it's just table salt. Oh my gosh

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.289
My glasses won't even stay up because they're just like slippery and my hair is slippery

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.430
Well, that's that's what I'm gonna use instead of shampoo from now on

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.410
Hey guys

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.639
I hope you loved this video as much as we loved making it for you because if you didn't and I guess we books just

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.609
Wasted our time, but we are literally working on the next one right now

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.740
So we'll see you as soon as we get it finished back to you then
