00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.271
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.000
It's 11:05.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.910
OK, let's get started.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.930
Last day we talked about
protein structure.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.220
We talked about composition,
which is the primary structure

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.955
of proteins, and that's the
instant R group sequence, as

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.520
you go down the backbone.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.500
The secondary structure proteins
is all about packing,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.070
and we saw that there were three
different structures,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.190
the alpha helix, the
beta pleated sheet,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.380
and the random coil.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.480
And the gambit here is to
maximize hydrogen bonding.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.440
And why you choose alpha, beta,
or random coil depends

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.790
upon the instant R group
sequence, which is why in some

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.260
instances, you can't
form the coil.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.450
Because the R groups
won't allow it.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.280
And then lastly, we talked about
tertiary structure, and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.080
that's conformation, and that
talks about our group

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.390
interactions, and ultimately
explains protein folding.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.040
Today I want to talk about
denaturing of proteins, which

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.610
is disruption of secondary
and tertiary structures.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.360
But before we do so, I
wanted to show you.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.440
I found another movie reference
to chemistry.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.585
This comes from 1957,
and the movie

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:30.990
is called Silk Stockings.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770
It's based on an old
Cole Porter play.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.950
And this stars Cyd Charisse
and Fred Astaire, who were

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.680
both fantastic dancers.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.360
And I want you to see
in this film clip

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.900
how she carries herself.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.140
And she actually sings this.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600
She didn't have somebody
dub it over.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.510
So the singing is OK.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.610
It's not great, but you've
got to see her posture.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.840
She's so graceful.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.320
And Fred Astaire is a terrific
dancer, but he doesn't dance

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.300
in this sequence.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.120
And last thing you need to
know here is, this is set

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.510
during the Cold War.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.920
So she's playing Ninotchka
Yoschenka, a good Ukrainian

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.810
name, and she's a Soviet
representative.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.450
And she's fighting with
Fred Astaire, who

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.950
is an American agent.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.620
And they're talking about the
differences between the Soviet

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.780
and the American systems. So
that's the background.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.280
It's 1957.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.810
I guess we better get
some volume up here

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.690
so we can hear it.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.050
And she will explain to you--
and remember, just

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.740
parenthetically, that my
particular interest in

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.150
chemistry is, of course,
electrochemistry, which is the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.730
highest form of chemistry.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.530
Now she'll explain it to you.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.855
[BEGIN FILM PLAYBACK]

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.550
-If you studied, Kamachev,
you would know what

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.250
I am talking about.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.580
-Who's Kamachev?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.660
-He was one of our greatest
scientists.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.100
He has proved beyond any
question that physical

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.270
attraction is purely
electrochemical.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.360
-You don't say.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.995
-Kamachev has proven it!

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:48.970
-For 30 years, he worked.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.090
-I happen to have worked on the
same subject for about the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.330
same amount of time, and I have
very good reasons for

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.600
believing otherwise.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.450
-Facts are facts

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.830
[SINGING]

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.990
-When the electromagnetic
of the he-male meets the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.229
electromagnetic of the female,
if right away, she should say,

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:12.860
this is the male, it's a
chemical reaction, that's all.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.560
And though you Fascists may
answer with kisses, the same

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.970
applies when your Mr. And Mrs.
Hey-diddle-diddle with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.430
middle-class kisses, it's a
chemical reaction, that's all.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.470
Say in love, with you, I fall.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.970
And in love, with me,
you also fall.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.430
Though the uninstructed faction
calls it mutual

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.636
attraction, it's a chemical
reaction, that's all.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.064
[END SINGING]

00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:47.400
-You don't believe
in Kamachev?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.810
-No, ma'am.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.420
[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.480
PROFESSOR: See the posture?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.150
It's just unbelievable.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.860
Fantastic.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.130
OK.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.920
So let's talk about denaturing
of proteins.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.550
So we want to talk about how
we can alter the structure.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.640
And we do so by invasive
means.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.130
So let's get to the
next slide.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.760
So here's the tertiary
structure, and I

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.150
can point to that.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.720
The first thing I wanted to draw
attention to, is we can

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.480
disrupt that structure by
change in temperature.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.560
So temperature is the first
agent that we can use in

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.220
disrupting, or denaturing,
protein.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.040
And the whole idea here
is to break bonds.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.295
But we're only going to break
secondary or tertiary bonds.

00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:35.330
We're not going to do anything
to the backbone.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.400
And a good example is what
happens when we fry an egg.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.560
The egg has protein in it.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.910
One of them is ovalbumin.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.510
It's about 90% water,
about 10% protein.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.095
And its native state, its
natural state, conformation is

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.500
a tight ball.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.710
And the diameter of that ball is
small enough that uncooked

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.060
egg is transparent
to visible light.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.620
Egg white is transparent to
visible light in its natural

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.340
form, but when we heat beyond
the denaturing temperature,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.210
that changes the bonds in
here, and it unpacks.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.760
And when it unpacks,
two things happen.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.090
First of all, the length scale
changes to be great enough

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.530
that it scatters light.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.440
So now the egg white
appears white.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.220
And secondly, those various
chains entangle, and that

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.450
gives it its rubbery
character.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.200
So all of that is happening as
a result of the increase in

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.350
temperature.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.610
So second way that we can
operate, is to change pH.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.120
And what that does, is it
changes hydrogen bonding and

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.190
electrostatic interactions.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.040
Now I draw your attention
to zone two here.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.490
In zone two, imagine if we take
that proverbial drink of

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.190
cola, and now the pH in here
goes way, way down.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.090
You can see this N has got a
hydrogen bond over to here.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.140
Now, if there's a proton excess,
the proton can cap,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.270
because this is a proton
attachment site.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.590
If the proton caps this
carboxyl, then this hydrogen

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.750
bond is broken, and now
this thing can unfurl.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.620
Over here, you see, this is an
electrostatic attraction.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.550
Again, the carboxyl could be
kept by a proton, and now the

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.650
plus minus electrostatic
attraction is lost. So by

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.900
change of pH, we could denature
what we see here.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.990
So there's a good example.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.120
And in fact, I think
we do this.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.390
We pickle our foods.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.590
And then this one I have,
because of my interest in high

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.220
temperature electrochemical
processing of metals, I've

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.600
been to Norway many times.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.270
And this is a food that they
will never let me eat, because

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.570
they're afraid if I ever
taste this, I'll

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.690
never return to Norway.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.400
But this is lutefisk, which
literally means lye fish.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.020
And lye has high pH.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.970
And this is an example of
denaturing protein by going to

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.930
very, very high pH.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.070
And then you soak it and draw
back out and so on.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.790
So there's a good
example of food.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.730
Now the third one I want to
talk about is oxidizing

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.450
reducing agents to denature
proteins.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.760
And what they do, they can
either create or destroy the

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.640
sulfide linkages, the
sulfur-sulfur linkages.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.720
So for example, you see at
position number one.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.310
Position number one, we
can use oxidizing

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.440
and reducing agents.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.790
And a good example, that
comes from hair.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.123
So first of all, I want
to talk to you.

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:37.410
Hair is protein.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.270
And this first example is just,
how protein can, one

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.980
strand can bond to the other
by hydrogen bonding.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.195
So up here you have one strand
and a second strand, and there

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:50.230
are hydrogen bonds
in your hair.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.680
Now, what you do when you want
to change your hair by blow

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.020
drying is first you
wet the hair.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.820
And the water goes in and
interrupts these hydrogen

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.540
bonds between strands.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.460
So now each of these cross-links
that want to form

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.220
instead terminate with
a water molecule.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.450
And now with the water
molecules, now you can move

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.340
the hair one strand versus the
other, hold it in place, blow

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.630
dry, get rid of the water, and
form new hydrogen bonds.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.700
So what, on the basis of what
I've just told you, how can

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.430
you account for a
bad hair day?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.290
What is a bad hair day?

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.880
A bad hair day is a day in
which it's rather humid.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.120
And so water can get in from the
atmosphere and interrupt

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.460
these bonds, and then the hair
will relax, and go back to a

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.790
native state that is unfavorable
vis-a-vis what you

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.840
tried to achieve with the blow
dryer in the mirror.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.710
So you want to combat this.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.590
So what do you do?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.900
Well, you bring out
covalent bonds.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.710
So here's two strains of hair,
and there are disulfide

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.990
linkages between the
strands of hair.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.730
So now with a reducing agent,
reducing agent is going to be

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.460
a proton donor.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:08.340
And can you see, these disulfide
linkages are capped

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.940
with hydrogen, and now
they're terminated.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.380
And so now the two strands of
hair are free to move relative

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.640
to one another.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.500
And now when you're at the
beauty parlor or the

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.700
hairdresser, now you can take
this hair, for example, and

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.150
wrap it around--

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.280
what do you call this thing?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.530
It's a mandrel in the
metallurgical word.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.680
What do you call this thing?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.890
Curling iron or something?

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.110
Yeah.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.430
OK.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.740
So here you are.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.510
You wrap this around--

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.520
I know what it does.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.800
I don't know the terms,
all right.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.090
So now you see, we've got the
hair now wrapped around in

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.710
this fashion, and now we
use an oxidizing agent.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.830
The oxidizing agent
is peroxide here.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.130
You know the derogatory
term, peroxide blonde.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.290
There it is, right here.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.610
So the peroxide goes
in, and now it

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.880
removes these hydrogens.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.100
The peroxide takes the hydrogens
away and reforms the

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.590
disulfide linkages, but
now the hair is

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.350
in this curled state.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.400
You know, you might
have the opposite.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.190
Maybe in your native state, your
hair, because of the way

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.350
the R groups are formed along
the length of your hair, you

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.910
know, it's always, the ones with
the curly hair want the

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.660
straight hair, the ones with
the straight hair want the

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.230
curly hair.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.290
And so, you know, maybe you
could be running this sequence

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.890
in reverse.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.870
But in this case, somebody
obviously wants curly hair.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.290
Now they form the disulfide
linkages.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.680
So this is the object,
here, of denaturing.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.770
So now when we go over to here,
we have a disulfide

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.410
linkage, which is forcing
this run of the random

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.960
coil to stay straight.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.660
But if we get, in this case, the
oxidizing, the reducing,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.390
and what will happen is that
we will break this.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:46.340
So the reducing agents will
destroy disulfide linkages,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.830
and the oxidizing agents will
create disulfide linkages, and

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.940
thereby we can distort the
natural form of the protein.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.290
And here's a fourth example.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.260
There are many others, but I'll
just give you four here.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.990
In the fourth one, we
can use detergents.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.060
And last day, I showed
you the example of

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.270
how to do your laundry.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.800
And so you've got this long
aliphatic tail and the

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.330
hydrophobic head, and you can
imagine if you take such

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.660
species and you've got this
hydrophobic pocket, the

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.460
species will operate in such a
way as to pull these non-polar

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.730
entities out, and
then destabilize

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.290
this hydrophobic pocket.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.190
So depending on what the nature
is of the protein,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:46.300
these various chemical and
thermal actions can lead to

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.860
denaturing.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:53.870
So this destabilizes hydrophobic
pockets.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.250
All right.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.150
So that's pretty good.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.390
All right.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.880
Well, I think this is where I
want to leave it with the

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.500
treatment of proteins.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.790
And I want to move on to
a second biomolecule,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.790
and that's the lipid.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.240
We'll say a few words
about lipids.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.200
Lipids are not classified
on the basis of their

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.660
composition, but rather
by their properties.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.970
So they are defined
their properties,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.480
which is kind of unusual.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.330
Normally we define things in
terms of their chemical

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.210
compositions.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.975
And in particular, they're
soluble in

00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:35.225
solvents of low polarity.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.930
Some of the books say nonpolar
solvents, but even something

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.580
that's polar but only mildly so
will work, in solvents of

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.240
low polarity.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.320
So that's the example.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.300
They're insoluble in water,
they're oily to the touch.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.840
And this includes things
like fats, oils,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.790
these are all lipids.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:09.710
Cholesterol, hormones.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.430
These are all members
of the lipid class.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.410
And so let's look at
some examples.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.190
We've got some slides.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.100
So if you start over here with
the glycerol, this is a

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.590
trialcohol.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.900
And you can see the OH.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.170
We're going to drop the H's, and
we're going to put these

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.290
long aliphatic chains on.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.635
There's 14 carbons here,
plus the two, so

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.380
it's 16 carbons long.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.620
And this also is seven
plus seven, and

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.340
then the two carbons.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.420
And the difference here is that
in this case, it's all

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.430
straight chain.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.830
In this case, we go for seven,
then we put in a double bond.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.220
And by doing so, when we get
to the double bond, that

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.560
forces everything to go into
planar 120 degree arrangement.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.030
So you go for seven however
you want, and then there's

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.030
this rigid 120 degree placement,
and then you go for

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.370
seven however you want.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.140
Well, clearly, the one in the
middle is going to pack better

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.270
than the one on the left.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.850
And so even though they have
seemingly the same chemical

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.430
composition, the one in
the middle is a solid.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.050
It's a fat.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.790
The one on the right is a
liquid, because it doesn't

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.480
pack well enough.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.250
The bonds aren't
strong enough.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.110
So these are both examples.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.150
And this is called
a palmitic acid.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.510
And you can see here
oxygen acting as a

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.330
bridge, as an ester.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.710
So oxygen, over and over again,
acting in this way to

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:35.930
give us the ability to make
these other longer structures.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.840
Now we can replace that oxygen
bridge with a dibridge.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.380
So instead of having just an
oxygen here, we're going to

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.660
put a phosphate.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.720
So with the phosphate, we've got
a phosphodiester linkage.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.030
There's one ester, there's
a second ester.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.310
And why we doing this?

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.720
Because nature wants to
get the spacing right.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.900
And remember what I just said,
because by the end, you're

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.460
going to see that spacing
is everything.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.110
So we can use this, and we can
even lose that oxygen, and put

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.350
something else here.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.090
So here's a--

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.060
I'm not expecting you to
know these by heart.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.740
I would give you the structure
and tell you what it is, tell

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.890
you its name, and then we
can go on from here.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.090
So what do you see here?

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.340
Well, this is called
a phosphatide.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.580
And this one is a
phosphatidylethanolamine,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.720
because there's the
amine here.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.140
And look at this thing.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.600
Well, you've got a
phosphate in the

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.690
center that's the bridge.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.310
This is the glycerol,
the three carbons.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.430
In its most primitive
form, we could just

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.900
have hydroxyls here.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.380
This is the fatty acid
off the one end.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.990
Long chains here,
not to scale.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.590
So these things should be
way, way over to here.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.480
And over here, we have
an ethanol amine.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.540
But look more closely.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.220
Well, this is a hydrophilic
head, this is

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.020
twin hydrophobic tails.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.520
Look, this is just
hydrocarbon.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.220
It's not soluble in water.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.250
So now you've got this
amphipathic molecule.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.250
It looks like a detergent,
doesn't it?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.160
This long, hydrophobic tail
could stab the grease, and

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.330
this hydrophilic head can
bond to the water.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.760
And now if we shake things up,
we'll release the grease

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.320
that's binding the soil
to your T-shirt.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.170
Got the phosphate bridge here,
and look even more closely.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.420
There's a minus, and
there's a plus!

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.210
This is zitterionic, on top
of everything else.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.160
So this can function as
a zwitterion, too.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.300
And everything we learned about
zwitterionic chemistry

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.540
and buffering, this
thing can do.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.290
That's cool.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:25.580
All right.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.120
So now I want to show what
happens when I take a whole

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.330
bunch of those.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:29.640
All right?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.370
So let's go back.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.830
I want to keep this one up, and
I want to want to do is

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.810
take a whole bunch of those,
and show how lipids can

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.110
actually operate in order
to build complex

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.150
structures for us.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.440
So what I'm going to
do, is I want to

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.100
represent that molecule.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.600
So here's the hydrophilic
head.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.420
That's the amine, right?

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.470
And then we've got twin
hydrophobic tails.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.970
And that's your carbon
sp3 chains.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.540
And I don't want to write
that so much.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.400
So I'm just going to simplify
that as simply hydrophilic

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.640
head and hydrophobic
twin tails.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.640
So this now represents
the twin tails.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.550
Now if I put a whole bunch
of these in water,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.660
what's going to happen?

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.600
First of all, this
is hydrophilic.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.320
And what if I were to just
pour this into a beaker?

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.660
What do you think would happen
if I introduced this into a

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.900
beaker of water?

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.860
Well, this is hydrophobic,
this is hydrophilic.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.070
Can you imagine that they
would all sort of

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.060
line up like this?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.970
We're trying to stick
the hydrophobic

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.870
tails up into the air.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.350
Because they don't want
to be down in here.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.720
This is hydrophobic.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.910
Doesn't want to be here.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.470
So now suppose I put a whole
bunch of these in water.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.500
More than four, right?

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.220
With only four, that's
the best can do.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.860
What if I put some molar?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.790
So then what it does, is
it forms a pocket.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.290
It's going to do this.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.560
All the heads are going to find
each other, and all of

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.620
the tails are going to
find each other.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.760
Because now they're going to
form a hydrophobic pocket.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.120
So they'll do it this way,
because they can-- can you see

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.580
how the heads can sort of make
a wall against the water?

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.455
And you go on and on and on, not
to scale, and then finally

00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:15.370
you have some end
effects here.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.250
So what have I formed here?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.590
I've got something, first of
all, I've got a lipid layer

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.240
here, and a lipid layer here.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.210
So together, I have
a lipid bilayer.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.407
In here, there's a pocket.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.490
And now, what I can do with
this whole thing, is I can

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.000
build a cell wall with this.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.800
I've got a cell wall.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.990
I've got an outside
and an inside.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.050
So what happens is, when we put
all these things together,

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.720
because of the clustering
of the hydrophobic and

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.835
hydrophilic, we say this thing
is endowed with the property

00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:09.085
of self-assembly.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.010
Very hot topic in material
science.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.860
And that leads to cellular
structure, and I think we've

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.150
got a nice cartoon here.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.650
So this is taken from
one of the readings.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.420
So you can see this with
the plurality of these.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.570
They're actually showing
the twin tails.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.960
Now, this was taken
from another text.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.040
I like this one, because it
shows the hydrophilic top,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.470
hydrophilic bottom, and the
hydrophobic interior.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.920
And then this thing is called
an integral protein.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.510
Why?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.560
Because it's integrated
into the cell wall.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.330
And let's think about this
protein for a second.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.680
What must be the nature of the
R groups in this vicinity of

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.430
the protein, that it
sits where it does?

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.810
The R groups around here must
be dominantly hydrophilic,

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.170
otherwise it would get dumped
out of that zone.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.450
And in here, it must be
dominantly hydrophobic, so

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.050
that it feels at home with all
of these hydrophobic tails.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.300
And over here, it must
be hydrophilic.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.860
Now imagine what happens.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.090
I'm going to go back to that
drink of Coca Cola.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.500
Forgive me, no brand names.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.100
Cola.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.370
And now the this zone here gets
flooded with protons,

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.910
because the pH is dropping.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.940
So that could cause
conformational changes,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.480
because pH changes the
conformation of the protein,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.540
and it could cause this
thing to change shape.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.230
It could unfold, or it might
unfold in such a way as to

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.880
open a channel down
the center here.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.220
And so in response to a change
in pH here, we open up a

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.900
channel, which means this is
acting as a chemical gate.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.970
This is how things
are animated!

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.980
It responds.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.290
And then once the proton
concentration has been

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.440
depleted and you're back to a
more neutral pH, then this

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.840
thing changes back to its
old confirmation,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.920
and the gate closes.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.310
It's that simple!

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.980
The secondary bonding
explains animation.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.830
That's what's happening.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.310
And there's one other
cool thing.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.970
Look at this.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.500
If they all have the
same head, They're

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.750
going to close pack!

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.610
It's fantastic.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.630
Everything.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.090
Everything you need to
know, 3.091 here.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.430
All right.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.240
So what is the key
to animation?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.520
The key to animation
is self-assembly.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.850
And why do we have
self-assembly?

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.360
Because we have these molecules
with the hydrophilic

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.320
head and the hydrophobic tail.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.070
These molecules are called
amphipathic.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:56.910
OK.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.790
So this has hydrophobic and
hydrophilic components.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.820
So if you take amphipathy, you
end up with self-assembly.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.660
That's the key.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.910
All right, good.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.190
All right.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.640
I think that's all I want
to say about lipids.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.630
That's all you need to know
about lipids, is lipids will

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.910
give you cellular structure.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.870
Now we've got a little bit of
time left, and we're going to

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.880
talk about nucleic acids.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.170
So what do I want to say
about nucleic acids?

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.950
Nucleic acids carry
information.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.850
They carry information that
directs metabolic activity,

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.120
including replication.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.490
And something can be animated,
but it doesn't count as a life

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.730
form unless it replicates.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.890
That's the characteristic of
life forms. So nucleic acids

00:22:46.890 --> 00:23:00.540
carry information that directs
metabolic activity, including

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.790
replication.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.430
So these are macromolecules.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.020
Not polymers, but
macromolecules.

00:23:19.406 --> 00:23:22.500
We'll take a look in a moment
at their structure.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.810
They're macromolecules, and the
basic structural unit is

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.060
called a nucleotide.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.140
And it's got three
building blocks.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.520
Every nucleotide has three
building blocks.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.880
See, what we're doing right
now, is we're really tying

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.270
together all of that chemistry
you've been learning the

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.750
entire semester.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.330
And it's fun to see it
actually go to use.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.260
So what are the three
building blocks?

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.460
Every nucleotide has a sugar.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.810
And we didn't study
carbohydrates, but I'll just

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.480
show you the structure
the sugar.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.790
It's got an amine.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.570
You know what that is.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.360
That's the NH something group.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.610
And it's got a phosphate.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.720
So the nucleotide has those
three components,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.860
So let's take a look
at the sugar.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.480
There's really two types of
sugars found in amino acids.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.400
There's the ribose--

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.240
and the only reason I'm showing
you this, is so that

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.180
you'll understand
the terminology.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.430
There's the deoxyribose.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.910
So if you look here, the sugar
on the left has this five-fold

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.880
symmetry, the five-fold ring.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.830
And there's hydroxyls at the
number one position, number

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.810
two position, number
three position.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.060
The deoxyribose is missing
the hydroxyl at

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.520
the number two position.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.710
That's the difference.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.150
The reason I'm showing you
this, is this is called

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.170
deoxyribose, and ultimately
this is the D in DNA.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.850
So you'll be able to at least
hold your own with your course

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.160
seven major friends,
if you have any

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.150
friends in course seven.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.870
And you can say, I know
what the D is.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.100
It's deoxyribose.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.790
OK.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.900
So then the amines.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.320
The amines we've got, there's
five of these.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:25.000
And they split for
RNA and DNA.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.250
And they're shown here.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.140
So it's interesting.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.530
There's two of them that are
called purines, because

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.920
they've got this
ring structure.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.270
And then the six fold, and
then the five fold.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.050
So these are the purines, and
then the pyrimidines have just

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.210
the six fold structure.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.410
There are three of those.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.290
So A, G, C, U, and T.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.840
Those are the five different
amino acids.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.620
And the difference is that in
DNA, you only have A, G, C and

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.730
T, whereas in RNA, you
have A, G, C, and U.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:00.670
This is the chemistry.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.430
If you take 7012, you'll figure
out how all of this

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.310
other stuff goes.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.820
And this thing here
is phosphate.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.300
And why is phosphate present?

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.570
Because it's acting as the
bridge and a spacer.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.230
So let's take a look
at the structure.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.430
OK.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.320
There's more of the amines
in nucleic acid.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.760
So this is what it looks like.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.960
So you have a backbone that
consists of sugar phosphate,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.630
sugar phosphate, sugar
phosphate, shown here.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.710
So in this case, you've
got the deoxyribose.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.250
So there's the sugar, there's
the five-fold symmetry.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.350
Then the spacer, the phosphate,
then the sugar, and

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.260
then the spacer,
the phosphate.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.140
And you can see that the sugars
are acting as hangers

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.310
for these amine groups.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.700
And they're called bases,
because in fact they act as

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.760
Bronsted bases.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.300
They're proton acceptors, and in
the early days of molecular

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.090
biology, people determine the
chemical composition by wet

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.930
assay, and these
were determined

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.340
to be Bronsted bases.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.960
And so to this day, people refer
to them as base pairs,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.880
et cetera, et cetera, even
though now we know they're

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.100
amines, et cetera.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.150
So this is the structure
going up.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.750
And you see, at one end, you've
got the three, and

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.705
going up to the five.

00:27:15.705 --> 00:27:18.800
The three is, you have the
carboxylic acid end, and at

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.650
the other end you have
the amino end.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:21.970
OK.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.270
So there the structure.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.950
And you have a choice here.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.230
So again, the sugar hanger,
the phosphate spacer, the

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.070
sugar hanger, the phosphate
spacer.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.580
And you have a choice of
one of these four.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.440
Any one of these four is what's
found in a DNA strand,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.055
as you go up the strand.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.440
Now, how is information
encoded?

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.540
Well, the information
is encoded--

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.490
first of all, we have
to recognize what

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:56.810
the structure is.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.450
Know that the structure, turns
out that it forms a double

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:06.020
helix, which is the first
secondary structure, right?

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.370
It doesn't have. The primary
structure is this instant A,

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.380
C, G, T sequence all along.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.760
And then the secondary structure
is, in order to

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.960
maximize hydrogen bonds, this
forms a double helix with a

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.310
second chain.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.940
And furthermore, the pairing
is such that A always pairs

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.460
with T, because they have two
hydrogen bonding sites between

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.280
them, whereas C pairs with G,
because they have three

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.780
hydrogen bonding sites
between them.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.580
And furthermore, look
at the spacing here.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.420
This always just stuns me.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.990
If you look down the center
of the strand--

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.970
so I've got two strands
of nucleic acid.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:53.590
The center to center spacing is
1.085 nanometers between A

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:58.380
and T, and it's 1.085 nanometers
to four significant

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.170
figures between C and G.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.450
And you might say, well, is it
possible that I could take two

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.810
of these hydrogen bond sites and
line them up to two of the

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.550
three hydrogen bond sites?

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.690
And the answer is no, because
the spacing is wrong.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.830
You can't, these two are far
enough apart that they won't

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.450
line up here.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.561
So it's guaranteed that it's
always A to T, C to G.

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:24.140
All right.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.960
So now you see the
double strand.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.600
You have one strand moving up.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.230
You see the pentagon is pointing
up, and here you see

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.590
the pentagon is pointing
down, and we have the

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.870
base pairs in between.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.960
C pairs to G, and
T pairs to A.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.730
And down here is the basic end,
the acidic end, the basic

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.060
end, the acidic end.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.800
And so the secondary structure
is the double helix.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.750
Why?

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.580
To maximize hydrogen bonds in
between, and then to keep

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.130
maximizing hydrogen bonds.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.530
Hydrogen bonds between
the galleries.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.378
Maximize, maximize, maximize.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.815
So there's what they call the
base pairs, and et cetera, et

00:30:04.815 --> 00:30:05.950
cetera, et cetera.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.270
This distance is all prescribed
by the fact that we

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.150
have the phosphate present.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:11.420
OK.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.990
Now where's the information
here?

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.880
I said this encodes metabolic
information.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.000
Well, suppose I want to direct
protein synthesis.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.140
I want to put amino acids
in a sequence.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.950
So I have to be able to call.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.535
You know, I'm sitting here as
nature, and I'm saying, I want

00:30:27.535 --> 00:30:28.680
to make this protein.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.470
So I need this amino acid, and
then I need this amino acid,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.030
and then maybe that amino acid,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.780
and put them in sequence.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.520
So I need 20 different
words to call 20

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.540
different amino acids.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:47.160
Well clearly, clearly if I have
just A, C, G, and T--

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:54.340
so if I have one-letter
words, it won't work.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.550
Because I need to call out 20.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.260
I need 20 amino acids.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.680
So how am I going
to get to 20?

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.840
I don't have 20 of these.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.510
I'm only using, there's
only four of these.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.150
So I say, oh.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.020
I know what to do.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.380
I can use this idea.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.940
The number of words will equal
the number of letters that I

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.100
have in my alphabet, raised
to the power, number

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.800
of letters per word.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.510
OK?

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.320
So if I use this idea,
then I can say--

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.570
what if I have two-letter
words?

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:36.920
So in other words, to call out
an amino acid, I have to take

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.690
two base pairs in sequence.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.200
That means I'll have--

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.800
there's only four letters.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.080
But if I have two letters per
word, that's 16, which is

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.980
still less than 20, and that's
no good, because I

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.190
can only call 16.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.770
So what does nature do?

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.500
What if I had three-letter
words?

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.140
Three-letter words, then, is a
64, which is greater than 20,

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.710
and that works.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.550
So now I've got, in point
of fact, 61 of these

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.180
three-letter words.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.700
So I go down the sequence.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.290
First base pair, second base
pair, third base pair.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.210
That triad represents
one amino acid.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:24.930
I've got 61 to call out 20, And
I've got three left over.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.960
For what?

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.640
Well, let's think about this.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.730
See this?

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:35.960
How do you know to read this,
defined by their properties?

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.120
You know to read from
left to right.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.070
You know that there's a space
here between words.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.900
So if I just give you
this strand of

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.600
DNA, where do I begin?

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.730
Do I take these three, or
do I start counting

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.650
from here or here?

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.280
So built into this, it tells you
to read either from left

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.100
to right, or right to left.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.090
It tells you where to
start, and it tells

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.340
you where to stop.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.730
These three-letter words, by
the way, are called codons.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.670
So we've got sixty-one to call
out 20 amino acids, which

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.500
means, some amino acids have
more than one name.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.820
There's one of them that has
six different names.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.010
There's six different codons
that can call it

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:26.950
a given amino acid.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.530
For some of them it's only
one, for some it's

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.950
two, three, et cetera.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:30.240
OK.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.150
So that's the information.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.310
Look!

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.710
Here it is!

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.470
There's the information!

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.470
It's all in there.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.610
Just hydrogen bonds like this,
hydrogen bonds like this.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.720
It's all bonding.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.690
So here's the codon.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.060
So somewhere here, see, we take
this, this, and this.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.920
This triad represents one
piece of information.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.200
All right.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.770
So let's go back and look
at some of the history.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.190
Who got us to this point?

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.260
This is fresh!

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.640
A lot of this happened
in my lifetime.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:56.880
All right.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.810
So Oswald Avery--

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.060
this is before my lifetime.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:07.040
He was working at the
Rochester Institute.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.380
And he was the first
person-- he was

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.070
born in Halifax, actually.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.360
And he worked professionally
here in the United States.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.760
And he was the first person to
recognize that nucleic acids

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.970
store and transmit genetic
information.

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.960
Up until the 1940s, people
thought nucleic acids--

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.580
are you ready for this?--
are too complicated.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.160
Their structure was too
complex to contain

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.490
information.

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:32.550
It's precisely the complexity
that gives us the abundance of

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.460
information!

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.820
The prevailing belief was that
proteins contained the genetic

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.380
information.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.390
But people couldn't figure
out how to make it work.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:47.880
So he was the first to make the
argument that the nucleic

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.920
acids have the information.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.480
And then the second giant
is Erwin Chargaff.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.350
Erwin Chargaff worked at
Columbia in New York, and

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.760
hospitals in the vicinity.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.090
And he was a painstaking
analytical chemist. He did all

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.490
of this work by analytical
chemistry, and he gave us

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.360
Chargaff's Rules, 1949.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.820
And he said that in any
biological system, the

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.920
concentration of a--

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.010
remember, they didn't know
the structure of DNA yet.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.800
I'm going to lead up to how we
get to the structure of DNA.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.410
So we're going back, this is
like a flashback in a movie.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.480
Now we're going back to see
how we got to the double

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.820
helix, all right?

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.070
People knew that the
concentration of A in any

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.520
nucleic acid was equal to
the concentration of T.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.100
They knew that there were sugar
present, they knew there

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.980
were amines present,
and they knew there

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.860
were phosphates present.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.390
That's all they knew, based
on chemical analysis.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.770
And now he tells us that, of the
amines, concentration of A

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.930
always equals concentration of
T, concentration of G always

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.150
equals concentration of C.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.510
And then the sum of
concentration A plus G is the

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.910
sum of C plus T.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.290
That's Chargaff's rule.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:02.020
And so here we are,
Homo sapiens.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.940
31, 31, 19, 19, a little bit of

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.600
statistical error, et cetera.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.490
But look!

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.020
Corn!

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.980
Yes!

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.580
Corn reproduces using
this same code.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:18.180
All living organisms on this
planet use the same code.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.280
Which makes sense!

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.920
If I eat corn, and I'm going to
get nutrition from it, and

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.410
it's going to help me build
cells, and regenerate my body,

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:32.030
and get energy from it, it has
to be made of this same stuff,

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.580
otherwise my body can't
recognize it!

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.870
Because I'm a biological
machine.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.850
This is not a fireplace
in here, right?

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.630
If it's a fireplace, you
can drink something

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.790
combustible and boom!

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.000
You've got energy.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.950
But we can't derive energy from
something combustible.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.160
We can only derive energy from
something like this.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.280
So, you know, when you think
you're really hot stuff, your

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.390
DNA is not that different from
that of an ear of corn.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.480
So a little bit of humility
might be in order.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.900
All right.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.420
And then the last person
we want to talk

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.730
about is Rosalind Franklin.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.100
Rosalind Franklin worked at the
King's College in London,

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.870
and her specialty was
x-ray diffraction.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.490
And she made painstaking
experiments where she could

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:21.040
take a strand of DNA with a
stainless steel needle and

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.330
pull it out of an aqueous
solution, and hold it in a

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.140
chamber where the chamber was
humidified so that the DNA

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.550
didn't dry out.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.200
And while it was humidified in
this chamber, take an x-ray

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.800
diffraction exposure for hours,
because all of the

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.890
recording was done by film.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.470
By halide photography,
and you had to have

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.950
long exposure time.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.860
This is one of the most famous
images of the 20 century.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:52.510
This is the image of
the DNA from calf

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.660
thymus, the beta structure.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.490
And this is a Laue pattern.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.240
So the symmetry of this pattern
is reflective of the

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.740
symmetry in the DNA structure,
which people don't know yet.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.640
And what you see is
five positions.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.290
One, two, three, four, five.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.540
Four is missing.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.760
There's no reflection there.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.110
But it's where you would expect
a position to be.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.110
So it's sort of Bragg-like,
isn't it?

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.450
Not all of the lines
are reflecting.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:28.170
On the basis of this image,
this is what we learned.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:35.400
We learned, first of all, that
the Laue pattern is indicative

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.750
of a double helix.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.850
Based on X pattern.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.840
Remember, they had no computers
in those days!

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.700
All they had was a
pencil and paper.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.590
So to do the Fourier transform,
and go back out of

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.040
K-space, and discern what
the pattern is--

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.110
you know, today it's trivial!

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.560
They did this all longhand.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.640
Number two.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.270
On the basis of that pattern,
you learn that it's 3.4

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.615
angstroms between nucleotides
along the backbone.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.630
We don't know what
the backbone is!

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.150
We just know that there's
sugar, there's

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.230
amine, there's phosphate.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.610
There's different ways
of putting this

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.990
together to make a chain.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.300
And the third thing that you
learn, because the strong,

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.060
clear lines indicate
that the heaviest

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:36.910
elements must lie outboard.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.630
What does that mean?

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:46.440
If you've got a double helix,
based on the first finding,

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.490
what's the heaviest element?

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.650
Phosphorus.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.400
Because otherwise you've got
carbon, oxygen, nitrogen.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.810
Nitrogen is atomic mass 14.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.940
Phosphorus is atomic mass 30.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.950
So it must be outboard.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.770
Otherwise, if it were inboard,
there would be other elements

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.560
farther out, and you wouldn't
get the clear lines.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.500
Because the heavy elements are
the ones that give the

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.020
reflection, and if the heavy
elements are obscured by

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.270
lighter elements that are
shielding them, you get a

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.300
lousy reflections.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.596
Blunted reflections,
blurry reflections.

00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:24.290
So all of that comes out
of her findings.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:28.530
So what happens next?

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.250
So there's the 3.4, and 10,
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.820
All of that happens based
on the pattern that

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.070
I just showed you.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:41.210
So I'm going to read to you what
happens in those days,

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:46.750
back in the 1950s.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.030
There was intense competition.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:52.470
You know, Linus Pauling had
proposed a triple helix, and

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.410
people in the UK were working
hard on it, and so on.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.950
A lot of competition.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:02.210
So what happens is that Watson
goes down to King's College in

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.970
London, and he meets Rosalind
Franklin in the hallway, and

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.100
they get into a big argument.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.220
And she really chews him him
out, and he goes running away.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.430
She was very tough.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:17.550
And so he goes to Maurice
Wilkins, who was her boss.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.580
And I'm reading, now, from
Freeman Judson's book.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.560
"Wilkins told Watson as they
went down the hall that

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.710
Franklin had found that DNA
fibers, when kept wet, yielded

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.540
a different x-ray pattern,
suggesting a second structure.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.940
Fourteen months after the King's
colloquium, despite

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.590
repeated correspondence and
conversations, visits, meals

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.030
together between Wilkins,
Watson, and Crick, the

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.400
possibility of a second
structure was news to Watson,

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.340
he wrote."

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.320
Now, this is quoting
from Watson's own

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.270
book, The Double Helix.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.770
'When I asked what the pattern
was like, Maurice went into

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.370
the adjacent room to pick up a
print of the new form they

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.130
called the beta structure.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.400
The instant I saw the picture,
my mouth fell open, and my

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.920
pulse began to raise.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.470
The pattern was unbelievably
simpler than those obtained

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.410
previously, the a-form.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.280
Moreover, the black cross of
reflections which dominated

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.670
the picture could arise only
from a helical structure.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.000
With the a-form, the argument
for a helix was never

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.650
straightforward.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.650
With the b-form, however, mere
inspection of its x-ray

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.740
picture gave"--

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.810
listen to this-- "several of the
vital helical parameters."

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.860
I'm going to come
back to that.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.540
"The picture that Wilkins showed
Watson was Rosalind

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.330
Franklin's, without
her approval."

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:31.590
So then Watson goes on the train
back to Cambridge, and

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:36.090
sits down with Crick, and in
no time, they've put the

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.860
structure together.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.000
And this is a famous picture.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.620
This is Crick.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.490
This is Watson.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.230
And I don't know if you
can see really well.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.570
These are lab clamps
that they're using.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.710
This is a lab stand.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.380
They're using lab clamps to put
the structure together.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.556
So here's the paper.

00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:53.380
The paper as it comes
out, Molecular

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.120
Structure of Nucleic Acids.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.620
And this was the first
image of DNA.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.360
And I submit to you that if
the earth were to end in a

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.860
giant explosion, and we were to
only send two images in a

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.890
spaceship out to let some other
race discover what we're

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.320
all about, it would be
this image, and the

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.560
image of the atom.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.162
That's all you need.

00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:18.260
Because you have the simple
atom, and you've got this, and

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.070
everything else is just
detail in between.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.140
So there's the first image.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.620
All right.

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.800
"We wish to suggest a structure
for the salt of

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.140
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.560
The structure has novel
features which have

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.020
considerable biological
interest. The structure for

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.660
nucleic acid has already been
proposed by Pauling and Corey.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.000
They kindly made their
manuscript available to us in

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.810
advance."

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.720
These guys never made their
manuscripts available to Corey

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.240
and Pauling.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.610
"Their model consists of three
intertwined chains with the

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.080
phosphates near the fiber axis
and the bases on the outside."

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.360
See, they got the
positions wrong.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.450
"Without acidic--" da, da,
da, da, da, and so on.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.170
Whatever.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.080
Now here's--

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.550
remember, I've quoted
from Watson's book.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:06.240
"The previously published x-ray
data on deoxyribonucleic

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.280
acid are insufficient for
a rigorous test of our

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.830
structure."

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:10.600
Really?

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.490
"So far as we can tell, it is
roughly compatible with the

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.290
experimental data, but it must
be regarded as unproved until

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.590
it's been checked against some
more exact results."

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.570
Remember, he's writing this
after having seen Rosalind

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.980
Franklin's x-ray pattern.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.110
"Some of these are given in the
following communications."

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.670
Yeah, the next paper is Rosalind
Franklin's paper.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.930
"We were not aware of the
details of the results

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.930
presented there when we devised
our structure,--"

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.800
That's a lie.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.690
"--which rests mainly, though
not entirely, on published

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.670
experimental data and
stereochemical arguments."

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.190
You know what? once I've given
you the data, and you know

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.300
what the structure is, you can
give me a very, very strong

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.810
stereochemical argument.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.390
But that's hindsight.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.890
If you don't know what the
structure is, you have no idea

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.950
what the stereochemical
arguments are, because you can

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.590
justify anything.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.000
So this is just absolute lies.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.900
Who are the authors?

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.150
Watson and Crick, even though
it's based on data that was

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.880
taken from other people.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.470
So here they are.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.550
This is the acknowledgments.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.350
We're indebted to--
blah, blah, blah.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:14.990
The experimental results in
ideas of Wilkins, Rosalind

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.620
Franklin, and their coworkers
at King's College.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.870
And one of us, Jim Watson, he
was the American, and I think

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.760
there's an irony here, was aided
by a fellowship from the

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.200
National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.340
And I think there's a joke
there, if you know anything

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.540
about Jim Watson.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.230
And now contrast
that with this.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.990
This is the publication
of the human genome.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.790
And look at all the
names here.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:41.110
Everybody who was involved in
the enterprise was named.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.080
This is not the paper.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.190
This is just the names
of the authors.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.120
Now, to be literate, there's
this one phrase.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.210
Typical British understatement.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.330
Remember, this was about
the structure of DNA.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.580
But there's this passage.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.100
It has not escaped our notice.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.930
This is the litotes.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.160
Understatement, right?

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.810
"It has not escaped our notice
that the specific pairing we

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:08.890
have postulated immediately
suggests a possible copying

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.490
mechanism for the genetic
material."

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.780
That is the understatement
all time.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.620
We've got the structure of DNA,
and parenthetically, I

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.500
think this is how you direct
replication in all living

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.910
creatures, by the way.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.380
So when this paper
was published.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.150
and they rolled out
the human genome

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.630
as a sort of a literary--

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:34.880
what's the word--

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.670
allusion, thank you.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.690
The literary allusion was--
there's a passage in this

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.930
paper that at one point begins
"It has not escaped our

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.300
noticed," da, da, da, da.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.160
So if you're ever with some
Course 7 people, and you want

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.420
to really get under their skin,
you know, you could be

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.280
at a party or something, and
finally, you say you know,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.680
it's not escaped my notice.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.870
And they know what
you're saying.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.345
It'll make you less popular
then you are now.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.660
So let's fast forward.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.200
This is Stockholm, December
10, 1962,

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.750
the Nobel Prize ceremony.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.110
Here is the King of Sweden.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.610
This is Francis Crick.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.860
This is James Watson.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.040
This is Maurice Wilkins.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.420
No Rosalind Franklin.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.540
This is Kendrew, and I'm
drawing a blank.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.290
These two guys were getting the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.730
for hemoglobin structure.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.580
This, if you look carefully, is
John Steinbeck, getting the

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.830
Nobel Prize in Literature.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.550
Over in Oslo is Linus Pauling,
getting his second Nobel

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.930
Prize, but for peace.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.450
So ironically, he's getting
his Nobel Prize.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.270
They're getting the Nobel Prize
not in Chemistry, not in

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.340
Physics, but in Medicine.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.370
You know, what's medicine?

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.520
I mean it's not really
a science.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.830
But anyway.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:54.620
Here it is.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.100
It's worthy of a Nobel Prize.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.470
So what really happened here?

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:00.460
What really happened?

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.230
Why was there no Rosalind
Franklin?

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.320
She was marginalized
as a woman.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.670
She was mistreated
by these men.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:09.230
It was 1955.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:10.400
You realize in the 1950s--

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.500
and I'm not talking about the
England of Charles Dickens.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.260
I'm talking about the England
after World War II.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.840
Women were not allowed
in the common room.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.940
And the common room
is where everybody

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.400
congregates at 4:00 p.m.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.350
to drink coffee and
exchange ideas.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.650
So she couldn't go into the
common room and so on.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:31.670
And it was just a terrible,
terrible story of misuse, of

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:34.490
information, lack of
attribution, and so on.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:37.450
If this story were unfolded
today, I guarantee you these

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.260
guys would not be getting a
prize, and in fact, the

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.120
publication would probably be
rescinded on the grounds of

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.450
its fraudulent claims, that
they were unaware of the

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.480
previous information.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.220
So after the paper was
published, she was so

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.100
brokenhearted that she resigned
her position at

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.800
King's College, and took a job
at another college in London.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.630
Her terms of severance included
her signing a

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:09.040
document in which she agreed to
abandon all future work in

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.290
biochemistry.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.650
I mean, imagine that you leave
your job, and they tell you

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.590
what you cannot do!

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.440
I mean, obviously, if you were
privy to intellectual property

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.880
and so on, you're bound
by confidentiality.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.450
But no one can tell you, you
can't go to work for somebody!

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:30.650
And so she changed fields, and
made seminal discoveries in

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:35.390
two other fields outside
of the DNA work.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.080
So why isn't she here?

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.070
She died of cancer in
1958, very young.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.460
And you can't get the Nobel
Prize posthumously.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.530
So some people are quite
outraged by this story.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.820
But there's a symbolism
here to have Wilkins.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.580
It's basically saying that
you two guys are not

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.450
the authors of this.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.190
And so some people say that
Wilkins is standing in for

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.370
Rosalind Franklin, and the
Nobel committee at least

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.490
acknowledged that.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.630
So what's the message here?

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:08.220
The message here is, I hope
nobody in 3.091 is ever

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.400
embroiled in a controversy
like this.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.150
We have to acknowledge
our collaborators.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:17.390
All of us are here because
somebody helped us.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.830
Don't go away.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.060
You haven't been
dismissed yet.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:20.970
This is important.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:21.950
What I'm telling
you is far more

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.700
important than that structure.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.150
I'm telling you how to
stay out of jail.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.680
See, here, you know, 50 years
ago, you cheat and steal, you

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.700
get a Nobel Prize.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.020
Today you go to jail.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.470
It is a Nobel Prize
in Medicine,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.840
of course, but anyway.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.750
So this is a book, if you're
interested in Rosalind

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.710
Franklin's story, it's
fantastic reading.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.960
Real page-turner.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.360
This is James Watson's book.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.050
If you read this, you know,
have your you-know-what

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.620
sensors on all the time.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.240
And here's a picture of
Rosalind Franklin

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.870
on vacation in France.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:59.070
And we'll leave with The Twist
by Hank Ballard, who was

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.150
another person who
was marginalized,

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.520
because he was black!

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.740
And so you couldn't listen to
this music, and so there was a

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.500
cover made.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.520
The version of The Twist that
you have heard is probably by

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.200
Chubby Checker.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.320
This is the original one
by Hank Ballard.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.620
It's gritty.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.530
It's very gritty.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:15.900
All right.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.320
Treat each other well.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.950
Get out of here.
