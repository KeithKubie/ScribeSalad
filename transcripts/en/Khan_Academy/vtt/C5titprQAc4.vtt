00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.070
- [Instructor] We are
asked what is the value

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.100
of the 100th term in this sequence,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.440
and the first term is 15, then nine,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.730
then three, then negative three.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.910
So let's write it like this in a table.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.670
So if we have the term,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.040
just so we have things straight,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.180
and then we have the value,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.890
and then we have the value of the term.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.360
I'll do a nice little table here.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.870
So our first term we saw is 15.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.830
Our second term is nine.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.440
Our third term is three.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm just really copying this down,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.770
but I'm making sure we associate
it with the right term.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.890
And then our fourth term,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.600
our fourth term is negative three.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.570
And they wanna ask,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.820
they want us to figure
out what the 100th term

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.800
of this sequence is going to be.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.120
So let's see what's happening here,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.010
if we can discern some type of pattern.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.940
So we went from the first
term to the second term,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.880
what happened?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.780
15 to nine, looks like
we went down by six.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.880
It's always good to
think about just how much

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.010
the numbers changed by.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.020
That's always the
simplest type of pattern.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.150
So we went down by six, we subtracted six.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.920
Then to go from nine to three,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.994
well we subtracted six again.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:12.770
We subtracted six again.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.079
And then to go from
three to negative three,

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.480
well we, we subtracted six again.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.840
We subtracted six again.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.920
So it looks like every term,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.660
you subtract six.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.280
So the second term is going to be six less

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.113
than the first term.

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:31.867
The third term is going to be

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:34.940
12 minus from the first term,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.870
or six subtracted twice.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.830
So in the third term,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.160
you subtract a six twice.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.550
In the fourth term,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.850
you subtract six three times.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.100
So whatever term you're looking at,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.680
you subtract six one less
than that many times.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.600
Let me write this down just so,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.630
notice when your first term,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.310
you have 15 and you don't
subtract six at all,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.590
or you could say you
subtract six zero times.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.090
So you could say this is 15 minus

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.240
six times or let me
write it better this way,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.950
minus zero times six.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.060
That's what that first
term is right there.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.620
What's the second term?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.440
This is 15,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.760
it's just we just subtracted six once,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.070
or you could say minus one times six.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.930
Or you could say plus
one times negative six,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.770
either way, we're
subtracting the six once.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.420
Now what's happening here?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.300
This is 15,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.080
this is 15

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.490
minus two times negative six,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.364
or sorry minus two times six,

00:02:41.364 --> 00:02:43.960
minus two times six.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.470
We're subtracting a six twice.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.060
What's the fourth term?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.050
This is 15 minus,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.680
we're subtracting the six
three times from the 15,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.980
so minus three times six.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.520
So if you see the pattern here,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.230
when our term, when we
have our fourth term,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.030
we have the term minus one right there,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.560
the fourth term we have a three,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.741
the third term we have a two,

00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:11.900
the second term we have a one.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.340
So if we had the nth term,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.410
if we just had the nth term here,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.470
what's this going to be?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.970
It's going to be 15

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.430
minus, you see it's going to
be n minus one right here,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.090
right when n is four,
n minus one is three.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.200
When n is three, n minus one is two.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.250
When n is two, n minus one is one.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.080
When n is one, n minus one is zero.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.300
So we're going to have,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.510
this term right here is n minus one,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.410
so minus n minus one times six.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.300
So if you wanna figure out the
100th term of this sequence,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.130
I didn't even have to write
it in this general term,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.530
you could just look at this pattern.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.620
It's going to be, and I'll do it in pink,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.300
the 100th term in our sequence,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.740
I'll continue our table
down, is gonna be what?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.680
It's going to be 15 minus

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.570
100 minus one, which is 99,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.730
times six, right?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.050
I just followed the pattern.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.550
One, you had a zero here,
two, you had a one here,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.830
three, you had a two here,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.970
100, you're gonna have a 99 here.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.150
So let's just calculate what this is.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
What's 99 times six?

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.470
So 99 times six,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.770
actually you could do this in your head.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.110
You could say that's going to be six less

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.940
than 100 times six, which is 600,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.550
and six less is 594.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.810
But if you didn't wanna do it that way,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.400
you just do it the old-fashioned way.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.330
Six times nine is 54, carry the five.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.291
Nine times six or six times nine is 54.

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:46.053
54 plus five is 594.

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.940
So this right here

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.660
is 594,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.320
and then to figure out what 15,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.940
so we wanna figure out,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.113
we wanna figure out what 15 minus 594 is,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.620
and this can sometimes be confusing,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.090
but the way I always
process this in my head

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.540
is I say that this is the exact same thing

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.270
as the negative

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.000
of 594 minus 15.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.270
And if you don't believe me,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.010
distribute out this negative sign.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.670
Negative one times 594 is negative 594,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.010
negative one times
negative 15 is positive 15.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.990
So these two statements are equivalent.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.240
This is much easier for
my brain to understand.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.620
So what's 594 minus 15?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.230
You should do it, we
could do this in our head.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.900
594 minus 14 would be 580,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.900
and then 580 minus one more would be 579.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.920
So that right there is 579,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.000
and then we have this negative
sign sitting out there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.250
So our the 100th term in our sequence

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.963
will be negative 579.
