sort of you know the prototype you know

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
sort of you know the prototype you know
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829
sort of you know the prototype you know
that's the thing that it really shoot

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
that's the thing that it really shoot
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689
that's the thing that it really shoot
for Moore's law but nobody ever keeps up

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
for Moore's law but nobody ever keeps up
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.429
for Moore's law but nobody ever keeps up

industry so it's saying we actually

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
industry so it's saying we actually
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.710

track and have been tracking really you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

cost for DNA sequencing and trying our
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.479
cost for DNA sequencing and trying our
best to keep up with Moore's law and we

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
best to keep up with Moore's law and we
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280
best to keep up with Moore's law and we
actually we actually did keep up with

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
actually we actually did keep up with
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.370
actually we actually did keep up with
Moore's law really quite effectively

near the end of the genome project and
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880
near the end of the genome project and
even in a number of years about four or

even in a number of years about four or
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500

using the old-fashioned method that we

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
using the old-fashioned method that we
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600
using the old-fashioned method that we
used to use for DNA sequencing but we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
used to use for DNA sequencing but we
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299
used to use for DNA sequencing but we
had sufficiently industrialized those

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
had sufficiently industrialized those
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279
had sufficiently industrialized those
methods it had actually allowed us to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
methods it had actually allowed us to
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590
methods it had actually allowed us to
keep up with Moore's law and then what

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
keep up with Moore's law and then what
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.590
keep up with Moore's law and then what
happened about 2007 our major groups

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
happened about 2007 our major groups
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750
happened about 2007 our major groups
switched over to these fancy new methods

and just continued to do it up to the
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660
and just continued to do it up to the
present time they outstrip Moore's law

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
present time they outstrip Moore's law
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330
present time they outstrip Moore's law
by far and it's really been truly

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
by far and it's really been truly
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
by far and it's really been truly
remarkable the cost of DNA sequencing

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
remarkable the cost of DNA sequencing
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280

completed ten years ago cost a billion
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920
completed ten years ago cost a billion
dollars and now we can sequence a human

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
dollars and now we can sequence a human
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469

and it costs well under $10,000 really

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
and it costs well under $10,000 really
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.760
and it costs well under $10,000 really
just a few thousand dollars and if you

and lipid bilayers and the strands of
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760
and lipid bilayers and the strands of
DNA sort of get pulled through it and

just way cool but what's particularly

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020
just way cool but what's particularly
 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.770
just way cool but what's particularly
cool about it is that that technologies

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
cool about it is that that technologies
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.160
cool about it is that that technologies
are can be reduced to really small form

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170

not science fiction to believe that we

or two or three one of the things I
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.330
or two or three one of the things I
think is particularly cool with this

that the USB device that will sequence a
 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.580
that the USB device that will sequence a
