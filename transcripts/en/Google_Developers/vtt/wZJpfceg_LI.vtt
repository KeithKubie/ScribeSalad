00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.310
Jaampr is a social network
to connect the people

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.910
with activities around
them in real-time.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.140
When we started, we didn't
have money or investment.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.570
For this reason, we only can
work a few hours per day.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.740
In this video, I want to
show you five libraries

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.900
to make your life happier.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.870
The Android Social
Network Library

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.180
can help us to
find users faster.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.040
We use a library to connect our
application with other social

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.650
networks like Twitter,
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.370
That is useful to import
friends or followers

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.300
for other social networks.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.390
We wanted to
[INAUDIBLE] something,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.030
but we didn't want
to lose our good look

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.920
and our good performance.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.460
We didn't want to spend
time making graphic designs.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.150
And we used Material
Design in our application

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.140
and still keep compatibility
with previous version

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.730
of Android Lollipop.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.990
With a few lines of
code, we code activities.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.650
We create socket connection
using a library of Socket.IO

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.920
for Android to create
faster connection

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.190
with our server in real-time.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.080
We send requests
to our server using

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.960
Volley library and download
image with Picasso library.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.780
With Volley library, we can
send objects, texts, and images

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.670
to our server.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.510
And with Picasso library,
we can manage image caches

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.250
in our application.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.600
With this library, we win more
time to develop our business.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.565
What is really important--
launch prototype fast,

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:54.800
reuse code, and win
happier developers.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.350
