00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in fifth grade I used to make paper airplanes

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.020
with my best friend Tim. Now we took two different approaches.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
You see I would read books and try to figure out the best way to make a paper airplane based on

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.080
other people's experience, and Tim would take the time and build them himself.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Now, the results were pretty interesting. Tim was always better than I was.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.150
Now I chalk that up to the fact that I believe I had a knowledge of how to build

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.200
paper airplanes but Tim actually had an understanding of it. So today,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.220
I'm gonna take you to Germany. I've found an academic club there that not only focuses

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.240
on the knowledge of how these things work, but they actually put it into practice and gain

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.250
an understanding. So today we're gonna start a two part video series. First of all I'm gonna

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.280
show you how to launch a glider, and then in a later video I'm gonna show you what it's like

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.310
in the cockpit with us. I'm Destin, let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.360
[music]

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.450
(Destin) The wings are taped on huh?
- Yep.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.470
It gets pretty noisy if you don't tape it, and it helps

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.990
for the airflow.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.520
- OK so gliding in a huge game of balancing your energy. You go from kinetic

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.550
energy to potential energy and back and forth again.
- OK?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.570
[music]

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.160
OK there's two ways to get potential energy into the system. The first one

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.170
is an airplane, and the second way is a winch, and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
Katarina? Katarina is operating the winch.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
OK this is absolute genious. You pull the glider

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.240
from way down there..

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.270
with this winch.
[German voice on radio]

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.380
[Large diesel engine starting]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.980
[Engine slowly revving up]

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.440
(Destin) Oh. Oooh wow. Oh are you serious?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.460
That is amazing.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.530
[rushing air]
[cockpit warning beeps]

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.600
[levers being pulled]

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.670
[engine running]

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.700
So she's pulling the rope in as it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.750
falls with a parachute so there's no slack.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.850
[engine stops]
(Destin) Perfect.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.880
- No, [unintelligible]
- You're very good at this.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.820
Ya?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.950
- Um. This is on the plane, and then when now it starts

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.980
this and when the winkel?
- Yeah Yeah.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.030
- Then it falls out automatically.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.050
- And then that makes the parachute operate.
- Yeah,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.090
and the parachute is that it doesn't fall that fast.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.130
- Your job is very important.
- Yeah, of course. [laugh]

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.150
Otherwise the sailplanes cannot start.
- Yeah.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.170
So, when I outfitted the gliders with different camera views the point was to learn.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.190
So these are all students and we're looking at all the different videos to make sure we

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.200
did everything correctly. And they're trying to learn what they did wrong, what they can

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.240
do better next time, playing with efficiencies and drag and things like that. So it's

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.250
really fun. Anyway, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Please subscribe.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.570
(together) Welcome to Germany. We're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.300
(Destin) And we're going to a disco party in our glider. [laugh]

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.330
Is it really tradition to wear a hat like this or are you guys just making fun of me?

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.340
OK if you want more information about gliders in Germany

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.380
you need to talk to this lady, Florentina, here in Germany,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.420
so how can we contact you? What's your group name?
- You could contact us on our home page.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.430
It's the academic gliding group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.460
- This is now the black forest.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.460
(Destin) You made it smaller. 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.500
Ein, zwei, drei!

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.520
[laugh]

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.050
It's in the tree!
