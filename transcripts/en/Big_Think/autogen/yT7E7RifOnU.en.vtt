now it turns out that extremely heavy

what we do is we bombard heavy ions

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
what we do is we bombard heavy ions
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.599
what we do is we bombard heavy ions
together to give a tremendous

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609
together to give a tremendous
 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.710
together to give a tremendous
conglomeration of protons and neutrons

which then fly apart and then we run the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
which then fly apart and then we run the
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330
which then fly apart and then we run the
videotape backwards we take all the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
videotape backwards we take all the
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370
videotape backwards we take all the
fragments put them back together again

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
fragments put them back together again
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.280
fragments put them back together again
and see whether or not for an instant of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
and see whether or not for an instant of
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670
and see whether or not for an instant of
time a heavy element existed inside the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
time a heavy element existed inside the
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590
time a heavy element existed inside the
atom smasher that's a very tricky

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
atom smasher that's a very tricky
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.470
atom smasher that's a very tricky
business because many kinds of false

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
business because many kinds of false
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.959
business because many kinds of false
bumps can occur in the data and one of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
bumps can occur in the data and one of
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.119
bumps can occur in the data and one of
them may actually correspond to a new

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
them may actually correspond to a new
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.810
them may actually correspond to a new
form of heavy elements there is a theory

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
form of heavy elements there is a theory
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090
form of heavy elements there is a theory
that says that if you bombard heavier

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
that says that if you bombard heavier
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549
that says that if you bombard heavier
and heavier ions together sooner or

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
and heavier ions together sooner or
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399
and heavier ions together sooner or
later you get an island of stability a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
later you get an island of stability a
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219
later you get an island of stability a
plateau where we would get stable matter

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
plateau where we would get stable matter
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.980
plateau where we would get stable matter
we're quite far from achieving that so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
we're quite far from achieving that so
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289
we're quite far from achieving that so
in the short term it means that there's

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
in the short term it means that there's
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390
in the short term it means that there's
going to be more and more debate more

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
going to be more and more debate more
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160
going to be more and more debate more
and more controversy as to what

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
and more controversy as to what
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100
and more controversy as to what
constitutes a heavy element given the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
constitutes a heavy element given the
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140
constitutes a heavy element given the
fact that it only exists for a brief

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
fact that it only exists for a brief
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690
fact that it only exists for a brief
fraction of a second did it or did it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
fraction of a second did it or did it
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.390
fraction of a second did it or did it
not even exist at all that's why it took

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
not even exist at all that's why it took
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.230
not even exist at all that's why it took
so long to verify 114 and 116

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
