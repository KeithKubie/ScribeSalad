00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.550
So let us try our hand at computing
some reliability and availability.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.450
Suppose that the system we
are considering is just a hard disk.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.600
And this disk, we buy it.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.200
We put it in our machine and
now, it works fine for

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
12 months and then it breaks
because it cannot spin any more.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.810
And then it takes us one month to
replace the motor in the disk.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
And after that fix,
it works fine for about four months.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.280
And then it breaks again and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.910
we find that the problem is
that it can not move heads, and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.580
it took us two months to figure that
out and then get the heads unstuck.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.500
And now the disc works fine for
14 months.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.780
And then it breaks.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.100
And we find that the head has broken.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.510
And we find this quickly but

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.340
then realize it will take
us 3 months to fix it.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.720
So we throw this disk away and
buy a new one.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.913
So the questions for you are,
what is the MTTF for this disk,

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:57.720
what is the MTTR for this disk, and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.770
what is the availability of this
disk expressed as a percentage?
