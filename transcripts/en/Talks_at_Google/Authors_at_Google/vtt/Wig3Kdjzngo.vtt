her book Forget Perfect was featured on the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.039
Today Show and on NBC Nightly News.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.770
Lisa writes leadershipcommunityreport.com
and for major news outlets such as Fortune

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.620
and The Wall Street Journal and this is Lisa.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.620
So would you like to take it away?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.620
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Thanks, thanks.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.620
Well I'm so glad to be here with you all today.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.782
The title of my talk is How to Sell with Noble
Purpose, and so I'm gonna give you the big

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.610
idea at the very front end.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
And the idea is this: the salespeople who
sell with a sense of higher purpose, that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.780
is the salespeople who are what I call the
true believers, who believe not only in their

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.370
products but who also believe in the impact
that they have on their customers, that they

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.339
make a difference in the lives of their customers,
those salespeople outperform the salespeople

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.760
who are just focused on their quotas or the
money.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.630
And these words selling and noble, a lot of
people don't think that they go together,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.040
in fact, a lot of people think that sales
is anything but noble and when you call someone

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.730
"salesy" it's not really a compliment [chuckles]
in most cases.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.030
But I'm here to tell you that they're wrong,
because when they talk about sales from that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.990
perspective they're really just talking about
the number side, the quota side, the spreadsheet

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
side.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.460
And so what I'm wanna talk to you about is
the whole other side of sales.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.160
And so I wanna share with you the research
I've done and the results of the research

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.820
I've done for the last 10 years that prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that when you have

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.950
a larger purpose, when you're part of something
that's bigger than you are, when you know

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.030
that what you're doing makes a difference,
you're more effective, you're more assertive,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.640
you're most successful, and you're also happier.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640
[pause]

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
And nowhere is this more important than in
sales, because the reality of sales is you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.330
may have a target, a quota, whatever language
you use, that connects with your head.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.650
But when you have a sense of a higher purpose
it connects with your heart which is where

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.450
your passion lies.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.330
So I'm gonna make you three promises for today,
I hear a motorcycle revving up [bad audio]

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.930
in the background [laughs].

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.930
[laughter]

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.280
I'm gonna make you three promises for today:
number one I'm gonna show you how you can

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.790
bring a sense of purpose and passion to your
job, how you can fall in love with your job;

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.700
number two I'm gonna show you how you can
bring that sense of purpose to your customers,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.230
to get your customers more engaged; and number
three how you can bring it to the other areas

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.520
of your life and the people that you care
about.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.660
So we got about an hour together, we're gonna
make the most of it.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.260
So here's what I want you to do: we're gonna
start off with an exercise.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.080
So what I want you to do is each of you pick
a partner and I want you to pretend that you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.340
are at a cocktail party or a soccer game whichever
one you would be more likely to be at and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.510
you've been introduced to another person and
they ask that question that they always ask,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.400
"What do you do for a living?"

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.760
And I just want you to very briefly describe
what you do and then switch.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760
OK?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.610
So just do that, don't think about it much,
just answer the question the way you'd ordinarily

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.250
answer the question.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:46.209
[people speaking to each other in background]

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.520
[pause]

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.410
Hey come on in, you're good.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.720
Uh-hum.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
I'm Lisa.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible] How do you do?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Hi, nice to meet you.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720
Go ahead and have a seat.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720
[pause]

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.720
They're doin' an exercise right now where
I asked them to, no you're good, you're good,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720
yeah 'cause you're lucky you get to do it
with me now.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720
&gt;&gt;male #1: [laughs]

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Imagine, and I'll explain
the background on this in a little bit, we're

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.650
talking about how to show up for your customers
with purpose.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.320
So what I want you to do is I want you to
just imagine we're at, we just met, which

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.000
we did, and I say, "What do you do for a living?"

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.400
And just tell me what you do for a living,
what's your job?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.820
Just answer the way your ordinarily would.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.820
What do you do for a living?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.820
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.820
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: You're a programmer.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.820
Oh where do you work?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.820
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.820
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay, like what?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.820
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.820
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay, so you're a programmer
and it's secret.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.160
Okay, I got it, that's good, that's all I
need to know.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160
[laughs]

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
[laughter]

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.190
And they're takin' turns.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.470
So, okay, so we're good, so pop up your computer
if you wanna take notes on that and we're

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.470
good.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.470
[pause]

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.080
So did you have a chance to do that?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.020
I want you to remember what that felt like
when you said it and I want you to remember

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.990
what it felt like when you heard it.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.430
Chances are you probably had a pretty automatic
response didn't you 'cause that's a question

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.080
that we're used to be asked, "What do you
do for a living?"

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.870
You guys probably get a better response than
most people because you say, "I work at Google,"

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.240
and then they go, "Wow, that's really cool,
wow."

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.240
But typically we have a pretty rote response
when it comes to these things.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.210
So I want you to remember how that felt and
we're gonna come back to that.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.320
So now I wanna talk to you about this idea
of selling with noble purpose and how that's

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.690
different than the way a lot of people sell.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.330
Now I'm gonna give you a little bit of background
and tell you I am a total nerd about these

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.330
things.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.230
I have been studying sales organizations for
over 20 years in a quest to figure out why

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.600
some people are good and some people are absolutely
amazing, and I wanted to figure out that difference

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.139
so I've been doin' this for a long time.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.560
So I'm really nerdy but this, about the data
and about behavior and all that stuff, so

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.900
I'm just giving you that disclaimer on the
front end.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.580
So when was 19 years old I had my first sales
job and I sold advertising for the college

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.980
paper and as I said I know you guys sell advertising,
but I sold it when it came in this paper form

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.980
like that.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.250
So I sold advertising and then I was the sales
manager for the college newspaper.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.800
And when I was 20 years old I was the sales
manager and our college newspaper sold a million

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.120
dollars worth of advertising in one year.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.550
Now I know that's nothing compared to what
you all sell, but for a college newspaper

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.580
that is a lot of money [chuckles] that is
like an unheard of amount of money.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.710
So clearly I was on fire for sales.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.410
So after college I went to work for Proctor
&amp; Gamble, I was a salesperson there, won some

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.020
sales awards, was the sales manager, and was
the sales trainer.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.360
But I left Proctor &amp; Gamble, big fancy Proctor
&amp; Gamble, multi-national company.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.060
I left there and I went to work for a sales
training company, and it was this little speck

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.350
of a sales training company, it was a six
million dollar company compared to Proctor

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.250
&amp; Gamble, so obviously very small.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.820
But I went to go work there because I really
believed in what they were doing.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.820
[pause]

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.060
And so I went to go work, I was in business
development; I was in charge of business development.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.070
So the first year brought in a million dollars
worth of new business, second year brought

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.199
in another million dollars worth of new business.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.320
And so a six million dollar company to bring
in a million dollars in new business two years

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.712
in a row is like a big deal, especially a
training company where the margins are like

00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:16.770
40 percent.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.009
So I really liked it and I was a believer,
I believed in our programs, but there was

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:28.259
always something missing 'cause we'd go and
we'd do these programs, the sales people would

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:35.100
learn the skills, and inevitably there would
be one small group of people that would outperform

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.150
the other people, there would always be those
outliers.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.900
And so I thought, "Something's missing.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.419
I wanna know what this is."

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.710
So I started my own company, was doing a lot
of consulting work around the area of sales

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.060
leadership, and what I wanna tell you about
it a project that I worked on and that had

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.069
a profound experience on my life, the way
I think about sales, and the way I think about

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.430
sales leadership.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.110
So I was hired, a group of consultants was
hired by this biotech company, this big biotech

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.610
company had sales reps all over the world
and they wanted to know the same thing a lot

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.710
of companies wanna know, same thing I wanna
know, what's the difference between the people

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.830
that are good at the jobs and people who are
absolutely amazing in terms of sales numbers?

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.660
So they hired this group of consultants and
we were gonna go out and we were gonna assess

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.110
the salespeople; we were gonna ride with 'em,
follow their calls, do interviews, we did

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.289
a whole host of things.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:31.710
And I should tell you this was a double blind
study in the sense that we didn't know who

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:37.320
the top performers were, we were just looking
at the behavior and this was fascinating.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.510
So there's a lot of ways that you can look
at sales behavior and I'll show a couple of

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.500
'em now and these are some pretty basic ways.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.910
When you take a look at sales behavior –

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.510
[sound of papers being shuffled]

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.080
one thing a lot of people look at is –

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.530
[pause]

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.550
customer knowledge and product knowledge,
and this is pretty easy to understand.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.550
Think about a salesperson --

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.820
[pause]

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.040
if you're low on the customer knowledge, low
on the product knowledge how do you think

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.070
these people perform?

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.070
They're terrible.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.820
This is not rocket science, they're terrible.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.540
Then we have salespeople who are high on customer
knowledge or high on product knowledge rather,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.540
but low on customer knowledge.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.360
What kinds of behavior do you think you see
from those salespeople?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.580
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.200
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.200
Um-hum.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.460
Here's my product, here's my product, here's
my goal, here's my number.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.940
Then we have salespeople who may be very high
on customer knowledge, these are more rare,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.070
but low on product knowledge.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.490
What do you think happens there?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.100
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: [inaudible]

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.010
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um, sometimes, sometimes.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.360
A lot of times these people have trouble closing
the deal 'cause they don't have the technical

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360
expertise.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.310
And then we have the obvious: people who are
high on customer knowledge, high on product

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.459
knowledge and those are the people who are
really, really good at their jobs.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:10:01.899
And as we looked at that what I realized is
a couple of those people were a lot better;

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:05.471
they didn't necessarily have more customer
knowledge and they didn't necessarily have

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:10.630
more product knowledge, but when we observed
their sales calls the calls were a lot better.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:16.230
So again what was that thing, what was that
thing that made them different?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.230
So then –

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.550
[sound of papers being shuffled]

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.480
another typical way, call frequency and call
length.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.390
People that don't make many sales calls and
the ones they make are short, generally get

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.970
fired pretty fast, right?

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.490
What about the salespeople that make lots
and lots of sales calls but the calls are

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.130
relatively short, they don't engage a customer
in much of a dialog?

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.730
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: [inaudible]

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.910
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: That's okay, depends
on what you sell, it's kinda that spray and

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.540
pray, and I'm gonna talk to you and I'm gonna
talk to you, and I'm gonna talk to you and

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.110
if I'm persistent enough it's a numbers game,
I'll probably eventually sell something.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.241
And then you have salespeople that have really
long calls with their customers, really in

00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:55.930
depth conversations but they don't make that
many calls.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.700
So high close rate with the people they do
call on, the problem is they just don't call

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.040
on enough people.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.600
And so then you have these people.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.769
[pause]

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:12.529
They always make a lot of calls and they're
significant calls, they're of a length enough

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:14.300
to get some depth with the customer.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.800
So we looked at that and of course those were
the people who had really great sales calls,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.510
but again there were a couple people in there
makin' just as many calls as the other people

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.500
that made a lot of calls, calls were just
as long as the other people, but yet there

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.190
were a couple people the calls were just different,
they just felt different, there was that thing,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.330
that thing again.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.610
What was that thing?

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.660
So we were getting close to the end of the
project and I was with this one sales rep

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.030
and this had a transformational effect on
me.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.029
I was with this one sales rep and I should
tell you I've been doing ride-alongs with

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.839
sales reps for a long time so I added it up
the other day it was some amazing amount where

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:57.900
I'd been on like a thousand sales calls or
some unbelievable number like that.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.500
So I'm with this one sales rep, I spent two
days with her, did the usual where we're coding.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.570
How many questions do they ask?

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.700
How long are they with the customer?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.660
How many calls do they make?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.480
We also did these one on one interviews where
we asked 'em all these questions.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.410
And this rep was just amazing.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.339
Like I said I've been with a lot of sales
reps and she was amazing.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:21.450
And again I don't know what her numbers looked
like but I know an awesome, kick butt sales

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.040
rep when I'm with one and she was one of those.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.360
So at the end of this two days with her we're
at the airport in Phoenix, Arizona, and oh

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.330
by the way just as an aside, if you ever go
out to work with a salesperson or you're making

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.410
calls yourself, July in Phoenix is not a time
when you wanna be getting in and out of your

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.680
car 12 times in a given day much less two
days in a row.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.680
I'm just saying.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.430
So that's just my little tip to you.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.860
So we've had this two days getting in and
out of the car in July in Phoenix, but she's

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.649
a rock star sales rep.

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:56.810
So I'm sitting in the car with her and I thought,
"I'm gonna ask her a question, I'm gonna ask

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.640
her a question I haven't asked anybody else."

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:07.030
So I said, "What do you think about when you
go on sales calls?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.880
What's in your brain?"

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.269
So she kind of looks, now we're in the car
at the airport so I don't know why she thinks

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:20.540
it's like this big secret, kinda looks conspiratorial
and she goes, "Well," like someone's gonna

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:26.649
hear us, "I don't tell many people this but
I'll tell you.

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:31.550
Something happened to me when I was first
in this job, I'd been in it a couple of months,"

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:37.570
and she said, "I was in one of my doctor's
offices and," this particular company sold

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:44.240
a drug that handled a lot of the conditions
associated with arthritis so she was calling

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.110
on a rheumatologist.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.910
And so she said, "So I'm in one of my doctor's
offices and of course there's all the doctors

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.980
and nurses dressed in their uniforms, there's
all the patients and they don't look very

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.550
good and I'm there in a suit with my name
badge on so I kind of stand out."

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:03.779
She said, "So I'm in the hall and I'm talking
to the doctor and this elderly woman comes

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:11.930
up to me and taps me and she says, 'Excuse
me miss are you the rep for this drug?'"

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.520
And she said, "Yes ma'am I am."

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.520
She said, "The woman looked at me and said,
'I just wanna thank you.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.130
Because of you I have a life.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.130
[pause]

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:30.550
This doctor prescribed that to me and now
I can travel, I can get down on the floor

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.010
with my grandkids and play with them.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.160
You gave me my life back and I wanna thank
you.'"

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:44.339
And she said, "I realized right then and there
my job matters."

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:50.250
She said, "So I think about that grandmother
every single day when I go to work, when it's

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.649
hard to get into the doctor's office, when
I'm havin' all kinds of issues with insurance

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:58.850
companies, when the nurses are too busy,"
she says, "I always know my job is to help

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:06.690
people like her and that's my higher purpose
and that's why I'm here."

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.690
[pause]

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.690
Wow!

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.850
So I get on the plane, go home, fly from Phoenix
to Atlanta so I have plenty of time to think

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:19.350
and this just sat with me and I thought, like
I said I mean I worked with hundreds and hundreds

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.180
of reps and thousands of sales calls, but
this really set with me because I hadn't heard

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.880
anybody speak exactly that way before.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.600
And so I thought about it and I thought about
this sense of purpose.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.839
And so I went back to the transcripts from
the other interviews and I thought, "I wonder

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.100
if anybody else talked about this."

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.930
And so when I first looked through the transcripts
I didn't see anything, I didn't see it.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:44.339
But then when I looked closer, then when I
looked closer, a little deeper in the anecdotal

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:47.630
comments it was there, it was completely there.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.839
It was there with the salesperson that said,
"You know what my dad was a doctor, their

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.600
jobs are hard, I wanna make it easier."

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.720
It was there with the salespeople that said,
"I wanna help these nurses, I wanna help these

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.550
patients, I think about that a lot, it's important."

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.130
And so I looked through and I thought, "Yeah
there it is, yeah there it is."

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.279
And so at the end of the study the biotech
company came to us and they said, "We want

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:15.550
you to identify who do you think," keep in
mind we don't know the numbers of these sales

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.450
people all we saw was the behavior.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.320
They said, "We want you to identify who do
you think the top, top performers?"

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.070
And I wanna be really clear everybody we worked
with was a good, solid performer.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.610
But what they wanted us to identify is who
do you think the top performers are 'cause

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.950
they had a certain percent of the people that
outsold everybody else.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.579
And so I went back, I looked through the transcripts
and I found seven reps who had all exhibited

00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:40.140
that sense of purpose.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.850
And I said, "This is who I think the top seven
are."

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.980
I was a hundred percent right, one hundred
percent right.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.000
And the only real difference between them
and their counterparts when you looked at

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.470
all these other measurements were they carried
that sense of purpose 'cause they knew that

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.279
their jobs made a difference, they knew it
mattered.

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:07.620
And so compare that one sales rep that I worked
with that I've described to you with her saying,

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.399
"I hold this grandmother in my heart," compare
her with what's going on inside the heads

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:14.009
of most of the other salespeople.

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:17.789
Now this is a company where the salespeople
are very well paid, salespeople have the opportunity

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:22.179
to earn bonuses, salespeople can go on these
big, fancy trips every year.

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:27.759
Who do you think is gonna be more effective:
the person who's going into their sales calls

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:33.159
thinking, "I need to close this 'cause I really
wanna win the trip, I wanna be the top performer,"

00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:38.940
or the person who's showing up going, "I am
saving lives, this is important?"

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.970
Who's gonna be more assertive?

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.350
[pause]

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.659
Yeah, so here's what I want you to do, I want
you to do another quick exercise for me.

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:50.440
I want you to do this one on paper first and
then I want you to do it with each other.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.279
And you guys can be a group of three.

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:57.659
So what I want you to do is I want you to
think about a time in your job, it can be

00:17:57.659 --> 00:18:05.080
this job or another job, any job you want,
when you made a difference to someone, when

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.509
you made a difference at work.

00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:08.970
So what I want you to do is I just want you
to take one minute and jot down some notes

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.789
'cause I really want you to think very deeply
about this: when did you do something at work

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:14.630
that made a difference to someone?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.210
And then I want you to share it with the rest
of the group.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.240
[pause]

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.309
Come on I heard y'all talkin', tell me what
you described?

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.600
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.649
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-huh.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.940
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.999
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-huh.

00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:35.289
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:38.340
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:47.629
&gt;&gt;male #3: And they were kind of shocked [inaudible]
and [inaudible]

00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:52.159
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:55.559
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:18:55.559 --> 00:19:00.100
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.330
So what do you remember about that?

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.330
How long ago was that?

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.330
&gt;&gt;male #3: It was in June.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.330
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: It was June.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.429
So what do you remember about it?

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:07.851
You said they were shocked, what do you remember
about that?

00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:08.851
&gt;&gt;male #3: They were just really happy.

00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:09.851
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-huh.

00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:10.851
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:11.851
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:12.851
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible] They were surprised
that [inaudible]

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:13.851
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-huh.

00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:14.851
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:17.080
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-hum.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.360
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.409
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:19:22.409 --> 00:19:24.700
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.440
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: But they were surprised?

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.570
What else did you all come up with?

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.570
What other things?

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.570
[pause]

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.570
&gt;&gt;female #1: [inaudible] but I feel like I
have, so our client [inaudible]

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.570
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.570
&gt;&gt;female #1: and great part of our job [inaudible]
is working [inaudible] they need --

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.570
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.570
&gt;&gt;female #1: go to their client.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.570
So I think one of the ways that I've made
a difference is when they request kind of

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.570
non-revenue generating things like --

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:51.649
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:20:07.700
&gt;&gt;female #1: [inaudible] and we get back to
them with [inaudible] really quickly --

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.009
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:10.009
&gt;&gt;female #1: [inaudible]

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:11.299
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:15.869
&gt;&gt;female #1: So it's not like a specific thing
but it's more like [inaudible]

00:20:15.869 --> 00:20:17.179
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:19.289
Do you remember instances of doing that?

00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:20.289
&gt;&gt;female #1: Uh-huh.

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:21.679
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: And what was the client's
response?

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:26.139
&gt;&gt;female #1: The client is just very appreciative.

00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:28.919
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:33.924
&gt;&gt;female #1: They were very surprised that
we could get it that fast.

00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:34.924
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:20:34.924 --> 00:20:36.799
Well now let me ask you a question: when we
started off I asked you to describe to your

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:40.279
partners what you did for a living.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:44.179
And now I just asked you to describe a time
when you made a difference at work.

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:48.399
Did you notice the difference in the way those
two experiences felt?

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:49.399
[pause]

00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:50.929
What was the difference?

00:20:50.929 --> 00:20:53.150
How did you feel different the second time?

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.690
What was the difference between the second
time and the first time?

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.970
&gt;&gt;male #4: The second time was more emotional.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.159
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: It's more emotional.

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.159
&gt;&gt;male #4: More passionate

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.159
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: More passionate.

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:07.820
What did you notice about the other person
when they were describing it the second time?

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.899
Was there a difference in the way they described
how they made a difference to someone versus

00:21:11.899 --> 00:21:13.450
when they described their job?

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.830
&gt;&gt;male #5: [inaudible]

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.929
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Doesn't sound as causal?

00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:19.929
More earnest?

00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:21.239
&gt;&gt;female #2: [inaudible]

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.549
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: More earnest.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:25.859
Did you all notice anything?

00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:30.059
Differences in the way you felt or the way
they seemed.

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.450
[pause]

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.440
Did their voices change?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
[pause]

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.690
&gt;&gt;female #3: A little more excited.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.830
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: There's more energy,
there's more excitement.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:47.549
That feeling that you had when you described
how you made a difference to someone, that's

00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:52.950
the feeling that I wanna focus on, that I
want you to be able to take into your interactions

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.220
with customers.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:01.460
'Cause that feeling taps into something very,
very powerful that we all have inside of us

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:08.919
'cause we all have a need, there's two fundamental
human needs: we want connection and we want

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:09.919
meaning.

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:15.440
We wanna have close personal relationships
with other people and we want to know that

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:22.840
what we're doing with our time counts for
something, that it matters, that we make a

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840
difference.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.990
This is a fundamental human need; transcends
age, transcends job, transcends culture.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.610
We wanna know that our lives count for something.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.429
And when you talked about the time you made
a difference you tapped into that.

00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:40.380
So you tapped into a much deeper level of
your heart, your soul, your head, and all

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.609
of that; you went deeper with that and that's
where you engaged your emotions.

00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:49.289
You know I didn't always know this, I was
very much on an achievement oriented path

00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:51.809
when I was in my 20's.

00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:57.559
And when I was in my late 20's and I was pregnant
with my first child I lost my mother to breast

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.009
cancer.

00:22:59.009 --> 00:23:06.070
And so I was 29 and she was 53, which seemed
very young at the time and now it seems even

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.070
younger.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.419
And I remember sitting there at her funeral,
and perhaps you all have had this experience

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:13.799
at a funeral.

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:21.349
My mother was a teacher and a lot of her students
spoke and they talked about the impact that

00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:23.350
she'd had on their lives.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.720
Some of the neighbors spoke, my mother's a
community activist, and she talked about how

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.109
she'd made a difference in the community.

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:34.840
I and her other children spoke about how she'd
made a difference to us.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:40.489
And I just remember sitting there thinking,
"This is what everybody wants; everybody wants

00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:45.679
to know that their life really matters."

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:49.149
And perhaps you've had this similar experience
at a funeral where you're sitting there thinking,

00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:54.940
"Gosh I wish that he or she was here to hear
this [chuckles] because this was a really

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.099
big deal and I bet they didn't even know how
much of a difference they made to all these

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:01.759
people [chuckles] and now they're dead and
they're not here.

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:04.450
It would be way better if they could have
heard this."

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.639
I don't know if you've ever had that experience
at a funeral where you're just amazed when

00:24:08.639 --> 00:24:11.309
you add up the sum of a person's life.

00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:15.909
Wow, they had a really big impact.

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:21.049
And so that moment was when I realized that
that's what I want, I wanna know that my life

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:23.710
counts, I wanna know that my life matters.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:30.509
And I realized so does everybody else and
so that really led me on a search for meaning

00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:35.799
and purpose and to find ways to infuse that
into everything I did.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:42.419
And it's a shame when we miss it, when we
miss what a big impact we have.

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.440
I said I'm sitting there thinking, "Gosh I
wonder if my mother even knew this," and in

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.610
all likelihood she didn't.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.360
The reality was she probably didn't.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.599
'Cause what happens is we get so busy with
our day to day lives and we do this and we

00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:56.200
run from this list and I've got this list
and I'm doing this and I'm doing this and

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:02.359
we fail to recognize the impact that we're
actually having on all the people around us.

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:06.229
And we fail to appreciate what a difference
we actually do make.

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:10.919
And this is real shame, it's a shame for two
really important reasons: it's a shame because

00:25:10.919 --> 00:25:17.490
we don't get to experience the joy of knowing
how much we matter and so we miss it; and

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:24.200
it's also a shame because when we don't realize
the impact that we have on other people we're

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.509
not as intentional in the way that we interact
with them.

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:30.359
What was the word you said the second time,
Rachel?

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:31.359
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Casual.

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:33.950
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: The first time was more
casual and the second time --

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:34.950
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Earnest.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.109
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: and the second time was
more earnest.

00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:38.509
So the first time was more casual, the second
time was more earnest.

00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:44.649
'Cause when we realize, "I'm having an impact
on this person," we elevate ourselves, we

00:25:44.649 --> 00:25:48.099
step into it in a bigger, bolder way.

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:51.090
So how does this apply to sales?

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:56.659
It completely applies to sales and that's
where this whole notion of a noble sales purpose

00:25:56.659 --> 00:25:58.269
comes in –

00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:59.679
[pause]

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:05.320
because what I've seen is the salespeople
who have absolute clarity about how they make

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:11.259
a difference to customers, the impact that
they have on customers, not only outsell and

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:17.200
outperform the other salespeople but they
like their jobs a lot more; they're a lot

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.219
happier because they know that what they're
doing counts for something.

00:26:21.219 --> 00:26:28.710
So I wanna tell you a story about a friend
of mine who's in politics.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.129
She's worked in a number of Congressional
offices and Senate offices, she's worked on

00:26:32.129 --> 00:26:35.639
a bunch of big campaigns and I was talking
to her a couple years ago and she said just

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:41.649
a casual comment, she said, "You know in every
office there's always one TB."

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:45.399
And I said, "What's a TB?"

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:52.519
Kind of rolled her eyes and she goes, "A TB
is a true believer.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:58.799
They're the starry eyed optimist who still
believes they can make a difference in the

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.799
world."

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:02.889
And she was kinda quiet but she goes, "But
you know what?

00:27:02.889 --> 00:27:03.889
Here's the thing all the jaded staffers don't
talk about: everybody else in the office is

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:09.090
secretly jealous of the true believer 'cause
they all wish they were a TB too."

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:21.379
And so I thought about that, she said this
to me a couple years ago and I've really pondered

00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:26.059
that and what I finally came to realize is
the reason that everybody's jealous of the

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:28.609
true believer is 'cause deep down in here
--

00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:29.609
[pause]

00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:36.220
we're all a TB too, we just want permission
for it to come out.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.220
[pause]

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:45.190
'Cause we've got this environment it's kinda
strange where somehow it's weird to really

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:51.870
care passionately at work, like it's somehow
unproductive, it's like the most bizarre thing

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.370
like, "The more serious I am, the more things,"
and I know you guys aren't serious 'cause

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:59.139
I'm sittin' here starin' at a pool table and
a foosball table so [chuckles] I realize that.

00:27:59.139 --> 00:28:06.029
But this whole notion of being making a difference
at work, that somehow that's like this starry

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:09.049
eyed, optimistic thing that only fools care
about.

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:15.979
But it's been proven time and time again that
this is actually what makes people more productive.

00:28:15.979 --> 00:28:21.902
So the good news is here at Google, if you
look and I'll move the chart here so you can

00:28:21.902 --> 00:28:28.929
see it, you already know what it is, you all
have a very, very powerful mission statement

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:29.929
already.

00:28:29.929 --> 00:28:33.869
[sound of pages being turned]

00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:35.789
But I also know that you're Google.

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:42.480
This is great, this is amazing, this is world
changing, but I also know that great is not

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.249
good enough for you.

00:28:44.249 --> 00:28:48.940
So what I'm gonna do with the rest of our
time together is I wanna work with you to

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:58.869
take this and translate it into sales, into
how you make a difference for your customers,

00:28:58.869 --> 00:29:02.279
for your customers, the individuals that you
call on.

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:09.909
How you can take this and translate it into
what I call a personal noble sales purpose.

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:18.950
Because when you have that at the front and
center of your brain it changes the way that

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.700
you interact with people.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:29.249
So I'm gonna give you a couple of examples
of clients of mine that have NSP's.

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:33.330
I'm gonna give you a couple of examples and
then I'm gonna ask you to as I go through

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.570
this next section I want you to be thinking
about the impact that you have on customers.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:44.450
So one of my customers sells project management
software for the construction industry.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.460
So it'd be very easy for them to say, "What
do we do?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.289
We sell project management software to the
construction industry and we're gonna be the

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:55.340
market leader, we're gonna be the best," and
all those things.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.349
[pause]

00:29:56.349 --> 00:30:00.349
We changed that and their NSP, their noble
sales purpose is now --

00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:02.070
[pause]

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:07.099
"We help people create a better world.

00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:08.099
"

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:09.099
[pause]

00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:10.099
Actually it's "We help people build a better
world."

00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:11.619
I need to get all of these straight in my
head.

00:30:11.619 --> 00:30:14.009
We help people build a better world.

00:30:14.009 --> 00:30:18.099
And so you think about that, think back to
that biotech rep, some of the other reps are

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:19.099
thinkin', "I sell drugs."

00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:21.240
She's thinking, "I change lives, I heal people."

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.879
Think back to that and now think about these
people that sell project management software.

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:29.120
It doesn't have to be about healing the sick.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.859
They sell project management software to the
construction industry; it's a pretty self

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:38.169
explanatory thing, but what they are passionate
about is helping people build a better world;

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.869
make it faster, make it safer, make it better.

00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.989
That's what they're passionate about so that's
how they show up for their sales calls.

00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:45.989
[pause]

00:30:45.989 --> 00:30:47.489
Make sense?

00:30:47.489 --> 00:30:54.009
I have another client that sells IT services
for small businesses and they used to say,

00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:57.799
"Our mission is to be the world's leading
provider or America's leading provider of

00:30:57.799 --> 00:30:59.269
IT services for small business."

00:30:59.269 --> 00:31:02.679
And one time we were in a meeting and we were
talking, this was about two years ago when

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:07.580
I first started really understanding the power
that a noble sales purpose could have on an

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.580
organization.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.139
And so we were in a meeting and we were talking
about what they do for customers and one of

00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:15.719
the sales people said it, he said, "You know
what it's really about making small businesses

00:31:15.719 --> 00:31:16.719
more successful."

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:18.320
Everyone went, "Yeah, that's right."

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.519
And I remember the salesperson was sitting
like right there and the CEO was right here

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.570
he goes, "That's it, that's it."

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.299
And he like jumps up and he says, "That's
what we do.

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:30.190
We help make small businesses more successful."

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.659
And that then became a filter for everything
they did.

00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:35.759
Is what we're doing helping small businesses
be more successful then we should do it.

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:37.580
If it's not we shouldn't do it.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.249
So do you see what that is, that's very, very
different than describing what you do is describing

00:31:43.249 --> 00:31:47.539
why you do it and it's absolutely critical.

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:51.159
So here's what I want you do to now: I want
you to partner up again and just do this to

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:54.609
start, we're gonna work on this and get it
down by the end of the session, I just want

00:31:54.609 --> 00:31:58.259
you to describe how you help your customers
and don't give it too much thought, don't

00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:01.440
think you gotta get the exact right words
just blather on about it for a couple minutes.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.429
Just like you were talking about how you made
a difference, talk a little more about how

00:32:05.429 --> 00:32:12.029
you help customers and then I'm gonna ask
you some questions about that.

00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:16.389
[pause]

00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:46.889
[people speaking to each other in background]

00:32:46.889 --> 00:33:04.320
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.679
[pause]

00:33:08.679 --> 00:33:39.179
[people speaking to each other in background]

00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:56.619
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:33:56.619 --> 00:33:58.570
So we're small so I'm gonna ask you to share
with the group.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.279
So what are some of the things that you help
your customers do?

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:03.299
How do you make a difference on a daily basis
to customers?

00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:05.690
What did you all come up with?

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.690
[pause]

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:10.899
When I make eye contact with you there's no
getting away from it.

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:11.899
[laughter]

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:14.440
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: [chuckles]

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.569
&gt;&gt;male #6: [inaudible]

00:34:16.569 --> 00:34:19.399
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:22.099
So improve the productivity of the programmers.

00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:24.299
What effect does that have on the programmers
when you improve their productivity?

00:34:24.299 --> 00:34:25.299
&gt;&gt;male #6: [inaudible]

00:34:25.299 --> 00:34:27.839
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: So you make work more
fun?

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:28.839
Make work easier?

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:29.839
Okay.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:30.839
Okay.

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:33.299
So are you starting to get, do you see the
shift here?

00:34:33.299 --> 00:34:37.619
It's about the impact that you have on the
people that you do your work for.

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:42.669
&gt;&gt;female #4: I guess [inaudible]

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:46.710
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-huh.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.740
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.779
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:58.579
How does it make their job easier and then
what impact does it have on their business?

00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:02.380
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.450
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.990
And so what effect does it have on them when
they get that research and insights?

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.160
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.049
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:35:16.049 --> 00:35:18.210
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.109
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:22.109
So --

00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:23.430
[pause]

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:28.279
to hone in on this, if you think about how
you're helping them what I hear you saying

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:35.049
is that you are helping them optimize their
money and drive business for their customers.

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:38.180
Yeah, so you help people attract business.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.920
So you help people attract customers.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.750
As a business owner someone that helps me
attract customers is very, very important

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.789
in my life.

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:46.789
[laughs]

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:47.789
What else?

00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:48.789
What other things?

00:35:48.789 --> 00:35:52.640
How else do you make a difference to customers?

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.299
Anybody.

00:35:55.299 --> 00:36:01.820
&gt;&gt;female #5: I talked about how I help my
customers drive the most sales.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.820
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820
&gt;&gt;female #5: [inaudible]

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820
So you help customers.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.380
So you mentioned that some of your customers
are Pier I, you say, so what happens when

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.380
Pier I drives more sales?

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.490
&gt;&gt;female #5: They drive more sales they have
a better reputation --

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:12.279
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Uh-hum.

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:15.400
&gt;&gt;female #5: they have better earnings columns.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.190
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.869
&gt;&gt;female #5: they improve their margin.

00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:21.660
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.450
And what happens as a result of that?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:27.500
&gt;&gt;female #5: They become more profitable.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.200
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:36.110
What happens 
to their employees?

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.110
&gt;&gt;female #5: They are happier.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.110
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Yeah.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.829
So employees are happier, more beautiful things,
I mean I think about Pier I, more beautiful

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:41.220
things are in people's homes --

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.220
&gt;&gt;female #5: Right.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.690
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: employees get to, they
add employees --

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.690
&gt;&gt;female #5: Right.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.069
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: the stores are well run.

00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:50.829
Have you ever worked at a store, any of you
ever worked retail?

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:56.269
The only thing worse than working in a busy
retail store is working in a non-busy retail

00:36:56.269 --> 00:36:57.269
store.

00:36:57.269 --> 00:36:59.950
[laughs] That's the only thing worse.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:04.450
And so I encourage you, we're gonna keep doing
this, but I encourage you to think about the

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:10.440
impact that you have on the human beings,
because again remember everybody wants connection

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440
and meaning.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.670
And so yes we are all about making our customers
more profitable, that's what we live and breathe

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:22.140
for, we're all about helping them attract
more customers to their businesses.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:30.890
Play it out one more level and say, "What
impact is that going to have on these people

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.890
that I'm working with?"

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.890
Can you see the difference where you take
it?

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:38.390
'Cause when you described how you made a difference
to a customer first you started kind of broad

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.420
but then your faces lit up, I don't know if
you noticed this, but when you started talking

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:49.651
about that one single person that you made
a difference to, your faces changed and you

00:37:49.651 --> 00:37:53.849
started to become, that was when you started
to become more emotional and more animated.

00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:57.210
I'll give you an example of this in a personal
situation.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.230
I told you I'd talk to you about how you can
use purpose in a personal situation.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.630
Are any of you parents?

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.630
Parent, parent.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.319
Any of you have parents?

00:38:05.319 --> 00:38:10.869
So you've been on one side or both sides of
this whole parenting thing.

00:38:10.869 --> 00:38:16.910
So as you know if you are a parent and if
you have parents there are a lot of very mundane,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:23.589
boring jobs involved in parenting; a lot of
mundane, boring tasks involved.

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:27.420
If you don't have children this is a heads
up for you.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.640
All parts of it are not fabulous, many parts
are.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.510
But one of the things I realized as I started
this work on purpose is it doesn't just apply

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:41.310
to the salesperson/customer interaction or
the sales manager/sales rep interaction.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.630
This level of purpose can be infused in anything
you do.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.660
And so one of the things that I set for myself
early on was I said, "I wanna have a sense

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.079
of purpose as a parent."

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:55.670
And so this might sound rather grandiose but
it's worked for me for a lot of years.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.130
And so one of the things that I said, one
day I was coming home and I'd had one of those

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.210
days, and we've all had one of those days,
as I said you've either been the parent or

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.750
the child or both in this situation where
the parent has just had a really long day

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:11.660
and they're really tired and they're coming
home and their hand is on the doorknob and

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.079
they know when they open that door they're
gonna hear, "What's for dinner?

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:16.400
She hit me!"

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.069
And you're just kind of going, "Okay."

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:22.839
And I just had this flash moment one time
when I put my hand on the doorknob and I thought,

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:23.839
--

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:24.839
[pause]

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:31.849
"On the other side of this door is a future
President of the United States or Secretary

00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:32.849
of State.

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:34.700
Get it together!" [laughs]

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.960
And so for me instead of thinking about, "I
gotta do this, I gotta make the dinner, I

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.730
gotta write the check, I gotta do the drive,
I gotta do this, I gotta this," entering in

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:46.920
that task list mentality, instead of thinking
about that I think, "I'm raising a global

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.440
leader and I need to step up."

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.440
[pause]

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.829
I don't do it every day but on the days when
I do it's a call for me to bring my best self

00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:56.950
to that job.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.579
And so the same thing happens in sales.

00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:04.750
If I go in thinking, "I need to sell this
stuff, I need to get 'em on this campaign,

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.450
I need to get 'em to do this," I'm gonna do
pretty well, I mean for heaven sakes you guys

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.380
are Google it's gonna go well for you.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:17.980
But what happens if we bring this whole other
level of intentionality to it and we show

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:23.779
up with a noble sales purpose to say, "You
know what I help this company grow and that

00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:26.700
creates jobs for these people?

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.539
I help this company grow and they put beautiful
things in people's homes."

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:32.000
Who are some of your other customers?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Shout 'em out.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.289
Who else do you guys work with?

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:35.289
Huh?

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:36.289
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: [inaudible]

00:40:36.289 --> 00:40:37.299
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: You're on the Home Depot
team?

00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:39.420
Oh okay, so no wonder you two sat apart.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.420
[laughs]

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.420
[laughter]

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:46.380
Yeah so you're on the Home Depot Team, you're
on the Lowe's Team so we'll talk in generalities

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.329
about the specifics.

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:49.329
[chuckles]

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:53.160
But if you think about that and you think
about how many great things happen at Home

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.210
Depot and Lowe's?

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.670
Yeah, I mean, I mean --

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.339
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: [inaudible]

00:40:57.339 --> 00:41:02.240
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: you're building a home,
I mean you're building a home.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.299
I mean I think of how much money I've spent
in both of those two places, oh my word.

00:41:06.299 --> 00:41:07.700
And you think, "You're building a home."

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.953
You know the other thing you're doin' is if
I go online and I can get that guy to get

00:41:10.953 --> 00:41:14.230
my water heater fixed in 12 hours, that's
huge, that is huge.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.329
I'm not gonna tell you who responded faster
'cause --

00:41:16.329 --> 00:41:17.329
[laughter]

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:19.440
I don't want you to fight between the two
of you but that is exactly what happened.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.350
But you think about this level of purpose
that, "I'm not just doin' bits and bytes and

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:28.549
this and that, what I'm doin' is I'm helpin'
these people create a successful business

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:30.589
and that's my purpose."

00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:34.470
So let me give you a framework, a way to think
about your business and to show you how all

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.329
this fits together.

00:41:36.329 --> 00:41:40.740
This is what we call our Six P Model.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.970
It's helpful to look at a visual model and
think about your business in this way.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.559
So in any given business we have profit, that's
the thing, the bottom line, what's our revenue,

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:51.440
what's our margin, etcetera.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.170
We have processes within the business: how
do we get things from here to there?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.280
How does data move through?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.450
What are our processes in the business?

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.369
What do we actually sell?

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:01.369
What are our products?

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:02.900
What's our go to market strategy?

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.730
That's where sales and marketing sits, it's
in promotion.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.470
And then who are our people and what are we
gonna do with all our people?

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.990
Who needs to do what?

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:16.990
And all of these are inter-connected and there's
a creative tension amongst all of these, a

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.990
natural tension.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:22.240
Perhaps have you seen that in your organization
with the people who wanna develop new products

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.190
maybe have some tension with the finance people
or the people in training maybe have some

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.609
tension with the process people.

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:29.640
Have you seen that happen?

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.470
There's a natural tension.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:35.059
What happens when one of these gets over emphasized?

00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:36.059
[pause]

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:40.589
Have you ever seen an organization where profit
was overemphasized?

00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:41.640
[pause]

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640
What happens?

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640
[pause]

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.569
&gt;&gt;female #6: [inaudible]

00:42:45.569 --> 00:42:48.690
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.030
&gt;&gt;female #6: [inaudible]

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:57.580
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: More and more and more
and more and more.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.580
&gt;&gt;female #6: [inaudible]

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.580
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Yeah.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.260
What happens over the long haul when profit
is overemphasized?

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.260
[pause]

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.859
Did it make a lot of money?

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:08.259
[pause]

00:43:08.259 --> 00:43:11.380
It always comes back in the end doesn't it?

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.780
If you've ever worked for a place where the
people found themselves saying, "All anyone

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.180
cares about here is money."

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.540
I can tell you that's a business that two
or three years from now will not be making

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.750
that much money.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.750
[pause]

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.240
What about when process gets overemphasized?

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.240
Have you ever worked for a business that did
that?

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.730
Ever been part of a business that did a lean
initiative or a Six Sigma initiative?

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.810
[pause]

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.819
Do you come out of that more joyful?

00:43:37.819 --> 00:43:40.730
&gt;&gt;male #7: [inaudible]

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:45.579
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right, right.

00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:50.760
It's not that process is a bad thing, every
organization needs process.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.420
It's when something is overemphasized.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.290
And I could go on and on with this.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.329
When products, even when people are overemphasized.

00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:00.339
It's the tension between all of these.

00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:04.730
But let me tell you where purpose fits into
this, if you think about this that's what's

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.220
missing here.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.480
This is what a purpose does for you: a purpose
becomes your center, it becomes like your

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.460
North Star 'cause that's what keeps everything
together.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:22.359
Sometime have you ever heard people say, "We
have a pendulum problem in business?"

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:26.160
Now we have a kind of all over the place problem
because business is so complicated now.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.230
But having a purpose; what do we wake up every
day to do?

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.119
And this is why it's important to have one
in sales.

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:39.890
When I know very succinctly and very deeply
on an emotional level how I make a difference

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:45.400
to a customer that becomes my North Star,
that becomes the thing that guides me.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.740
It guides me in my decision making and it
guides me in my sales behavior.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.329
So think about who would you rather have call
on you: the person that's calling on you to

00:44:54.329 --> 00:44:57.610
say, "I wanna close this and I wanna close
this and I wanna get 'em to do this," or the

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.059
person that's calling on you saying, "I'm
gonna help your business be more successful,

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:06.930
that is my purpose, that is why I'm here to
help you grow this business, help you create

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.829
more jobs, help you satisfy your customers?"

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:14.309
In the case of your two customers, "To help
people create better homes.

00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:16.660
That's what I wanna help you with."

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.109
That sales call has a completely different
energy.

00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:25.420
Remember when I talked about those salespeople
who were just a little bit different, just

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.420
a little bit different?

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.020
It was that sense of purpose bringing that
into the sales call.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.910
And there's been a lot of research done on
this, on a sense of purpose.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:41.930
Jim Collins in Built to Last and in Good to
Great demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.260
purpose and value driven companies outperform
the market by 16 to 1, they outperform their

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.750
competitors by 6 to 1.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:51.200
Daniel Pink's research in Drive, the secret
about what motivates us.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.000
What do you think motivates people?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
[pause]

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Hum?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.400
Yeah, it's not the carrot or the stick; he
totally debunked that.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.680
It's autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.690
Another bestselling book of late, The Progress
Principle, where they looked at the work diaries

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.230
of thousands and thousands of employees, where
they charted out what they were really thinking

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:15.369
at work; they call it their inner work lives.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:20.760
The thing that had the biggest contribution
to creating a positive work environment, and

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.240
a positive work environment was where people
liked it and they got a lot done, was when

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:33.089
people had meaningful progress towards a shared
purpose, towards meaningful work.

00:46:33.089 --> 00:46:37.339
So the research is absolutely, absolutely
clear, purpose matters.

00:46:37.339 --> 00:46:41.940
Now again the great thing at Google is you
all do have clarity around this, you know

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.630
how you're making a difference in the world.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.789
But what happens is despite all this research
and despite all this stuff that's out there,

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:52.460
a lot of times it falls apart when you get
to sales 'cause what takes precedent in sales?

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.460
[pause]

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460
Hum?

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.000
The revenue, the numbers; revenue is important.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.519
I've been in sales all my life, I run my own
business.

00:47:00.519 --> 00:47:04.810
Revenue is extremely important but one of
the things that Peter Drucker said really

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:12.170
struck with me is, "Profit is not the purpose
of a business but rather the test of its validity."

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.650
Think about that.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:19.960
Profit is not the purpose of a business but
the test of its validity.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.339
[pause]

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:26.359
And so I think your company knows that already;
a lot of companies know that, but what happens

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:31.089
is when it comes to the sales conversation
it ends up being all about the targets and

00:47:31.089 --> 00:47:33.250
the revenue and we gotta get this and we gotta
get this and we gotta get this.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.559
It's not because we're inherently bad, evil,
or greedy people.

00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:40.259
No it's just because sales lends itself to
that.

00:47:40.259 --> 00:47:44.339
That's why we have to be really intentional
about pulling purpose to the front.

00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:45.660
You wanna say somethin'.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.660
[pause]

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:52.700
So I'm gonna give you an example here of what
happens when it all becomes about the money;

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.480
this is an extreme example, sometimes you
in the extreme we see what we don't wanna

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480
be.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.970
The faces are blurred on this to protect the
innocent.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:05.060
How many of you like buying a car?

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060
[pause]

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.820
&gt;&gt;female #7: I just bought one [inaudible].

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.200
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Really?

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.570
Do you realize, everyone else can't see, I
wish the camera could capture your facial

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:17.570
expression now.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.349
Your facial expression was, "I just bought
one."

00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:24.829
I mean literally like, "I just passed a kidney
stone."

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:28.760
I mean that's what your face was like.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:34.019
[laughs] So I take it, it was not a great
experience for you.

00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:38.809
Now I want you to think this through: now
car salespeople, I do not think they are inherently

00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:46.839
evil people, but when you look at most despised
professions, the list, the only people that

00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:49.559
fall below car salespeople are Congressmen.

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:50.559
[laughter]

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:54.289
The only people [chuckles] I'm not kidding,
I don't make this stuff up.

00:48:54.289 --> 00:48:57.609
I Googled it, it must be true, but anyhow.

00:48:57.609 --> 00:49:01.970
So think about this though, this is an amazing
thing that happens in this industry.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:06.950
So think about the automotive industry, they
have excellent engineers don't they?

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:13.640
They have amazing engineers, they have great
consumer research, they're literally -- my

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.619
cousin used to run a huge manufacturing facility
for one of the Big Three and so they do all

00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:21.730
this research to find out how they can make
our lives better with these cars.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:26.900
Then they have these great engineers, how
can they make us feel better, enjoy driving

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.099
more, support our families better by taking
all these kids?

00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:34.849
So they do all this research, they have these
great engineers, they have great ads.

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:36.470
Aren't a lot of the car ads great ads?

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.589
I mean you watch the ad and you think, "Wow,
this could have a huge impact on my life.

00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:42.910
I could feel so much better if I had this
car."

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.059
So it's all there.

00:49:44.059 --> 00:49:46.410
But what happens when you get—

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.579
[pause]

00:49:47.579 --> 00:49:51.390
to the salesperson?

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:57.180
When you go to the car dealership do they
ask you any questions at all about what impact

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.839
will this car have on your life?

00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:02.470
How will your life be better or different
as a result of this?

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.490
Do they ever ask you any of those questions?

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.490
No what did they ask you?

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:07.490
&gt;&gt;female #8: [inaudible]

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.490
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Yeah.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.839
You ready to close it now?

00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:12.999
How much a month can you expend?

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:15.720
And these days, do you have good credit?

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.849
Of course if they asked you if you work for
Google, hey okay [inaudible].

00:50:20.849 --> 00:50:27.579
But yeah because the whole conversation is
around how can I close you right now and it

00:50:27.579 --> 00:50:30.089
shows from the moment you walk in there.

00:50:30.089 --> 00:50:31.680
Can't you just feel it?

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.750
Now why do you think that is?

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.289
Is it because they're bad people?

00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:36.630
Is it because they're evil people?

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:37.799
&gt;&gt;female #9: [inaudible]

00:50:37.799 --> 00:50:42.960
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: 'Cause they're only numbers
driven, that is their sole focus.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.089
'Cause what are the conversations that the
sales manager has with the sales rep?

00:50:49.089 --> 00:50:54.599
The reason the sales rep only talks to you
about pricing/closing is because that's all

00:50:54.599 --> 00:50:57.769
the sales manager talks to the sales rep about.

00:50:57.769 --> 00:51:00.819
When they have those sales meetings what do
they talk about?

00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:01.819
How many you gonna sell?

00:51:01.819 --> 00:51:02.819
When you gonna sell it?

00:51:02.819 --> 00:51:03.819
How are you gonna close it?

00:51:03.819 --> 00:51:04.819
How fast can you get it done?

00:51:04.819 --> 00:51:05.819
When are you gonna do it?

00:51:05.819 --> 00:51:08.109
When are you gonna do it?

00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:11.460
There's nothing wrong with having a strong
sense of urgency about sales.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.559
Trust me, I run a company, this is an important
thing, we wanna have a sense of urgency.

00:51:15.559 --> 00:51:22.090
But when you miss that sense of purpose, when
that's absent, the interaction with the customer

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.170
is just awful.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:30.210
And this is an extreme example, but this is
an industry that has done it to itself; they

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:36.930
have invested in every aspect of that industry
but they have not changed the way they sell,

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:41.670
and that is why I'm still driving [bad audio]
year old Lexus because I cannot bear to go

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:47.770
to the car dealership because it is an assault
on my soul to be with a bad salesperson and

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:51.460
so I'm gonna drive it until the wheels fall
off, I cannot even stand it.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.700
[laughter]

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.579
But we do not want this to happen to you;
this is a very, very extreme example.

00:51:58.579 --> 00:52:00.930
So here's what I want you to do:

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.420
[pause]

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.210
there's Google's very powerful mission statement.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:08.670
You've had a couple of minutes to talk about
how you make a difference to customers and

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.500
so I just want you to get started on this;
it takes a while to do it, but I want you

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:16.650
to get started on it and what I want you to
do just pair up and I want you to try and

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:21.920
come up with some sort definitive statement
about how you make a difference to customers.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.740
Now I gave you those examples my customers
use; one of them is we help people build a

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:33.140
better world; gave you the example of I'm
raising a future President of the United States

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.019
of America, maybe that'd be helpful to you,
I don't know.

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:39.519
Gave you the other example of we help small
businesses be more successful.

00:52:39.519 --> 00:52:40.519
[pause]

00:52:40.519 --> 00:52:47.690
The thing a good noble sales purpose has in
it is it is very clear about the impact that

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:54.180
you have on customers, it's concrete, so it's
real it's not just some airy, fairy thing.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:01.069
So like we help small businesses be more successful,
they really do that and it's exciting, it's

00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:02.849
exciting, it's a reason to believe.

00:53:02.849 --> 00:53:06.769
So here's what I want you to think about,
I want you to take a couple of minutes to

00:53:06.769 --> 00:53:10.720
do this, I want you to think about the impact
that you have on your customers or your team

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:16.260
members, how you're different than your competitors;
and I use the word competitors to mean the

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.769
people that you're competing for dollars with.

00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:22.250
So as you said the newspaper, how are you
different than that?

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.510
And you don't have to make a big long list,
but how are you different?

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:31.519
And then the third thing is: think back to
how you felt when you talked about that time

00:53:31.519 --> 00:53:33.140
when you made a difference to somebody.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.500
On your best day what do you love about your
job?

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.650
So it doesn't have to include all three of
these but this is just some prompts to get

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:40.650
you started.

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.290
So I want you to take a couple minutes, talk
about it, see what you can come up with, and

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:46.559
this will be a start.

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:48.089
[pause]

00:53:48.089 --> 00:53:58.869
[people speaking to one another in background]

00:53:58.869 --> 00:54:00.410
Great.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.950
Perfect.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:03.490
[pause]

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:14.270
[people speaking to one another in background]

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:32.750
&gt;&gt;female #10: [inaudible] more trying to understand
[inaudible] trying to grow [inaudible]

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:38.910
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:43.530
&gt;&gt;female #10: [inaudible]

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:57.390
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: So you're really, yeah,
you care.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:02.640
&gt;&gt;female #10: I do things that [inaudible]
I feel lucky to be in a great company where

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640
it is important to my boss that we care about
our customers --

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.200
&gt;&gt;female #10: [inaudible] that you don't just
care about [inaudible]

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.749
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:55:10.749 --> 00:55:27.400
Well it isn't ironic those are the companies
that make the most money.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.250
&gt;&gt;female #10: Right.

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:33.869
[inaudible]

00:55:33.869 --> 00:55:39.410
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: You can feel it.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.349
I'm gonna show you something in a second about
how you're, that thing I showed you Rachel

00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:46.049
about how your subconscious feelings are being
read by your customers –

00:55:46.049 --> 00:55:47.049
&gt;&gt;Rachel: [inaudible]

00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:48.700
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: and they don't even know
it.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:54.109
So is it okay if I go to like 2:30?

00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:55.109
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Yep.

00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:56.109
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Is that okay?

00:55:56.109 --> 00:55:57.109
&gt;&gt;Rachel: [inaudible]

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:58.259
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay, okay 'cause [inaudible]

00:55:58.259 --> 00:55:59.259
[pause]

00:55:59.259 --> 00:56:00.609
So tell me what you all came up with.

00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:03.730
This is a start so if we had more time we'd
work through it and we'd get 'em all perfect.

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:05.799
You had a great one though, why don't you
tell me what yours is.

00:56:05.799 --> 00:56:10.589
&gt;&gt;female #11: Mine is to help my clients grow
their businesses and become more successful.

00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:11.869
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:17.470
So the thing I would add to that is I would
say instead of "to help my clients" I would

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.089
say "I help my clients."

00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:20.740
&gt;&gt;female #11: Okay.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:21.740
[pause]

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.170
And so I help my clients grow their businesses
and be more successful.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:25.289
It's pretty succinct and simple.

00:56:25.289 --> 00:56:27.051
Rachel you're in training so what did you
come up with?

00:56:27.051 --> 00:56:28.051
&gt;&gt;Rachel: My customers are Googlers.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.051
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:33.589
&gt;&gt;Rachel: So I arm Googlers with skills and
knowledge so that they can have more successful

00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:38.069
and effective at work and home [inaudible]

00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:40.630
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:47.809
Did you come up with one?

00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:49.569
Are you close?

00:56:49.569 --> 00:56:50.569
&gt;&gt;male #8: Yeah, I guess [inaudible]

00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:51.569
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Okay, great.

00:56:51.569 --> 00:56:52.569
&gt;&gt;male #8: [inaudible] I empower the end user
[inaudible]

00:56:52.569 --> 00:56:53.569
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: You empower the end user
to find your customers.

00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:54.569
&gt;&gt;male #8: Actually I [inaudible]

00:56:54.569 --> 00:56:55.569
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:56:55.569 --> 00:56:56.569
&gt;&gt;male #8: empower customers [inaudible]

00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:57.569
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:56:57.569 --> 00:56:58.569
&gt;&gt;male #8: [inaudible]

00:56:58.569 --> 00:56:59.569
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:56:59.569 --> 00:57:02.579
So you empower, so you have this vision of
all these people out there finding your client

00:57:02.579 --> 00:57:03.579
--

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:04.579
&gt;&gt;male#8: Right.

00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:05.579
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Yeah.

00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:07.009
Can you feel the difference in that?

00:57:07.009 --> 00:57:12.650
Are you starting to sense the difference in
that versus, and again you guys have a great

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:17.299
mission statement but when you think about
what you're bringing to that individual customer

00:57:17.299 --> 00:57:19.750
interaction there's a slight twist on it.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.069
[bad audio] the difference?

00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:28.859
&gt;&gt;female #12: [inaudible] you words are more,
are stronger, the word empower is just [inaudible]

00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:29.859
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:57:29.859 --> 00:57:30.859
&gt;&gt;female #12: Yeah.

00:57:30.859 --> 00:57:31.859
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Um-hum.

00:57:31.859 --> 00:57:34.220
&gt;&gt;female #12: I don't know I feel like it's
just, even in the language you used to describe

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.220
it --

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.220
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.220
&gt;&gt;female #12: is more motivating.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.220
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: It is.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.220
And see this is, I'm glad you noticed that
because this is the thing that a lot of times

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.319
companies who have absolute clarity of their
mission, whether they call it a mission or

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:47.779
a purpose, that have absolute clarity a lot
of times it needs to be tweaked for sales.

00:57:47.779 --> 00:57:51.809
'Cause it really resonates with the product
development people and it's a great statement

00:57:51.809 --> 00:57:57.930
to put out there to the entire company, but
what happens in sales is I need to have a

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.549
mental image of that one customer I'm calling
on.

00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:03.920
That's why I say a noble sales purpose.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:11.100
I need to have a mental image of what I do
for you specifically, that's why it's so important.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:19.740
So the NSP, it's how you make a difference
to your customers and it's what you hold in

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.740
your heart when you go on sales calls.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.270
So I'm gonna give you in the time that we
have left, we just have a couple minutes left,

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:33.980
so I'm gonna give you three things that you
can do to keep this front and center of your

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.720
awareness.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.230
First thing is a mental model that you can
use when you go on sales calls.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.660
So let's think about how a typical sales call
goes.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.569
We've got the salesperson's agenda which is
what?

00:58:45.569 --> 00:58:46.569
[pause]

00:58:46.569 --> 00:58:48.359
Sell, of course it's to sell.

00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:50.769
So we have the salesperson agenda.

00:58:50.769 --> 00:58:54.269
I'm gonna go over to the customer see if I
can find out a little bit about them because

00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:55.269
what do I wanna do?

00:58:55.269 --> 00:58:58.740
I wanna bring them back over to my side so
I can sell them something.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.970
It works; there's nothing wrong with that.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:02.650
What I wanna give you is a different mental
model.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.520
And you all have the book in front of you
so if you think salesperson/customer, different

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.690
mental model is what we call the Triangle
of Truth and it's thinking about your sales

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:13.999
calls in a very different way.

00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:18.140
Your sales calls are no longer I'm trying
to get the customer over to my agenda, you're

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:24.079
sales calls are in service of your NSP, your
noble sales purpose.

00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:29.780
So if I'm showing up to help my customers
be more successful or if I'm showing up to

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:36.390
help customers find my customers then everything
single thing I do on that sales call is in

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:38.970
service of that.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:40.840
Why is this so important?

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.320
This is important because one of the things
that salespeople struggle with is being able

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:51.950
to master the, I wanna help the client and
I need to close this deal; that quagmire right

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:52.950
there.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:56.789
What this does it is says you can do both
because the most successful salespeople, in

00:59:56.789 --> 01:00:01.380
the studies I did with salespeople, the most
successful people have a both/and mentality.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.200
So I've got a whole white paper on this.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.049
This is really cool: if you just text SMART
to this number if you've got a cell phone

01:00:07.049 --> 01:00:11.519
text SMART to this number and you can get
it and it'll describe this in a little more

01:00:11.519 --> 01:00:12.519
detail.

01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:16.079
See usually I'm not a cool person who would
have something like that, but now I am where

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:19.829
you just text SMART you get a paper, so there
you go.

01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:25.960
The reason this mental model is so important
is the way you show up mentally affects the

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.869
things that you say and the presence.

01:00:29.869 --> 01:00:38.270
When you look at human interactions and you
look at content, the actual words we say,

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:43.700
and mindset, which is our inner dialog that's
being revealed through our tone and our body

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.900
language, what percent do you think people
respond to?

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900
Content versus mindset?

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:55.980
If you had to put percentages on those where
do you think most of the response comes from?

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.980
[pause]

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:04.069
Some studies show as much as 93 percent and
I'm gonna prove it.

01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:05.069
[pause]

01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:12.349
Where were you last night?

01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:13.570
Where were you last night?

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:14.570
Where were you last night?

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:18.180
We just had three completely different conversations
and I said exactly the same thing.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.869
You knew what I was thinking didn't you?

01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:32.210
That's why this NSP, thinking about this before
you go on calls, that's why it matters 'cause

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.690
the customers can feel it.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.589
I made it very conscious here, they can feel
it subconsciously, we're all responding to

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:40.430
each other subconsciously all the time.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:47.119
So is it any wonder that that salesperson
that I mentioned to you who said, "I think

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:51.140
about that grandmother everyday and I'm gonna
heal more people like her."

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.890
Guess what I found out about that sales rep?

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.039
Number one rep in the company three years
in a row.

01:01:57.039 --> 01:01:58.440
Are you surprised?

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
[pause]

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.700
No, 'cause that's what's in her head when
she goes on sales calls.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:11.830
Like it or not your internal dialog is the
elephant inside every interaction.

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:12.960
[pause]

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.079
And so what a noble sales purpose is about
is about elevating the quality of your internal

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:20.289
dialog when you're in front of the customer.

01:02:20.289 --> 01:02:23.700
So I'm gonna give you two more things real
quickly before we close.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.489
This is the mental model that I want you to
have when you think about your sales calls.

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:30.519
Now I'm gonna give you a technique to present
information to customers.

01:02:30.519 --> 01:02:34.810
How do we usually present information to customers
when we make a recommendation to customers?

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:35.810
Hum?

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.810
&gt;&gt;female #13: Slides.

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.079
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Slides, PowerPoint, oh
my goodness.

01:02:39.079 --> 01:02:41.040
So nothing wrong with that.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:47.109
In my experience what we usually do is we
say, "Here's what I recommend and here's why."

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:48.109
[pause]

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:51.059
Isn't that the way we usually do it?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:55.239
Well I'd like to suggest to you there's a
more powerful way to do that.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.549
It's a technique I call context and framing.

01:02:58.549 --> 01:03:02.960
If you show up for your customers and you
have a noble sales purpose and your purpose

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.869
is to make a difference in their business,
you're probably gonna be pretty proactive

01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:10.369
about asking them questions 'cause you're
gonna need to know.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:14.609
How can I create success for you if I don't
know what success looks like for you?

01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:17.319
So when it comes time to present something
instead of saying, "Here's what I recommend

01:03:17.319 --> 01:03:21.749
and here's why," try this instead.

01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:25.799
Start with context: "You told me that one
of the things that you wanted to do was get

01:03:25.799 --> 01:03:27.140
more shoppers into the store.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.259
You appeal to younger people you wanna get
more shoppers into the store."

01:03:30.259 --> 01:03:33.740
Frame: there's a couple ways that you could
do this.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.099
You could do it this way, you could do this
way, you could do it this way.

01:03:36.099 --> 01:03:40.780
"As we look at this, this one is probably
going to be the most effective for you in

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.799
helping you reach the objectives that you
set.

01:03:43.799 --> 01:03:46.339
And so that's why I recommend this."

01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:48.950
Did you hear the difference in that?

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.170
It's very subtle but there is a distinct difference.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:59.989
So you provide the context first, then you
set up a frame, and then you deliver the message.

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:01.229
[pause]

01:04:01.229 --> 01:04:05.670
It sounds backwards to us, but it's in order
for the customer.

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:09.769
'Cause if I say I recommend this the customer's
brain is going, "And how does that fit with

01:04:09.769 --> 01:04:11.989
this and how does that fit with this and where
would that go with this?"

01:04:11.989 --> 01:04:13.339
The customer's brain is doing all that.

01:04:13.339 --> 01:04:17.239
Doing it this way I establish the context
first, "Okay we're all on the same place,

01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:18.239
here's what we wanna do.

01:04:18.239 --> 01:04:22.769
You said that you wanted to do this," and
I wanna be very clear on this I'm not talking

01:04:22.769 --> 01:04:24.099
about manipulating your customers.

01:04:24.099 --> 01:04:28.249
"Well you said and I'm gonna make you think,"
I'm not talking, I'm talking about doing this

01:04:28.249 --> 01:04:31.559
in a very authentic, intentional way.

01:04:31.559 --> 01:04:35.009
So if I wanna make the customers more successful
and I've uncovered what that looks like for

01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:38.220
them, I frame it up, "Here are the things
you wanted to accomplish in the next coming

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.220
year.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.519
Now as we look at the advertising portion
of this there's this, there's this, there's

01:04:42.519 --> 01:04:43.519
this.

01:04:43.519 --> 01:04:46.150
Looking at these three things I think this
is the one that would give you the most bang

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:50.170
for your buck and so what I recommend is this
is the way we need to implement."

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:52.920
Can you hear the difference in that?

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.799
That is pulling that purpose to the front
and center.

01:04:55.799 --> 01:05:02.530
So that last thing I wanna share with you
is a management technique.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:07.450
So this is what I want you to tell your managers
when you're in a conversation with your managers;

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:12.180
it's a technique that sales managers can use
and you can also use it to manage your manager.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:17.319
So how does the typical sales managers/salesperson
conversation go when you start looking at

01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:18.390
the numbers?

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:19.390
[pause]

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:24.480
&gt;&gt;female #14: They're behind or ahead or --

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.519
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: [laughs]

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:29.473
&gt;&gt;female #14: How are we gonna drive more
money [inaudible] --

01:05:29.473 --> 01:05:30.473
&gt;&gt;Lisa Earle McLeod: Right.

01:05:30.473 --> 01:05:31.473
How are we gonna do this?

01:05:31.473 --> 01:05:33.720
And typical, I mean I've been a sales manager,
typical conversation, "When are we gonna close

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.720
it?

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720
How much can we close?

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720
Is there somebody else?

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.359
Have you met with all the decision makers?

01:05:38.359 --> 01:05:40.559
Who's the competition?

01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.559
What stands in the way?

01:05:41.559 --> 01:05:42.799
Can we speed it up?"

01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:45.369
Those types of things; anybody ever have one
of those conversations?

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:53.229
Those are very appropriate sales manager conversations,
but there's one more question that will make

01:05:53.229 --> 01:05:54.720
a huge difference.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.779
If as you look at a sales opportunity if the
manager says, --

01:05:59.779 --> 01:06:00.779
[pause]

01:06:00.779 --> 01:06:07.739
"How will the customer's life be different?"

01:06:07.739 --> 01:06:08.739
[pause]

01:06:08.739 --> 01:06:16.840
That one question shifts it from being all
about you and what you need to close, to the

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.369
impact that it will have on the customer.

01:06:20.369 --> 01:06:26.329
And this is very ironic because if I'm a salesperson
and I can paint you a picture of how the customer's

01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:32.400
life will be different and it's a very positive
picture, that is going to create more urgency

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.430
in me as a salesperson than you telling me,
"When can you close this?"

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:40.989
Because it matters, now it matters.

01:06:40.989 --> 01:06:42.640
I can't wait for their lives to be different.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.910
I wanna have this impact on them.

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:46.210
It matters.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.070
And if you can't paint a positive picture
of how their lives will be different you are

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:52.170
probably not going to close it anyway.

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:54.849
[chuckles] So that one question.

01:06:54.849 --> 01:06:57.019
Can you hear the difference in what that does?

01:06:57.019 --> 01:07:00.259
Remember, what do you do when you described
how you make a difference?

01:07:00.259 --> 01:07:02.080
It was about why you did it.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.470
This is about the why and that transforms
that sales manager conversation.

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.640
[pause]

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:17.420
This is the reality: quotas, targets, numbers,
they connect with your head.

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:22.400
When you have a sense of purpose it connects
with your heart.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:28.820
And top performing salespeople have both;
they're very clear on the numbers, but they're

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:34.319
also very clear on how they make a difference
to their customers and that's what they keep

01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:36.380
at the front and center.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.559
And so that leads me to the third thing that
I told 'ya I was gonna talk to you about which

01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:44.769
is how you pull this sense of purpose to the
front and center of all your relationships,

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:47.450
not just with your customers.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:53.789
'Cause see here's a little secret: when you
know that you're interactions with other people

01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:59.309
make a difference, when you know that your
life matters, that you make a difference,

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:07.109
you show up for it in a much bigger way; you
show up in a bigger way.

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:11.710
You show up as your best version of yourself.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:16.740
Because having a sense of purpose in your
life is actually how you start to fall in

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:21.730
love with your own life 'cause that's when
you know it matters.

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:22.730
[pause]

01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:26.839
So your work matters, your company matters,
your life matters, you matter.

01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:35.389
And one of the biggest mistakes that we make
is we undervalue our lives and the impact

01:08:35.389 --> 01:08:40.900
that we have on other people; it's a huge
mistake 'cause when you bring a sense of purpose

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:46.630
and you know that you make a difference everything
changes, everything changes.

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:52.450
And so I want you to keep that in your mind:
that your job matters, your company matters,

01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:59.699
your life matters, and you matter, everything
that you do matters, it matters a lot.

01:08:59.699 --> 01:09:00.699
Thanks.

01:09:00.699 --> 01:09:00.700
[applause]
