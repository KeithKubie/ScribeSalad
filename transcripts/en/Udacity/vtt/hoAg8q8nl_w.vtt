00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this homework assignment, I want you to modify the function compile.formula

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so that it rejects any formula where there is a zero as the leading digit in a word.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, in our first version of solve we took care of that,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we had to because Python would have interpreted 012 as an octal number.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the second version where we use compile.formula, we didn't work about that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now we want to put that test back in.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If YOU is a word in the formula and the function is called with Y equals 0,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the function should return False, even if the arithmetic works out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What I want you to do is modify the following code in any way you want,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so that the function that you build up as a string and then compile with a vowel

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is a function that will correctly return false in this case.
