00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
In today's video,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.300
we are taking a look
at a common household spice,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.180
and just how it reacts to fire.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.200
Guys, you've probably
had cinnamon before.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400
You probably have
in your cupboard right now,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200
but did you know that cinnamon
is actually highly flammable?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
To be more specific,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.280
cinnamon is actually a dust
made from a bark of a tree,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.160
and there's lots
of different types of it.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.660
But dust itself is
highly explosive.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.940
When you have these tiny
tiny little particles

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.780
of anything that's even
a little bit flammable,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.424
when they're in air
in just the right ratio,

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:41.500
the flame can so easily travel
from one to the next

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.580
that it just blossoms out,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.300
and can actually just
make an explosion.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.700
In fact, in a lot
of food factories,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.276
there are warnings everywhere

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:52.200
about potential explosions
due to the dust particles

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.851
in the air.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.204
Cinnamon, soy products,

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:57.160
everything down to
custard powder can cause this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.197
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:01.647
We are taking a look at the hows
and whys of cinnamon ignition,

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:03.280
and then scaling it up.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.000
One of the cool things
about cinnamon though is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.056
that it doesn't burn quite
the same way as a lot

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:07.800
of other powders.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.505
Lots of dry powders will burn

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:11.910
if they get thrown
into the air into a cloud,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.500
and then come
in contact with heat.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
But cinnamon has something
a little bit extra.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.900
Not only does
cinnamon burn well,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.100
and create a fireball

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.700
if it's combined with the air
in just the right ratio,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.200
but it also has a cool
like magical effect,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
where it makes the air look
like it's sparking,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.657
and it's more than just a flame
when you burn a cinnamon.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.801
So I actually learned
this trick years ago

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.320
at different bonfires
with my family.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.700
But then, doing
some research on it,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700
I realize it's actually
pretty dangerous.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.500
But we want to show you just

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.900
how cool it can be
under the right circumstances.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Cinnamon is actually
derived from a tree,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.906
like we said.

00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:46.700
It's actually the
inner tree bark.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
So people will peel back the
outer layer of the tree bark,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.400
and this is the layer
in between the actual tree

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.759
and the bark itself.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.350
That's what cinnamon is.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.700
It's wood, basically
this is sawdust.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.440
Delicious, delicious sawdust.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.180
But it's also very flammable,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.180
just like most
wood products are.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.900
So to begin with,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.600
we're going to show
you a couple of really

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.198
small scale experiments
just to give you an idea

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:10.300
of what cinnamon
will do around a fire.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.130
Now, we're not saying
that it's going to be explosive.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.500
But this isn't something
that's going to detonate

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.777
if I put a flame on it.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.500
Be really hard to bake with,
if that was the case.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.500
But you can see

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.700
that it does burn
and catch fire.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.940
[Music]

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.000
And it makes
the house smell amazing.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.880
[Music]

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.920
So powdered sugar,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.214
kind of the same as cinnamon
where it is technically a dust.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.760
So it is explosive,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880
but it's not going to do
the same thing over the flame.

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:42.580
I'll show you.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.520
[Music]

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.400
Not much.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.660
But if you've ever
worked in the kitchen,

00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:49.000
you will know that powdered
sugar, any type of sugar,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
will catch fire.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.700
This isn't doing anything
over the flame.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.040
Look at the--

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.756
There we go.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:54.949
They're in tiny bit.

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:56.800
Little tiny bit of orange fire.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.860
That's it.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.600
Maybe 1/4 of cinnamon,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.500
compared to what we use
with the powdered sugar,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.140
and it sparkles.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.840
As it jets off,
you see the orange flame,

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.000
and then coming off

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.540
of the orange flame
is tiny little sparks,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.400
and it looks so freaking cool.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.800
So what Nate was doing before
at the powdered sugar?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.580
You can see
the difference immediately.

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.177
So much more of a cinnamon.

00:03:17.177 --> 00:03:18.200
Let me try and use

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600
our cinnamon container
to sort of make clouds.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.820
[Music]

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.800
And while it is explosive,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800
we're not doing this
in large enough quantities

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.046
for auto ignition.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.300
What's happening here is
very very small clouds.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.836
If we have these clouds
of cinnamon rising up so thick

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.986
that we couldn't see
6 inches from our face,

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:39.000
then we would technically
be in a danger zone.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.400
Cinnamon dust is

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.200
highly flammable for
a couple of reasons.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.850
Like we said,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.691
this is basically
finely ground tree bark.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.500
It's made of wood.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.300
It's flammable, but it also
contains some other chemicals.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.470
There are two chemicals

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.660
in cinnamon called
cinnamaldehyde and eugenol,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.160
which are also
both very flammable,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.700
and it's flammable enough
that it's possible

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000
that cinnammon is actually
giving off vapors

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.100
that can burn as well.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.400
So it's not just
the individual particles,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.200
but of vapor itself coming
off of the cinnamon

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.420
that might burn.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.100
So it's really cool
to see these effects,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.800
even on a small scale
with our torch.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.701
But now, we're going
to take it to the big level.

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:14.000
We want to show you guys what
this looks like in a bonfire.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.178
With a lot of cinnamon.

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:16.100
A lot of cinnamon.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.340
So much cinnamon.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.400
Too much cinnamon.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.500
There's no such thing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.520
Alright guys, we are out
in the middle of the desert now,

00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.900
because we want to scale
up cinnamon in fire,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.300
and show you just how cool
it looks in the bonfire,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.600
but in safe conditions.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.241
So Nate's built us
an awesome fire.

00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.400
We're gonna light it up.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.820
We could like this fire
with like matches,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.200
but we like these.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.000
[Music]

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.440
It was below 70 degrees,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.900
so neither of us
were very happy.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.920
This is better,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.790
because I have a flare too,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.742
but while we're waiting
for the fire to actually build,

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:48.900
we're going to
do something else.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.920
Maybe ask for adult supervision
before trying this.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.600
But as we were saying,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.355
powdered sugar is
also highly flammable,

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.750
just not the same as cinnammon.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.260
But it's a pretty
cool party trick.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:05.620
[Music]

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.800
Also, it's delicious.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.100
That's red.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.311
I've never seen
this be red before.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.290
I've never done this
with the road flare before.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.930
Yum.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.700
That's the fun thing
to do while waiting

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.100
for your bonfire to start.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.600
All right.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.300
Let's see if we can do this
with some regular fire.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.500
The flare's making it red,
which is awesome.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.880
I want to show you what it looks
like which has a regular flame.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:34.200
[Music]

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.700
So this is going
to be cinnamon and sugar.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.745
You guys have seen fireballs
just a powdered sugar.

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.300
Now, we're trying it
with the cinnamon.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.109
I've never tried to breathe out
cinnamon into a fire before.

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:43.300
This will be interesting.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:06:03.260
[Music]

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.620
That's delicious,
and my mouth is so dry.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:15.640
[Music]

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.420
Oh, that's so cool.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:24.800
[Music]

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.299
Oh.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.800
Good.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.160
Good.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.000
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.600
It is.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.420
Did you spill it all down the--

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.500
That would be a yes.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.680
As a side note,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.856
Nate might have years
of experience of fire-breathing

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.200
in certain capacities,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200
and we also have taken
a lot of precautions.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.600
We have a lot of water,
and an entire fire extinguisher,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.035
and we're in the middle
of the desert.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.640
So we're being pretty careful.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.200
All right, we've got
a pretty good fire.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.100
I don't think it's gonna get
much bigger than this.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.100
No, this is perfect.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.060
It might be time to start
throwing in some larger

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.014
quantities of cinnamon.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.300
So you guys saw in the kitchen,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.624
when we were just throwing
in a little tiny handfuls,

00:06:58.624 --> 00:07:00.211
but now, with just
a couple of these,

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.490
after a handful of cinnammon,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.200
if you want to grab a handful
of powdered sugar,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.700
the powdered sugar makes
a really really big sort

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.600
of a fireball,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.639
but the cinnamons going
to give it that sparkle.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.540
3, 2, 1.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.520
So they do react differently.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.720
The sugar goes in--

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.100
Closer to the bottom.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.800
There's a little bit
of a flare up.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.700
So powdered sugar,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.946
if you throw it
to the top of the flame

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:21.800
like you do with cinnamon.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.820
Not much of a reaction.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.300
If you toss it directly
into the flame.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.857
That's when you're going
to get a bit of a flare.

00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:31.992
Now, cinnamons the opposite.

00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:35.468
If I throw it at the bottom,
you get kind of a flare,

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.100
but it's not going
to be quite the same.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.100
At the top though.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.700
You can get that really cool,
really fast fireball.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.440
So we did sprinkles,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.460
and now, we've moved on
to slightly larger handfuls.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.000
So one thing I
do want to point out.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.300
Nate and I are not standing in
any sort of dust cloud radius,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.100
and we're also standing up wind
of the fire itself.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.100
So we're not in any danger
where we're at,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.700
so long as we toss the cinnamon
directly at the fire,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.900
and not in our line of fire.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.440
[Music]

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.960
3, 2, 1.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.680
[Music]

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.420
3, 2, 1.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:26.400
[Music]

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.600
So I'm finding it interesting
to note that yes,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.700
cinnamon is flammable.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.600
But as you're seeing,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.000
if we're tossing it
into the embers,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.240
it's not doing much.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.200
We've actually got a bit

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
of a trail of cinnamon
around our fire pit,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.100
but it's not lighting.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.500
Even though it's not,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.600
we are going to douse
this entire area with water

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.400
before we leave.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.720
[Music]

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.600
All right, we've got
one container left.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.449
So I actually feel
pretty safe standing

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:52.400
where I am right now
as Nate's throwing,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.000
because again, we're standing
up wind of the fire.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.600
I have cinnamon on my clothes.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.051
So I'm not going to get
any closer to the flames.

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:00.689
Although I'm not
in a dust cloud,

00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:02.050
so I'm not in any danger.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.389
If you've ever seen videos

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.500
of people covering
themselves in cinnamon.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500
There's one that went viral
around the internet

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.940
not too long ago.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.938
That ended pretty badly,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.600
but we're being very
very cautious here.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.040
Another thing to note is
this entire area,

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:17.000
it smells so strong
we are cinnamon,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.200
and it's amazing.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.580
It's gonna smell that way here
for weeks, probably.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.200
If you're going to experiment
with this at home,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.763
make sure you have
an adult with you.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.500
Make sure you're being
very very careful.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.700
Don't coat yourself in cinnamon
before lighting a flame,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.800
or anything like that.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.320
That said, it can,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.540
as we said,
cause explosions.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.120
So if you decide to do this, do
it in a controlled environment,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.960
make sure you have
safety precautions,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.040
and then, have fun.

Guys, that's not all.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.700
You know we've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.059
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.181
And that box at the bottom is

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:01.000
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.900
Hit that bomb
so you can join the club,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.090
and you never miss
out on the fun.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.165
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:06.310
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.900
Talk to you then.
