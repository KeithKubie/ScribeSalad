00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.790
yes it's not that there's a twist
the initial twist is actually really

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800
the initial twist is actually really
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.529
the initial twist is actually really
good and once you get through just like

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539
good and once you get through just like
 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.299

oh that's awesome that's cool well now
 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.100
oh that's awesome that's cool well now
what are they gonna do though and then

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110
what are they gonna do though and then
 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.559
what are they gonna do though and then
afterwards is like oh really that was it

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569
afterwards is like oh really that was it
 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.489
afterwards is like oh really that was it
like you know that's all I can say

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499
like you know that's all I can say
 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.290
like you know that's all I can say
without really giving it away but it's

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300
without really giving it away but it's
 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.450
without really giving it away but it's
like it's a great idea that they just

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460
like it's a great idea that they just
 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.040
like it's a great idea that they just
don't execute well it's like oh that's

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050
don't execute well it's like oh that's
 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.439
don't execute well it's like oh that's
an awesome idea now let's see what the

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449
an awesome idea now let's see what the
 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.529
an awesome idea now let's see what the
payoff is for that awesome idea nothing

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539
payoff is for that awesome idea nothing
 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.719
payoff is for that awesome idea nothing
like nothing really it is clever

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729
like nothing really it is clever
 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.909
like nothing really it is clever
yeah I'd even argue there's some like

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919
yeah I'd even argue there's some like
 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.499
yeah I'd even argue there's some like
there's some good social commentary in

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509
there's some good social commentary in
 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.239
there's some good social commentary in
there I would say you know even about

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:28.249
there I would say you know even about
 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.429
there I would say you know even about
the media have the need for villains

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439
the media have the need for villains
 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:34.570
the media have the need for villains
though yeah without going too much into

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580
though yeah without going too much into
 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.899
though yeah without going too much into
it I mean there is it is clever but it

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909
it I mean there is it is clever but it
 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.610
it I mean there is it is clever but it
doesn't give you the payoff that it's

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620
doesn't give you the payoff that it's
 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.829
doesn't give you the payoff that it's
really building up I mean and again it's

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:41.839
really building up I mean and again it's
 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.749
really building up I mean and again it's

not just the trailers if it was just the
trailers I say false advertising but the

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439
trailers I say false advertising but the
 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.559
trailers I say false advertising but the
first half I think we can say does build

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569
first half I think we can say does build
 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.350
first half I think we can say does build

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159
it's probably the best shot thing in the
 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.159
it's probably the best shot thing in the
film but the other problem is they have

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169
film but the other problem is they have
 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.339
