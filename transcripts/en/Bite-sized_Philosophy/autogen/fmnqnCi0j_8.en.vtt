the rats are pulling on the you can

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770
the rats are pulling on the you can
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.800
the rats are pulling on the you can
measure rat motivation by how hard they

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
measure rat motivation by how hard they
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.190
measure rat motivation by how hard they
pull on this on the spring let's say and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200
pull on this on the spring let's say and
 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.150
pull on this on the spring let's say and
they're more motivated if they're

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
they're more motivated if they're
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.740
they're more motivated if they're
running away and running towards but

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
running away and running towards but
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.870
running away and running towards but
let's go back to play so you can take

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880
let's go back to play so you can take
 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.520
let's go back to play so you can take
juvenile rats who haven't been able to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
juvenile rats who haven't been able to
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.780
juvenile rats who haven't been able to
play for a while maybe they've been

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
play for a while maybe they've been
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.880
play for a while maybe they've been
isolated or maybe they just haven't been

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
isolated or maybe they just haven't been
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.220
isolated or maybe they just haven't been
able to engage in physical activity like

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
able to engage in physical activity like
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040
able to engage in physical activity like
many school children that you might be

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
many school children that you might be
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.710
many school children that you might be
thinking about neither allowed to play

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
thinking about neither allowed to play
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.150
thinking about neither allowed to play
nor allowed to engage in physical

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
nor allowed to engage in physical
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740
nor allowed to engage in physical
activity and there's a reason I'm

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
activity and there's a reason I'm
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720
activity and there's a reason I'm
telling you that so anyways you get one

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
telling you that so anyways you get one
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.009
telling you that so anyways you get one
of these little rats and you can measure

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
of these little rats and you can measure
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290
of these little rats and you can measure
how hard he wants how hard it he'll pull

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
how hard he wants how hard it he'll pull
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910
how hard he wants how hard it he'll pull
the go out and play or how many buttons

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
the go out and play or how many buttons
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889
the go out and play or how many buttons
he'll push you know and that gives you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
he'll push you know and that gives you
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.389
he'll push you know and that gives you
an indication of his motivation so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
an indication of his motivation so
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.610
an indication of his motivation so
anyways you can see that the play

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
anyways you can see that the play
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010
anyways you can see that the play
deprived juvenile rat will fight harder

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
deprived juvenile rat will fight harder
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260
deprived juvenile rat will fight harder
to play than a non play deprived you've

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
to play than a non play deprived you've
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.860
to play than a non play deprived you've
now rat and so you can infer that the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
now rat and so you can infer that the
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.549
now rat and so you can infer that the
rat wants to go play and you know you do

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
rat wants to go play and you know you do
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080
rat wants to go play and you know you do
that you do the same measurement with

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
that you do the same measurement with
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.119
that you do the same measurement with
everyone around you if they want to do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
everyone around you if they want to do
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799
everyone around you if they want to do
something you're going to poke and prod

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
something you're going to poke and prod
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.360
something you're going to poke and prod
out them to see what sort of things

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
out them to see what sort of things
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.819
out them to see what sort of things
they're willing to overcome in order to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
they're willing to overcome in order to
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770
they're willing to overcome in order to
go and do that you'll object even if you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
go and do that you'll object even if you
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.539
go and do that you'll object even if you
don't really object it's like it's a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
don't really object it's like it's a
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.550
don't really object it's like it's a
measurement device and if they're

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
measurement device and if they're
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170
measurement device and if they're
willing to overcome a bunch of your

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
willing to overcome a bunch of your
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.000
willing to overcome a bunch of your
objections then you think oh well maybe

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
objections then you think oh well maybe
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770
objections then you think oh well maybe
they really want to and that's another

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
they really want to and that's another
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660
they really want to and that's another
weird thing to really know if there's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
weird thing to really know if there's
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600
weird thing to really know if there's
something you want you need about five

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
something you want you need about five
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480
something you want you need about five
arguments about why you want it because

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
arguments about why you want it because
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160
arguments about why you want it because
the probability that the person who's

the probability that the person who's
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350
the probability that the person who's
opposing you will have five arguments

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
opposing you will have five arguments
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149
opposing you will have five arguments
about why you shouldn't have it is very

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
about why you shouldn't have it is very
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:26.840
about why you shouldn't have it is very
low

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
low
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.950
low
they just won't have thought it through

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
they just won't have thought it through
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140
they just won't have thought it through
enough so the other thing that happens

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
enough so the other thing that happens
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880
enough so the other thing that happens
in the future authoring exercise is that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
in the future authoring exercise is that
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.039
in the future authoring exercise is that
you're asked to articulate the reasons

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
you're asked to articulate the reasons
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.190
you're asked to articulate the reasons
for all the goals that come out of your

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
for all the goals that come out of your
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.600
for all the goals that come out of your
vision of the future so you're asked

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
vision of the future so you're asked
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520
vision of the future so you're asked
like why would it be good for you why

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
like why would it be good for you why
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960
like why would it be good for you why
would it be good for your family why

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
would it be good for your family why
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270
would it be good for your family why
would it be good for broader society so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
would it be good for broader society so
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.410
would it be good for broader society so
that gives you three levels of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
that gives you three levels of
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600
that gives you three levels of
argumentation right there if you have it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
argumentation right there if you have it
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580
argumentation right there if you have it
articulated down into detail and it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
articulated down into detail and it's
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950
articulated down into detail and it's
related to other important goals then

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
related to other important goals then
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870
related to other important goals then
you're you're a hell of a thing to argue

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
you're you're a hell of a thing to argue
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850
you're you're a hell of a thing to argue
with because people just aren't that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
with because people just aren't that
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.880
with because people just aren't that
deep by which I mean they just don't

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
deep by which I mean they just don't
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010
deep by which I mean they just don't
have that many levels of explanation or

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
have that many levels of explanation or
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.499
have that many levels of explanation or
objection and it's also really useful in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
objection and it's also really useful in
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510
objection and it's also really useful in
relationship to your own mind because if

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
relationship to your own mind because if
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.469
relationship to your own mind because if
you want to do something that's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
you want to do something that's
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.320
you want to do something that's
difficult and that requires energy a lot

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
difficult and that requires energy a lot
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210
difficult and that requires energy a lot
of different subsystems in your mind are

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
of different subsystems in your mind are
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680
of different subsystems in your mind are
going to throw up objections it's like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
going to throw up objections it's like
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.000
going to throw up objections it's like
well maybe that isn't

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
well maybe that isn't
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.170
well maybe that isn't
what you should be doing right now maybe

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
what you should be doing right now maybe
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.369
what you should be doing right now maybe
you should be doing the dishes or

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379
you should be doing the dishes or
 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.830
you should be doing the dishes or
vacuuming or watching TV or looking at

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
vacuuming or watching TV or looking at
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.190
vacuuming or watching TV or looking at
YouTube or if you're really sneaky when

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
YouTube or if you're really sneaky when
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.630
YouTube or if you're really sneaky when
you're trying to do something hard what

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
you're trying to do something hard what
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.100
you're trying to do something hard what
your brain does is give you something

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
your brain does is give you something
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.899
your brain does is give you something
else hard to do that's not quite as hard

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909
else hard to do that's not quite as hard
 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.640
else hard to do that's not quite as hard
so that you can feel justified and not

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
so that you can feel justified and not
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.780
so that you can feel justified and not
doing the thing you're supposed to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
doing the thing you're supposed to
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.830
doing the thing you're supposed to
because you're doing something else

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
because you're doing something else
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.899
because you're doing something else
useful and if you give in to that

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909
useful and if you give in to that
 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.569
useful and if you give in to that
temptation which you often will then it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579
temptation which you often will then it
 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.190
temptation which you often will then it
wins and because it wins it gets a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
wins and because it wins it gets a
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.600
wins and because it wins it gets a
little dopamine kick and it grows

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610
little dopamine kick and it grows
 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.479
little dopamine kick and it grows
stronger everything anything you let win

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489
stronger everything anything you let win
 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.110
stronger everything anything you let win
the internal argument grows and anything

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
the internal argument grows and anything
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.720
the internal argument grows and anything
you let be defeated shrinks because it's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
you let be defeated shrinks because it's
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.270
you let be defeated shrinks because it's
punished it doesn't get to have its way

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280
punished it doesn't get to have its way
 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.069
punished it doesn't get to have its way
so that's another thing really to

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079
so that's another thing really to
 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.949
so that's another thing really to
remember don't practice what you do not

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959
remember don't practice what you do not
 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.589
remember don't practice what you do not
want to become and because those are

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599
want to become and because those are
 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.509
want to become and because those are
their neurological circuits you build

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
their neurological circuits you build
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.920
their neurological circuits you build
those things in they're mad they're

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
those things in they're mad they're
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.319
those things in they're mad they're
they're not going anywhere you can build

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329
they're not going anywhere you can build
 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.910
they're not going anywhere you can build
another little machine to inhibit them

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
another little machine to inhibit them
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920
another little machine to inhibit them
that's the best you can do once they're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
that's the best you can do once they're
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710
that's the best you can do once they're
in there you can't get them out so and

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720
in there you can't get them out so and
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720
in there you can't get them out so and
then the ones you build to inhibit can

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
then the ones you build to inhibit can
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.399
then the ones you build to inhibit can
be taken out by stress and the old

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409
be taken out by stress and the old
 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.319
be taken out by stress and the old
habits will come back up so you've got

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329
habits will come back up so you've got
 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.750
habits will come back up so you've got
to be careful what you say and what you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
to be careful what you say and what you
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.030
to be careful what you say and what you
do because you you build yourself that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
do because you you build yourself that
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.250
do because you you build yourself that
way
