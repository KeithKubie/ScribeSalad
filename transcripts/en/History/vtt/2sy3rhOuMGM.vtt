00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:04.796
NARRATOR: In 1968, a
charismatic young musician

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:08.258
started a hippie commune
in the California desert.

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.010
His followers embraced
his message of sex,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.181
drugs, racism, and murder.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.352
That man was Charles Manson,
and he and his family

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.564
would become the face of
evil for the latter half

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.233
of the 20th century.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.026
1969.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.155
On August 9th and 10th, a
series of shocking murders

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.824
sent panic throughout
Los Angeles.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.493
Seven people were
brutally killed,

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:39.831
including actress Sharon Tate,
who was eight months pregnant.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.168
Their bodies were found in their
homes stabbed multiple times

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.337
and arranged in a
ritualistic manner.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:49.340
Words were written on surfaces
in blood across the walls,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.888
including pig, death
to pigs, and rise.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.766
The case remained a
mystery for months

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.351
until Susan Atkins, a young
woman imprisoned on theft

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.645
charges, bragged
to a fellow inmate

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.064
about committing the
murders along with members

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:09.360
of her hippie cult. Atkins
claimed the cult was made up

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.863
of mostly women,
but their leader

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:16.826
was a diminutive Svengali
type named Charles Manson.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.829
As the case against Manson
and his followers unfolded,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.040
investigators learned
how he exploited

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.209
the Cultural
Revolution of the '60s

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.002
to orchestrate
unspeakable violence.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.382
For young women
like Susan Atkins,

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:34.636
the hippie culture filled
with music, psychedelic drugs,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.138
and free love was
a way to reject

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.057
their straight-laced
middle class upbringings

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.392
and find spiritual
enlightenment.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.269
Charles Manson
used the lifestyle

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.982
to lure these impressionable
young women to his commune.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.736
An uneducated ex-con, Manson
was nevertheless highly

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.863
intelligent and charismatic.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.866
He preyed on the weaknesses
of his followers,

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.077
charming them with
flattery and then

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.663
breaking them down emotionally.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.916
He brainwashed them with
habitual acid trips,

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:09.504
group sex, and rambling,
repetitive religious lectures.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.131
A self-proclaimed
messiah, Manson preached

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.469
about an imminent race war,
naming it Helter Skelter

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.888
after the Beatles song
whose lyrics he believed

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.641
outlined the prophecy.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.644
To ignite the war, he ordered
five of his family members

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.231
to break into the homes of
prominent people in Hollywood

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.818
and kill them as
gruesomely as possible.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.903
They were instructed to
frame the Black Panthers

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.698
for the murders, writing
pig on the walls in blood

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.408
as a reference to
the term the Panthers

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.452
often used for policemen.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.454
After Manson was
arrested, his followers

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.124
remained loyal, camping
outside the courthouse

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.209
as he awaited trial.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.254
His co-defendants,
facing the death penalty,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.008
carved x's into their
foreheads, cut off their hair,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.759
and often disrupted
court proceedings

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.262
with taunts and outbursts.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.181
After several months on
trial, all were found guilty

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.684
and later sentenced to death.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.520
But their sentences would be
commuted to life in prison

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.902
when California invalidated
the death penalty in 1972.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.863
It would take years for
many of Manson's followers

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.949
to recuperate from the
emotional manipulation and mind

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.994
control that contributed
to their horrific acts

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.121
of senseless violence.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.833
The Manson murders hastened the
decline of the hippie movement,

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:32.503
forever tarnishing the peace
and love message of the '60s

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.672
by validating
America's worst fears

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:38.635
about drugs, sex,
and communal living.
