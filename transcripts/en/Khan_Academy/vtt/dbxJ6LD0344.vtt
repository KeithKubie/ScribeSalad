00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.440
We're asked to find the
conjugate of the complex number

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.440
7 minus 5i.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.690
And what you're going to
find in this video is finding

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.280
the conjugate of a complex
number is shockingly easy.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.080
It's really the same
as this number--

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.380
or I should be a little
bit more particular.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.595
It has the same real part.

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:17.970
So the conjugate
of this is going

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880
to have the exact
same real part.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.580
But its imaginary part is going
to have the opposite sign.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.250
So instead of having a negative
5i, it will have a positive 5i.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.280
So that right there is
the complex conjugate

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.670
of 7 minus 5i.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.370
And sometimes the notation
for doing that is you'll

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.490
take 7 minus 5i.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.190
If you have 7 minus 5i, and you
put a line over it like that,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.940
that means I want the
conjugate of 7 minus 5i.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.410
And that will equal 7 plus 5i.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.390
Or sometimes someone
will write-- you'll see z

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.420
is the variable that people
often use for complex numbers.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.650
If z is 7 minus 5i, then they'll
say the complex conjugate

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130
of z-- you put that
line over the z--

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.100
is going to be 7 plus 5i.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.990
Now you're probably
saying, OK, fairly

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.940
straightforward to find a
conjugate of a complex number.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.070
But what is it good for?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.720
And the simplest reason
or the most basic place

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.820
where this is useful is when
you multiply any complex number

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.280
times its conjugate, you're
going to get a real number.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.570
And I want to emphasize.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.060
This right here
is the conjugate.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.340
7 plus 5i is the
conjugate of 7 minus 5i.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.260
But 7 minus 5i is also the
conjugate of 7 plus 5i,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.200
for obvious reasons.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.825
If you started with
this and you change

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:46.250
the sign of the imaginary
part, you would get 7 minus 5i.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.110
They're conjugates
of each other.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.160
But let me show you that when
I multiply complex conjugates

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.690
that I get a real number.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.890
So let's multiply 7
minus 5i times 7 plus 5i.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.190
And I will do that in blue--
7 minus 5i times 7 plus 5i.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.440
And remember, whenever you
multiply these expressions,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.981
you really just have to multiply
every term times each other.

00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:10.880
You could do the
distributive property twice.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.920
You could do something like FOIL
to remind yourself to multiply

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.470
every part of this complex
number times every part

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.780
of this complex number.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.720
So let's just do
it any which way.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.370
So you'd have 7
times 7, which is 49.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.450
7 times 5i, which is 35i.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.580
Then you have negative 5i
times 7, which is negative 35i.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.870
You can see the imaginary
part is canceling out.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.490
Then you have negative
5i times positive 5i.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.010
Well, that's
negative 25i squared.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.350
And negative 25i squared--
remember, i squared

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.540
is negative 1.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.470
So negative 25i squared--
let me write this down.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.500
Negative 5i times 5i is
negative 25 times i squared.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.110
i squared is negative 1.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.110
So negative 25 times
negative 1 is positive 25.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.390
And these two guys
over here cancel out.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.160
And we're just left with 49
plus 25-- let's see, 50 plus 25

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.740
is 75.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.770
So this is just 74.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.259
So we are just left
with the real number 74.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.800
Another way to do
it-- you don't even

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.430
have to do all this
distributive property.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.846
You might just
recognize that this

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:25.950
looks like this is
something minus something

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.190
times that same
something plus something.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.460
And we know this pattern
from our early algebra,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.560
that a plus b times a minus b
is equal to a squared minus b

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.330
squared, is equal to a
difference of squares.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.570
And so in this case, a is 7.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.270
a squared is 49.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.950
And b, in this case, is 5i.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.900
b squared is 5i
squared, which is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.210
25i squared, which
is negative 25.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.400
And we're subtracting that.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.330
So it's going to be
positive plus 25.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.510
You add them together.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.266
You get 74.
