[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.070
SPEAKER: All right,
well, everybody,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.320
we are so fortunate today to
have Chef Mark Djozlija with us

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.050
from Wright &amp; Co.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.700
So if you could
please-- let's give him

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.872
a huge round of
applause and welcome him

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:20.080
to Google here in Birmingham.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.620
[LAUGHING]

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.480
MARC DJOZLIJA: Thank
you, that's very kind.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.170
I was actually surprised
at all the pictures of me

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.711
on the walls.

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:28.660
It was kind of funny.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.295
But--

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.290
SPEAKER: Did you know you'd--

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.450
MARC DJOZLIJA: [INAUDIBLE]
what's going on here?

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.350
Yes, but no, it's great.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.830
SPEAKER: Did you know we
needed a signed, autographed

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.990
photograph of you, too?

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.020
MARC DJOZLIJA: I
signed one, as well.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.450
So yeah, I'm very
honored and humbled

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.160
to be here in the first place.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.590
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.850
MARC DJOZLIJA: So thank you.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.610
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.700
I appreciate it.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.949
SPEAKER: Yes, thank you so
much, Marc, for being here.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.090
And I will let you give a better
bio, but just really quickly,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
so you guys are aware
of Marc's tenure

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.480
that he brings to the great
city of Detroit, he spent--

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.190
I know you opened
20 restaurants.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.810
I don't know-- or
eight restaurants

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.550
over 20 years with
Wolfgang Puck, right?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.050
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yes,
you are correct.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.080
SPEAKER: Correct.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.600
MARC DJOZLIJA: I grew up in
Madison Heights, Michigan.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
And I graduated from
Lamphere High School.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.760
SPEAKER: Wahoo!

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.140
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yep.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.640
And--

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.500
SPEAKER: Any Lamphere
grads in the room?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.250
That's right next to
my house, but anyway.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.690
MARC DJOZLIJA: That's OK.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.100
That's OK.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.599
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.420
Yep.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.130
MARC DJOZLIJA: And I left pretty
much right after I was 18.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.880
And I started bouncing
around the country.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.670
I went to cooking
school in New York.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.960
And I went to Maui, Hawaii.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.280
I went to Las Vegas.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.570
That's where I met Wolfgang.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.932
I went to Los Angeles.

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:22.390
And then, I went
back to Las Vegas.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.610
And then, I went
to Atlantic City.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.580
And when I was in
Atlantic City, he said,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.080
you know, Marc, we're going to
open a restaurant in Detroit.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.690
I'll do my Wolfgang--
you know, Marc,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.940
we open a restaurant
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.950
You go back to your hometown.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.382
[LAUGHING]

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:33.814
SPEAKER: That's a good one.

00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:34.678
That's really--

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:35.930
[LAUGHING]

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.250
MARC DJOZLIJA: You know,
I'll tell you a funny story.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.620
Well, I was at a
dinner one time.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.340
And Wolfgang was there.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.680
They go, hey, Marc, you
should know Wolfgang.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.800
Marc does a great
impression of you.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.630
I go, that's really a way to
get the good side of Wolfgang,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.620
you know what I mean?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.730
I'm making fun of
him on my free time.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.714
So he said, you go back
to Detroit, Michigan.

00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:50.380
He goes, you want to
go back to Detroit?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.340
And we opened a restaurant.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.050
I said, Detroit, like
Detroit, Michigan?

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.130
You know, it's 2005.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.290
I said, have you been?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.956
He said, it's going
to be in the casino.

00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:57.650
It will be fine.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.858
We'll get some good commerce.

00:01:58.858 --> 00:02:00.360
So I came back
with the intention

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.110
of opening the first
restaurant at the MGM

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.180
Grand, when the MGM opened.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.750
And I said, the only stipulation
I have is I want my next gig.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.957
I wouldn't plan on
staying here for 10 years.

00:02:09.957 --> 00:02:11.290
I'd do it for a couple of years.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.120
I'd move on to the
next opportunity.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.850
And he was going to
go back to Hawaii

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.310
to run all the food and beverage
at a small hotel on Waikiki

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.450
Beach.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.680
2009 comes around.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.700
The economy goes bad.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.200
And all of our deals dried up.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.830
So there was nowhere to go.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.750
So I stayed on for a
couple of more years.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.370
And then, the lease
agreement was going to end.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.300
And the MGM wanted
the facility back,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.490
because we were the
only restaurant that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.690
wasn't on the casino floor.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.510
And someone under
the age of 18 or 21

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.719
could come to the restaurant.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.009
So they want to make it a
more casual restaurant, which

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.370
is now TAP, the sports bar.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.084
So the deal was we would take
over the other two restaurants.

00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:47.000
They were [INAUDIBLE]
restaurants at the time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.490
So I opened both
of those, as well.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.560
SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080
MARC DJOZLIJA:
But in the hiatus,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.330
shall we say, when I was
considering whether or not

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.704
I still wanted to
stay in Detroit

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:56.660
and how this was
going to work out,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.690
I lived right downtown Detroit.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.310
And I moved back in 2007.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.950
So when I moved back, I said
there's only 50 people that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.654
live downtown.

00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:06.070
I know, because everywhere I
go, I see the same 50 people.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.795
[LAUGHING]

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.170
Living on Woodward, I also
had to walk out my front door,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.170
and I said, where do I get to
go eat and drink in this town,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.045
you know what I mean?

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:12.820
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.170
MARC DJOZLIJA: You know, there
were some places, Detroit Beer

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.750
Company, Vicente's,
so on, and so forth.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.820
But when the town
started to change,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.537
with a lot of new
commerce that came,

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:22.120
I would walk out my
front door and I'd

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.079
see lots of young
professionals, like yourself.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.994
I said, where do they
get to go eat and drink?

00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:26.710
SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.410
MARC DJOZLIJA: And that's when
the whole mindset changed.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.910
I said, I think we
should try and do

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.717
something downtown in
the core of the city,

00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:33.550
trying to create what
we call, The Gathering

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.710
Place, the kind of place
where you could come

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.210
for a beer before
the baseball game,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.910
a glass of wine after the opera
house, or anything in between.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.860
Make it approachable,
reasonably priced,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.370
and hopefully, with not much
to compare it to at that time,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.280
we thought that would be
our core business model.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.030
And we were very fortunate
the way it worked out.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.280
SPEAKER: And if you
didn't hear earlier,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.030
we were saying a group of us
actually went to Wright and Co.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.430
last night just to check
out the scene and not--

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.880
four out of the five of us
had never been there before.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.210
So we spent some
time looking for it.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.190
We were expecting-- you said
it was on Woodward Avenue.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.550
We were on the first floor
across from the Aloft Hotel,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.430
knew it was by John
Varvatos, and then, the one

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.180
person in our group
who had been said, oh,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.221
it's on the second floor.

00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:18.940
So the first question
I had for Marc,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.430
and I'd love for you to talk
about that with the group,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.570
too, was, why did you
choose loft space?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.040
That's so interesting and
it's such a new concept

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.290
for what the
American small plates

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.325
atmosphere is that you provide.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:32.200
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well--

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.630
SPEAKER: So it's an
interesting story.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.530
Also make sure you tell the
John Varvatos story, too,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.320
because I love that.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.580
MARC DJOZLIJA: I will.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.200
[CHUCKLING]

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.720
So I knew Richard
[? Shiad, ?] who

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.650
was the legal counsel
for then Dan Gilbert.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.025
He used to come in the original
Wolfgang Puck restaurant.

00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:46.612
His wife, they'd
always come in late

00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:48.070
because he would
get off work late.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.528
And then, when I would finish
work, he'd say, oh, sit down.

00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:53.336
Have a glass of wine with me
and let's talk about Detroit.

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:55.210
Bedrock and Quicken
Loans and the whole group

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.049
is trying to figure out
what Detroit needed,

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:58.840
and talk to the people
that lived downtown,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.610
and say, what do you miss?

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.770
What do you think we should
be doing, so on and so forth.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.820
So when I started to look for
something, I called Richard.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.040
And I said, can you
find someone who

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.610
can show me around some
of your vacant buildings

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.160
and see if we can
engage in a concept?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.857
The original space that I
liked, the next meeting,

00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:21.190
I bought my business partner,
Dave Kwiatkowski, with me.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.612
And I said, this is a space.

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:24.070
And the gentleman
who was there, he

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.870
goes, oh, no, you
can't have this space.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.920
It's already been leased.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.730
And you got some
bad information.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.730
So they said, let us show
you some other spaces.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.800
And none of them really worked.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.130
And they said, we
have one last space

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.570
we haven't showed anybody, yet.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.260
And they took us up to Wright
&amp; Company on the second floor.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.010
And it was all beat
up wood, and the light

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.343
was shining through the windows.

00:05:40.343 --> 00:05:42.370
It looked very European
coffee shop-ish.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.275
And we fell in
love with the space

00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:46.400
before we knew we what we
were going to do with it.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.120
Dave's like, this is perfect.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.280
So we're all excited.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.830
And then, the next day,
we're like, perfect for what?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.800
[LAUGHING]

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.540
What are we going to do with it?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.770
You know what I mean?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.353
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.450
MARC DJOZLIJA: So people, we--

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.710
I let me retract.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.200
Me, Dave consider ourselves
good eaters, drinkers,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.132
and travelers.

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:04.840
And we wanted to create
the kind of place

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.270
that we would seek out if
we went to another city.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.340
So if you go to a place
like Washington, DC,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.664
or Philadelphia,
or New York City,

00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:13.330
there's lots of places
on second floors,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.705
lots of places in
basements, lots

00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:16.780
of places in alleys,
which we have one of those

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.310
now, as well, a
cocktail bar called,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.810
The Bad Luck, which
we can get to later.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.010
But we did it--

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.950
we did what we thought was cool.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.700
We tried to create
the kind of place

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.992
that we wanted to
hang out all day.

00:06:29.992 --> 00:06:31.450
And then, we kind
of hope that just

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.920
resonated with everybody else.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.220
And we didn't think we
needed a ton of people

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.530
to gather the
concept, just enough.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.440
So we did it and just hoped
that it all worked out.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.917
Now, the first three days
we opened, nobody came.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:46.750
And we thought it was
the worst idea we ever

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.620
came up with in our whole life.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.430
[LAUGHING]

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.860
And then, the next day,
it started to trickle in,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.530
trickled in.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.440
And people found it.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.970
And then, there's some
buzz that got created.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.720
And then, everything's been
fantastic ever since then.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.370
So John-- so we were
in the [? industry ?]

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.760
of the restaurant.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.250
And Bedrock had been
talking about the retail

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.230
that they were trying
to create around us

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.804
to stimulate some business
on the Woodward corridor.

00:07:10.804 --> 00:07:12.220
And they said John
Varvatos is one

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.160
of the gentleman that's
looking to come to Detroit

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.930
and open a store.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.105
So we were interested
to hear that someone

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:20.980
like that was coming.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.287
So it was early in the
morning, me and Dave

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:25.870
where the only ones
in the restaurant.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.210
And the elevator opened
up, and the elevator

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.430
dings when the door opens up.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.350
And 10 young people come in,
10 young men dressed really

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.129
sharply, skinny
kids, good looking.

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:38.003
SPEAKER: Skinny kids.

00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:39.326
[LAUGHING]

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.130
MARC DJOZLIJA: I'm like,
well, who let them get here?

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.450
Because the elevator is locked.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.200
And so they come--

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.750
SPEAKER: They're starving.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.300
They're skinny kids.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.020
MARC DJOZLIJA: They kind of
panned out through the room,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.880
and then opened up,
and then, Dan Mullen,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.504
who was the representative
for Bedrock,

00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:53.770
Jim Ketai, Dan's business
partner, and John Varvatos

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.310
walk in behind them.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.940
So we get up, and Dan
Mullen says, this is Mark,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.520
and this is Dave, and
they own Wright &amp; Company.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.730
And John Varvatos
is looking around.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.100
He's like, you two
own this place?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.910
We say, yes, we do.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.650
Yes.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.454
He said, a pretty badass space.

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.620
And I said, well, coming
from a gentleman like you--

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.676
I go, that's one
heck of a compliment.

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.345
[LAUGHING]

00:08:14.345 --> 00:08:16.720
And so he said, I'm thinking
about inhabiting downstairs.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.950
How do you feel about that?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.100
I said, only if we get to
throw your grand opening party.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.580
And so, I had heard when
he took over the old punk

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.629
bar in New York City and
opened a clothing store,

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:29.170
he left the stage in and KISS
played the grand opening party.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.270
So I knew it was going
to be a big affair.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.340
So Alice Cooper
played in the store.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.767
And we were the
VIP room upstairs.

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:35.600
SPEAKER: So awesome.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.669
MARC DJOZLIJA: They
blocked off Woodward,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.289
and about 600 people came.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:38.970
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.767
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah,
so only so many people

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:41.600
could come upstairs.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.299
But I didn't tell
you this story.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.000
So the VIPs got to go to
the balcony at what the John

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.600
Varvatos store is and watch the
Alice Cooper show, and then, go

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.830
back up.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.431
And Dave comes down and he
says, the fire marshals here

00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:54.680
and he's really upset with us.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.460
There's too many people
in Wright &amp; Company.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.940
And I said, well, there
was security, supposed

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.410
to check their wristbands.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.600
Why isn't he
checking wristbands?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.090
I don't know, but
the place is a zoo.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.880
So I watched the
end of the show.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.890
I go back upstairs.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.630
And there's a security guard.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.129
And he goes, where's
your wristband?

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:09.820
SPEAKER: To you?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.060
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.565
[LAUGHING]

00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:12.940
And I said, rumor has it you
should have been asking that

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.820
about an hour ago because,
apparently there's too many.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.770
So I gave him my card.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.300
He lets me in.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.270
And literally, it was like
wall to wall of people.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.010
SPEAKER: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.010
MARC DJOZLIJA: So we had
to get some people out.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.520
We had tables set up for Dan
Gilbert and for Alice Cooper.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.105
And Michael Bolton was
there and some other people,

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:29.230
so we had to make sure
everybody got taken care of.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.130
But it's kind of funny
they wouldn't even

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.020
let me back in my own
restaurant after I

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.740
decided to throw the party.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.450
SPEAKER: So does that present
logistical challenges then,

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.802
being on the second floor
with coolers or storage or--

00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:40.760
MARC DJOZLIJA: It does.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.760
And you know, I will talk about
the view here in a second.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.240
But yeah, all of our
storage is downstairs.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.550
So all our walk-in coolers,
all our dry storage,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.470
our Fort Knox of booze
is all in the basement.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.880
So every day, the situation
is that prep people

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.350
prep whatever's
on the list, take

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.280
it downstairs, rotate the
stock, bring the stock upstairs,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.969
stock the restaurant
for service,

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.760
and then when they
leave, the cooks come in

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.426
and the place should
be set up for them.

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:07.290
So you had mentioned,
why don't we do lunch?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.373
That's part of the reason.

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.260
I don't know what to
do with a staff who

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.190
is spending all day
right now setting up

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.829
so we can have a busy dinner.

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:15.370
Like Katy Perry's
at the LCA tonight,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.203
so we're planning to
have a pretty big night

00:10:17.203 --> 00:10:18.970
and some good commerce downtown.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.650
So you had also
mentioned originally

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.580
about the second floor.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.530
You know, if you're
on the first floor

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.160
of a building in a storefront,
you see cars and people.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.784
On the second floor, if you
look out Wright Company,

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.200
or if you're in
table 40-- we call

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.454
it the VIP table it's the
one that was next to you,

00:10:37.454 --> 00:10:38.120
with the turret.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.860
SPEAKER: I wasn't at the
VIP table last night?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.570
MARC DJOZLIJA: No, you weren't.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:40.730
You're right.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.142
[LAUGHING]

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:41.966
SPEAKER: Oh, I thought I was.

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:43.360
MARC DJOZLIJA: You weren't
there till after dinner.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.827
You know, you've got to
let me know ahead of time,

00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:46.010
so I reserve it for you.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.840
But you can look right down
Woodward, all the way to Campus

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.970
Martius and see the cityscapes.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.230
SPEAKER: Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.604
MARC DJOZLIJA:
You see cityscape.

00:10:50.604 --> 00:10:51.590
You see architecture.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.250
You see more than just
people walking around.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.110
And it's a totally
different dynamic.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.910
And that's what we really
fell in love with, as well.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.940
SPEAKER: The restaurant
was completely illuminated

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.064
last night, too, because
of all the holiday lights.

00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:05.280
You could see the tree
from Campus Martius.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.810
And it's just so beautiful
what that stretch of Woodward

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.670
has become.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.260
And with the Shinola Hotel
going up a couple doors

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.180
away from you, you made
the right decision.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.596
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well, they said
all the commerce around us,

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:19.170
the Element Hotel will be right
behind us, the Siren Hotel,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.140
will be right next to them.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.500
So when we talked about
timing and location,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.280
it just worked out
amazing for us.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.250
But at the time, we
totally speculated

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.110
that, if we were
close to the arenas

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.240
and we were close to the
event spaces, that maybe

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.730
we could draw some
traffic to the area.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.909
And no matter how
quirky the space was--

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:38.700
but like I said, it
get's better every day.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.280
And now, the LCA has
really helped us, as well,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.140
because of the fact that, when
you talk about 20,000 people

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.880
coming down on a
Wednesday in wintertime,

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.980
you know that, if
1% of them comes

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.574
to Wright and
Company, 200 people,

00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:55.490
that's incrementally
going to be a much better

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.290
Wednesday than we
would normally have.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.480
So five events a week between
the Pistons, the Red Wings,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.710
and all the concerts, so that
also helps for us, as well.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.190
So like I said, every
time you read an article,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.082
you're like, is--

00:12:08.082 --> 00:12:10.040
we seem to be in the
general vicinity of what's

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.300
going on in some
capacity, which is great.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.841
SPEAKER: Well, and
it does bring down

00:12:12.841 --> 00:12:15.320
a more diverse and unique
crowd than the sports

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.180
crowds that you get at
Ford Field or at the CoPa,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.090
so that'll be good
for you guys, too.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.097
And then, us, of course,
when we move down to Detroit.

00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:23.930
We'll all come down.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.490
MARC DJOZLIJA: And we look
forward to that, as well.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.080
So we also have another venue.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.580
We have a Chinese
restaurant in what

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.950
was the old Chinatown,
called The Peterboro.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.825
So I don't know if you're
familiar with that.

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:35.300
It is on the other side of
LCA, so it's about one mile,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.291
catty-corner.

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:37.790
It's right behind
the Masonic Temple

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.350
in what was the old Chinatown.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.780
So the building right
across the street from us,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.180
Chung's, was the last
Chinese restaurant

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.060
that was still open in
the old Chinatown in 2000.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.792
And a gentlemen we partnered
with found this facility,

00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:51.500
wanted to rehab the
building, and thought

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.895
it'd be cool to open
a Chinese restaurant

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:54.770
in the old Chinatown.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.820
So we opened a place called The
Peterboro about two years ago.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.300
And so we also have that
on the other side of us

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.900
that also is perfectly
located for the new arena.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.440
And Founders Brewery just opened
across the street from us,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.660
now, which will also
bring people to the area.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.000
We're bridging the
gap between the arena

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.740
and what is quote,
unquote, "Midtown,"

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.620
on the other side of
Martin Luther King,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.480
where it was kind of
the Cass corridor.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.530
But the shipping
container facility,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.404
you may have read about,
the Detroit shipyard

00:13:21.404 --> 00:13:22.500
is right next to us.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.850
So that's being built, as well.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.730
So we're going to be
right smack, hopefully,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.124
again in an emerging
area of Detroit,

00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:30.040
where all the commerce
will come up around us.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.491
And we will just hopefully
position ourself properly,

00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:32.990
again.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.740
SPEAKER: It's such
an exciting time.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.406
MARC DJOZLIJA: And
we do have a cocktail

00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:37.850
bar called The Bad Luck that's
in an alley in The Albert.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.410
SPEAKER: Is this
the super secret

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.160
project you were working
on for a Fall 2017 opening

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.588
that you couldn't comment on?

00:13:44.588 --> 00:13:45.671
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:46.700
SPEAKER: OK, tell us about it.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.570
That's exciting.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.220
MARC DJOZLIJA: So
if you've ever been

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.330
downtown to the Belt, where
like Standby is and the Skip,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.710
that's an alley, very, very
nice decorated, graffiti--

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.005
we're in a functioning
alley, like real alley,

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:03.310
like, bums, dumpster alley.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.040
SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.690
MARC DJOZLIJA: And it
wasn't really purposeful,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.310
like we didn't want to create
some experience like it's

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.460
going to be an
adventure to get there,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.180
but it was a space
that became available.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.680
They didn't know
what to do with it.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.766
It was a really good deal.

00:14:13.766 --> 00:14:14.640
SPEAKER: Yeah, I bet.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.890
MARC DJOZLIJA: So we created--

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.870
and we also wanted to create
something a little more grown

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.810
up, shall we say.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.554
You know, I have no--

00:14:23.554 --> 00:14:25.220
first of all, I know
everybody downtown.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.030
So if I say anybody's name,
I say it with affection.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.140
I love Standby.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.104
I love what it is.

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:33.020
But sometimes, it's a
little more like a club.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.920
SPEAKER: Right.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.610
MARC DJOZLIJA: We
wanted somewhere

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.600
where you could sit across from
your date, have a nice drink,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.640
and a sedate atmosphere,
a little more grown up,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.140
shall we say, so we created
this cocktail bar called The Bad

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.640
Luck.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.580
And it's based on
the tarot cards.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.995
Our 13 seasonal drinks were
all based on the tarot cards.

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:47.290
SPEAKER: Well, that's neat.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.560
MARC DJOZLIJA: It's
a call-ahead program.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.450
You call up, and they tell
you how long before your table

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:50.810
will be ready.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.420
That way, you don't walk down
this alley in your high heels,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.280
or you're in the snow, or
whatever it turns out to be.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.030
And then, when you get in,
it's a secret little oasis

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.180
in this alley to where we have
a really sexy cocktail bar.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.170
There is no food.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.420
If you're hungry, Wright &amp;
Company's a block that way.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.830
[LAUGHING]

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.380
So we'll help you out that way.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.546
We'll get you a reservation.

00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:11.390
SPEAKER: Would you
call it a speakeasy?

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.790
MARC DJOZLIJA: We don't, per se.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.190
I mean, I think that term
gets a little overused.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.790
We just have a really
sexy cocktail bar.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.391
And we're proud that we
were recognized by "Eater"

00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:24.140
by-- they had the
design awards this year.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.240
We were the best designed place.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.060
So we just got that the
other day, which is cool.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.850
So people are recognizing
for what it is.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.945
SPEAKER: We had a long
day at our client's office

00:15:33.945 --> 00:15:35.820
yesterday before we came
into the restaurant.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.528
And it was funny.

00:15:36.528 --> 00:15:38.749
We told one of our
clients in the meeting

00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:40.040
where we were eating dinner at.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.860
And she goes, oh, my
god, the food is amazing.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.140
But honestly, the best part
is Jake, the bartender.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.640
He's so hot.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.380
[LAUGHING]

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.700
So you can have Jake at
the Bad Luck Bar, maybe.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.230
Maybe you should consider that.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.885
[LAUGHING]

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.010
MARC DJOZLIJA: Hey, listen,
every little bit helps.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.750
I told you last time--

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.360
SPEAKER: Whatever it takes.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.110
MARC DJOZLIJA: --we
only have a couple

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.030
of rules at Wright &amp; Company.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.490
The first one is, we hope
you have a good time,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.040
enjoy your meal, and you
tell your friends, right?

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.080
And the other one is, you hope
your credit card goes through.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.390
Besides that, you
know what I mean?

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:07.935
[LAUGHING]

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:08.760
Everything else is
up for discussion.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.300
So if you come to see Jake,
I'm cool, you know what I mean?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.630
I'm cool.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.290
SPEAKER: OK, all right.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.890
Yeah.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.210
MARC DJOZLIJA: That's
the draw this week.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.418
SPEAKER: I'm sad I didn't
get to meet him last night,

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:17.510
but we'll come back.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.550
So at The Bad Luck, then--

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.870
well, can you read--

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.470
do you read tarot cards
or is it just you designed

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.190
based off the 13 tarot cards?

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.680
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yani Frye
is our managing partner.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.870
He used to work and be the head
bartender at The Sugar House.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.710
So he's there.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.910
He devises all the drinks.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.960
And so the 13 tarot card drinks
are just like anything else.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.310
You can have whatever you want.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.810
If you want to gin
and tonic, if you

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.309
want something else to drink,
he's happy to make it for you.

00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:46.790
But we're trying to
promote what we would do.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.400
And you know, we got a little
bit of flak, shall we say,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400
when we first opened up.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.250
We did have a $90 cocktail.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.259
It was based on a--

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:54.800
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.550
MARC DJOZLIJA: --flagon
of [INAUDIBLE] rum

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.330
from the British Navy from 1957.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.740
And so--

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.734
SPEAKER: I want that.

00:17:01.734 --> 00:17:04.109
MARC DJOZLIJA: --we would pour
it for you one ounce neat,

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.230
so you could try it on its own,
and one ounce in the daiquiri.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.970
So you technically
got two drinks.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.790
And so there was a lot
of talk about the $90,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.751
but realistically, if you go
to any bar worth its weight,

00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.250
they may have some
Pappy Van Winkle,

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.140
which may cost you $120.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.460
They may have Louis
the XIII, the cognac,

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.099
that may cost you $150.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.170
So we didn't really
understand why the--

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.410
like, we were trying
to outplay everybody

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.567
with our $90 cocktail
wasn't really the premise.

00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:31.400
We just said, we have
something very unique.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.774
And you're not
going to get this.

00:17:32.774 --> 00:17:34.630
So we got all three
flagons of this.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.450
So we monopolized
the rum aspect of it.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.960
So if you want to have it,
you've got to come see us.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.520
SPEAKER: You still have it?

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.570
You didn't get rid of it just
because you had flak, right?

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:45.030
MARC DJOZLIJA: No, no, no.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.210
SPEAKER: OK, good.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:45.550
Good.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.460
MARC DJOZLIJA: No,
no, it's still there.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.293
But I'm just saying,
there was a little flak

00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:49.999
about what we were
trying to create.

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:51.290
And that was not the intention.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.435
But as they say, no publicity
is bad publicity sometimes.

00:17:55.435 --> 00:17:56.310
SPEAKER: That's true.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.840
Yeah, that's true.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.180
Well, so I want to talk a
little bit more about you.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.930
MARC DJOZLIJA: OK.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.513
SPEAKER: And one of the things
I read about you that I thought

00:18:03.513 --> 00:18:05.960
was really interesting
was, someone

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.752
as talented as you are in
the culinary space usually

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:11.210
comes out of the womb screaming,
this is what I want to do.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.732
But you didn't really get that
bug until much later in life,

00:18:14.732 --> 00:18:16.940
even though you graduated
from the Culinary Institute

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.820
Arts of America.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.800
MARC DJOZLIJA: So
you are correct.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.159
SPEAKER: So tell us about that.

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:24.520
MARC DJOZLIJA: So I was not the
best student in high school.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.202
And so when my parents
were starting to press me,

00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:29.160
like what are you going
to be when you grow up,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.550
the only thing I was
really good at was math.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.980
So I didn't really foresee
myself to be an accountant

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.360
or anything like that.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.420
So I had a couple of buddies.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.770
There was a vocational
school that you

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.175
could go to instead of
taking your elective credits

00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:43.800
in high school.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.270
SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.230
MARC DJOZLIJA: So
during the day,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.771
you would take the
things you had to,

00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:48.749
like government or English.

00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:51.290
And then, in the afternoon, you
go to this vocational school,

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.852
and you could learn a trade.

00:18:52.852 --> 00:18:54.810
So one of them was taking
auto mechanics, where

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.150
he worked on his car all day.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.250
And the other one was
taking heating and cooling.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.080
And there was cosmetology
and other things like that.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.470
And there was food service.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.420
So me being the-- trying
to get out of school,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.020
as opposed to engage
more in school,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.228
I said, this is a great idea.

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:09.620
I think I'll take food service.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.830
I thought, if nothing else,
maybe I'll make some food

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.650
that I could eat.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:13.441
That's why I'm fat.

00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:14.030
[LAUGHING]

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.310
And then, maybe, I'll meet some
girls, you know what I mean?

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.580
So that was my whole
premise, right?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.800
SPEAKER: Yeah, in
cooking class, yeah.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.410
MARC DJOZLIJA: And so
after doing it for a while,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.993
it turned out I was
really good at it.

00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:26.987
Recipes were easy to decipher,
measurements, and the tech.

00:19:26.987 --> 00:19:29.570
I like to work on my hands, so
that all kind of came together.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.820
So my teacher would
start having me

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.559
help with someone who
was struggling, because I

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.600
would be a little faster.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.990
She said, will you help Laura
out with the cake or whatever?

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.427
So I kind of said,
well, maybe this is it.

00:19:41.427 --> 00:19:42.760
Maybe this is what we should do.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.350
And a gentleman came from the
Culinary Institute of America

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.750
and said--

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.405
and told us about the
school for about 45 minutes,

00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:50.780
and then handed
out applications,

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.160
told us how it works.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.430
And so I went home
to my mom and dad.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.024
I said-- and this is
in late '80s, mind you.

00:19:58.024 --> 00:19:59.690
It wasn't exactly
that fashionable to be

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.694
a chef or that cool.

00:20:01.694 --> 00:20:03.610
There was no Food Network
or things like that.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.820
[LAUGHING]

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.320
So I went home
and I said, I want

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.028
to go to this cooking
school in New York.

00:20:08.028 --> 00:20:09.960
My dad said, this
is a joke, right?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.410
Like, you want to go
cook for a living?

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.032
My dad was a prominent engineer
working for General Motors,

00:20:15.032 --> 00:20:15.740
things like that.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.660
So I said, I don't
know what else you

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.076
want from me because I don't
know how to do anything else.

00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:21.530
And I feel good like this.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.910
So I'm going to try.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.120
So they said, OK.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.380
They didn't believe me.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.730
I'd pay.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.220
So I had to pay
for my first half.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.886
So I get some jobs
when I was in school.

00:20:27.886 --> 00:20:29.440
And once I started
to excel, they

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.630
paid for the rest of
my schooling and said,

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.110
this is going to work out.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.940
So sometimes, you just kind
of fall into some things.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.920
And then I started bouncing
around the country.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.720
And once I went
to Maui, Hawaii, I

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.649
didn't take it that
seriously, either.

00:20:43.649 --> 00:20:44.440
I was on the beach.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.580
SPEAKER: I feel like you're
not supposed to, though.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.530
I mean, you're in Waikiki.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.070
You're not supposed to.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.610
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, so I
was fooling around in Maui.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.540
I worked for a restaurant.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.456
I learned some things.

00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:52.810
And I felt like I had to
get more focused on it

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.590
if I was going to.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.699
So I got a job at the
Hilton Corporation.

00:20:55.699 --> 00:20:57.490
And then, they transferred
me to Las Vegas,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.870
where my parents were,
which I thought was

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.290
going to be a good opportunity.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.050
And I then I met
Wolfgang Puck when

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.180
he opened in 1993,
when he opened

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.770
the restaurant in Las Vegas.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.020
And so, then the rest,
shall we say, is history.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.210
Because the timing was good.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.980
And I met the right
man at the right time,

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.790
who helped you
become a better chef.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.184
I used to make Wolfgang
dishes, and he'd be like,

00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:19.600
you're going about
this all wrong.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.550
You're trying to
create something

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.420
that doesn't have the proper
flavor profiles or any of that.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.506
And I talk to young chefs,
now, about this all the time.

00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:30.130
He said, start with
something you like.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.440
Start with something
you know that works.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.649
So he says, take ham and
cheese, for instance.

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.690
Everybody likes a ham and
cheese sandwich, right?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.280
SPEAKER: Everybody.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.310
MARC DJOZLIJA: And
if you do, maybe you

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.750
like mustard on it, right?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.750
So you know the flavor profiles
work-- ham, cheese, mustard.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.970
So you can, in turn,
create anything

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.190
with those flavor profiles that
could be cool or different.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.330
And I look back at a dish we're
doing right now on our menu,

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.230
which is a gnocchi.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.230
It's a Parisian gnocchi.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.560
So it's crispy,
but it's Parmesan

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.880
and a Parmesan broth with
prosciutto, which is there.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.380
And then your bread
is the gnocchi.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.370
So it's like, in a way, you
use the bread is a gnocchi,

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.580
the Parmesan and the
Parmesan broth is the cheese,

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.950
and the prosciutto is the ham.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.100
So I didn't even
do that on purpose.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.840
Sometimes it comes
self-consciously.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.590
But you can look back
at different aspects

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.360
and say, see how
that worked together?

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.540
And the things that he
taught you and how to do that

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.370
are things that still
apply to what I do today

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.372
and the style that I try
and create through our food.

00:22:28.372 --> 00:22:29.330
SPEAKER: It's so basic.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.570
And yet-- I have to read this.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.730
The pork belly sliders
that you brought,

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.460
tomato jam, arugula, sriracha
aioli on a toasted brioche bun.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.990
And it's the best
thing I have ever had.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.679
It's so amazing.

00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:41.970
MARC DJOZLIJA: Just like with--

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.428
if I talk about
cocktails, as well,

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:45.560
there's just a start
and end of every food.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.040
So you eat something, and
if you don't have the start

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.090
or you don't have
the end, then there's

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.631
something missing, whether it's
acid or something to bring it

00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:53.350
up or salt to elevate a flavor.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.100
There's something
that's missing.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.890
And that bite is
perfect because you

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.950
have the butteriness
of the brioche bun,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.040
the bitterness of the arugula,
the sweetness of the tomato

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.582
jam, the spiciness of sriracha,
and the smokiness of the pork

00:23:05.582 --> 00:23:06.081
belly.

00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:07.900
So you have you covered
a gamut of flavors.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.050
So when you eat
it, a lot happens.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.000
But also back to Wolfgang,
the sriracha aioli

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.510
is three ingredients.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.870
The tomato jam is
five ingredients.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.300
It's tomatoes, it's apples,
it's lemon juice, it's sugar.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.920
That's four ingredients.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.020
So one's got to take
several simple ideas

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.000
to create one complex idea
is the game, shall we say.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.130
Find the best
products you can find,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.040
handle them properly, and
then, create the flavor profile

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.390
so that it works.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.490
So I could teach you how to make
that dish, but you have to--

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.740
no, seriously, because they
said I have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.531
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:46.840
MARC DJOZLIJA: But they said you
have to understand the flavor

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.847
profiles to get to that point.

00:23:48.847 --> 00:23:49.930
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.580
MARC DJOZLIJA: Trial and
error, sounds like a good idea.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.620
There's lots of
things we've made

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.130
that we thought were a good
idea that we were like,

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.960
that's a terrible idea.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.190
And they never made the menu.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.856
SPEAKER: And speaking
about ingredients,

00:23:58.856 --> 00:24:01.030
and keeping it local,
and Detroit coming up,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.180
do you have a lot of-- do you
source a lot of the ingredients

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.434
that you make in the
restaurant from local places?

00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:08.100
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yes,
as much as possible.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.080
Now, the urban
farming scene isn't

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.760
growing as fast as we'd like.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:19.350
So sometimes, you want
10 pounds of green beans

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.190
and they have five
pounds of green beans.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.240
Because you want green beans.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:22.960
I want green beans.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.835
He wants green beans.

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:25.542
We all want the same
products, you know?

00:24:25.542 --> 00:24:27.150
People like Recovery
Park and people

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.810
like that are doing a
really great job with it.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.810
You can't grow fast enough
for busy restaurants.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.100
I mean, some of the places
like Chartreuse and Selden

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.500
Standard and us, we're busy.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.940
So we're using a lot of carrots.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.550
We're not using a
bunch of carrots.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.080
We're using boxes of carrots.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.930
So we do as much
as we can, and then

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.010
you just have to
supplement, accordingly.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.900
And the new facet really is
now that different people are

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.490
trying to grow stuff for you.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.142
So right now, people
engage and say,

00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:55.600
tell us what you
think you're going

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.099
to need in the summertime, even
if it's a pedestrian product

00:24:58.099 --> 00:24:58.825
like a cucumber.

00:24:58.825 --> 00:25:01.450
If you know you're going to need
it, we'll have a plot of land,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.310
we'll grow cucumbers
twice, and we'll

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.880
harvest on one while the
other ones are growing,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.379
then harvest back and forth,
back and forth, back and forth,

00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:09.490
and maybe keep you in
cucumbers all summer.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.740
So people are looking at
more interesting techniques

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.910
to try and get the
products to us, as well.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.530
SPEAKER: So are
these local sellers

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.759
who approach you sort of cold
call-ish in the restaurant?

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:20.300
MARC DJOZLIJA: A
lot of them who are.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.790
There's people in 7 Mile
and Woodward, and Bernard

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.970
Parks, who does some things at
the old school over off Monroe,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.390
and, obviously, Recovery
Park and people like that.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.967
A lot of local people
that come and say here's--

00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:35.300
they send you lists really
what's going to be available.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.380
Here's what we have now.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.860
Here's what we have in a
couple of weeks from now.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.609
And here's what we'll
have moving forward.

00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:42.430
So you try and get in
before everybody else.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.550
SPEAKER: Yeah, definitely.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.490
MARC DJOZLIJA: I don't
know if it works this way,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.198
but you try to be the
first one to email,

00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:47.915
like, I'll take the green beans.

00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:50.300
And hope I said yes before
Andy said yes or something

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.867
like that.

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:52.700
But they're all really
good friends of mine.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.310
So we like to--

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.750
everybody wants
to have something

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.162
that they can showcase, as well.

00:25:58.162 --> 00:25:59.870
SPEAKER: So you're
still, though-- you're

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.040
saying that there's an
opportunity for urban farming,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.990
too, in downtown Detroit.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.040
MARC DJOZLIJA: Oh,
no, no, absolutely.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.120
SPEAKER: If anyone's a farmer.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.470
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well, the
only thing I will say is--

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.976
SPEAKER: 20% projects.

00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:10.130
MARC DJOZLIJA: I can't
say how lucrative it is.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.940
I don't know the work
versus profit margin

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.580
to come out of it is, I mean,
a lot of our passion projects,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.000
things like that.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.020
But yeah, there's lots of room
for lots of things in Detroit,

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.675
contrary to popular opinion.

00:26:23.675 --> 00:26:25.550
SPEAKER: We just heard
about one new project.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.280
Do you have your eye
on anything else?

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.450
MARC DJOZLIJA: We always do.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.116
SPEAKER: Future?

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:34.250
MARC DJOZLIJA:
We're engaged a lot.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.140
But the town has
changed, as well.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.600
I mean, real estate
is more expensive.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.370
Contracting is more expensive.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.540
I mean, if we were talking--

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.540
if I was trying to build
Wright &amp; Company today,

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.160
3 and 1/2 years
later, it'd probably

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.919
cost me 30% to 40%
more than it did.

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:48.710
SPEAKER: Yeah, wow.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.335
MARC DJOZLIJA: Because
they said, well,

00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:51.830
the demand for contractors--

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.370
and just like we talked
about, people of the industry

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.410
having trouble filling
some of these jobs.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.640
Same thing with contractors.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.430
The LCA took up a lot of people.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.384
So a lot of projects
got put on hold

00:27:02.384 --> 00:27:03.800
because they use
as many resources

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.240
they could to get that open.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.749
And now, a lot of
the residential

00:27:06.749 --> 00:27:08.540
that's happening in
Brush Park is taking up

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.557
a lot of contractors.

00:27:09.557 --> 00:27:12.140
The guys that are going to build
your floor or the woodworkers

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.560
are all building cabinets
for different projects, now.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.695
And so the price escalates,
material escalates.

00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:26.690
And the way we desire to engage,
as far as tenant improvement

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.330
plans, money that we
expect the people who

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.160
own the buildings
to invest, as well,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.960
doesn't always jive
with everybody, either.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.117
So we talk more than we engage,
but we have an opportunity

00:27:37.117 --> 00:27:39.200
possibly on the table that
we think might work out

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.950
in the springtime.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.780
SPEAKER: Hopefully in the LCA?

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.280
In?

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:42.550
In?

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.520
MARC DJOZLIJA: If
it was that easy.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.100
[LAUGHING]

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.550
If it was that easy.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.591
SPEAKER: We'll have to
have you to the new office

00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:49.309
when it opens and maybe let you
come and do a guest chef day

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:49.850
or something.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.820
MARC DJOZLIJA: Oh,
I'd be delighted to.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.420
I'd be delighted to.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.820
SPEAKER: OK, that'd be great.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.880
Yeah.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.480
Excellent.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.570
Well, I know that we're
about 10 minutes out here.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.380
And I don't know if anyone
has any questions for Marc.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.150
But I want to make
sure I left some time.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.820
I think you might have to use
the microphone because we're

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.150
filming.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.050
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chef.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.800
I've been to Wright &amp; Co. a
couple times and I love it--

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.070
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well, thank you.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.260
AUDIENCE: --by the way.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.460
But I had a question about
the restaurant, actually.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.835
Behind the bar, there
is a beautiful painting.

00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:17.210
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah,
it's stunning.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.356
AUDIENCE: And I want to-- it's
like a ship on stormy seas.

00:28:20.356 --> 00:28:21.980
And I wanted to know,
is there a story?

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.990
I always wondered if there
there's a story behind that.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.610
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well, there is.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.210
So my business partner, Dave--

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.710
well, first of all,
the ceilings are

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.959
very high at Wright &amp; Company.

00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:30.315
So it's a very grandiose space.

00:28:30.315 --> 00:28:32.690
And we didn't want to put
mirrors or something like that.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.280
We were trying to
figure out what's

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.994
the focal point we could do.

00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:38.910
So we bantered about
lots of different things.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.640
And Dave had a smaller
replication of that painting.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.550
It's by a very famous
maritime artist, Dutch--

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.880
[INAUDIBLE] Dutch,
Ludolf Bakhuizen.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.930
And it's a replication
of a painting

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.230
from 1619 called "Ships
Running Aground in a Storm."

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.480
So Dave said it'd be cool if
we could have this focal point.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.720
So we found a local
artist, Michelle Tanguay,

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.950
and we gave her the picture.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.540
And we said, we'd like you
to replicate this for us.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.960
And so she sent us pictures
every couple of weeks

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.614
as she was standing on a ladder,
trying to paint this thing.

00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:10.280
And then, it was one
of the first things

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.488
we hung up because we didn't
want to have it damaged.

00:29:12.488 --> 00:29:15.590
So before we put the banquettes
in, she tacked it on to plywood

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.760
on the floor.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.400
And then we hung it on the wall.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.570
And our woodworking guys
actually built the frame

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.657
around the outside of it.

00:29:21.657 --> 00:29:23.240
And then we covered
in a tarp while we

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.290
did the rest of the work.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.200
And actually, people talk about
the chandelier and the turrets.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.908
Well, that was the
first thing we bought.

00:29:28.908 --> 00:29:31.640
I bought it one week at an
auction at DuMouchelle's one

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.512
week after.

00:29:32.512 --> 00:29:34.220
And it hung there for
about seven months.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.580
They were very kind to leave
it there with a sold sign

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.250
because we didn't have
anything to do with it.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.700
We didn't know-- we had to have
the ceiling done before we can

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.590
do the electrical and all
that, so it was no way to--

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.450
SPEAKER: The ceiling
is that beautiful--

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.420
I'm going to get this wrong,
but it's the tin that's the--

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.620
what do you call that,
the hammered tin?

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.290
Was is it?

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:51.532
You know it?

00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:52.990
I don't know, but
it's so gorgeous.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.385
MARC DJOZLIJA: So the ceiling is
a whole different, other story.

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:56.093
Again, there are some
really cool aspects

00:29:56.093 --> 00:29:58.400
about the building.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.152
If you're looking at the bar--

00:30:00.152 --> 00:30:02.360
you're just looking at the
bar and to the left, there

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.290
a big piece of
plaster [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.540
that some hipster artwork.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.700
That was where the
original elevator was.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.670
The building was built
in 1891 by a gentleman

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.160
called Frederick Schwankovsky.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.910
And he had the
Schwankovsky House of Music

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.290
was on the first floor.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.170
And he inhabited it until 1920
until the great Kay Jewelers

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.540
inhabited the space.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.880
And then, so downstairs
was an actual storefront

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.180
where you could buy jewelry.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.322
And the second floor was
a private viewing room

00:30:28.322 --> 00:30:30.155
where you go look at
all the fancy diamonds.

00:30:30.155 --> 00:30:33.110
And at some point, they
turned it into a ballroom

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.647
and hosted parties there.

00:30:34.647 --> 00:30:37.230
And that's where the name Wright
&amp; Company came from, as well.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.070
So we were trying to pay homage
to the history of the building,

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.820
itself.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.830
So I said, what's the
name of the building?

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.330
They said Wright Kay.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.320
And so why don't we call
it Wright &amp; Company?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.250
We're just a company that's
inhabiting this historic piece

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.765
of history in Detroit.

00:30:53.337 --> 00:30:54.920
And then, in turn,
it became the House

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.530
of Fabrics and some other
things before it became dormant.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.590
It was a couple of
nightclubs, and then it

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.850
turned out to be what it was.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.350
But the ceiling--
so the first thing

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.465
we did after we cleaned
up the space is we

00:31:05.465 --> 00:31:07.339
were going to blow out
the ceiling because we

00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:08.720
wanted to have exposed rafters.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.642
So we had to stain them, so it
didn't drip on everything else.

00:31:11.642 --> 00:31:13.850
So we got some scaffolding,
and we took leaf blowers,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.099
and we blew all the-- we
were blowing all the dust out

00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:18.469
of this building had been
vacant for a long time.

00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:20.010
And the guys upstairs
came downstairs

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.720
and they said, hey,
we need you to stop.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.720
And so we thought we were
making too much noise.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.370
And I said, are we bothering
you in some capacity?

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.900
They said, come on upstairs.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.150
So we were blowing the
dust through the cracks

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.180
of the floor and
the little ant hills

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.260
and there was dust all
through that space.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.430
So we apologized.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.090
We sent a cleaning
crew in that weekend

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.173
and had them for two days.

00:31:40.173 --> 00:31:42.110
They cleaned the
whole office building.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.200
And then Monday
morning comes around,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.950
and our representatives
from Bedrock said,

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.630
we need to talk
about the ceiling.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.240
They said, we have some
sound issues, you know,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.610
obviously this situation.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.860
They said, what if we do this?

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.490
What if we insulate it,
[? firm ?] it with plywood.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.760
We will pay for and
install any ceiling

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.100
of your choice, which sounded
very generous at the time.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.660
But when we leave,
if we ever leave,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.160
we're not taking
the ceiling with us

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.493
anyway, so will always be there.

00:32:05.493 --> 00:32:07.110
So I was amenity
to their situation.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.630
So we decided to have
something that would be shiny,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.000
so when you came
down the street,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.930
you could see the chandelier
and it speckles off the ceiling.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.860
And then hopefully, you go,
what's going on up there,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.464
to try and figure out how to get
in, have our own little game,

00:32:25.464 --> 00:32:27.630
shall we say, or several
games we're trying to play.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.340
And some of it more
purposeful than others.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.470
We didn't desire to--

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.428
we didn't desire you to
enter through the alley

00:32:34.428 --> 00:32:36.830
and have a real sign,
but to hang a sign

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.990
on a historic building
is very expensive.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.100
You have to go through
a bunch of design work.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.172
And so, at some point,
we just gave up.

00:32:43.172 --> 00:32:44.630
It just became too
much of a chore.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.320
So we have our little
sandwich board.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.278
We wanted you to enter
through the alley, which

00:32:48.278 --> 00:32:50.630
would be easier to hang
a sign because nobody

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.220
cares what you do in an alley.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.710
But when they were working
on the Metropolitan,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.296
some bricks fell off
on top of a truck

00:32:56.296 --> 00:32:58.170
and we've had scaffolding
outside ever since.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.253
It's been 3 and 1/2 years.

00:32:59.253 --> 00:33:00.600
So we never really got it.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.808
You can enter through the
alley, go up to the stairs,

00:33:02.808 --> 00:33:04.306
but we never had
the entrance where

00:33:04.306 --> 00:33:06.930
we were truly desired it because
of the construction around us.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.820
So we'll see what
happens in the future.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.570
But right now, I think,
for the most part,

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.190
people figure out
how to get there.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.330
And then, you still see
people walking around--

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.430
I was telling her about
it-- with their phones.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.090
[INAUDIBLE] out the window.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.230
They go, I know it's
around here somewhere.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.415
You know, they did it
last night [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:20.290
SPEAKER: That was us.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.430
We were using the Google
Maps to try to find you.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.860
But there is some--

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.850
there's some
cachet, if you will,

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.750
about finding the entrance
by the sandwich board.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.030
That's literally the
only way, at least

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.640
that I could see last night,
to find Wright &amp; Company.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.260
And then, getting
up the elevator,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.870
and then it kind of opens,
and you're like, wait, what?

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.247
It's a huge, beautiful space.

00:33:40.247 --> 00:33:42.080
MARC DJOZLIJA: The
intrigue in the elevator,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.350
and then, you come
around the corner,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.900
and then you walk down
the little hallway,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.066
and then the space opens up.

00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:48.525
And hopefully, everybody
feels that way.

00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:49.400
You know what I mean?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.233
SPEAKER: I think so.

00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:52.567
Yeah, you have a very special
thing going on down there.

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:54.607
MARC DJOZLIJA: When we
talked about the elevator,

00:33:54.607 --> 00:33:55.460
I skipped over it.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.297
It was one of the first
buildings in Detroit

00:33:57.297 --> 00:33:58.130
to have an elevator.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.440
So it was called the Elevator
Building, originally.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.010
SPEAKER: Oh, it was?

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.218
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, so yeah.

00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:05.330
And one other side note,
which is a cool story.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.531
The lady-- the last opera--

00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:08.989
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on what the last opera

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.159
was at the opera house--

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:14.330
the lead in the opera was
a great great granddaughter

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.954
of Frederick Schwankovsky.

00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:16.880
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.429
MARC DJOZLIJA: And so she
had never been to Detroit.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.679
She had heard about the
building and the business.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.679
And then they contacted
us from the opera house.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.790
And we had a little party.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.389
And anybody could of came.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:29.669
And she actually saying
three songs in the space--

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:30.710
SPEAKER: Oh, that's cool.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.400
MARC DJOZLIJA: --yeah, for--

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.239
SPEAKER: In the restaurant?

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:32.870
MARC DJOZLIJA: In
the restaurant.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.060
SPEAKER: Where would
you have a singer?

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.300
MARC DJOZLIJA: We just--

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.341
she was just in the turret,
you know what I mean?

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.469
And she just told the
story about her great great

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.500
grandfather and him building
the building and the history

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.719
of her family, and
then her history

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.730
and how she got back to
Detroit for the opera.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.980
And then she sang a few songs.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.429
And then that was
pretty much it.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.560
So it was cool that her--

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.937
SPEAKER: Did she
sing operatic or--

00:34:52.937 --> 00:34:54.020
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.050
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:55.620
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, so--

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.110
SPEAKER: Billowing throughout.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:57.810
MARC DJOZLIJA: And all of
the family was invited.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.270
So we saved some
places for them,

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.660
so they could watch her
sing and things like that.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.230
So it's kind of cool to bring
some of the history back.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.890
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.150
MARC DJOZLIJA: And
also, everybody

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.816
who's ever known the
Wright Kay building

00:35:06.816 --> 00:35:09.620
has some story about it, or,
it was vacant for a long time,

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.030
so people used to live in there.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.665
My father bought his
class ring downstairs.

00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:13.390
God rest his soul.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.080
SPEAKER: At Kay Jewelers?

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.600
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yes.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.933
God rest his soul, but yeah,
when he was in high school,

00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:17.600
he bought his--

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.490
when I showed him, I told him
I was going to quit my job

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.300
and open my own restaurant.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.770
And once again, the
second time he thought I

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.610
was even crazier to becoming
a chef in the first place.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:24.500
[LAUGHING]

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.280
But I showed up the building.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.750
And he goes, oh, my god, I
bought my class ring there--

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.330
SPEAKER: Aw.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.700
MARC DJOZLIJA: --when
I was in high school.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.330
So it was cool.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.246
SPEAKER: That is the
cool thing about Detroit.

00:35:31.246 --> 00:35:32.860
Everyone has some
kind of connection,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.670
even in you live
up in the burbs--

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.065
[MUSIC SOUND EFFECT]

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:36.175
--or you haven't been here very
long, it's seems like that.

00:35:36.175 --> 00:35:36.680
MARC DJOZLIJA: No, absolutely.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.610
Absolutely.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.151
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming in, Marc.

00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:40.040
We appreciate it.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.120
That's a good segue
into my question.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.480
I was just wondering,
you've been in Detroit

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.850
for a long time with
some departures outside,

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.750
but born and raised here
and went to school here,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.460
and have been very instrumental
in kind of the re-invigoration

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.510
of downtown.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.840
What do you see--

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.710
10 years from now, what do
you see Detroit as being?

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.640
And what gets you excited for
what that might look like?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.680
MARC DJOZLIJA: Well, as
much as I am from Detroit,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.870
I also am a realist
and I see the flaws.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.747
So I hope Dan Gilbert sees this.

00:36:07.747 --> 00:36:09.788
Listen, Dan, I'm telling
you what you need to do.

00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:11.420
[LAUGHING]

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.910
You know, when we first
engaged with them,

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.300
they were very purposeful about
the downtown and the Woodward

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.180
Corridor, and trying to create
unique shopping experiences.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.800
When we first met
them, they said,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.383
when we redeveloped
the Hudson's Site,

00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:26.000
we'd like to have
a department store.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.430
And I said, which department
store do you desire to have?

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.140
And they said, we'd like to
have Bloomingdale's, would

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.260
be our first choice.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.850
And so this is five years ago.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.475
I go, don't you think
Bloomingdale's is

00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:36.597
a little highfalutin
for the area?

00:36:36.597 --> 00:36:38.180
And they said, what
we're trying to do

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.030
is trying to say that there
is no-- the reason we'd

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.860
like Bloomingdale's
is because there are

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.650
none of the state of Michigan.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.400
If you want to shop
at Bloomingdale's, you

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.160
have to come downtown to do it.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.540
And so that was their
mindset as far as creating

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.840
retail of things you can't
get anywhere else, the reasons

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.645
to come downtown, to rebuild
the tax base, commerce,

00:36:56.645 --> 00:36:57.817
so on, and so forth.

00:36:57.817 --> 00:36:59.150
Hopefully, it all trickles down.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.300
And maybe you want
to live there,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.050
and then, restaurants
like ours, maybe you

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.862
want to live by
there, live downtown

00:37:03.862 --> 00:37:06.320
because there's a cool place
to eat and drink and all this.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.710
But what we do need
to do next is--

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.700
the QLine is fine.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.620
But we need to create better
public transportation.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.760
And we need to create
purposeful retail.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.290
And I joked around
it the other day

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.195
like, where do I go buy
a pair of socks downtown?

00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:22.070
You know what I mean?

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.653
I live right on the
Woodward Corridor,

00:37:23.653 --> 00:37:26.360
but where do I go buy
the necessities of home

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.500
for downtown?

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.770
And if you're expecting the--

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.390
with the escalation
of residential,

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.260
which was also
escalating in price.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.010
For anybody that knows
and lives downtown,

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.770
it's not cheap to live downtown.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.720
And if you're expecting people
to have a car because all

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.660
of your retail is 10 miles that
way, that way, or that way,

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.289
pay the car insurance, and
not be able to get around

00:37:47.289 --> 00:37:48.830
on public transportation,
then you've

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.740
got to start building things
where they don't need a car.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.940
They don't need to pay that.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.856
And they don't need the
public transportation.

00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:56.600
Because I can take
the QLine to a Target,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.990
or I can get to a
Meijer, or whatever you

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.420
desire, or a
Nordstrom Rack, so I

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.207
go buy a shirt to go
out on a Friday evening.

00:38:05.207 --> 00:38:07.790
Those are the things that I have
to start filling in the gaps,

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.620
or the residential
will never truly

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.066
fill out, because
people will say,

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:12.440
I can live somewhere
else cheaper

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.629
where I can have all
the amenities I need.

00:38:14.629 --> 00:38:15.920
They got it in, like, Ferndale.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.920
And then we don't rebuild
the tax base is really

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.835
what this is all
about, getting people

00:38:19.835 --> 00:38:24.380
to live, work, engage in
downtown in the wake of,

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.360
what, three years of
bankruptcy, only three

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.430
years out of bankruptcy.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.013
And that's the other
crazy thing, too.

00:38:29.013 --> 00:38:31.920
I was talking about this is
the elevator to somebody.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.710
You know, Wright &amp; Company's
only been open 3 and 1/2 years.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.130
And although, we were
in the forefront,

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.540
we don't take really
any credit from that.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.592
If Andy Hollyday hadn't
bought the building,

00:38:38.592 --> 00:38:40.800
Selden Standard would have
been open before we would,

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.750
because they--

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.500
he quit his job a year
before I quit mine.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.958
And we're really
good friends, too.

00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:46.700
So that's why I know.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.770
But they opened a
few months after us.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.620
But all of this has really only
happened the last three years.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.220
You know, you talk about all
the cool restaurants or bars

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.617
or shopping or reasons
to go downtown,

00:38:58.617 --> 00:39:00.450
it's really all happened
the last few years.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.090
And we get clouded by that.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.590
It seems like it's
been a long time.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.381
Like, you said, I've
been here a long time.

00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:06.087
I probably have.

00:39:06.087 --> 00:39:06.670
I'm a veteran.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.880
I've been here a
whopping 10 years.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.830
You know what I mean?

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.790
It's been such a short
time to actually--

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.832
to get all of this going.

00:39:13.832 --> 00:39:15.164
So it's going to take more time.

00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:16.620
But that's what I
really hope for.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.940
I hope for, not only
for myself, selfishly,

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.040
but so that for people
that live downtown say,

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.290
I want to stay because
I can get everything

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.630
I need out my front door
at some particular point.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:28.880
SPEAKER: That's a great point.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.590
We'll make sure we
get this to Dan.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.131
MARC DJOZLIJA: I'll
have to tell him.

00:39:32.131 --> 00:39:33.060
[LAUGHING]

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.560
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.140
MARC DJOZLIJA: Tell him, to be
able to get everything you need

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.370
is cool, too.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.620
SPEAKER: Well, I couldn't--

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.672
I am down there every day.

00:39:40.672 --> 00:39:42.380
And I didn't know
there's a Lululemon now

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.981
underneath where you live and a
Nike store and, obviously, John

00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:46.480
Varvatos.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.120
But whole stretch,
if you guys haven't

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.960
been down there
in the last month,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.305
it's just even boomed even more.

00:39:52.305 --> 00:39:54.680
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yeah, there's
Under Armour, Warby Parker--

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.310
SPEAKER: Under Armour, too,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.730
MARC DJOZLIJA: --Bonobos.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:56.790
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.860
MARC DJOZLIJA: There's some more
coming, you know what I mean?

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.380
So I'll let Bedrock do their
own press, so I don't tell.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.036
[LAUGHING]

00:40:01.036 --> 00:40:03.410
Let's talk about who they're
going to put into the space.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.520
I'm just saying, you know.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.660
Just because they
tell me, I shouldn't

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.743
be telling everybody else.

00:40:06.743 --> 00:40:08.330
I'll let them do the
announcement when

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.290
the new place is going to come.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.520
But they are going to fill
up the Woodward Corridor.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.470
They have other people
that are engaging.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.890
Some cool things are going
to do on the Hudson's

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.830
site in the next few
years after they--

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.413
now, that's going to be really
interesting to watch them build

00:40:18.413 --> 00:40:22.040
a 61-story residential/
office building right smack

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.477
in the middle of Detroit.

00:40:23.477 --> 00:40:25.810
It's not going to make parking
or getting down there any

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.185
easier, but it'll be really
interesting to watch.

00:40:28.185 --> 00:40:30.060
SPEAKER: Well, all that
other stuff is great,

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.270
but Wright &amp; Company
is phenomenal.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.870
And really, we know that you
are early into the scene,

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.670
into the restaurant
scene, really even now,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.755
but we appreciate
you having such a--

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:43.050
it's a luxurious experience,
from a culinary standpoint,

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.160
but it is such an super
casual and approachable

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.350
and friendly and
warm place to be.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.699
So thank you for giving
us the opportunity

00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:52.490
to have a restaurant
like that in our city.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.000
MARC DJOZLIJA: I'll
say one more thing.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.330
Well, that was the main goal,
as I told you last night.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.830
The original menu only was--

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.176
everything was under $20.

00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:01.800
We didn't want to feel like you
can only come on your birthday,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.260
your anniversary,
Valentine's Day,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.880
feel like you could
come on a regular basis.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.690
And there's only one
dish that's eclipsed it,

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.420
just because we wanted a
better steak, and it's $22.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.934
So we want you to
be able to feel

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:12.350
like you can come over there,
have a glass of wine, a bite

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.450
to eat before a game,
after the opera house,

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.640
anything in between
and not break the bank.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.420
And I think that's a very
Detroit way of looking at it,

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:19.920
too.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.870
SPEAKER: It is.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.300
MARC DJOZLIJA: That
everybody can come and enjoy

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.640
Wright &amp; Company, regardless
of how you're dressed,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.632
where you're going, and
be able to enjoy it.

00:41:27.632 --> 00:41:29.340
SPEAKER: Well, we hope
that's the Detroit

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.290
in 10 years from now.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.270
MARC DJOZLIJA: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.140
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:33.860
Well, thanks.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.550
Let's give Marc a big
round of applause.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.139
And thank you, again,
for being here.

00:41:37.139 --> 00:41:38.180
MARC DJOZLIJA: Thank you.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:38.680
Thank you.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.230
[APPLAUSE]
