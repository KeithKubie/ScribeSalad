00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.670
It is
a local purÃ©ed chard

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.339
that is topped with poached crab

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.975
and then splashed with
a really yummy ramp dressing.

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.443
I love yummy ramps.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.211
Oh, I love, um, chards.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.379
We like to
say here that ramp

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.815
is the truffle
of onions.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.650
(chuckles)
It's a dumb little joke.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.819
(together)
We like to say that, too.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:19.987
(chuckles)
That's funny.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.622
Now have you guys
been to Octavia before?

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.657
No, we are
poppin' our cherry.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.892
Wow.
(chuckles)

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.360
Well, you just let me
do the driving.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.928
I'm gonna
take excellent care

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:28.729
of you guys
tonight.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.631
Okay.
Once again...

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.166
<i>je m'appelle John,</i>
and <i>bonne anniversaire.</i>

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.335
Oh, thank you.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.336
Wow.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.405
He's tall
and he's bilingual?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.474
I'm short and I can't
speak English good.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.909
He probably has
a French press

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.810
and one of those things
that in the bathroom

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:44.978
you clean
your butthole with.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.713
Oh, a bidet.
A bidet.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.215
(sighs)
He's so classy.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.349
Totally.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.051
You're bad-mouthing me
to Anton now?

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.619
You cannot
find one minute

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.154
to go pick my sister up
at the airport?

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.556
Tell her fat
ass to flag down a cab

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:56.890
like a person.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.925
My sister is
an ex-junkie, John, okay?

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.326
She needs someone to
pick her up,

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.528
she can't be unsupervised.
Jesus Christ,
she's a grown woman.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.664
She can't be babysat
her whole life, Cheryl.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.065
Well, thank you so much
for the support.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.233
Support? Tell her to give
back the laptop she stole.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.434
She never stole that!

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.635
You have no proof that she--
Are you kidding me?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.103
You need to wake up.
What? You're crazy.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.738
I don't know that she gave
us bedbugs for sure,

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.173
but I'm
pretty damn positive.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.274
This is why I wanted
you to go to Al Anon.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.277
Salmon, we got onion rings,
we got a gumbo.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.912
How's the steak doing?
