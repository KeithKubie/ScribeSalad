MASTURBATION GAME HAD TO ADAPT.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.058 align:start position:0% line:8%

I GET IT.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.628 align:start position:0% line:7%
THE GUY HAS NO PARENTS.

HIS BODY.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start position:0% line:8%
YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHO HE'S SHARING A ROOM WITH.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.137 align:start position:0% line:7%
HOUSEKEEPING.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.272 align:start position:0% line:7%
JUST KIDDING.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.174 align:start position:0% line:7%
IT'S YOUR ARCH NEMESIS.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start position:0% line:8%

WHEN YOU'RE ON THE COMIC-CON
CIRCUIT, ROOMS FILL UP QUICK.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.253 align:start position:0%
ARE YOU TRYING TO SHATTER
THE GLASS CEILING,

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.490 align:start position:0%
OR JUST CRAWL AROUND
ON TOP OF IT?

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.324 size:81% position:41%
ARE YOU AFRAID OF SPIDERS?

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.659 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T LIKE 'EM?

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.426 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SPIDERS ARE CREEPY.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.127 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AGREED.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.295
NOW, HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN HURT?

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.262 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:04.397
LIKE, JUST BRUISES, SCRATCHES.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.098 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE GOOD BALANCE?

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.868 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO?

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.635 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:10.269 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT
FOR YOU?

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:10.903 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; IT'S--YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.904 size:84% position:42%
LIKE, REALLY CLUMSY, BUT...

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.373 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER TRIPPED
WHILE YOU WERE UP ON TOP

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:14.807 align:start position:0%
OF A ROOFTOP?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.174 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I HAVE.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:16.442 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE?

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.710
&gt;&gt; I WAS KIND OF RUNNING ACROSS
AND THEY HAD, LIKE, THESE WIRES

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.179
ON THE TOP, AND I DIDN'T SEE IT,
SO I KIND OF JUST FACE-PLANTED.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:21.214 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; BUT NOT OFF THE EDGE?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.081 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.316 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NEVER HAD ANY CLOSE CALLS
ON THE EDGE?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY, NO.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.418 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU DO A PULL-UP?

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.419 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:26.886 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DO A PULL-UP?

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.858 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I WANNA HEAR
WHEN YOU'RE UP ON TOP OF A--

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start position:0%
OF A CRANE,
IS THAT YOU COULDN'T--

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.696 align:start position:0%
IF YOU DID FALL--
DO A SINGLE PULL-UP

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.631 align:start position:0%
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.699 align:start position:0%
WHO'S FILMING YOU?

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:40.800
&gt;&gt; IT'S USUALLY MY BOYFRIEND.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:46.772 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK THAT HE'S HOPING
FOR THAT ULTIMATE VIDEO?

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:47.539 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DUNNO.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:50.443 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK HE'D
KEEP FILMING?

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.177 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UM...

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.545 align:start position:0%
THAT THOUGHT HAS CROSSED
MY MIND.

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:53.613 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, I SURE HOPE SO.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN WHEN
SOMETHING GOES WRONG

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.849 align:start position:0%
AND THE CAMERA MAN
SHUTS THE CAMERA OFF.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start position:0%
EVEN IF YOU DROP IT,
LET US HEAR THE SOUNDS.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.156 align:start size:63% position:38% line:8%
IT SEEMS THE EARTH'S
YELLOW SUN TURNS SUN

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.858 align:start position:0% line:7%
INTO A SUPER FREAK.

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.896 align:start position:0% line:8%
AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS
THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.198 align:start position:0% line:7%
STARTS TO GET TO YOU.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:15.601 align:start position:0% line:8%
IS HE FILLING IT WITH AIR
OR SEMEN?

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:16.802 align:start position:0% line:8%
I BET HE ALSO HAS A CHUNK
OF KRYPTONITE SHOVED

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:21.807 align:start position:0% line:7%
UP HIS POOPER.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.776 align:start position:0% line:8%
IT STARTED WITH UGLY WOMEN
BEING ON TELEVISION.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.811 align:start position:0% line:8%
NOW HERE WE ARE
FAT SUPERHEROES.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:28.814 align:start position:0% line:7%
THANK YOU, OBAMA.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:31.450 align:start position:0% line:8%
SUPE'S NOT THE ONLY KINKY MEMBER
OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:34.787 align:start position:0% line:8%
BATMAN GETS OFF ON BEING
TREATED LIKE A BABY.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.422 align:start position:0% line:7%
HOLY STINK BOMBS!

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.591 line:7%
DOES BATMAN HAVE TO GO POTTY?

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.959 line:7%
&gt;&gt; CLEAN MY BUTT CAVE, ROBIN.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:41.761 align:start position:0% line:8%
&gt;&gt; UGH, SOMEBODY'S GOT
AN UPSET TUMMY.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:47.500 align:start position:0% line:8%
&gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT'S IN MY DIAPER
THAT DEFINES ME.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:48.901 size:84% position:42% line:7%
&gt;&gt; MUST BE AN ORPHAN THING.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.970
WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS.
THE ECONOMY IS HURTING EVERYONE.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.939
EVEN BRUCE WAYNE
HAD TO TAKE A JOB

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.875
HANDING OUT TITTY BAR COUPONS
ON THE STRIP.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.578
UH-OH, LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME
TROUBLE IN SIN CITY.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.779
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.648
ABOUT JEFF DUNHAM'S
UPCOMING APPEARANCE.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.484
WE'RE ABOUT TO WATCH BATMAN
FACE HIS TOUGHEST FOE YET--

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.220
A LIQUORED-UP CHOLO.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.254
[laughter]

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.723
- JUST SUCK MY [bleep].

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:15.428
- BATMAN JUST TOLD HIM TO SUCK
HIS MOTHER[bleep] [bleep].

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.797
THAT'S DEFINITELY
CHRISTIAN BALE.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.465
[laughter]

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.300
THAT GUY'S GOT A TEMPER.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.602
RIDDLE ME THIS.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.937
WHERE IS BOY WONDER
WHEN YOU NEED HIM?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.473
PROBABLY AT TAO, MAKING OUT WITH
ONE OF THE HOT MALE BARTENDERS

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.242
THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.277
[laughter]

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.946
HOLY BITCH SLAP.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.381
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO PICK A FIGHT

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:36.482
WITH THE DARK KNIGHT.

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:37.750
THAT'S HOW HEATH LEDGER
DIED.

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.418
[audience ohs]

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:40.620
- SOMEBODY BREAK IT UP.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.787
- UH-OH.
[audience ohs]

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.888
THE IRONY.

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.357
A SPINE INJURY
WAS THE SAME THING

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.358
THAT PARALYZED SUPERMAN.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.859
[audience ohs]

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:49.428
THIS IS WHY NO ONE IN THE UFC
FIGHTS WITH A CAPE.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:52.531
SURE IT LOOKS AMAZING,
BUT IT'S REALLY RESTRICTIVE.

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:56.936
[audience ohs]

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.972
SO HARD WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOUR HERO IS ONLY A HUMAN

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.276
AND MOST LIKELY HOMELESS.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.677
OH, HE'S WOBBLY.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.812
BUT THAT MIGHT JUST BE
BECAUSE HE'S DRUNK.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.714
WE'RE JUST GLAD
THAT CHRISTOPHER NOLAN

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.650
DIDN'T MAKE THIS CLIP
THREE HOURS TOO LONG.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.819
AND FOR THAT,
WE THANK YOU.
