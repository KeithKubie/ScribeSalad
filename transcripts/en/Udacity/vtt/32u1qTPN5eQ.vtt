00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.510
Let's go ahead and give our student
user access to pseudo themselves.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.610
I'll first copy the vagrant file and
name it student.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.290
I'll then need to make
a small edit to this file and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.030
I'll just use nano to do that.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.007
This second line here is actually
what's doing all of the work.

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.564
The file name doesn't mean anything,

00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:21.905
so we'll change the word
vagrant here to student.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.587
There are a few more options here.

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:25.315
And if you'd like to
understand them all,

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.011
I've placed a link in the instructor
notes for more information.

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:32.572
For now, we just want student users
pseudo access to function exactly as

00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.825
the vagrant users currently does.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.666
After saving that file, I've switched
back to my terminal where I'm logged in

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.510
as the student and we'll try to
run this pseudo command again.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.507
And there we go, we see the results.

00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:48.280
Our student user now has
access to use pseudo.
