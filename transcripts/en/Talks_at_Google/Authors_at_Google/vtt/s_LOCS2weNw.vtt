00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.747
PRESENTER: Please
welcome Allie Brosh.

00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:04.299
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.840
ALLIE BROSH: OK, so
I'm going to read

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.550
you the first story in the book.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700
So if you haven't
read the book yet,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.787
you're getting a head start.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.370
Let me make sure my
clicker's working.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.480
When I was 10 years old, I
wrote a letter to my future self

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.600
and buried it in my backyard.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.370
17 years later, I
remembered that I

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.922
was supposed to remember to
dig it up two years earlier.

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:31.880
I looked forward to
getting a nostalgic glimpse

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.989
into my childhood.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.780
Perhaps I would marvel
at my own innocence,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.840
or see the first glimmer
of my current aspirations.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.500
As it turns out, it just made
me feel real weird about myself.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.980
The letter was scrawled
in green crayon

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.739
on the back of the utility bill.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.280
My 10-year-old self
had obviously not

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.092
spent much time planning
out the presentation of it.

00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:55.550
Most likely, I had simply been
walking through the kitchen,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.140
and suddenly realized
it was entirely

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.170
possible to write a
letter to my future self.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.980
The overwhelming excitement
of this realization

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.180
probably cause me to
panic and short circuit,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.822
making me unable to locate
proper writing elements.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:15.530
There was no time for
that kind of thing.

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:21.710
I did, however, manage to
fight through the haze of chaos

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.240
and impulse long enough to
find a crayon stub and a paper

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.430
surface to match it against.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.030
The letter begins thusly.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.620
"Dear 25-year-old."

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.330
Note, not dear 25-year-old
me, or dear 25-year-old self.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.355
Just dear 25-year-old.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.310
Do you still like dogs?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.950
What is your favorite dog?

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:53.300
Do you have a job training dogs?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.055
Is Murphy still alive?

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:02.810
Foreshadowing.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.229
What is your favorite food?

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.479
Are mom and dad still alive?

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:15.855
I feel it's important to note
the order of those questions.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.360
Obviously, dog-related
subjects were my chief concern.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.820
Murphy was my family's
dog, followed closely

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.719
by the need to know my
future favorite food.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.260
I feel that the
double question marks

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.640
speak to how important
that question was.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.223
And you guys can't
see that, but there

00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:34.330
were double question
marks in there.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.580
Only then did I pause to
wonder whether my parents had

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.624
survived.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:48.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.020
The letter continues with a
section titled, "About Me."

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.490
My name is Allie, and
I am 10 years old.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.039
I have blonde hair
and blue eyes.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.580
My favorite dog is
a German Shepherd.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.310
My second favorite
dog is a husky.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.190
My third favorite dog
is a Doberman Pinscher.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.304
This is troubling for a number
of reasons, the first of which

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:09.470
is that I apparently thought
my future self wouldn't

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.518
be aware of my
name or eye color.

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:23.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:24.730
The second thing is
the fact that I just

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.360
tacked on my favorite
dog breeds at the end

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.810
there, like it was every bit
as important to my identity

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.580
as the other things, as if
my past self had imagined

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.304
my future self standing in the
yard, above the upturned earth,

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:35.720
clutching my letter
and screaming,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.510
but what dogs did I like?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.160
How am I supposed to understand
my identity without knowing

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.525
what dogs I liked when I was 10?

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:49.890
I take a break from
writing at that point

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.514
to draw several pictures of what
appear to be German shepherds.

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.690
Below the German shepherds, I
wrote the three most disturbing

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.920
words in the entire letter,
three words that revealed more

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.710
about my tenuous
grasp on reality

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.590
than anything else I have
uncovered about my childhood.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.370
There at the bottom
of the letter,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.050
I had taken my
crayon stub and used

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.130
it to craft the
following sentence.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.513
"Please write back."

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:27.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.620
Judging by the thick,
purposeful lines in each letter,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.340
I was applying a truly
impressive amount of pressure

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.760
to the crayon.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.204
The sincerity of the
request is unmistakable.

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:39.370
When I asked my future self
what my favorite dog is,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.370
or whether my mom and
dad were still alive,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.000
I actually expected
to get answers.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.220
And apparently, I still
expected to be 10 years old

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.967
when I got those answers.

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:48.800
"Please write back."

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.980
I imagine myself patiently
standing in the yard,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.897
day after day,
thinking, any time now.

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:53.980
It's going to happen soon.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.840
I just know it.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.250
Time travel is a
complex subject that I

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.900
don't expect a 10-year-old
to fully understand.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.385
But this is more than just
a basic misunderstanding

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:07.010
of time travel.

00:05:10.468 --> 00:05:29.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.700
I'm almost definitely
not a time traveler.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.330
But in case I am, I
decided to write back.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.160
In fact, I decided
to write letters

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.970
to several iterations
of my past self,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.053
because I felt there were
important things I could

00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:42.470
explain to myself or things
I could warn myself about.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.400
Allow me to begin with a
letter to my two-year-old self.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:55.211
Dear two-year-old, face
cream is not edible.

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:56.960
No matter how much it
looks like frosting,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.381
no matter how many
times you try,

00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:00.630
it's always going to be face
cream and never frosting.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.080
I promise I wouldn't
lie to you about this.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.788
It's honestly never
going to be frosting.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.565
For the love of
fuck, please stop.

00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:19.610
I need those organs
you're ruining.

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:26.520
Dear four-year-old.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.380
Allow me preface this
by saying that I don't

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.380
know why you started eating
salt in the first place.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.690
But regardless of the
precipitating circumstances,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.220
there you are.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.000
As soon as you became aware
that eating huge amounts of salt

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.945
is really, really
uncomfortably salty,

00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:50.790
you should have
stopped eating salt.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.560
That's the solution.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.580
The solution is not
to begin eating pepper

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.680
to cancel out the salt.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.000
You've found yourself in this
predicament several times now.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.458
And every time, you get trapped
in this totally preventable

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:07.080
cycle.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.570
You've done more than
enough experimenting

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.403
to come to the conclusion
that pepper is not

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:12.837
the opposite of salt
all by yourself.

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:14.920
But somehow, you seem to
remain stubbornly unaware

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.550
of this fact.

00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:26.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.630
To reiterate, no matter
how much pepper you eat,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.520
it won't undo the
ludicrous amount of salt

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.834
you ate before it.

00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:34.000
The only thing you're
accomplishing by eating pepper

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is making your mouth taste
like pepper and salt.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.064
Similarly, switching
back to salt

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:42.480
again won't cancel
out the burning

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.100
from the pepper you ate to
cancel out the original salt.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.460
How is this so
difficult to understand?

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.210
You can stop whenever
you want to do.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.014
As a side note, you
really need to start

00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:56.180
learning from your mistakes.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.680
Believe me, I know
what happens when

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.640
you discover electric
fences next year.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.056
And you could do without that
seventh jolt of electricity.

00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:05.665
Dear five-year-old.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.850
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.850
Normal children don't have
dead imaginary friends.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.982
Normal children don't
pick open every single one

00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:26.440
of their chicken
pox scabs and then

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.580
stand naked and bleeding
in the darkened doorway

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.570
to their bedroom until
someone walks past and asks

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.370
what they are doing.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.005
Furthermore, normal children
don't respond by saying,

00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:39.130
I wanted to know what all
my blood would look like.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:45.940
Normal children also don't
watch their parents sleep

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.650
from the corner of their room.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.259
Mom was really scarred by "The
Exorcist" when she was younger,

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.550
and she doesn't know how to
cope with your increasingly

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.950
creepy behavior.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.930
Please stop.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.730
Please, please stop.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.969
Dear six-year-old.

00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:03.010
You're having an absurdly
difficult time learning

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:14.815
the letter R. You
practice all the time,

00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:17.190
and you have mastered every
other letter in the alphabet,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.660
both uppercase and lowercase.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.940
But for reasons beyond
my comprehension,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.110
R just destroys you.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.705
Look at this.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.710
How does that happen?

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.717
How do you mess
something up that badly?

00:09:37.717 --> 00:09:39.050
The first one is understandable.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.780
But what's going on
with that middle one?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.900
Have did that extra
protrusion get there?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.460
And look at the tiny
one on the right.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.870
That one has four protrusions.

00:09:53.356 --> 00:09:54.730
I'm not an expert
on protrusions,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.730
but that's way too many.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.960
I think if you took some
time to relax and really

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.660
look at the letter R, you'd
see that it's not nearly as

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.110
complicated as you're making it.

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:09.350
Dear seven-year-old.

00:10:20.022 --> 00:10:21.605
Look at the other
children around you.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.665
Do you see how they're
wearing clothing?

00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:30.290
That's because they're
seven years old,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.706
and they've all
realized that it's

00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:34.780
no longer appropriate to take
their clothes off in public.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.446
But you haven't
realized that, have you?

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.070
People have tried to
explain it to you.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.890
Your teachers have tried.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.000
Your parents have tried.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.041
Even the other students
have expressed discomfort

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:46.240
with your persistent and
inexplicable nakedness.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.730
But you just don't stop.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.865
Why do you want to
be naked so badly?

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:52.370
Do you even know why?

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.460
Are you overtaken by
forces beyond your control

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.490
that make you do this?

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.140
Regardless, clothing
is a reality

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.540
that you need to accept.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.034
There are no loopholes to this.

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.700
You can't take your
clothes off and hide

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.122
in the corner hoping
no one notices.

00:11:11.122 --> 00:11:12.830
You can't trick the
teachers into letting

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.896
you be naked by burying
yourself in the sandbox.

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:19.470
Your clothes are in
a pile next to you.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.990
They know.

00:11:25.482 --> 00:11:26.190
Dear 10-year-old.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.930
Wow, you really like dogs.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.840
In fact, you like dogs
so much, that I'm not

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.240
even sure it's
emotionally healthy.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.740
It might be normal
to love dogs a lot,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.590
or to be really
interested in dogs.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.767
But you go way, way past that.

00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:48.600
Normal children don't
walk around pretending

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.900
to be a dog nearly as much
as you do, for example.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.520
You're 10.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.880
It makes people wonder about
your developmental progress

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.230
when you growl and bark at them.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.882
An even more concerning
issue is the obstacle course.

00:12:00.882 --> 00:12:03.340
Fine, you want to train your
dog to run through an obstacle

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.100
course.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.130
That's pretty normal.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.440
What isn't normal is
making your mother time you

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.820
as you crawl through
the course on all fours

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.154
over and over again.

00:12:13.154 --> 00:12:15.070
You're making mom think
that she did something

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.195
wrong to make you this way.

00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:26.730
Now that we've gotten
that out of the way,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.230
allow me answer your questions.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.850
Do you still like dogs?

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.900
Yes, but not as much as you do.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.660
I've developed a healthy
relationship with dogs.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.600
What is your favorite dog?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.376
I don't know.

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:41.750
This may cause a
surprise to you,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.160
but knowing exactly where
each dog breed ranks

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
on my list of favorites
isn't the pressing issue

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.935
that it used to be.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.180
Do you have a job training dogs?

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:50.680
No.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.388
I can't even train my
own dogs, let alone

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:54.960
the dogs of other people.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.960
Is Murphy still alive?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.760
Of course not.

00:13:02.105 --> 00:13:03.480
I don't know
whether you're being

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.313
optimistic are you
actually don't understand

00:13:05.313 --> 00:13:07.044
that dogs won't live to be 25.

00:13:07.044 --> 00:13:09.460
But you really set yourself
up for a lot of disappointment

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.420
there.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.840
What is your favorite food?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.590
Nachos.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.030
Which is fortunate,
because in the future,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.405
you're dysfunctional and you
don't take care of yourself.

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:20.550
So you end up eating
a whole lot of nachos.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.400
Are mom and dad still alive?

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.000
Actually, you turn
out to be Batman,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.291
so we had to have them put
down for storyline purposes.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.750
Dear 13-year-old.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.200
I think everyone was relieved
when you started to grow out

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.460
of your unhealthy
obsession with dogs.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.540
Unfortunately, now you
think you're a wizard.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.760
I know this because I found
your collection of spells.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.099
Tell me, how does mixing
dijon mustard with sand,

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:53.890
and then eating it,
makes someone love you?

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.629
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:01.670
First of all, I thought
that your extensive early

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.510
experiences with ingesting
nonfood substances

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.240
would put you off of
attempting something like this.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.930
Secondly, no one is
going to love you

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.471
until you stop doing things like
trying to make them love you

00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:12.520
by eating mustard sand.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.290
Dear other iterations
of my past self.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.979
Thank you for not
being so goddamn

00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:27.020
weird that I felt I had
to address you personally

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.310
in a letter from the future.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.373
I commend you.

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:31.846
The end.

00:14:31.846 --> 00:14:47.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.620
So, questions I guess, now?

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.721
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:14:57.721 --> 00:14:58.387
ALLIE BROSH: Hi.

00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:00.387
AUDIENCE: What's your
writing process like?

00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:01.220
ALLIE BROSH: Oh boy.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.190
OK.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:08.710
So I start out with a really
specific but vague sense

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.360
of what I want the
post to feel like

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360
and what I want it to read like.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.855
The problem with
that is that it's

00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:15.230
sort of like
looking at something

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.480
out of your peripheral vision.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.360
You can't really focus on it.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.400
And so you have to just
steer closer to it.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.900
And you know when
it's really wrong.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.790
You don't know when it's right.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.070
So most of the
writing a post process

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.780
is just steering
it closer to what

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.850
this arbitrary, weird mental
image I have in my head is.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.470
I also have a folder
system on my desktop.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.690
I have the idea farm.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.940
And that's where there's just
like one-word, random ideas.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.440
Sometimes I don't
even remember what

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.400
I was thinking
when I wrote them.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.480
But I revisit that
folder periodically

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.780
and try to see if there's
any new perspective that I

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.320
have on one of those things.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.410
And if there is a
new perspective--

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.560
like maybe a new angle,
something that can actually

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.404
steer it toward being an
actual story with structure--

00:15:58.404 --> 00:15:59.820
I move it to another
folder, which

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.370
is-- what's that one called.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.922
I think it's post-holding area.

00:16:05.922 --> 00:16:07.880
And that's where I start
actually working on it

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.220
legitimately.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.850
And then once it
starts taking shape,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.010
to the point where I
feel like I can maybe

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.140
start adding drawings,
I move it to the folder

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.040
called "Look at
this, motherfucker."

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.510
And that's to get
me to look at it.

00:16:22.597 --> 00:16:26.164
Because I won't otherwise.

00:16:26.164 --> 00:16:27.580
And then once it's
in that folder,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.121
I know that it's serious and I
need to take it very seriously

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:31.779
and start drawing pictures.

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:33.070
Does that answer your question?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.810
All right.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.860
As someone who has
had dead fish before,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.660
I can say that I
really appreciated

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.390
that particular comic.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.900
And I think it was
widely recognized

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.740
as something that was very human
and an interesting, different

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.640
perspective on
the subject than I

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.530
think many other people
had ever seen before.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.972
And I think that was really
courageous and great.

00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:57.930
ALLIE BROSH: Thank you.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for writing that.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.610
And as a follow up question,
what's your favorite dog?

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.550
ALLIE BROSH: My favorite dog?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.890
Oh boy.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.390
A wolf.

00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:11.319
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.920
Is there a technical
term for the hair piece

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.150
that your character wears?

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.140
Is it a ponytail?

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.200
ALLIE BROSH: OK.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.560
That's-- I sort of have come
to think of it as a shark fin

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.619
a little bit.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:24.930
It did start out as hair.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.359
And then I got sort of annoyed
drawing hair for myself,

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.950
and so I just did this
little triangle thing.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.991
And now it's a shark fin.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.370
I just wanted to
say, first of all,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.620
that I don't know if it's the
same post that guy was talking

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.660
about, but I really,
really loved the post

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.280
about Allie trying to kill the
fish, then she would spare it.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.466
Yeah, that was my favorite.

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:49.590
I was cracking up for ages.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.140
But anyways, I wanted
to ask, you always

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.760
seem to have this wealth of
ideas that you write about.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.920
And I was wondering how
you prevent yourself

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.690
from hitting blogger's block?

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.670
ALLIE BROSH: Well, I feel like I
thought that I was out of ideas

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:08.100
pretty much like three weeks
after I started my blog.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.580
And I don't know.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.840
I just keep going back
to it and keep trying.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.280
Like I said, I write down
in may ideas farm thing,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.307
I just will write down.

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:18.140
Even if I think something's
a horrible idea,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.515
I'll write it down
anyway if it's

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.410
a word that maybe is intriguing.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.030
And I've had stuff where I come
back to it three years later.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.988
And it's like, finally.

00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:27.790
OK, now I can do
something with this.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.400
Whereas before, I maybe
hadn't had the experience yet

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.840
that would allow me to turn
that actually into a story.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.560
There are some stories that
are you had to be there

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.000
stories, until I figure out
what the little ironies are,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.730
what the little inconsistencies
are in the story

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.840
to draw out to make
it actually funny

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.667
and read like there's
a structure to it.

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:49.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.666
ALLIE BROSH: You're welcome.

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:54.053
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:54.053 --> 00:18:56.050
ALLIE BROSH: Oh, hi.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.185
I like your cone.

00:18:58.185 --> 00:18:59.610
That's good.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.470
AUDIENCE: So your drawings have
this amazing like-- they're

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.730
deformed in these weird
ways that are also,

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.027
they seem to get across
the emotion more than

00:19:15.027 --> 00:19:16.860
if it was just like a
normal looking person.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.490
I'm wondering, do
you know beforehand

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.200
how you're going to deform
a face that it looks

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.634
so proud and so twisted, or do
you try like a million times?

00:19:25.634 --> 00:19:27.550
ALLIE BROSH: I do have
to try a million times.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.049
Like what I was
saying before, where

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:31.700
I have this really vague
but very specific thing.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.480
If that makes sense.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.990
It's a specific sense.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.350
But the image in
my head is vague.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.270
And I have to do quite a
few drafts of my drawings

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.340
to get it to look somewhat
close to what I'm imagining.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.130
And so sometimes,
it's actually good

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.600
that I don't know what
I'm doing, because I'll

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.860
draw something and
I'll be like, oh hey,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.276
I wouldn't have
thought of drawing

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:55.590
that face if I didn't
just take a stab at it.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.270
But yeah, it definitely
takes a really long time

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.070
to get the face just right.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.920
Sometimes the people,
the eye, if you

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.890
move it even like
half a millimeter,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.279
it makes a huge difference
in the facial expression.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.820
And you wouldn't
think that something

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.640
like that would make
such a big difference.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.087
But I guess maybe
just to me it does.

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.420
AUDIENCE: Well, they're awesome.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:14.920
Thank you.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.650
ALLIE BROSH: You're welcome.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.230
AUDIENCE: Did you intentionally
hit on the artistic style

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.280
and keep it consistent
intentionally,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.856
or is this just the
thing that came out?

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.730
ALLIE BROSH: This is
the thing that came out.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.990
It's been an evolution.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.780
When I first started
drawing my character,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.510
it was just like a circle head
with a triangle body thing.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.330
And since then, there
are things like edits

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.710
I've made to it that have slowly
made it what it is today, which

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.500
is sort of like this
fish-tadpole-bird thing,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.760
I don't know what.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.758
All the shapes that I
find funny, I guess.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.280
I think your work is really
relatable to a ton of people,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.880
because of how genuine it feels.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.540
You're part of a generation
of authors like Jenny Lawson

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.250
and Matt [? Eiman ?] that
you just read their stuff

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.899
and you feel so much
like this is something

00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:15.190
that could have happened to me.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.290
Or I remember something
that happened me now

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.390
that exactly is like that.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.380
I wonder though,
since you're also

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.930
a great comedian,
how much of what

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.880
you write over the last
four or five years,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.160
do you feel detached from it?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.340
Or do you truly feel
like you're doing

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.760
something autobiographical?

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.440
Like, do look back
at things you wrote

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.640
and you're like, no, that's
exactly how I feel now.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.190
Or do you feel like you
iterate over, again and again,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.830
to make it more of
a polished product?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.990
ALLIE BROSH: I definitely
spend a lot of time polishing.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.490
I think that my job as
a writer or a comedian

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.630
is to take whatever
thing is in my head

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.560
and figure out how
to translate it most

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.610
faithfully into
other people's hands.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.310
And so, that involves a lot
of very specific word choices.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.970
So most of the editing process
is just getting the word

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.380
choices down exactly
right to-- it

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.420
can be the subtleties and shades
that I'm trying to get across.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.090
As far as how I feel
looking back on stories,

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.460
I think I do put myself
in my head-- like,

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.040
say when I'm a kid-- I write
from my perspective as a kid.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.685
So my mom is very much the
villain from my perspective.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:28.270
Clearly, from the
reader's perspective,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.810
she's just being a good mom
and doing what she needs to do.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.250
But yeah, so from my
perspective as a kid,

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.637
she was being mean
and evil, and I

00:22:36.637 --> 00:22:37.970
think that answers the question.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.180
I feel like I'm rambling.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.305
AUDIENCE: No, that's great.

00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:42.590
Thanks

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.750
ALLIE BROSH: Hi.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.320
AUDIENCE: So I
imagine these days,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.200
with the book coming out and all
that, you're on the road a lot

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.230
and a lot of changes.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.840
How are simple dog and helper
dog dealing with your absence?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.923
ALLIE BROSH: They're good.

00:22:53.923 --> 00:22:56.020
We have them staying
with a vet tech

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.130
at our veterinary
hospital, and she's great.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:02.130
She's been sending us pictures
of them just to say, hey,

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.050
they're doing good.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.920
But yeah, they're
doing very well.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.070
They've adjusted
to life in bend.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.920
The simple dog knows how to
go up and down the stairs now.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.900
She still sort of
sidewinds though.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.580
Like when she's
going down, she'll

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.894
do like this weird thing.

00:23:18.894 --> 00:23:20.310
But yeah, they're
doing very well.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.790
AUDIENCE: So I think a lot of
people related to your comic

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.315
about the Alot.

00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:34.705
ALLIE BROSH: A lot of people.

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:38.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.110
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if-- I find

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.210
that I have certain
typographical mistakes that I

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.770
make, especially when I'm
typing quickly, that bother me.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.270
And I was wondering
whether a lot was a thing

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.230
that you use to help
correct yourself,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.580
or whether there are other
mistakes like that you're

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.210
trying to fight?

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.470
ALLIE BROSH: So a lot was
never really a problem for me.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.007
The thing that I have problems
with are double letters.

00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:07.840
When spelling a word,
I'm great at spelling,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.130
except for if there's a
double letter in there.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.480
If there's two L's or
two T's, I'm fucked.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.160
I don't know how
to spell the word.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.877
So I've been trying
to memorize which

00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:18.085
ones have the double letters.

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.585
AUDIENCE: So, he beat me
to it, but the Alot post

00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:25.440
was really amazing.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.846
ALLIE BROSH: Thank you.

00:24:26.846 --> 00:24:28.346
AUDIENCE: But I was
wondering if-- I

00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:30.970
don't know how to pronounce it--
spaghatta nadle is coming back

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.250
at all?

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.298
ALLIE BROSH: People really
like that goddamn noodle.

00:24:35.298 --> 00:24:37.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.681
I think, eventually, he
will have to come back.

00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:40.930
Enough people really like him.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.540
And if I get drunk
or really tired,

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.090
sometimes I'm just really in
the mood for spaghatta nadle.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:46.590
Yeah.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.260
AUDIENCE: So what made
you start drawing this?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.410
Did it start with the blog?

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.430
Did you just draw
things like this

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.310
and tell stories about
yourself in the past?

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.060
ALLIE BROSH: Yeah.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.490
I mean, I've always
written stories just

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.260
as a means to entertain myself.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.270
I used to try to write
books when I was a kid.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.340
They were mostly about guys
fighting things and just going

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.840
on adventures where
they fight more things.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.900
So yeah, I guess I was
procrastinating when I actually

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.950
started my blog.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.140
I was supposed to be
studying for a physics final

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.600
for college.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.140
And I eventually
did study for it,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.960
but at this particular
point, I didn't want to.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.780
And I started to
write stuff online.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.159
And I think the
my style evolved--

00:25:31.159 --> 00:25:32.950
I've been thinking a
lot about this lately,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:39.331
actually-- it's probably
a result, sorry.

00:25:39.331 --> 00:25:41.080
I got like 45 minutes
of sleep last night,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.254
so I'm a little
scrambled in the brain.

00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:46.670
It's a result of
me subconsciously

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.120
trying to reproduce the feel
of stand up comedy on the page.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.920
I watch a lot of
stand up comedy.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.307
And when I first
started just trying

00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:57.140
to write without the
pictures, I was sort of

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.490
bothered by the fact that there
weren't facial expressions,

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.550
or weren't any of
those non-verbal cues

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.120
that you can get from
watching a stand up comedian.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.210
And so once I started
experimenting with pictures,

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.497
it felt really natural
to have this thing

00:26:10.497 --> 00:26:12.080
that you can intersperse
with the text

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.950
to give maybe like a
word list interaction.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.020
Or you could say
1,000 things at once,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.930
which is really helpful
for comedic timing.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.440
So that's how that happened.

00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:30.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.420
How do you remember, or
make up, all the details

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.542
about when you were a kid?

00:26:35.542 --> 00:26:40.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.900
ALLIE BROSH: My memory
starts pretty young.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.540
I have all right memories
of most of the early stuff.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.760
So if I write stories of
when I'm like four and five,

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.250
the memories are
a little spotty.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.800
I have to talk to
my mom about some

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.190
of the more storyline
relevant details, about like,

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.020
for example, in the
post about the cake,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.390
meeting the entire cake.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.100
I remember everything
about that,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.433
except for I don't actually
know how I got into the room

00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:06.355
with the cake.

00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:07.230
I remember eating it.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.104
I remember throwing it
up all over the place.

00:27:09.104 --> 00:27:11.080
But I don't remember
how I got in there.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.890
So with stuff like that, where
I really don't remember--

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.975
and it's not a major
like, it's something

00:27:15.975 --> 00:27:17.600
like I got into the
room with the cake.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.370
So I just need to find a
way to get to that point.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.590
And I figured the most
logical explanation, knowing

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.240
my grandparents'
house, was the window.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.920
So there's a little bit of that.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.620
And sometimes I'll trim stuff
down for like streamlining it

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.800
for storyline purposes,
so it's not confusing.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.672
Or, say like, oh,
well I was here

00:27:34.672 --> 00:27:36.630
with this person, this
person, and this person.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.070
I'll just like, I was here.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:45.500
But yeah, they're-- you were
asking about my memories.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.150
I'm really sorry, you guys.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.120
I knew I was going to
crash at some point today.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.360
I woke up and I was so
surprised like, oh man, I

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.014
don't feel like as bad as
I thought I would feel.

00:27:57.014 --> 00:27:58.930
And now, it's all starting
to come back to me.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.809
It's catching up.

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.100
So yeah, hang in there with me.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.488
I'm sorry.

00:28:04.488 --> 00:28:06.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.650
What would you say
distinguishes you

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.217
from your character
named Allie, if anything?

00:28:12.217 --> 00:28:14.300
ALLIE BROSH: I think that
my character is actually

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.730
a more accurate
representation of me,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.530
like how I really, really am.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.300
It's like inside.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.550
Inside that, that's what I am.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.330
I'm this weird, absurd thing.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.810
And yeah, like when
I talk to myself,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.620
the voice inside my head
is very much this thing.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.810
Me, I'm just yeah.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.796
I relate more to the character.

00:28:37.796 --> 00:28:39.277
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:39.277 --> 00:28:39.985
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.280
ALLIE BROSH: I
love your costume.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.439
AUDIENCE: What costume?

00:28:45.439 --> 00:28:46.377
ALLIE BROSH: Oh.

00:28:46.377 --> 00:28:50.130
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.730
I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about how

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.260
early you get feedback on posts,
how polished you like things

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.600
to be before you get
it, who you go to.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.100
ALLIE BROSH: I pretty much just
talk to my husband about it.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.180
He's the only one in like
the inner, inner post circle.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.425
Because I start to
doubt myself when

00:29:10.425 --> 00:29:13.050
I'm hammering through
stuff that never

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.780
sounds funny in
the very beginning.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.690
Because I'm stumbling over
it, and I'm like oh, well,

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.200
there's this part.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.640
And it'll be really
funny, you'll see.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.320
Like, once I draw the
picture, once I draw the eyes,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.260
you'll see it'll
be really funny.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.320
But just imagine this.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.930
And you don't get
the whole picture.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.250
So I do just read it to Duncan.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.340
I guess I share with my editor
and my agent sometimes too.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.270
But most of it just
goes on in my own head.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.290
I leave it for a few days if
I'm really stuck, and come back

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.792
and read it and think like, hey.

00:29:39.792 --> 00:29:41.500
Is this any better
than I thought it was?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.360
Or maybe I missed something?

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.420
Maybe I think it's horrible now?

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.640
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
talk to your husband

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.440
to get ideas to get you unstuck?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440
ALLIE BROSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.606
We'll go on walks, these
like long, nighttime walks,

00:29:52.606 --> 00:29:54.270
and just like hammer
out post ideas.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.130
And we'll pick a topic, like
identity, and say like, well.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.940
What's important
for your identity?

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.460
And he'll say to me what's
important for his identity,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.876
and then we'll
just talk about it.

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:08.474
And it's good,
because we just have

00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:10.390
an interesting conversation,
and maybe an idea

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.550
will spring from that.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.966
ALLIE BROSH: You're welcome.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.590
AUDIENCE: We also have
30% of our offices

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.057
on a Hangout view this.

00:30:20.057 --> 00:30:22.390
And so if anyone on the Hangout
wants to ask a question,

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.460
just unmute in between
questions, and ask away.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.070
And I think we have time
for five more minutes.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.400
I'd like to ask a question.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.470
ALLIE BROSH: Where is it?

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.367
AUDIENCE: I'm the
disembodied voice.

00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:38.450
ALLIE BROSH: I can see me.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.210
I can't see anybody--

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.350
AUDIENCE: I, really, really,
really love your blog.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:50.260
And thank God you're
writing it to me.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.960
I used to have to pet rats.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.020
And I adored them.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.640
And I want to have
them again soon.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.810
But I'd like to know a bit
more about your pet rats.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.830
ALLIE BROSH: They're wonderful.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.030
I rescue them, actually.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.570
We adopt them
from-- so, you guys

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.640
have maybe seen the "Hoarders"
episode with the rats.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.314
We adopted some
from that situation.

00:31:13.314 --> 00:31:14.980
They took them out
of the house and were

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.700
trying to get them homes.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.240
So we have, I think, seven now.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.480
And our oldest two rats are
just the sweetest two rats

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.250
in the world.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.442
There's Pizzo, who
is my favorite thing

00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:28.400
in the entire universe.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.000
She's roughly potato-shaped
and very soft.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.590
And she's very affectionate.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:42.480
And then there's Charlie,
who-- Charlie's very special.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.850
She never really settled down.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.280
She's sort of twitchy and
weird about everything.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.290
But I love her to death.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.630
And I could go
through all of them,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.840
but I think that wouldn't
leave very much time

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.294
for other questions.

00:31:57.294 --> 00:31:59.460
AUDIENCE: But how do they
get along with helper dog?

00:32:02.095 --> 00:32:03.720
ALLIE BROSH: The dogs
leave them alone.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.440
They know that the
rat cage is special,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.907
and they shouldn't go
over there and bug them.

00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:11.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.040
ALLIE BROSH: You're welcome.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.040
AUDIENCE: I was going to
ask if you've ever done

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.250
or wanted to do any
spoken forms of comedy,

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.267
like improv, stand
up, et cetera?

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:21.350
ALLIE BROSH: I actually
would love to do stand up.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.450
I don't know if I have
the stage presence for it.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.280
It terrifies me.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.570
But I love stand up comedy.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.755
And maybe one of these days
I'll take a crack at it.

00:32:29.755 --> 00:32:30.630
AUDIENCE: You should.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.550
All kinds of people with
terrible stage presence do it.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:54.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:54.476 --> 00:32:56.100
AUDIENCE: So when
did you first realize

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.210
that some of your characters
and their expressions

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.880
left your blog and
were used for memes

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.170
and other forms of
entertainment on the internet?

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.610
And did that change
your writing at all?

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.070
ALLIE BROSH: It didn't
change my writing.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.120
I noticed it when people
like my Facebook friends

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.350
would post it on my wall, and
be like, did you see this?

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.130
No, I did not.

00:33:16.482 --> 00:33:17.940
I think one of the
first ones I saw

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.225
was somebody using it
on a coffee shop sign,

00:33:20.225 --> 00:33:22.190
with the chalk drawings.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.370
And that was pretty cool.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.430
And I see people
will make their own,

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.336
and post Alot memes to my wall.

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:31.460
Hey, I see it all the time.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.820
I'm always getting emails
from people being like,

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.300
did you see this
one and this one?

00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:37.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.010
AUDIENCE: As an artist
and a copyright holder,

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.774
how do you feel about that?

00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:50.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.060
ALLIE BROSH: I like that the
internet is having fun with it.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.610
It's fine when people are
just using it as a meme.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.800
Having fun with it, trying to
be funny, that's totally fine.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.350
It's less fine when they are
using it to sell something

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.730
or to like support a really
shitty point of view.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.909
I don't know.

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.973
So those times really bother me.

00:34:10.973 --> 00:34:12.889
But the other times, I'm
totally fine with it,

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.180
when people are just having
fun and trying to be funny.

00:34:21.602 --> 00:34:23.560
PRESENTER: I think that's
all we have time for.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.522
Thank you so much.

00:34:24.522 --> 00:34:26.480
Allie is going to be
signing books at the back.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.982
So if you want your book signed,
please make an orderly line

00:34:28.982 --> 00:34:30.190
towards the back of the room.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.539
Thank you so much for coming.

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:40.321
[APPLAUSE]
