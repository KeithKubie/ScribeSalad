00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.100
In late 2001 an economist called Edward Castronova
made tsunami sized waves in the world of economics

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.160
when he published a paper claiming that an
isolated place called Norrath had a currency

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.230
stronger than that of the Japanese Yen- an
especially bold claim considering Norrath

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.330
had less than a million inhabitants, had only
existed for about two years and didn’t exist

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.330
physically.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.960
Yes, Norrath was entirely virtual and populated
exclusively by players of the video game EverQuest.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.430
Released in 1999, EverQuest is an immensely
popular and influential massively multiplayer

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.190
online role playing gaming (MMORPG).

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.080
Set in the magical fantasy world of Narroth
and boasting an impressive (for the time)

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.750
near half million subscribers at the apex
of its success, EverQuest came to the attention

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.060
of Castronova at first much in the same way
it came to the attention of anyone- he just

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.590
thought it sounded like a fun game to play.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.750
However, as he became more familiar with the
game, he noticed some rather fascinating things

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.000
about how the virtual economy had developed
within the game.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.280
This all culminated in him publishing on the
Social Science Research Network a humorous

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.940
but excellently researched, and ultimately
groundbreaking, paper titled, Virtual Worlds:

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.850
A First-Hand Account of Market and Society
on the Cyberian Frontier.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.790
By his own admission, Castronova stated, “I
thought maybe seventy-five people would read

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.510
it and that’d be great.”

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.920
Instead, it quickly received over 16,000 downloads
(and today is sitting at closer to 50,000).

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.580
While this might not seem like much, let’s
remember context here- this was an academic

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.990
paper published on an online academic journal.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.620
Needless to say, that number of downloads
made it the most downloaded paper in the history

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.520
of the Social Science Research Network, which
at the time featured almost 50,000 academic

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.479
papers, including many dozens written by Nobel
laureates.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.280
Why was this paper so fascinating to the world
of economics?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.720
As economist Yanis Varoufakis noted, “Economic
theory has come to a dead end — the last

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.520
real breakthroughs were in the 1960s.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280
But that’s not because we stopped being
clever.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.180
We came up against a hard barrier.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.040
The future is going to be in experimentation
and simulation — and video game communities

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.280
give us a chance to do all that.”

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.140
What Castronova had stumbled upon was essentially
an economist’s dream- virtual worlds the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.840
researchers could use to analyze in a scientific
manner various concepts in their field using

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.810
large data sets and real people populating
those worlds.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.040
Or as Washington Post journalist Brad Plumer
succinctly stated, in virtual worlds, “The

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.209
data is richer.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.730
And it’s easier to run economy-wide experiments
in a video game — experiments that, for

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.849
obvious reasons, can’t be run on countries.”

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.819
In short, economists in academia were intrigued
with Castronova’s paper and its implications

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.349
for future research.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.410
So what did Castronova find?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.599
After painstakingly pouring over the available
data surrounding the world of Norrath, he

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.641
was shocked to discover that in real world
dollars Norrath had the 77th highest GNP per

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:24.629
capita, placing it squarely between Russia
and Bulgaria at the time.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.560
How was this possible for a virtual world
with only virtual currency?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.860
At the height of EverQuest’s popularity,
sale of in-game items ran rampant and at one

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.450
point in time a player could pretty much buy
anything they wanted in-game, regardless of

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.000
how rare or powerful it was, so long as they
could flash the cash to make it happen.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.159
Although Sony, who published the game, would
make several attempts to quash this practice,

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.219
claiming amongst other things that all of
the items for sale were their intellectual

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.849
property, as well as outright banning players
they caught doing this, the sale of in-game

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.129
items and avatars became a thriving industry
on sites like Ebay.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.099
In fact, former child actor Brock Pierce (perhaps
best known as a kid for his roles in Mighty

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.809
Ducks and First Kid, and as an adult for his
work in crypto currency) even started a surprisingly

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:16.840
successful company, Internet Gaming Entertainment
Ltd (IGE), which dealt in these virtual goods

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.230
in exchange for real money.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.680
The company maintained a rather large staff
of low-waged workers who worked in Norrath

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.280
and the real world, doing things like meeting
to exchange goods, as well as building up

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.830
avatars and acquiring virtual goods for future
sale.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.020
In any event, Castronova analysed over 600
illicit sales outside the realm of Norrath

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.600
on sites like Ebay and then simply compared
this to the value of the item in-game in the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.780
principle currency of Norrath- Platinum Pieces.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.810
When he did this, Castronova discovered that
the relative value of a single Platinum Piece

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.720
compared to the US Dollar was $0.01072.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.190
While this may not seem all that much, as
Castronova pointed out, at the time, “its

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.160
value exceeds that of the Japanese Yen and
the Italian Lira.”

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.990
With this value in hand, Castronova was then
able to roughly calculate a number of other

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.340
interesting things about the economy of Norrath.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.080
For example, it turned out the average citizen
of Norrath earned around $3.42 per hour (or

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.090
about $5 an hour today) when taking into account
the value of the items and in-game currency

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.310
they could realistically acquire during normal
play per hour on average.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.253
Combining this with the estimated time extreme
players sunk into the game (according to data

00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:28.840
gleaned by Castronova in surveying over three
thousands players), Castronova calculated:

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.310
Many users spend upwards of 80 hours per week
in Norrath, hours of time input that are not

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.270
unheard of in Earth professions.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.030
In 80 hours, at the average wage, the typical
user generates Norrathian cash and goods worth

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.010
$273.60.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.560
In a month, that would be over $1,000, in
a year over $12,000.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.890
The poverty line for a single person in the
United States is $8,794.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.860
Looking at players of every time commitment
level, Castronova determined that, despite

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.180
the game being extremely new, the average
player of EverQuest already had over $3,000

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.460
worth of sellable goods locked up in the game.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.090
But we’re not done yet because Castronova
was then able to roughly calculate the gross

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.800
national product of Norrath based on the value
of the (entirely virtual) goods it produced

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
in 2001.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
His final number?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800
About $135 million.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.310
While, again, this may not sound like much,
divided amongst the estimated total number

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.170
of Norrath denizens, that meant the GNP per
capita of the virtual kingdom was $2,266-

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.390
a figure that, as previously mentioned, theoretically
ranked the computerised state the 77th highest

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.390
on Earth at the time.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.830
Naturally, this information peaked the interest
of Castronova’s fellow economists, as did

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.110
other observations he made about the virtual
world and economy he was studying.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.030
For example, according to Castronova one of
the more curious things he noticed during

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.780
his research was that, despite every effort
being made by Sony to give everyone an equal

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.490
footing when the game began, financial inequality
was quickly rife amongst the denizens of Norrath.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.830
Additionally Castronova also observed how,
much like in the real world, the wealthiest

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.200
players would often hoard their wealth and
use their vast resources to pay poorer characters

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.670
to do all of the pointless busy work they
didn’t want to waste time with, in effect

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.201
becoming pseudo-employers who kept the lion’s
share of any profits made via the work of

00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.000
the plebeians to themselves.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.610
Anecdotally, Castronova would say of his own
time in-game as a low level player with no

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.560
resources: “My problem is that I am under-equipped.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.730
I have been basically naked, carrying only
a simple club, a caveman in a world of cavaliers.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.370
My poverty is oppressive – no amount of
rat fur is sufficient to buy even a simple

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.150
tunic at the ludicrously high prices of the
merchant biots.”

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.370
Naturally, as the game evolved, the whole
“initial equality” thing also died off

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.960
for some, thanks to those markets where players
who had disposable income in the physical

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.370
world could simply buy whatever they wanted
for real money and enter the game vastly more

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.490
powerful and capable than a player without
this option.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.420
Since Castronova’s paper, and partially
as a direct result of his work studying virtual

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.380
economies, the one time self professed “academic
failure” and “schmo at a state school”

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.210
managed to leverage this to level up in real
life- securing a tenured position at Indiana

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.760
University Bloomington as a professor of Telecommunication
and Cognitive Science, as well as coming to

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.190
be known as the “founder of the field of
virtual economics”.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.410
And as many other virtual worlds with complex
virtual economies have likewise sprung up,

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.360
economists and other scientists continue to
study them, as they make great petri dishes

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.120
to observe how various variables result in
changes in economy and human behavior.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.130
Going the other way, gaming companies like
Valve have taken to hiring economists to help

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.970
them manage their virtual worlds.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.450
As economist Robert Bloomfield notes, “If
you’re creating a game with 100,000 users,

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.570
with things that they can buy and sell, you
need an economist just to help you tweak that

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.560
system so that it doesn’t spin out of control.”

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.240
As for Castronova, he concluded his ground
breaking paper by waxing poetic about the

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.540
potential virtual worlds could have with the
application of new technology, stating

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.980
The impact on Earth society is hard to overestimate.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.950
With the development of voice technology,
communication in Virtual Worlds will move

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.690
from cumbersome chat to telephone-like conversation,
thus greatly enhancing the Virtual World as

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.210
a place of social interaction.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.230
Families living thousands of miles apart will
meet every day for a few hours in the evening,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.100
gathering their avatars around the virtual
kitchen table and catching up.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.640
And the day of driving to the store may well
be over.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.590
Earth roads will be empty because, instead
of using them, everyone will be sailing across

00:09:34.590 --> 00:10:22.070
the azure heavens on their flying purple horses,
to shimmering virtual Walmarts

00:10:22.070 --> 00:11:00.010
in

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:07.620
the sky.
