00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.603
I have a statement
here in yellow,

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.019
which, for the
sake of this video,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.240
we will assume is true,
that eating spinach makes

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.872
you stronger.

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:11.330
And then after
this, in white, I've

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.840
written a bunch of
other statements.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200
And I want to figure out if
these are reasonable things

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.950
to say, given the assumption
that this first statement is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.610
true, that eating spinach
makes you stronger.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.270
And we could even
put it over here.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.830
"Eating spinach
makes you stronger."

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.530
So let's read this
first sentence.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.152
"If you eat spinach, then
you will get stronger."

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:37.360
So this is just really a
rephrasing of the first one.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.590
This is really just
putting it in if-then form.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.110
You have your "if" and
your "then," but it's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.640
really saying the same thing.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810
If you eat spinach-- that's
the same thing as eating

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.220
the spinach-- then you
will become stronger,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.630
then you will be stronger.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.720
You get stronger.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.650
So this is saying
the exact same thing.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.200
I will say that if we assume
this first statement is true,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.230
then the second statement
is definitely true.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.420
Now, this third statement.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.800
"If you don't eat spinach, then
you will not get stronger."

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.500
So this is interesting.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.520
This is kind of assuming that
the only way to get stronger

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.530
is by eating spinach.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.590
But that's not what that
first statement says.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350
That first statement
says eating spinach

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.001
is a way to get you stronger.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.750
So if we think about
ways to get stronger,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.800
there are other ways
to get stronger.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.140
You could lift weights.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.370
And maybe you don't want
to eat any spinach at all.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.660
Maybe you eat eggs.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.900
Who knows?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.585
There's a million, you know--
maybe you have a-- drink milk.

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:44.210
Who knows what?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.270
There are a lot of options
that will get you stronger.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.690
Drink milk.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.320
So eating spinach
is not the only way.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.260
So if you don't eat
spinach, you still

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.220
might be able to get stronger.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.510
They're not ruling out that
you can't get stronger.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.970
So I would say, I would
not go with this statement

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.760
right over there.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.560
Let me do it in red so
that I can mark it off.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.289
This one is not
necessarily true.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.804
You can get stronger other ways.

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:14.220
Now, if you eat spinach, you
will definitely get stronger,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.770
if you believe that statement.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.270
But you can get
stronger other ways.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.907
So just by not eating spinach,
if you lift weights, eat eggs,

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:21.990
who knows what else, you
could still get stronger.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.440
So we'll rule out
the second statement.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.030
Now, this third statement.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.030
"You are not stronger.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.510
Therefore, you must not
have eaten spinach."

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.080
Now, this is where we really
have to put our logician hats.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.100
And a logician is just
someone who has really,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.170
really, really good logic.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.610
"You are not stronger.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.520
Therefore, you must not
have eaten spinach."

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.020
And we have to be very
careful to separate

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.970
our everyday
experience versus what

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.970
we're trying to
deduce logically.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.220
So in our everyday
experience, I'm not stronger,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.844
but maybe I did eat spinach.

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:57.010
And we'd say, hey, you know,
maybe sometimes spinach

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.230
doesn't make me stronger,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.970
But we have to remember, we're
assuming this first statement

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.740
is true.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.350
We're assuming this first
statement is absolutely true.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.260
Eating spinach
makes you stronger.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.900
If you had eaten
spinach, by definition,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.710
this first statement says
you will be stronger.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.280
If you're not
stronger, then there's

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.870
no way that you
ate some spinach.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.670
So this is actually true.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.920
This is actually
true if we assume

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.360
this first statement is true.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560
Now, this last statement.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.190
"You are stronger.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.160
Therefore, you must
have eaten spinach."

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.690
Well, this goes
back to this idea.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.290
That first statement didn't
say spinach is the only way

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.430
to get stronger, or the
second statement wasn't if

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.002
and only if you eat spinach,
then you'll get stronger.

00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:44.460
There's other ways
to get stronger.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.270
You could lift weights,
eat eggs, drink milk.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.400
So this last statement--
you are stronger.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.190
Therefore, you must
have eaten spinach--

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.580
isn't necessarily true.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.840
You could have drank--
lifted weights,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.700
or ate eggs, or
anything like that.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.620
So I will rule this
one out, as well.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.463
You cannot make this conclusion
given this first statement.
