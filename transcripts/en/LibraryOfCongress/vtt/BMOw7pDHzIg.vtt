00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.830
Asaf has written and
directed a number

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.080
of award-winning documentaries
on Israeli television,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.660
including a series on Israeli
[inaudible], history of Tel Aviv,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.450
Jaffa, and the life and
influence of Joseph Trumpeldor.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.930
Last year, at the Washington
Jewish Festival,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.930
he screened his documentary
"Muses of Isaac Bashevis Singer"

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.060
on the Yiddish writer,
Bashevi Singer.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.230
In addition to his film work,
he curates for Beit Hatfutsot,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.230
which is a museum for the Jewish
people in Tel Aviv, Israel.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.960
He's doing exhibits on Jewish
humor, Jewish fashion designers,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.050
the Dreyfus affair, the
Amy Winehouse Exhibit,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.330
which I saw when I was in Israel,
and a new one on Bob Dylan.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.530
He's currently working
on a film on Sal Bellows.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.050
And I must say, he was happily
using our collections at LC.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.910
Speaking of resources at LC,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.570
I've brought out a few comic
graphic novels that we have

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.150

&gt;&gt; Lihi Shavit-Saguy: It's
going to be very few words

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.350
because I'm curious, as you are,
to hear what Asaf has to say.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.770
I just want to thank you
for being here today.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.910
I want to thank Gail for initiating
this program, as she does always.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.210
She did an interesting

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.190
and fascinating program
regarding Israeli literature

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.870
and Hebrew literature.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.930
And I hope you'll enjoy this
event, and this lecture, and clips.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.710
It sounds fascinating to me.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.010

I hope that you will enjoy the
lecture and the conversation,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.910
and mostly, the clips because as
a filmmaker, [laughter] my best is

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.840
to show my film than to talk.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.140
[Laughs]

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.150
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley:
Before we get started,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.070
I just want to put a little plug
in for our comic book collection,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.370
because it's probably one of the
better kept secrets of the Library.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.030
And it's unfortunate that that's
the case, because we have one

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.450
of the largest collections
in the country.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.640
And anybody who's interested in
doing serious research on Superman,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.960
Archie, Detective Comics, or Zapp,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.940
you can find them all
in our division.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.220
So I encourage anybody who's
interested in doing research

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.530
with comic books to
come to the newspaper

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.910
and current periodical
reading room, and talk to us,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.290
because we would welcome using
our -- with our collection, okay?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.990
So now we're going to take a turn,
and it's going to be a conversation

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.170
that Asaf and I were going to have.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.560
And hopefully, the questions will
give him an opportunity to kind

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.290
of sort of inform us on how
we can come about writing --

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.300
creating this documentary,
but also giving us some --

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.870
a close look on, you know,
what are Israeli comics,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.610 position:56%
because I frankly didn't know very
much about them until I had a chance

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.510
to spend some time with him.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.120
So I'd like to start the questions.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.790
And hopefully, we can
just take it from there

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.700
and have a wonderful dialogue.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.770
So my first question to
you is you've been working

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.160
on some very different
film topics, I mean,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.290
Isaac Bashevis Singer,
Hebrew superheroes.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.710
They seem a little
disparate in content.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.780
So what attracted you to
those very different topics?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.610 position:56%
And is there something that kind of
links those topics together for you?

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.360
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Okay, [laughs] okay.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.640
First I think the answer for your
question, it's my childhood love.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.220
When I was young, I was
always fascinated from comics,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.990 position:56%
and from the children books of Isaac
Bashevis Singer that are beautiful

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.070
and illustrated by Moe
Sanduck [phonetic].

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.550 position:56%
And maybe I'm a little bit a docent.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.000
So I was -- later on, I was
still reading it when I grew up.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.440
And about Isaac Bashevis
Singer, I was one day --

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.540
I will tell you in a
short the whole film,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.020
that I found that when I finished
his Hebrew book and I started

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.520
to read all his short stories in
English, I found out that in each

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.610
of his short book, another name

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.280
of a woman is credited
for being a translator.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.940
So I said, "It's fascinating.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.820
Okay; this is a mystery.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.280
I will start to count how
many names there are."

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.580
And then I found out 48 women.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.410 position:56%
[Laughter] So this is my researching
and my mystery detective.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.580
So I try to -- I started to
call them and to ask them, "Wow,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.810
why do you have 48
women translators?

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.180
Why not one?

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.770
When you have a good
translator, go with her."

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.730
So this would be --
so then now you need

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.430
to see the film why he had this
hound of women translators.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.150
And about comics, I have
always loved comics.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:51.860
And first really when I grew up,
I read the American superheroes,

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.790
Spiderman, Batman, Superman.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:06.210 position:56%
And for me, it was mysterious why
and American comic artists that came

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.350 position:56%
to the United States, or came --
most of them from Europe in the '20s

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:17.490
and the '30s, made these
-- innovated this great --

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.780
and most of them were Jews --

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.210
made these great comics that we
are worldwide known, like Superman,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:32.000
and Spiderman, and all of them were
made by comics artists like Siegel

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.070
and Shuster, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:42.670
And at the same time, in
Israel came also comic artists,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:48.280
and they made totally
other protagonists,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.380
the Israeli superheroes.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.510
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So how did
you approach making this film,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:05.190
since it's about comics and
some of the Hebrew superheroes?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.830
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: So first I
contacted all of these people.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:13.570
And comics artists, when I compare
them to people from the film,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:19.490
from the literature, will have
very open, very straightforward,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.460
and they like to tell
you great stories.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.490
And so I called them, and
they were really happy

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.560
that first time somebody will
make a film about Israeli comics

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.650
and will tell the world about that.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.070
And this is my mission in the films
that and then you will want to go

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.660
and take a book about falafel
man, or [inaudible] man,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.530
or other kind of characters.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.710
So I took the top ten comic
artists, in my opinion.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.730
Each one of them represents
another style,

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.950
another decade in the
Israeli society.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.990
And it also reflects
about the changes

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.030
in the Israeli society,
history and culture.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.850
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay;
so maybe we can, you know,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.620
sort of look at the
beginning of Israeli comics?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.920
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.140
So I will start with the first
clip that it's the intro clip.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.340
And it's about the
first Israeli superhero.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.640
Okay.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.440

[ Background Sounds ]

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.750
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: So this
is Eewyian [phonetic],

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:17.620
the first Israeli superhero.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:24.510
He didn't have any special
forces, but he was --

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.780
his mission was to help the new
countries that he's growing up.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.730
And he was very -- it was a
funny twist and sometimes,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.150
he had like he could
make himself bigger.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.060
And people loved him.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.150
He was -- for 30 years,
he was in the daily kids.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:50.960
And I think that he stopped in '67

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.860
because it was a big
change in Israel society.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:03.450
There was -- the '60s were changing
the conception of the Israeli

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:09.790
and this naive and
childhood hero was not good.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.100
And they started to look
for new kinds of heroes.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.570
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley:
So did they look back

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.590
to America for their heroes there?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.890
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.640
So then they started to look
again to the Americans to starting

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:33.510
where Superman is in '67 is
like the well-known character,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.580
and some of them trying
to put Superman

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.210
in the Israeli society,
in the Israeli culture.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.760 position:56%
And there are two attempts for this.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.750
And these attempts
are very interesting.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.510
And I will tell more
after we will see them.

superman, the subraman [phonetic],

have -- two of them they are
changing the "S" to Jewish symbols,

in Israeli history culture.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.030
And he's fighting the Nazis.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.960
And they are -- both of them
were really interesting.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.730
It's drawn well.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.220
The subraman is not colored.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.600
Eewyian is in color.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.240
But -- and then the
audience didn't --

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.170
it was for a short
period both of them went,

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.190
and the Israeli audience
didn't like it.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.960
They searched for another
kind of superhero,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.940
superheroes that they can more
identify, something that they feel

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:57.520
that it's giving them
another kind of fantasy,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.770
or something that they
more can relate to it.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.800
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So why do you
think the American style superhero

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.650
failed with the Israeli audience?

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.560
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: I think that
in Israel that they were tired

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.510
from heroes, from superheroes

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.940
because you can find
it in the daily news.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.390
You can find them.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.870
There is the soldier,
there is the leader,

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.400
and there are the Israeli heroes.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.920
So then when it's come
to this subculture,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.270
people want another
kind of superhero.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.510
And then they combined like
they wanted to be something

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.910
that they're more identified
from reality.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:50.260
And then it's something
really strange is coming up.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.670 position:56%
And this is like a connection, maybe
because of that I like them so much,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.250
it's they are taking the
protagonist, the totally other side

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.570
of the superhero, it's the loser.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.940
They are taking the ultimate
loser, like it's the protagonist

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.140
in the Yiddish literature
in Shalamalech

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.190
and Isaac Bashevisinger [phonetic].

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.400
So they're taking the complete
-- maybe they are brothers.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:23.050 position:56%
One is -- there is this movie,
"Twins", like one is Schwarzenegger,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.330
the other is Danny De Vito.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.220
So they are taking
this loser character,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.440 position:56%
and they are making him like a hero.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.520
But this loser is sometimes he's
failing, but a lot of times,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.880
he's also succeeding to solve the
mystery, the problem, the motive.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So who are these?

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.130
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Who are they?

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.000
[Laughter] So I will
show a couple of them.

[ Silence ]

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:50.710
Well, [laughs] so she's
like taking --

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.380
we saw in the first Eewy Meewy
[phonetic], this kids that was --

00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.400
he was doing tricks, but
he was still like good.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.150
[Laughs] And then she took this
kid and she changed his character.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.950
She made him like that he's the
one that's not that innocent,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.280
that he is very demanding.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.050
And this character of
Chamudi [phonetic],

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.280
it's "cutie" in English,
became very popular.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.950
You can meet him in
commercials in Israel.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:32.020
You can meet him like in doing
a commercial for healthcare.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.760
And people love him
really, and there is --

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.880
and this is really one of
the most comics characters

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.070
that are loved in Israel.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:48.300
And it's a really nice twist
to see how it was in the '30s,

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:54.490
this kid character and now in the
2000s, what is the new millennium,

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.850
what is the new kid character.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.810
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So if you
had sort of this retelling

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:07.870
of the cute character reappearing,
do you also have a variation

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.880
of the superhero appearing then?

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.180
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.540
Now it's -- there is new kind
of superheroes in Israel.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.120
In Israel, people love
to read more comics.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.560
It's become more mainstream.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.110
There are stores of
comics you can find.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.530
There is a museum for comics.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:32.080
There is like every year
two festivals for comics.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.310
And the new generation
loves to read comics.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:42.050
So they made up two new
Israeli superheroes.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.840
And I think that they are great.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.270
You will meet them in a second.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:51.320
One is Falafel Man, [laughter]
and the other is Oozy [phonetic].

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.560
And they are more complex,
and they --

00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:01.220
are combined they're like
kind of a special power,

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.320
and also it's kind
of more of a loser.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.620
[Laughter] This is Falafel Man.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.900
And he's like the most
popular now among the kids.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.210
And I think that he has a great --

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:49.200
it's like a little bit here of
the story of the Green Giant,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.990
that's he's like enter the
Green Giant to this reactor,

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.860
and he got these special powers.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.390
But here the twist is that
he got in with Falafel.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:04.300
So [inaudible] -- so he can
throw you a new falafel,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.280
but what is done, not a lot.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:13.440
But still he's solving the
problems of the bad guys

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.440
that are coming to attack the good.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.850
And he's really funny.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.720
And this is what I
think what happened.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.700
This was the combination of
the loser and the superheroes.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.280
And it's -- you should read it.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.980
[Laughter] No more.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.390
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So
something else that was in --

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:48.220
is in your documentary is
sort of a category of comics

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.080
of retelling Israeli history?

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.380
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.680
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Can you speak
a little bit more about that?

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.980
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.780
There is also a great
phenomenon that also later that --

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.690
also in the more religious
people they have comics.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:07.390
And also in the United
States and Israel,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.930
the Orthodox are having comics.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:17.220
And then they are taking like the
great characters from the Bible,

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.690
of the rabbis, and
telling comics about them.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:25.930
Later on you can find here like
great collections of books of it.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.890
So this is one phenomenon.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:39.030
And also -- but for me the most
prominent in this field it's a guy

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.360
that his name is "Shai
Charkoff" [phonetic].

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.440
And he really told the
story of the Bible,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.890
and later of the [inaudible]
in comics.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:56.600
And he took a character that he --

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.300
made up a character
that his name is "Baba".

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.890
And it's become a big phenomenon.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.460
And he's telling all
the Jewish history.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.440
Now he's working more
for later and later.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.510
And let's see it.

So here [inaudible] and since
then when it comes as to --

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.480
as Jews, the story of antiheroes
are much more successful

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:08.180
that we just have a story, because
here he's like writing [inaudible]

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:16.240
that we work, and he says
that, "They are out."

given us a pretty good picture

of what your documentary's about.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.450
And also I feel like we got
a sense of what the history

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:54.010
of Israeli comics is about,
at least you tantalized us

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.420
to want to learn more.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.680
But to shift gears a
little bit, I'm interested

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.320
in knowing how you were able to
get the participation that you got

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.740
with the comic book creators, and
also the fact that they are so open

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.870
and frank in how they
answer their questions.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:20.520
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Really, the
comic artist was really open

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.750
for doing a documentary about it.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:27.790
The only concern -- and it was
also a very big concern for me,

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.650
it's how you move --

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:37.290
how you transform comics to the
big screen, to the television.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:42.650
So because most of the time
when you are transforming comics

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.230
to the big screen, you are doing
2D animation, 3D animation.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:53.170
And nowadays it's like
reality with special effects.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.150
And they say, "No, no, no; this is
the worst thing for our comics."

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:01.360
Comics, the reading that your
eyes are like the cameras.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.270
If you are doing the focals,
that you can read the text first,

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.100
you can move like this,
or like this.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.680
It's so important.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:14.160
So it was -- also for me it was
-- when I did this small animation

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.990
and showed the comics, I
tried to show how it looks,

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.090
the feeling of the reading.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:23.300
And sometimes it makes
this film very condensed,

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.090
that you need to look
at the picture,

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.390
also to look at the picture.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.290
You need to understand
it takes time.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.200
You need to read.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.230
And also sometimes there
is voiceover of something.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.530
So it's very condensed.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.640
A lot from your patience.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:45.980 position:56%
And you need to be very tuned to it.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:50.780
And I tried to bring it to
the audience this feeling,

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.680
because also when you read comics,
it's a very intense experience.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.110
People think, "Eh, it's
only looking at a picture."

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.410
Not at all.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:05.550
Reading comics it's a great
experience, and it takes --

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.930
you need to have this
quality how to read comics.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.230
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:15.490
And I want to leave a few
minutes for questions to Asaf,

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.540
but I have one more
question for you of my own --

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.840
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Okay.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.140
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Before
we open it for questions.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.140
And what are you working on next?

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.620
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Oh, so
it's a good question.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:36.820
So my other film about Isaac
Bashevi Singer, it was about him

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.960
and his woman translator.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.120
But his first translators was --

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:50.090
that made him successful
and opened the doors for him

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.420
to the English reader was Sol Belo
[phonetic], another [inaudible].

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.370 position:56%
So now I make -- and Isaac Bashevi's
was really afraid from Sol Belo

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.770
that everything will think that
he's not such a good writer.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:03.540
It's only because Sol
Belo helped him.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.650
So because of that, he said, "Okay;

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:11.510
for now I will take a
new kind of translation.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.370
I will do it."

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:17.170
He will take this business
to himself.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:22.280
So now I'm making a
film about Sol Belo.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.790
It will be a first-time
documentary about him.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:31.810
And as a filmmaker, you will need
always to work on two project

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:36.860
in the same, [laughs] because
one project is going fast

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.580
and then it's stuck, always
money and things like this.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:47.280
So on the other side, I'm doing
films that's also continuance

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.150
of my search more in
this visual world.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.460
It's about the Fleischer
-- the Fleischer studios.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:01.960
They made up Popeye and Betty Boop,
and all of these great characters.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.480
Also, they are the first
ones that made Superman

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.720
to the animation for Superman.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.440
They were the -- in the '20s, '30s,

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:19.810
there were two big major animation
studios, The Fleischer and Disney.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.040
And this was the big rival.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.720
The Fleischer's were, of
course, Jewish immigrants.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.590
It was a family and Disney,
as we know, were not Jewish,

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:34.810
They came from Midwest
America and they won, Disney.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.190
And already they made about
them a great documentary,

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.530
ten -- six episodes.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.070
I'm on the Fleischer side.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.670
I think that the Fleischer
cartoons are much better.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:53.130
I think that this is how you should
do comics, cartoons, animations,

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:59.210
that it's like less
reality, more surrealistic.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:04.850
And it's a better influence,
like all the --

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:08.610
I don't know, compare
Betty Boop to one of the --

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:16.860
to Snow White, or compare
Popeye to the prince.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.700 position:56%
So it's -- so I think that their
style -- but they lost in the fight.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.600
So I think it's time to make a
film about them, and why they lost.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.900
[Laughs]

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.700
[ Silence ]

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.400
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay; I'm
going to look forward to it.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.610
So those sound like great projects.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.760
Does anybody have any questions?

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.060
All right.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.590
And bear with me because
I'm going to repeat it

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.530
for the webcast, all right?

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.830
Yes.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:49.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So the only thing I remember
about Israeli comics is in the '60s,

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.680
my grandmother used to send us --

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.600
she used to very carefully
cut Ferdinand comics

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.900
out of the newspaper.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:02.450 position:56%
And we'd get every couple of weeks
all of these Ferdinand comic strips,

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:06.550
newspaper comic strips sent in
one of those blue aerograms.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.850
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.150
&gt;&gt; And I always thought
that that must have come --

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.630
she was from Vienna.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:11.930
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:16.580
&gt;&gt; And I don't know what the
comic strip culture was in Europe

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.060 position:56%
from a lot of the world where the --

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.490
a lot of where the World
War II immigrants came from.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.150
But I'm wondering if
there is a connection,

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.390
and how that fits into this?

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.690
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.990
You could --

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.290
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Either
you or more for the question.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:31.590
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: No, you, you.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:32.890
[Laughter]

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: I'm going to try.

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:39.750
Sorry. This is a strip such
as Ferdinand that was clipped

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.070
from the newspaper in Vienna.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No, no, no; an Israeli newspaper.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.190
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: An
Israeli newspaper and sent;

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.030
and so what was the connection

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:54.880
between European and
Israeli comic strip?

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.180
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:01.650
So you saw that here in the
movie there are different styles

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.580
of comics, like the
style of this more center

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.910
of Europe it's very minimalistic.

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:13.530
And there is a big tradition
of it, like the last --

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:17.810
the Hymnodies [phonetic] in these
traditions that you don't make --

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:22.050
the American tradition it's
totally that you are making swap,

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.790
and [inaudible], and jumping.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.710
And you have the strip that --

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:29.310
and also the boxes in
the strip are changing.

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:36.350
And in the European style
always it's very minimalistic.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:42.420
It's one line that the strip
-- the boxes are the same.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.570
And it was also influenced
in Israel,

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:55.160
and also in newspaper it's
also more common to see it.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.160
And yes it was influenced.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.910
And some -- in Israel there were
many influences, from America,

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:04.240
from Europe, from Central
Europe, from --

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.350
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Yes.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:12.450
&gt;&gt; Some of the early comics in
America, the subjects were animals.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:18.920
A couple that come to mind are
Tom and Jerry, Felix the Cat.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.650
Did that phenomenon also occur
in Israel where the subjects

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:28.790
of the comics were
animals and not people?

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.610
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: The question
is about how American comics --

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:34.910
&gt;&gt; From the early days.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.790
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: The early
days used animals in the comics,

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:42.860
and did something similar
happen with Israel comics?

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.160
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.280 position:56%
There is this -- in Israel they made
-- the figure is called "The Duck".

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.170
And he's a loser, the duck.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.110 position:56%
[Laughter] In each end of the strip,

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.430
the butcher is coming
and killing the duck.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:02.430
But yes, it was also
there, and it was great.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:06.980
I did -- tonight there is a
screening, and you can come

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.880
and see the whole film
and meet the duck.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.180
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Yes.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:18.020
&gt;&gt; You talked about the big screen,
and obviously here with Hollywood,

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:27.790
Hollywood's been trying to cash
in for the last ten to 20 years,

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:36.060
and even before that in
television in the '30s and '40s.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:44.540
Have any of the characters
that have been well-known

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:51.790
in Israel made their way to live
action where someone portrays them

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:57.990
as you see that today in Hollywood

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:00.900
with the Batman and
Superman characters?

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:07.450 position:56%
Are the people reenacting in either
TV or Israeli films those characters

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.860
that everybody knows there?

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.380
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Have any of
the Israeli characters made it

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:18.960
to either the TV or the silver
screen similar to the way

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.740
that the American comics
have made that jump?

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.040
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.880
So the guy who we think
that made subraman later on,

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.210
he made the comic strips that
it's called "Beng" [phonetic].

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:30.940
And it was -- and it's
still publishing today.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.070
And it's about a teenager,
an Israeli.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.310
It's like Mad Magazine.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:40.860
It's very, very funny, but
also a little bit satiric.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.660
And this -- and his strip
came to the television,

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.960
but not yet to the big screen.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.370
Now they're working on
another guy that made a very --

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:50.840
a graphic novel about the
Holocaust and his experience.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.940
It's like he's very influenced by
Maus [phonetic], and working now

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.800
to make a film about him.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.820
His name is Michel
Kichka [phonetic].

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.630
And this will be the first time

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:08.520
that they will make an animated
film from an Israeli cartoon.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.820
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Sure.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.120
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask questions.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.420
One is about [inaudible].

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.630
You mentioned a couple
of Nobel Prize winners.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:18.480
[Inaudible] plays a
very important role.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.950
And I wonder if anybody picked up.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:26.120
That would make an
interesting presentation

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.770
of the dog in the cartoons.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.510 position:56%
The other question is about Yiddish.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:36.440
You mentioned at the beginning
the idea of the [inaudible],

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.740
the Yiddish [overlapping].

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.040
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.620
&gt;&gt; And I wondered if anything
has been done in this connection,

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:48.870
and if there is a market in
Israel to read stories in Yiddish.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.490
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay;
two -- let's see if I --

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.540 position:56%
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able
to capture all of your question --

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.360
your two questions properly.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.530
But there's the one --

00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.830
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: About Agnon.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.130
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Agnon, the dog.

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:03.500
Let's start with that.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: You have a good idea.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.160
They should make a film about it.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.080 position:56%
[Laughter] Maybe me; I will take it.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.510
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Get his name

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:17.440
so he can get an acknowledgement
about that idea.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.740
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.790
By the way, it's reminded
me, the acknowledgment,

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:28.530 position:56%
the people that made the Superman,
Schuster and Siegel, for many years,

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:32.480
they were -- never
acknowledged about it.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.400
And there was a big fight about it.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.410
Mind you, of course
they never saw it.

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:44.630
But in there the first movie
"Superman" in '78 or nine,

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:50.180
I don't remember, that came to the
big screen, the first "Superman".

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.840
And this was the first time
and after that and until now,

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.440
the big studios are making
films about superheroes.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.740
But the first was Superman.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.330
And in the Superman,
they said, "Okay;

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.460
now it's time to give
them the acknowledgement."

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:11.190
And they said, "Okay; Superman,
created by Schuster and Siegel."

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:20.050
And now it's not only this
and Marvels that created this

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.380
because the comic artists
didn't make a lot of money.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.460
They worked really hard.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.630
And it's a very tragic story.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:29.930
You can read it.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.940
Also Michael Chabon [phonetic]
wrote a great book about it,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:37.050
"The Adventure of the
Kavalier &amp; Clay [phonetic]".

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:39.520
So I will not do it.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.920
I will give you credit.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.220
And the --

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.710
&gt;&gt; The other one was about Yiddish.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.010
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Ah.

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:48.220
&gt;&gt; If there is a market
for Yiddish --

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.520
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.820
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: A
market for Yiddish?

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.120
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: So in the
[inaudible] population,

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.780
they have comics in Yiddish.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.060
And this is the big heat.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.130
This is going very well.

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:06.800
And they are selling more comics
magazine in the [inaudible].

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.660
Like each week there is like
two new magazines very --

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:20.310
really because in Israeli comics,
it's like now the parents like if

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.390
in the '50s, they told the
kids, "Don't read comics.

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:25.790
Read real books."

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:30.150
In our days, the parents say,
"Okay, read comics, read something.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.450
Don't watch TV."

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:37.720
[Laughter] They really
encourage them to read that.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:42.390
So most of the kids in Israel
still watch TV and not read comics.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.320
But still, in the [inaudible],
that they don't want

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.240
that they will watch
TV, it's really selling.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.260
And they have Goldberg, this
character that he speaks Yiddish.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:57.690
And yes it's -- I think
that it's also a good idea

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:03.430
to make a Yiddish superhero
for a movie.

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:04.730
You have great ideas.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.030
You should be a filmmaker.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.330
[Laughter]

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.440
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley:
Okay; the last question.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.660
&gt;&gt; I had a question about
superheroes in politics.

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.760
You had Goldemeyer
[phonetic] there on the screen.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.220 position:56%
What about super losers in politics?

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.850
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Super losers,
not just superheroes in politics.

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:26.150
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Oh.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:35.490
But this is -- you touch really --
Goldemeyer, it's important symbol.

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:37.900
In American society, she's like --

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:44.130
tonight I am going to the National
Jewish Museum in Philadelphia.

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:49.690
So she's one of the top Jewish
figures in the 20th Century.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:53.040
In Israel they dislike her.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.580
She is not -- because she's
connected to the Yom Kippur

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:03.270
for '73 -- for the Israel
society, Goldemeyer she's a loser.

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.830
They don't like her.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.630
So this is the difference.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:10.050
[ Silence ]

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:11.350
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:14.610
So are there lots of -- is there
political element in comics?

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:15.910
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes, yes.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:17.210
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:18.510
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: For sure.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:19.990
And like always in a
subculture, there is --

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:26.220
it's more criticizing
and satiric comics.

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.520
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley:
Okay, all right, good.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.620
&gt;&gt; I have just one
question too, if I can.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.920
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.900
&gt;&gt; Was there some pushback when
they did the Holocaust comics

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.570
because of the topic?

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.170
Did people think it was
not an appropriate form

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:39.470
to discuss the Holocaust?

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:40.770
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.070
So was there a pushback when the
Holocaust comics were published?

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:43.370
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: So I
think that in '82,

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:44.670
it was published first time Maus.

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.970
And this was a breakthrough.

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:47.270
And Maus was saying that you
can tell stories for adults.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.570
You can tell them in
a format of a book,

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:49.870
of a novel graphic you can tell
stories about the Holocaust.

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:51.170
And Maus also was translated
to Hebrew.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:52.470
And it was changing
also in the comic world.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:53.770
It made what it's -- there
is now a differentiation

00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:55.070
between comics magazines
and graphic novels.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:56.370
This was Maus.

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:57.670
Maus was the first one.

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:58.970
So this guy, Michel Kishka
[phonetic], that did it,

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.270 position:56%
he did it only four years ago to do
a graphic novel about his experience

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.570
as a second-generation
about the Holocaust.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:02.870
The ground was already
prepared for him to do it.

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:04.170
And it's a great graphic novel.

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:05.470
You should have it here.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.770
[Laughs]

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.070
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: We do.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:09.370
We do.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.670
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: All right.

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.270
Well, thank you very much.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.070
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:01:07.070
[ Applause ]

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.340
&gt;&gt;Gail Shirazi: I want to thank
Asaf, and I want to thank Georgia

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.510
for the very interesting program.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:15.190
And we hope you will
come to our next one.

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.490
Thank you.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.350
And we have some comic books
here if you want to take a look.

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.650
&gt;&gt; Asaf Galay: Yes.

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:25.390
