00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.492
It is a scientifically proven
fact that it is more fun to do

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:08.130
things with other people
than to do them alone.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.680
This is why the bus was
invented in 1884.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.760
This is also why the pizza
was invented by

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.060
the Italians in 1823.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.780
It is even more scientifically
proven that watching stuff

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.340
with other people is more fun
than watching it yourself.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.610
This is why the sofa was
invented in 1972.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.950
By the way, the word sofa comes
from the words "so far,"

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.080
as in Google I/O is happening
so far from here that I'm

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.180
probably going to organize
an event and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.600
watch it with my friends.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.020
Anyways, there's this Google
I/O Extended thing that was

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.210
invented in 2009.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.420
The main idea is to have an
event at the same time when

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.650
Google I/O happens in California
so that you have

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.260
all the news in real time.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.860
You can discuss the news
as they are coming to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.220
you through the tubes.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.640
You can hack on the new APIs.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.430
You can fantasize about once
having one of these [BLEEP]

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.220
that we're going to announce in
I/O. Basically, you bring

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.060
people in and have fun.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.370
So if you're interested, we
have a couple of tips for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.960
organizing Google
I/O Extendeds.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.705
And we'd definitely like to
help make your Google I/O

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:32.955
Extended great.
