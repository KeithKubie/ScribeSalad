1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,850
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,880
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab this hour
talking about [inaudible] bird's lots of

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,930
words. So once words into your head,

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,410
once they tickle in there and we've
just explained how that happens sort of,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,080
then they are, you know, they're
always, they're like, well,

6
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
what if they're not?

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,040
What would happen if that who
that throng that is in your head.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,153
Yeah.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,210
What if all of that stuff, whatever
is in your head suddenly went

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,370
get yanked right out of your head.
[inaudible] what would be left?

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,330
Hello.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,330
This got us thinking about a very
famous time at probably one of the Ted

13
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:47,530
conferences I grew up the study of the
brain talk given by an euro anonymous

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,710
named Jill bolty. Is it bolty
or bulte? Bowtie Taylor. Yeah,

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,940
and all you really need to know is that
one morning in December of 1996 Dr.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,680
Taylor woke up and she
had, she had a headache.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I woke up to a pounding pain behind my
left eye and it was the kind of pain,

18
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,500
caustic pain that you get
when you bite into ice cream.

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,010
And it just gripped me and
then it released me and it
was very unusual for me to

20
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,680
ever experience any kind of of
pain. And so I thought, okay,

21
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,420
I'll just start my normal routine.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,390
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,

23
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:25,391
which is a full body full exercise
machine and I'm jamming away on this thing

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,870
and I'm realizing that my hands look like
primitive Claus grasping onto the bar.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,950
And I thought, Whoa, I
am a weird looking thing.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,870
So I get off the machine and I'm standing
in my bathroom getting ready to step

27
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:46,640
into the shower and now I lost my balance
and I'm propped up against the wall

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,630
and I'm asking myself, what is
wrong with me? What is going on?

29
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,080
And in that moment, my right arm
went totally paralyzed by my side.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,110
In fact, a blood vessel in the
left hemisphere of Jill's brain had

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,570
popped up and that part of your brain
was starting to shut down and it was the

32
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,760
shutdown that really caught our attention.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,320
In that moment. My brain
chatter went totally silent,

34
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,040
just like someone took a remote
control and pushed the mute button.

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,210
So here I am in this space and my job
and any stress related to my, my job,

36
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:28,500
it was gone and I felt lighter in my body.

37
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,240
And then all of a sudden my
left hemisphere comes back
online and it says to me,

38
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,550
hey, having a stroke and we got to
get some help. And I'm going, oh,

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,670
I got a problem, I've got a problem. So
it's like, okay, okay, I got a problem.

40
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:46,480
But then I immediately
drifted right back out.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,650
And I affectionately refer to this
space as la La land. But it was,

42
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm just watching my brain
become more and more, uh,

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,050
I'm incapable of at is Jill both
detailer herself. Hi Robert.

44
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,660
We actually got her into a
studio. Hello Dad. Hello.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,260
Cause we wanted to ask you some questions
about that moment when her inner

46
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,160
voices went away. So let's,

47
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,700
let's talk about brain
chatter for a moment in the
story that we've told so far,

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,000
you're still asking yourself questions.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,660
Know did that stop it on
the morning of the stroke?

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,830
I was doing this wafting dance between
the right hemisphere and the left

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,990
hemisphere. So language
would come back on.

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,710
But once I got to the emergency
room and I passed out,

53
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:37,390
when I woke later that afternoon,
I had absolutely no language.

54
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,590
Did you know your name? No.
Did you know your address? No.

55
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Did you know about your summer from
1983 you know like my mom is so and so.

56
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,200
Any of them? None of it.
I didn't know any of that.

57
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,930
Just imagine she's lying in her bed.
Her head is shaved, wrapped in bandages.

58
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,050
She's had hours of brain surgeries,
got tubes coming out of her mouth,

59
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,570
however knows she's lost her
career. She's lost her language.

60
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,630
I lost all my memories and yet she says,

61
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,870
sitting there in that
suddenly wordless space,

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I had found a peace inside of
myself that I had not known before.

63
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,120
I had pure silence inside
of my mind. Pure silence,

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,780
pure silence. Hear silence. What you know,

65
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,910
not that little voice that that you know.

66
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,030
You wake up in the morning and the
first thing your brain says is, Oh man,

67
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,230
the sun is shining. Well imagine that
you don't hear that little voice saying,

68
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:37,180
man, the sun is shining and you just
experience the sun and the shining

69
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,540
does. Is this the absence
of reflection of any kind?

70
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,910
Is it just central intake and

71
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,730
that is exactly what it was. It was.
It was all of the present moment.

72
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,230
Did you have FOBTs I had joy. I had,

73
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,770
I just had joy. I had,

74
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,190
I had this magnificent experience of
I'm this collection of these beautiful

75
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,830
cells. I'm organic. I'm
this, this organic entity.

76
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,090
You have a period by any chance. You know,

77
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,840
I missed that by a few years,
but I get a lot of that.

78
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,340
And the other thing that she told us is
that lying in that bed with outwards,

79
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,590
she says she felt connected to things,

80
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,650
to everything in a way
that she never had before.

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,583
Oh yeah.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,420
I lost all definition of myself in
relationship to everything in the external

83
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,254
world.

84
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,300
You mean like you couldn't figure out
where you ended [inaudible] how much of

85
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:44,301
that was was about language
of little part a lot.

86
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,170
I mean, oh,

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,060
I would say it was huge languages
and ongoing information processing.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,110
It's the constant reminder
I am, this is my name,

89
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:59,210
this is all the data related to me
are the my likes and my dislikes.

90
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,020
These are my beliefs. I am an
individual. I am a single. I'm a solid.

91
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,430
I'm separate from you.

92
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,940
This is Rudy as this may sound
pin all of this on language.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,230
We have run into this idea before
a couple of seasons ago. Uh,

94
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,900
Paul Brock's remember him. Yeah.
Neuro-Psychologist trust me about myself.

95
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,890
He told me that there is a theory out
there which she believes actually that all

96
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,520
a person is in the end, like
all the personhood of a person,

97
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,530
the I or the you of a person.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,920
All that is in the end is a story.

99
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,350
A story you tell yourself we normally
think of when we think about ourselves is

100
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,830
really a story. It's the story of
what's happened to that body over time.

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,000
I did not have that portion of my
language centers that tells a story.

102
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,100
Here he is little Jill, Jill Bolte Taylor,

103
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,210
climbing the Harvard ladder through
language loves does section cutting up

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,340
thing. That language was gone. I
got to essentially become an infant

105
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,480
again. This is the problem here.

106
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,050
What do you mean when you drop out of
the ins of yourself or the story of

107
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,050
yourself, then you are
left. She says that piece,

108
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,240
I could argue that that's just stranded.

109
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,620
That's stranded in the sunshine
with the wind in the now.

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,020
But I mean it's not like she stayed there.

111
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,130
That's to me wouldn't be a dog to her if
she had, and as she started to recover,

112
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,780
she ran into something
kind of interesting,

113
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,500
which sounded to me sorta like what?

114
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,930
Maybe the rats and the babies
go through in the white room.

115
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,980
She would have these disparate thoughts
and then go back and remissed all out.

116
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,750
Like she couldn't bring them together.
When, when people would speak to me,

117
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,470
I would, I remembered in pictures. So, um,

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,150
if somebody would ask me, who is the
president of the United States of America?

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,370
This is a huge question.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,350
So for the next several hours I'd
be pondering president, president,

121
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,170
president wants a president.

122
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,720
And then I would get a picture in
my mind of a president as a leader,

123
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,960
a picture of a specific
guy. It's, it was actually,

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,050
it still flashes into my mind.
It's, it's a picture of a,

125
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:12,800
of a silhouette of a male
presidential profile.

126
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,990
Like maybe the idea of
a president basically.

127
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,710
So that was our president and then I
had to figure out a United States then.

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,330
So yeah, eventually I come
up with this map in my mind,

129
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,730
this picture of the United States
and like the line drawings.

130
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,660
Now she's got this map, she's got
the silhouette of a guy and she said,

131
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,130
after hours, president United States,
President United States. And I was like,

132
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:37,340
oh my God. She still couldn't
somehow bring him together.

133
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,110
I didn't have the road that I had
to travel in order to come up with.

134
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,590
Um, I think it was Clinton at the time.
Yeah, it was Clinton at the time. No,

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,220
as Jill starts to get better,

136
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:52,160
this is after eight years
of hard work and recovery.

137
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:55,410
And finally the words start to
trickle back. And when they did,

138
00:08:55,411 --> 00:09:00,411
she says that silence that she
loved so much got pushed out.

139
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,620
That was one of the sacrifices for
me. That was one of the sacrifices.

140
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,120
Wow. Oh Wow.

141
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,550
We're doing a, we're doing
a language show here a year.

142
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,310
The auntie queen of our language. So
you're like same Clooney, it's it.

143
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,540
No, no, no, no, no, no.

144
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,550
But what I am saying is that in order
for us to communicate with language,

145
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,010
we pull ourselves away from a
different kind of experience.

146
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
I do believe that there are
times when you need to let your,

147
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
your brain chatter be quiet.

148
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,800
But is it fair to say this is like,

149
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,910
please agree or disagree
with this statement?

150
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I think that words and language
and grammar are necessary,

151
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,170
but not half as good as wind in my hair
as smelling my nose and that old right

152
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:51,840
brain sensual immediacy.

153
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,510
Yeah. You know, if,
um, if I had to choose,

154
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,460
which is essentially what you're
saying, if I had to choose, um,

155
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,360
that would be really, really,
really tough decision.

156
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,660
[inaudible].

157
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,990
Jill Bolte Taylor is the author
of, uh, what's it called?

158
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,920
The book my stroke of insight.
Yes. Check our website,

159
