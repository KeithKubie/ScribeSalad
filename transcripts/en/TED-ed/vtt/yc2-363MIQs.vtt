00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.791
It can strike without warning,
at any moment.

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.144
You may be walking across a soft carpet
and reaching for the door knob

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:18.746
when suddenly...zap!

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.831
To understand static electricity,

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.049
we first need to know a bit
about the nature of matter.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:25.846
All matter is made up of atoms

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:28.897
that consist of three 
types of smaller particles:

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.085
negatively charged electrons,

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.433
positively charged protons,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.589
and neutral neutrons.

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.694
Normally, the electrons and protons
in an atom balance out,

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:44.261
which is why most matter you come across
is electrically neutral.

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.092
But electrons are tiny 
and almost insignificant in mass,

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:51.425
and rubbing or friction can give
loosely bound electrons

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:55.059
enough energy to leave their atoms
and attach to others,

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.598
migrating between different surfaces.

00:00:57.598 --> 00:00:58.791
When this happens,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.384
the first object is left 
with more protons than electrons

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:05.213
and becomes positively charged,

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:09.386
while the one with more electrons
accumulates a negative charge.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.285
This situation is called
a charge imbalance,

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:15.239
or net charge separation.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.611
But nature tends towards balance,

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:22.915
so when one of these newly charged bodies
comes into contact with another material,

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.123
the mobile electrons 
will take the first chance they get

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:28.119
to go where they're most needed,

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.564
either jumping off the negatively
charged object,

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:33.734
or jumping onto 
the positively charged one

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:37.654
in an attempt to restore 
the neutral charge equilibrium.

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:41.734
And this quick movement of electrons,
called static discharge,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.082
is what we recognize as that sudden spark.

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:48.314
This process doesn't happen 
with just any objects.

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:51.220
Otherwise you'd be getting 
zapped all the time.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.392
Conductors like metals and salt water

00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:56.507
tend to have loosely 
bound outer electrons,

00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:59.781
which can easily flow between molecules.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:03.798
On the other hand, insulators 
like plastics, rubber and glass

00:02:03.798 --> 00:02:08.780
have tightly bound electrons
that won't readily jump to other atoms.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.186
Static build-up is most likely to occur

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:14.947
when one of the materials involved
is an insulator.

00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:16.499
When you walk across a rug,

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.675
electrons from your body
will rub off onto it,

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:24.364
while the rug's insulating wool
will resist losing its own electrons.

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:28.452
Although your body and the rug
together are still electrically neutral,

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:31.461
there is now a charge polarization
between the two.

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.522
And when you reach to touch the door knob,

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:34.456
zap!

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:37.925
The metal door knob's loosely 
bound electrons hop to your hand

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.879
to replace the electrons 
your body has lost.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.098
When it happens in your bedroom,
it's a minor nuisance.

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:46.212
But in the great outdoors,

00:02:46.212 --> 00:02:50.751
static electricity can be a terrifying,
destructive force of nature.

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:54.532
In certain conditions,
charge separation will occur in clouds.

00:02:54.532 --> 00:02:56.977
We don't know exactly how this happens.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.741
It may have to do with the circulation
of water droplets

00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.342
and ice particles within them.

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:05.169
Regardless, the charge 
imbalance is neutralized

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.931
by being released towards another body,

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:09.083
such as a building,

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.210
the Earth,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.292
or another cloud in a giant spark
that we know as lightning.

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:17.859
And just as your fingers can be zapped
over and over in the same spot,

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.940
you better believe that lightning 
can strike the same place more than once.
