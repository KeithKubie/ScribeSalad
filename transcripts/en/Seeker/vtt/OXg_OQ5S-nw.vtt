00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.049
Kale is the cinderella of leafy greens, it
seems in the past few years it’s gone from

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.700
bottom of the barrel food to diet mainstay.
But does it really deserve to be this popular?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.530
Hey there, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.860
It’s no secret fruits and veggies are good
for you. Like REALLY GOOD FOR YOU. They’re

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.670
densely packed with lots of nutrients and
are known to fight cancer and heart disease.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.140
But recently Kale has gone from garnish to
main course, sales went up 400% in the course

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.300
of a year, &nbsp;a group of doctors and chefs
even petitioned the white house to make October

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.140
2nd National Kale day. But who is the true
king of so-called super foods? In a recent

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.110
report from the Center for Disease control,
it’s not kale. The popular green placed

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.880
a paltry 15th. &nbsp;In terms of nutrient density,
other leafy greens like chicory and chinese

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.399
cabbage bested the super popular super food.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.180
Chopping the CDC charts with a Nutrient density
ranking of 100, watercress. &nbsp;Per calorie

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.370
it packs the biggest nutrient punch. The tangy
salad and sandwich topper is low on calories

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.280
but high in vitamins and minerals. Some studies
show it might even fight cancer. One study

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.760
suggested a compound found in the plant could
turn off a protein that breast cancer needs

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
to go.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.890
In comparison, while it still contains vitamins
and minerals and also helps fight cancer,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.659
kale’s nutrient density is only 49.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.299
But before you call for a national watercress
day, consider this. The reason watercress

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.060
bests kale on this list is all about the calories.
The Nutrient Density Scores are based on nutrients

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.049
per calorie. So kale’s score of 49 means
that you get about half of the nutrients you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.242
need in 100 calories of kale. Watercress’s
score of 100 means you get about all of the

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:39.380
nutrients you need in 100 calories of watercress.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.990
In terms of what you actually eat, counting
serving size, not calories, gives you a better

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.140
idea. &nbsp;One cup of watercress contains just
4 calories but provides 106% of the vitamin

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.829
K you need and about a quarter of vitamins
A and C.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.920
&nbsp;
Just one cup of kale on the other hand contains

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.290
33 calories but those calories pack a punch,
&nbsp;and contain over 6 times the amount of vitamin

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.090
K you should get and over 100% of your recommended
vitamin A &amp; C intake. Personally, I’d prefer

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.369
a cup of kale to more than a cup of watercress
to get the same healthy goodness.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.810
So cup for cup, kale still wins. But you really
can’t go wrong with any vegetable. Others

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.160
on the CDC list like, broccoli and cauliflower
have been shown to reduce lung cancer in mice

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.250
AND humans. Tomatoes, carrots, and blackberries
are also super healthy and contain compounds

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.580
that fight cancer and heart disease. &nbsp;While
trends come and go, at the end of the day

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:39.370
you can’t lose with a diet of fruits 
and veggies.
