["The Review Must Go On"]

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.500
[gentle music]

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.540
["The Review Must Go On"]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.140
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.380
Ever since I started this show, I've got a lot of requests to review the movie "Cats Don't Dance," released in 1997.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.180
Really? This is seen as a bad movie?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
I mean, I remember seeing it a long time ago, and I recall it being okay.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.540
Not perfect, but a serviceable film.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.040
A nice little kid's movie with nice animation and one or two laughs.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.660
I even mentioned at one point I would never review this movie,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.020
because I didn't think the flaws were bad enough to fill up an entire review.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.960
But then I started thinking about it. Maybe you don't want me to review this movie because it's so bad, but because it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.760
left an impact.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.900
I'm hearing more and more that this is one of those movies that was played a lot on Cartoon Network,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.360
and even though it bombed at the box office, it found life on VHS,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.940
resulting in only now a wide screen release on DVD.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.160
And with all the recommendations I've been getting for it, clearly it has a following.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.040
So, what is it that draws so many people to this animated flick?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.960
Eh, why not take a look? This is my quick mini-review of "Cats Don't Dance."

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.400
It starts off with a Randy Newman song...

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.840
[inhales] That's nice.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.140
...as we see a cat in the nineteen thirties named Danny, played by Scott Bakula...

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.140
This will be the greatest movie ever made if this is all secretly an identity from "Quantum Leap!"

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.040
...is traveling to Hollywood to try and become a star.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.800
Danny: ♪ You can do anything, if you try ♪

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.680
♪ Dig that face, they ain't seen nothin' like it any place ♪

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380
♪ It's right up off the movie screen ♪♪

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.740
Nostalgia Critic: The first thing you might notice about this film is that it seems, well, corny.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Like, Indiana can't supply enough fuel for your corniness.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.300
But, there's a couple things to keep in mind.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.200
On top of the beautifully colorful and lively animation, this is a throwback to musicals of that era,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.340
which represents Danny's optimism that's going to be dashed later on in the film.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.560
In fact, reality is already kind of sinking in,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.620
as the love interest of the film is not introduced through glitter and lights,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.880
but, rather, Danny unknowingly screwing her over, blinded by his cheerfulness.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.860
Everything he does somehow results in her misery.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.600
Also, sh*t, Captain Archer's a good singer!

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.780
Danny: ♪ Hollywood! Where the streets are paved with gold ♪

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.360
♪ Where the kitties never grow old ♪♪

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.100
Nostalgia Critic: Ensign! Set a course for... smooth.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.960
[lounge piano music] Yeah, how ya doin'? Yeah.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.760
Danny enters a talent agency, coming across a slew of weirdos and has-beens,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.980
if they ever have been,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.220
and the talent agent just happens to need a cat for a Noah's Ark picture.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.240
Farley: Just sign here, here, here, here,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.460
[rapidly] and here and here and here and here over there down the middle... [gibberish]

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.800
Sawyer: A cat crossed my path.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.100
Tilly: Orange tabby?
Sawyer: Yeah?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.020
Tilly: Green vest?
Sawyer: Yeah?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.820
Tilly: Straw hat?
Sawyer: Yeah!

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.480
Tilly: Oh, what a coinkydink!
Sawyer: How'd you know?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.320
Tilly: Hippo intuition?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.300
Farley: Ha!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.600
Nostalgia Critic: While the music in scenes like this can get distractingly loud,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
the pacing is pretty impressive,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.720
calling back to classic fast-talking comedies of that time

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.860
like "His Girl Friday" and "Bringing Up Baby."

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.300
Farley: I'll give you Sundays off.
Sawyer: I never work Sundays.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.160
Farley: Pay you double time?
Sawyer: Triple time.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.360
Farley: Triple time?!
Sawyer: Is there an echo in here?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.500
Farley: You're pushing me!
Sawyer: No chow, no meow.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.300
Walter Burns: Look, darling, this will bring us back together again. Just the way we used to be!

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.500
Hildegard "Hildy" Johnson: That's just what I'm afraid of. Any time, anyplace, anywhere.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.680
Walter Burns: Don't mock me! This is bigger than anything that ever happened to us!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.580
Nostalgia Critic: Only this time, the animation can magnify the movements as well as the speech.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.040
Plus, our love interest, Sawyer, played by Jasmine Guy,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.920
continues to comedically be the subject of needless violence, the best kind of violence.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.540
[Sawyer yowls]

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.020
I'm not usually for animal cruelty, but if Tom and Sawyer could get together for a slapstick routine,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.720
I already have the perfect name.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.100
Man: Tom Sawyer?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.000
Nostalgia Critic: That's actually better!

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.020
Sawyer gets roped into a role, too, as they can't find any female cats,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.220
and they're off to shoot with their main star,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.380
a Shirley Temple knockoff named Darla Dimple,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.820
played by Ashley Peldon.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.120
She's just jealous because she flunked out of art class.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.660
Darla: ♪ I built a little boat, as cute as it can be ♪♪

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.020
Nostalgia Critic: This character is by far the best part of the movie.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.920
At first you might be wondering what I'm talking about, but when Danny musically improvises?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.520
Her reactions from here on out are beyond priceless.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.380
Darla: And who here's an angel?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.500
YOU TELL ME WHO HERE IS AN ANGEL!

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.360
Flanigan: Why you are Darla! Sweetheart, celebrity, darling! [chokes]

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.560
Nostalgia Critic: I don't think there's enough haunted houses for the amount of scary faces she makes in this movie.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.760
They're all horrifyingly insane, and the animation doesn't hold back in the slightest,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.200
making every reaction hilarious.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.720
Even the one on the cover is kind of disturbing.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.920
She looks like whoever possessed Regan in "The Exorcist".

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.460
With such a lighthearted tone for the rest of the film,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.120
this is an enjoyably cynical  approach to a child icon.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.000
It's kind of weird, but also funny, this idea of turning a Shirley Temple type persona into a villain.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.620
It's equivalent of showing the Olsen twins as villains,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.500
or the Jerry McGuire kid as a villain,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.100
or... [evil laugh]

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.440
Dah! No, that one's for real!

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.840
This leads to the only character who might actually be funnier than Darla, her butler, Max.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.360
When she calls for him, we don 't even see him approach, he's already inside.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.320
The angles they use to show the size of this guy are simple in layout,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320
but ridiculously effective.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.160
He never even separates his teeth to say a word.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.760
Max: Yes, Miss Dimple?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.200
Nostalgia Critic: And when he puts Danny in his place,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.620
his exit perfectly through the him-shaped hole is inspiringly extreme.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.780
I don't think Batman could have an exit that good.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.640
When Danny tries to figure out what he did wrong, Sawyer lays some blunt reality on him,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.000
leading to probably the film's most poignant line.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.480
Danny: All I want to do is the thing I love.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.620
Doesn't everyone?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.740
Nostalgia Critic: But Danny finds out he's not the only one with dashed dreams.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.100
He comes across an elephant named Woolie Mammoth,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.860
who's the logo for the studio, which he has to do every time they make a movie.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.800
This cracks me up, because it would be so much easier just to shoot it once and reuse the footage.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.440
But every time a movie is made, he has to squeeze his head through, get made up,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.820
and he has to do the sound effect all over again.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.820
That's just enjoyably pointless.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.720
It's made even funnier by the fact that he's apparently a piano player.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.980
How???

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.420
He has hooves! Or paws! Or whatever elephant hands are called!

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.240
How does he hit the keys?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.860
I know it's a small thing, but that really makes me laugh.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.440
Danny finds out that Woolie wanted to be a musician,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.820
but the Hollywood system chewed him up and spat him out, just like all the rest of his new friends.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.340
Apparently, Hollywood just isn't interested in animals as leads.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.100
Danny: But I thought Hollywood was always looking for new talent?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.280
Woolie: Ah ah ah! Talented *people*. Not animals.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.240
Nostalgia Critic: When will human-washing stop?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.060
But Danny thinks he can inspire everybody again,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.240
and brings out some old costumes and instruments to have fun with.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.840
The color literally comes back into their lives.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.060
In fact, the use of color to show their constant conflicting emotions is very clever.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.320
Whey they're interested, they start to glow and become more vibrant.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.220
But when they're not, they step back into the shadows, and once again, the color is removed.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.060
It's subtle, but it's pretty smart.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.160
Darla sees that Danny is going to try and get an audition with a big-time producer,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.020
and she's afraid that their talent might upstage hers.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.360
Darla: Invite that cat... to teeeeeeea.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.220
Nostalgia Critic: Okay, if Jared Leto harnessed this kind of creepiness, we would have a much better Joker.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.540
Darla invites Danny over to her house and offers him and his animal friends

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.520
her studio and props to audition for the big-time producer, L. B. Mammoth.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.880
Little does Danny know that L. B. doesn't know, and they're about to crash an important press conference.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.040
Cue the most maniacally maniacal of laughs.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.920
Darla: [maniacal laugh]

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.100
Nostalgia Critic: Is it wrong that I'm siding with the villain and I really think she should have her own movies?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.400
We get a pretty fun villain song

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.080
obviously making every person who worked on it the happiest animators in the world.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.760
Darla: ♪ Big and loud! ♪

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.940
♪ It's gonna be big and loud! ♪

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.340
Nostalgia Critic: And thus, the animals show up to the studio, but Darla floods the stage,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.580
putting the press conference, as well as the entire studio, under water.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.460
All the animals are fired, and they of course blame Danny, leading of course, to a sad song...

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.740
...from Sawyer...

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.340
...doing her best Natalie Cole impression.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:51.360
Sawyer: ♪ Gonna turn just a little unkind ♪♪

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.340
Nostalgia Critic: It's not bad, but if you've heard Sally's song from "A Nightmare Before Christmas"

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.480
and just put little cat ears on top of her head, it's pretty much the same thing.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.340
But Danny gets an idea on how to redeem himself, as well as get some revenge.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.580
He invites everyone to the premiere of her movie, planning to show everyone what they can do.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.960
But Max hears a bow tie snap and is literally gone in the next shot.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.720
The only thing funnier that what we see with this guy is what we don't see.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.340
Danny and Max have a big fight on top of a Darla balloon...

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.400
One of the strangest settings for a climax since David Hasselhoff.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.780
...and Danny eventually sends him flying.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.560
This results in the animals going on to perform, and making it look like it was Darla's idea.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.560
The audience is resistant, but they give them a chance, and of course, they love them.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.380
Even with Darla trying to stop them yet again, she only ends up making the show even better.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.100
She accidentally exposes her evil plans to everyone, resulting in her career being destroyed,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.160
and the animals acting in movies that wouldn't be released for sixty years.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.060
And that is "Cats Don't Dance."

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.380
Is it corny? Yeah. Are there times when the music and sound effects are a little much? Absolutely. But...

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.960
How did "The Hudsucker Proxy" put it and then I stole years later?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.380
Norville Barnes: You know, for kids.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.040
[ding]

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.880
Some movies are for families, this is clearly for kids.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.180
That is to say, there are definitely elements for adults.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.580
Darla is great, her butler is great, the callbacks to classic Hollywood are nice,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.160
and, honestly, you could argue that there's a good lesson about prejudice in there.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.680
Despite it being called the Golden Age of Cinema, there were still many groups that were kept out of it.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:33.260
If you replace the animals in this movie with many minority groups, you could actually have yourself a pretty fitting commentary.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.300
Is that what they had in mind? I don't know, it could be a very simple follow-your-dreams story.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.120
But if "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" can be about cartoon animals dealing with racism, why can't this?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.280
And if you think it's too strange or goofy to be enjoyed, look on the bright side.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.860
Michael Jackson was going to be a part of it.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.140
Yeah, no joke.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:59.720
This was originally supposed to star a live-action Michael Jackson with animated characters wanting to be movie stars.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.040
In fact, at one point, it was supposed to be the Looney Tunes.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.520
But after Jackson dropped out, they gave the Looney Tunes move to Michael Jordan,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.880
and kept the story going, because, hey, maybe there was something there even without Jackson.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.820
And again, I think there is, if you look at it as a kid's film.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:22.420
It's not going to entertain both adults and children perfectly like "The Iron Giant," "Kung-Fu Panda," or "Spirited Away,"

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.860
but it's colorful, energized, and has a good message for kids,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.420
while also having some great expressions, hints of cynicism, and nice salutes to the early days of film for adults.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.800
It's not a classic, but it's a good film.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.840
It's a little cheesy, but if done well, cheesy is fine.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.000
It's definitely worth showing to children, and maybe you too can sneak a peek and gain just the right amount of enjoyment from it.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.340
How'd that phrase go again, Tim Robbins?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.440
Norville Barnes: You know, for kids.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.060
Nostalgia Critic: Exactly. But you know what, sometimes there's no fault in wanting to feel like a kid again,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.140
and this is a good film to do that with.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.400
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.580
