00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.839
This is Pixar Studios.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.970
I'm sure almost everyone's heard of them, and watch their movies.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.490
They've, they've won a few awards along the way, too.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.000
But less people realize just how much mathematics and science goes into animating these films.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.909
Even the boss here is a computer scientist.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.018
This is Tony DeRose, and he leads the research group at Pixar. And today he's talking to us here at numberphile.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.210
Well my particular area of

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.009
interest is in, in geometric modelling. Creating shapes of things.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.459
And that problem comes up a lot around here because we've got characters with, you know, pretty complicated shapes.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.590
You know, some of the characters on the board behind me.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.760
This is a,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.289
this is a sculpture of the hand of Geri, from Geri's Game, a character in a short film that we did

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.340
quite a few years ago now, and it, you know, just, it's a complicated shape,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.329
and we needed to develop some way of representing these kinds of shapes

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.759
in a way that artists could deal with, but computers could, could render and display quickly, as well.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.389
So Jan Pinkava, the director of Geri's Game, was also a sculptor.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.209
So he created this sculpture of Geri's hand, and then we later digitized it and made the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.640
final surface that appeared on the screen.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.289
Let's simplify first, and we'll get back to surfaces in three dimensions in a minute.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.829
But let's start, say, with curves in two dimensions, to explain the basics of the process. So, what I've got here is a little

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.549
four point polygon, and it's gonna be my job to make a smooth curve out of it.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.489
I'm gonna make a smooth curve out of it by just repeating a few simple steps. So, the first step

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.329
I'm gonna call split, and

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.289
what that does is it adds midpoints to the edges. So now I've got eight points, but it's not really any smoother.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.299
The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make it a little bit smoother by repositioning all eight of these points.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.399
So this guy, for instance, is gonna move from where he is now to the midpoint of his right neighbor.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.079
Similarly, this guy is going to move to his right neighbor. And let me animate that for you.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.328
I'll call that the averaging step. So now we've got eight points, a little bit smoother. And again,

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.759
my goal is to make a smooth curve, and so I'm just gonna repeat.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.509
I'm gonna split and average, so now I've got 16 points. Again, a little bit smoother.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.339
I'll put those two steps into a combined step I'll call subdivide. And you see that as I continue to subdivide the,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.160
a smooth curve starts to emerge.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
And that's the basis of how we

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.579
create all of our surfaces. This splitting and averaging idea also works for surfaces.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.149
So here's an example where I start with a cube. So if I split,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.389
it's a little more complicated for surfaces to split.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140
I have to insert edge midpoints, like this one here. Like I did for curves.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.009
And I also have to introduce the middles of faces. But again, that's just done by averaging. So this point

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.500
here is just the average of the four points around it. And then I average. In this case,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.589
I need to use a carefully constructed weighted average, for reasons

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.250
we may talk about in a minute.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.429
But if I pick my averaging weights carefully enough, I can continue this split and average process and

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.650
generate smooth surfaces in the limit.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.450
And that's exactly how Geri's hand, and, in fact, Geri himself, was built. Well, here, for instance, are the points that we digitized off this,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.819
this sculpture, before subdivision, we run this splitting and averaging process a lot of times, and that smoothes the surface out, and creates the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.320
smooth shape that you ultimately see on the screen.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.119
Brady: "To the untrained person, which I very much am, this seems sort of, it doesn't

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.810
"seem very subtle. It seems like anything you feed into this process will just kind of get blob-ized in

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.109
"the same way, everything will get turned into this kind of generic blob.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.149
"Is there, is there more nuance to this, than what it, than what it looks like? Or does everything turn into a big bleh?"

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.329
Well, there is some nuance. There's some magic numbers involved.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.630
So let's get a sense of what those numbers are. One pair of magic numbers are 1, 1 here. Those are the weights that I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.409
used in this averaging step, when I moved things to midpoints.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.829
And those are magic because you can show that a nice thing happens in the limit of this subdivision.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.759
So this 1, 1 means it's gonna go to a spot that is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.249
one part of where he is now, and one part of where his right neighbor is now. Okay, so let's do that.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.069
Let's, let's, each stage is split followed by average. So there's the split.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.519
So when he moves according to the 1, 1 rule,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.770
he's gonna move from where he is now to here.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.930
And this guy's gonna move from where he is now to here, and so on. So we'll see that.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.799
And we just keep repeating that process, and

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.748
a beautiful thing happens. In the limit, you can show that this curve is a,

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:49.589
there's a parabolic arc that sits in here, and there's another parabolic arc that sits in here, and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.159
those two parabolic arcs meet with a smooth

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.849
derivative, a smooth tangent line, at this point.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.340
And that's all just an emergent property of this subdivision process. There are some other magic numbers I can use. For instance, if I use

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.478
1, 2, 1, so I split as before. Now if we use the 1, 2, 1 rule, this guy is gonna move from where he is now to

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.479
two parts of where he is now,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.764
one part of his left neighbor, and one part of his right neighbor. So it's 1, 2, 1.

00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:22.169
Brady: "So he, so he's carrying more of his weight"

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.199
Yeah, exactly. And so if I

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.318
average it with that set of weights, I get a shape like this.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.949
If I continue to split and average, again something really nice happens.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.250
When we used the 1, 1 rule, we got piecewise parabolas, which are degree two curves.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.629
Here, we're gonna get degree three curves, in the limit. And if I pick weights 1, 3, 3, 1, and do this process,

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.729
it turns out you get degree four curves. And

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.219
this pattern is, I think, probably familiar to many of your viewers. 1 1, 1 2 1, 1 3 3 1.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.848
Those are all rows of something called Pascal's triangle.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.180
So what we're learning here is that if you pick your weights carefully, that is, from rows of Pascal's triangle,

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.408
the curves that you get in the limit are nice and smooth, and

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.009
they're polynomials, and the degree of the polynomial is given by how deep into Pascal's triangle you pick your weights.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.819
But you don't have to pick them carefully, you don't have to pick your weights carefully.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.289
I can, in fact, I don't even have to make the weights positive. So suppose

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:35.219
I pick rates 1, minus 2 and 3. So I split as before, and now this guy is gonna go to a point

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.480
which is minus one times himself, one times his left neighbor, and three times his right neighbor.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.180
Brady: "I have no idea what's going to happen."

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.240
Yeah. Let's see what happens.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.920
Okay.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.360
Something interesting.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.010
Let's continue.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.780
We'll keep doing that.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.780
So what we're seeing here is,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.110
in the limit, if you don't pick your weights carefully, you get something that isn't smooth anywhere. In fact,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.520
it's a fractal.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.920
Brady: "So, when I watch one of your films, which one is the right one? Which one creates

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.340
"the surfaces that make you happy?"

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.960
Well, it turns out that for surfaces, this

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.059
Pascal's triangle pattern doesn't work any more.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.790
You have to use a,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.690
a different set of mathematical tools to figure out weights that are gonna generate smooth objects in the limit,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.379
and those are very carefully chosen weights. They were first discovered by Ed Catmull forty years ago.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.990
Ed's the president of Pixar.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.309
Brady: "Do we know, are those like, are they like, like fractions? Are they, what numbers are they?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.810
"Are they like one, one point seven, and three point nine two? Or..."

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.050
I don't remember them off the top of my head, but there's a simple formula

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.000
that is now well known. You can find it on our website.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.120
Brady: "So when you've got your 3D object,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.402
"they're the, they're the ones you plug in and then, bang."

00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:53.160
Yeah, exactly. So what I was doing

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.790
the subdivision with the cube, we were using those very carefully

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.909
constructed weights that Ed discovered. We do this subdivision process a few times, and it,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:09.479
that gets us points that are kind of close to where they would go if we did in an infinite number of times.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:16.230
But, on top of that there's a few tricks that we use to figure out exactly where they're gonna go. Mathematically,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.610
we, we think about what would happen if we did it an infinite number of times, and it turns out that

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.490
we can write down exactly

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.640
what happens if we did do it an infinite number of times.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.260
Brady: "Let's crack out the paper."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.100
Yeah, so let's see how that works. And, let's start with an observation here.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.639
So I'm gonna go back to the simple 1, 1 rule, that we had earlier.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.489
And watch what happens on, say, this leg of the polygon. So I'm gonna split and average,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.629
and notice that what happened here is that I still have two points on this polygon leg,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.780
they're just a little bit closer. If I split and average again,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.410
again, I get two points on this leg, they're just a little closer together.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.520
If I do it again, again they're closer.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.449
So, what's gonna happen if I do this an infinite number of times? Well, these two points are gonna get closer and closer together,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.780
in the limit, they'll be on top of each other, and

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.109
the location where they converge is

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.840
the midpoint of the original leg.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.080
So without doing any computation at all,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:25.910
I can determine very quickly that these four blue points are on that limit object. And the nice thing about that observation

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:33.410
is that it holds at every stage of subdivision. Watch what happens on this leg of the polygon. So this leg wasn't in my original

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.770
arrangement, but it got introduced after the first stage. And, as I split and average, we're gonna again see

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.470
two points on this same line. They just get closer and closer together, as I subdivide.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.440
And again, they're gonna converge to the midpoint of

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.669
the leg when it was first introduced, so let's go back to that arrangement, here.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.060
So I know that the midpoint of this leg is also on the limit object.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.240
So, after one stage of subdivision, I already know eight points exactly.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.010
Brady: "You refer to this thing called the limit object.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.480
"That's the finished product."

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:12.080
That's the finished product. Right. So, it's the mathematically perfect version. And now I've got eight points that are on the mathematically perfect curve.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.440
Computing what happens in the limit becomes a little bit more

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.799
delicate when we look at one of these

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.679
other rules, like the 1, 2, 1 rule.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.625
So let's see if we can track where this point goes as I subdivide.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.359
Brady: "So we're using a 1, 2, 1 now."

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.729
This is a 1, 2, 1 rule, so if I split and average,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.310
Okay, so he moved some distance.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.669
Let me split and average again. He's moved a little bit more. It's not exactly clear where he's gonna stop.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.680
Brady: "He's not on the limit object yet."

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.180
He's not on the limit object yet, so.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.010
But, yet, we can compute exactly where he's gonna go, with some other magic numbers.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.309
Let's take a look at how that works. I'm gonna draw a little piece of my curve, my original polygon,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.620
and since this is my original polygon,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:11:00.939
I'm gonna use superscript zeroes. So A super zero, B super zero, and C super zero. So that's before subdivision.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.680
If I subdivide once, I get some points that are gonna sit in here,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.890
and I'm gonna call this guy A super 1,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:15.819
B super 1, and C super 1. And if I subdivide it again, I get some more points in here.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.350
And what we want to know is,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:24.219
okay, here's B zero, here's B 1,  B 2's gonna be some place. The question is, where is B infinity?

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.210
We'd like to figure out where that is.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.210
Turns out we can answer that question.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.950
And to do that, I'm gonna write down a few things I know. Well, one thing

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.340
I know is that A super 1 is just on this midpoint,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:43.119
so I could write that as A plus B over 2, and these are super zero guys, my original things. If you work out

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.780
the algebra of the splitting and averaging, using the 1, 2, 1 rule, you can see that B super 1 is A super zero

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.830
plus six B super zero plus C super zero

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.390
divided by eight.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:03.520
So that's just unwinding the split and average process. And then C super 1 again is just the midpoint on this leg.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.810
So that's B super zero plus C super zero over 2.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.330
Ok, well, that isn't obviously helping us answer the question of where B infinity is. To do that,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:20.379
I'm gonna do something a little bit sneaky. Take A super zero and B super zero and C super zero and

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.509
combine them with weights 1, 4 and 1.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.480
And we'll have to divide by 6.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.410
Put a 1 there.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.940
Because I have, kind of, six things in the numerator.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.820
Brady: "Where did the 1, 4, 1 come from?"

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
My back pocket.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:43.399
And, you'll see why I picked 1, 4, 1 in just a second. The real answer is it came from

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:50.359
a tool called Eigenanalysis. But, we don't need Eigenanalysis to see what's gonna happen here.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:57.050
And we take that same combination and apply it to A super 1, B super 1, and C super 1,

00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:59.449
So I get 4 B super 1,

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:04.849
one copy of A super 1, one copy of C super 1, and divide by 6.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:12.920
So now I have two expressions, and if you take these equations over here and just substitute them in here, and simplify,

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:17.719
what you'll see is this expression is actually equal to this expression.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.199
And it's only true for these weights 1, 4, 1.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.260
And the cool thing is that I can use that same

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.120
reasoning to

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.709
figure out that going from the 1, the super 1 condition

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:33.679
to the twice subdivided condition,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:44.329
again, applying 1, 4, 1 to the twice subdivided points, over six, I could, I'll find that these two expressions are  also equal.

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:48.499
So I can repeat this process any number of times I like.

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:57.049
Say, all the way to infinity. So I can compute A infinity, 4 B infinity, plus C infinity,

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:58.910
over six

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:05.420
and that's still gonna be equal to the expression that I had to start with. And now the beautiful thing happens.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.010
If you think about what happens to this little arrangement of three points, as you continue to subdivide,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:16.010
those three points, on the, on the second stage get closer together, on the third stage even closer,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.130
as I do it an infinite number of times, all three of those points converge to this place, B infinity.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.760
So, these are all B infinities, actually. So, this turns into B infinity.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.139
A infinity and B infinity

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:34.579
are the same, in the limit. C infinity and B infinity are the same. So I can rewrite this as B infinity

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.929
plus 4B infinity plus B infinity

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.519
divided by 6. Well, averaging together a bunch of B infinities just gives me B infinity.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.910
And, so, what I've learned is that B infinity is right there.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:58.599
I start with my original points, take them with weight 1, 4, 1, and that gives me B infinity straight away.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.200
Exactly, and no approximation.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.480
Brady: "Before you even started, you knew where B was going to end up."

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.150
Exactly. So if I take some other polygon, now, I know that B

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.189
infinity is gonna be four parts of this guy,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.960
one part of this guy and one part of this guy, which is gonna be a point about right there.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.890
And again, that can be computed without approximation. If I had, say, the 1, 3, 3, 1 rule,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:30.249
I'd get a slightly different set of expressions here, I'd get a different collection of magic numbers,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.900
again,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.040
solved for with a systematic tool called Eigenanalysis,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:43.269
and it would have this same property. And the whole thing works for 3D as well. For surfaces, right. And so that lets us compute

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.030
exact points on our,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:54.699
the surfaces of our characters, and we can even compute exact derivatives, which we need for computing that nice, smooth

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.739
gradation in illumination, or shading, in the graphics.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:08.590
We'll have more from this interview with Tony coming very soon, and that will be uploaded to our sister channel, computerphile.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.880
So go over there and keep an eye out for that one.

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:13.060
Well, films that I've worked closely on,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.999
it's hard to watch and not see all the flaws.
