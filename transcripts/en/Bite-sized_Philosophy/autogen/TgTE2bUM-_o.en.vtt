maybe it's a little less than that but
it's<00:00:13.889><c> high-quality</c><00:00:14.040><c> animation</c><00:00:14.940><c> and</c><00:00:15.389><c> so</c>

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 align:start position:0%
it's high-quality animation and so
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's high-quality animation and so
someone<00:00:15.809><c> had</c><00:00:15.929><c> to</c><00:00:16.080><c> paint</c><00:00:16.500><c> 30</c><00:00:17.279><c> pictures</c><00:00:17.640><c> to</c><00:00:18.060><c> get</c>
