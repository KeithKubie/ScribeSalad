00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.926
- [Instructor] Consider
the density curve below.

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:04.638
It's depicted right over here.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:05.863
It's a little unusual looking.

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:07.047
It's more like a triangle

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:08.679
than our standard density curves,

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.992
but it's valid.

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:12.112
Which of the following
statements are true?

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.978
Choose all answers that apply.

00:00:14.978 --> 00:00:16.938
The mean of the density curve

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:18.938
is less than the median.

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:20.757
Pause this video

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:21.590
and see if you can figure out

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.803
whether that's true.

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.270
Well, we don't know exactly

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.657
where the mean and median are

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:28.455
just by looking at this.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:29.314
But remember,

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:30.373
the median is going to be

00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:31.763
the value for which the area

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:32.946
to the right and the left

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:34.577
are going to be equal.

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:35.884
So, I would guess

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.714
the median is going to be

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:39.381
someplace like that.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.361
So that's my guess.

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.158
My approximation.

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.741
That is the median.

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:48.602
And because our distribution

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.967
goes off further to the left

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.596
than it does to the right,

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:53.429
you can view this

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.924
as something of a tail.

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:56.228
It's reasonable to say

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.311
that this is left skewed.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.570
Left skewed.

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.328
And generally speaking,

00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:08.263
if a distribution is left skewed

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:10.300
the mean is to the left

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.259
of the median.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.592
So, because it is left skewed

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.387
the mean might be someplace

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:18.225
like right over there.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.058
Another way,

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:20.343
to even think about the mean

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:21.653
is that the mean would be

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:23.493
the balance point,

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:24.759
where you'd place a fulcrum

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.342
if this were a mass

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.082
and you might say,

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.706
why doesn't that happen at the median?

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:30.539
Well remember,

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.121
even when you're balancing something

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.349
a smaller weight

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.432
that is far away from the fulcrum

00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:37.792
can balance out a heavier weight

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.412
that is closer in to the fulcrum.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:41.734
So, in terms of this first one

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.042
the mean of the density curve

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:44.614
is less than the median.

00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:45.447
In this case,

00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:46.280
or you could say,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.300
to the left of the median.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.568
We can consider this to be true.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:51.401
Now what about,

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.723
the median of the density curve is three?

00:01:54.723 --> 00:01:55.743
Well, I already approximated

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:57.131
where the median might be,

00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:57.964
saying hey

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.043
this area looks roughly comparable

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:00.269
to this area.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:02.027
The median definitely,

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:03.046
I might not be right there,

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:04.187
but the median is definitely

00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:05.985
not going to be three.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.214
This area right over here

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:08.560
is for sure

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.848
smaller than this area

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:11.792
right over here.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:14.562
So we can rule that out.

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:18.037
The area underneath the
density curve is one.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:18.870
Pause this video.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.777
Is that true?

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:21.610
Yes.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.443
This is true.

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:25.106
The area underneath any density curve

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:26.171
is going to be one.

00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:27.234
If we look at the total area

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:28.176
under the curve,

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:30.509
it's always going to be one.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.683
So we answered this question.

00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:34.442
I'll leave you with one extra question

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:35.911
that we can actually figure out

00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:38.284
from the information they've given us.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:39.224
What is the height

00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:40.774
of this point?

00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:42.455
Of this density curve right over here?

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:44.871
What is this value?

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:46.304
What is this height going to be?

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:48.030
See if you can pause this video

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.014
and figure it out

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:50.563
and I'll give you a hint.

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:51.396
The hint is

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:52.648
this third statement.

00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:56.725
The area under the density curve is one.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:57.558
Alright,

00:02:57.558 --> 00:02:59.130
now let's try to work through it together.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.213
If we call this height h,

00:03:02.977 --> 00:03:05.111
we know how to find
the area of a triangle.

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.132
It's 1/2 base times height.

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:10.792
Area is equal to 1/2 base times height.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.781
We know that the area is one.

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:14.217
This is a density curve

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:15.456
so one is going to be equal

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:16.847
to what's the length of the base?

00:03:16.847 --> 00:03:19.301
We go from one to six.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.134
So from one to six

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.181
this base,

00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:22.780
the length of this base

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.304
is five.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.418
1/2 times five times height.

00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:30.716
Or we could say one is equal to 5/2

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:31.939
times height

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.442
or multiply both sides by 2/5

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:38.192
to solve for the height

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:40.025
and what are gonna get?

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:40.858
We're gonna get the height

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.173
is equal to 2/5.

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:44.006
So if you have

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.073
a very clean triangular
density curve like this

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:48.892
you can actually figure out the height

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.475
with even if it was
not directly specified.
