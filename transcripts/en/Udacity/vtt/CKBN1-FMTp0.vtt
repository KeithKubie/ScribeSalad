00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.160
So when you've identified
a problem point in your app,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.440
how do you go about figuring out
what the best solution is for that?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.950
&gt;&gt; So the first thing to realize is that

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.090
to some extent honestly
there is no best solution.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.450
There are lots of best solutions.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.390
&gt;&gt; Mm.
&gt;&gt; and your job is just to find

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.435
one the fastest you possibly can.

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:17.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.680
&gt;&gt; So
the best way to do that is actually

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.550
through quantity rather than quality.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.450
Don't necessarily focus on
finding the best solution,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.030
just come up with the first thing
that you think might be better.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.885
And then come up with the next ten
things that you think might be better.

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:32.500
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.170
&gt;&gt; And
then make prototypes of all of those.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.675
Again, we're going for fast and cheap.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:37.600
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.620
&gt;&gt; So
that this is a really quick process.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.755
Make ten prototypes, test them all.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.550
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And see which is better.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Then do that three more times, or

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720
four more times
&gt;&gt; Or five more times and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.040
eventually you'll start to settle in and
really understand what people care about

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.670
and what's the best-
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
&gt;&gt; What really is valuable to them.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.600
&gt;&gt; Right
