NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.103
where we will highlight
one of three common missed

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:14.960
opportunities for apps to
deliver delight to their users.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
It's the second episode in the
Three Steps to Awesome series.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.630
I'm your host, Nazmul
Idris, a developer

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.610
advocate passionate
about designing mobile.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.290
And I have with me
a very special guest

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.390
on the show today.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.340
PATRICK LARVIE:
Hey, thanks, Nazmul.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.330
I'm Patrick Larvie.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.939
I'm a researcher here at Google.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.480
I've been focusing
on user experience

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.080
and mobile for a long time.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.470
NAZMUL IDRIS: Awesome.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.000
So apps that are widely
divergent from platform

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.920
guidelines are usually
not a good idea.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.900
You should try and make
people feel at home

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.600
in your application by
following platform guidelines

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.940
wherever you can,
and be consistent

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.145
so that the user's
expectations from that platform

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.460
are met from inside
of that application.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.200
So, for example, an
Android user expects

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.430
that your Android version
of your application

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.000
feels at home on Android.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.830
And similarly, an iOS
user has an expectation

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.970
that the iOS version
of your application

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.360
should feel at home on iOS.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.400
Keep in mind, it's their phone.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.256
Users identify very deeply
with a particular phone,

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.880
and they think about
it as their phone.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.230
They don't say that this
is my Android or iOS.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.850
They think of it as my phone.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.560
And so your application has to
make sure that it fits inside

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.390
of whatever idea they have
of their particular phone,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.380
and not get hung up on these
technical details around which

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.367
platform the application
is running on.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:25.950
Because, again, the
user doesn't care.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.430
PATRICK LARVIE:
That's right, Nazmul.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.846
NAZMUL IDRIS: So
there are reasons

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:31.010
for deviating from
these guidelines,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.750
but you must have a good
reason to deviate from them.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.010
Deviating without a
particularly good reason

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.259
is generally not a good idea.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.800
PATRICK LARVIE:
That's exactly right.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.300
When people talk
about their phones,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.570
they don't talk about my
Apple 5 point whatever.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.270
They say this is my iPhone.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.830
And I think the idea of
making people feel at home

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.190
begins with the
kind of nomenclature

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.430
we use when we develop apps.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.960
So, for example, what's
the opposite of short?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.870
NAZMUL IDRIS: Tall.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.040
PATRICK LARVIE:
Not at Starbucks.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.820
NAZMUL IDRIS: What?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.945
PATRICK LARVIE: At Starbucks,
the opposite of short

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:05.570
is trenta.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.030
Another example for
Android is making

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.060
sure the buttons do what
people expect them to do.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.059
A Back button should take you--

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.850
NAZMUL IDRIS: Back.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.792
PATRICK LARVIE: Not necessarily.

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:17.250
I've seen Back
buttons do all kinds

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.390
of funny unexpected things.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.440
It can make you add the
app, it can take you back

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.140
to the home screen, it
can do all kinds of things

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.060
that people don't
necessarily expect.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.100
So it's important to remember
that design guidelines are not

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.900
there just because
people like guidelines,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.490
they're there
because we want users

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.530
to feel at home on
their phones no matter

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.770
what app they're using.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.500
You can deviate with
purpose, and there's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.916
some really good
examples of this.

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:43.030
For instance, in the latest
version of the YouTube app,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.850
you'll notice that
the YouTube app has

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.170
gone to a card-based
design, so you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.850
can scroll through
all kinds of content.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.320
And when you find something
you like, you click on it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.200
and the content can
actually pop out

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.170
and you can watch the video
in a much smaller square

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.980
that you can move
around your screen.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.135
Why did they do this?

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.020
This is actually quite unusual.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.164
It's a very
purposeful deviation.

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:05.330
The reason they did this
is so that you can continue

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.125
to watch that video as you
scroll through the content

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.700
and find something
else to watch.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:13.160
There are lots of instances
where people say things

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.740
like I really want my app
to reflect the quirkiness

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.280
or the specificity of my brand.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.000
This is generally a bad idea.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.460
The way to express your brand
is by having an awesome design

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.960
that fits the guidelines
of the platform

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.980
and makes your user feel
completely in charge.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.390
As an example, I hope
that everyone watching

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.740
goes and checks
out the Airbnb app.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.180
It's amazing.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.530
It will replace the
desktop entirely for you,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.630
and you will be
awed and inspired

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.380
by how they've taken-- they've
designed within the guidelines

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.160
to come up with an app that's
very, very unique to Airbnb

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.790
and is, in my opinion,
one of the best

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.234
apps I've seen in a long time.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:58.150
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.925
I think the key here is
respecting a user's choice,

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:02.800
whether it's the choice
of the device they've

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.680
made or the platform,
even the social network

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.442
that they're using, for
example, for social sign in.

00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:09.900
I think the most
important thing is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.274
that, as a developer,
when you're

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:12.980
building an application
that's going

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.360
to live in a
particular platform,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.026
make sure that your
application does not

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:17.610
feel like a second
class citizen.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.029
Because the user
be able to know.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.230
The user is savvy.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.241
They have really, really
high expectations,

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:24.740
and so it's really,
really important

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.790
to make sure that you
respect their choice,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.110
and also make sure that
your applications are giving

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.410
a first class experience for
their particular platform

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.520
on their particular device.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.070
PATRICK LARVIE: For
example, Nazmul,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.060
if I invite you over
to my house and I say,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.182
hey, I've got this
great bottle of wine,

00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:41.640
would you like to
share it with me?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.070
And you say to me, hey, that's
awesome, where's a straw?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.120
Give me a straw.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.160
That's terrible.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.410
Why is that terrible?

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.896
Because the entire point of
inviting him over to share

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:52.270
this bottle of
wine is that we're

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.800
going to drink it together.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.790
This is the point of
playing well with others.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.120
Think of a mobile phone
exactly the same way.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.030
Your app is playing
on that phone

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.210
with lots of others
at the same time.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.020
You need to remember that.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.330
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.380
And the key is that, just
like the bottle of wine,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.450
they are resources
on your phone that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.420
are very limited,
like CPU, network,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.160
and memory, and each application
instead of essentially sticking

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.540
in a straw and consuming all
of CPU network and memory,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.840
it should really be in a
more sharing state of mind.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.847
And so a good way to do this
is to keep efficiency in mind.

00:05:25.847 --> 00:05:28.180
So one of the biggest things
you could do as a developer

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.450
is make sure that
your applications are

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.630
aware of battery consumption,
network consumption,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.240
and display constraints.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.970
We talked about the Caturday
app in part one of this series,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.870
and it was a Caturday app that
allows you to get documentaries

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.200
on cats on your mobile device.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.810
So one of things you can do is
that if the application detects

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.230
that you're going low on
battery, maybe instead

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.260
of allowing you to play
a particular video,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.130
it would allow you to queue it.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.230
Similarly, if you're
not low on battery,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.820
but it senses that you're on
a device that has a very, very

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.010
small screen or a really
low resolution display,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.400
instead of giving you
the HD quality video that

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.810
would consume a lot more
battery and network,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.460
instead it should give you
a lower resolution video

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.410
that you can't even
tell the difference when

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.500
you're using this application.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.780
So similarly, another
thing to keep in mind,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.980
and this is really
to data transfers,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.002
is to try and use the big cookie
model for transferring data.

00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:23.460
Big cookie model
just means instead

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.090
of doing really
small data transfers

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.070
intermittently, you bash them
together and do one big one.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.870
And there's a reason for this.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.500
The cellular radio
on your phone,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.430
it actually drains
battery at a rapid rate

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.430
when you power the radio
from idle to high power mode.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.360
And so if you can limit
how often you do this,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.710
that will actually end
up giving your users

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.040
savings on their battery.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.331
And in line with that, you
should also think before you

00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.640
sync, which is kind of
tied to the same concept

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.850
where instead of kicking
off your own syncing

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.750
operations using your own
timer, you should try and bash

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.122
this with system syncs.

00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:02.580
What will happen is that the
system will wake up the radio,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.870
take the hit for going from
idle to high power mode,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.890
and then while it's powered
up, all the applications

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.120
that need data synced, it can
do all of that at the same time.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.420
Again, giving you more
savings on battery.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.120
And finally, when you're
testing and building

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.260
these applications make sure
to use an old device that

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.264
is resource constrained.

00:07:23.264 --> 00:07:25.680
Because if you're testing on
the latest and greatest Nexus

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.395
with multiple cores and
many, many gigabytes of RAM,

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.770
you might get away with things
that you won't on an older

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.000
device, and that's a really
good practice to get into.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.710
PATRICK LARVIE:
This also applies

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.970
to your choice of technologies.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.310
So as your user is going
along and using our app,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.870
and let's say, we'll go
back to the cat video app,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.070
it's time to watch a
cat video, and suddenly

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.980
you find that the technology
requirements for watching

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.770
that cat video are inconsistent
with your platform.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.940
So how many times, and I'm
thinking very specifically

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.960
about Flash, think about
those iOS users out there.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.320
That know this is a
planned incompatibility,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.350
and Nazmul's point is that
you should plan for delight.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.630
That's absolutely true.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.160
You should also bear in mind
that not everyone shares

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.322
the same technology stack.

00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:18.030
There are other ways
of thinking of that.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.180
So if you can use
HTML5, for example,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.907
that might be a better choice.

00:08:21.907 --> 00:08:22.990
NAZMUL IDRIS: No, exactly.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.406
In this particular
case, let's say

00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:28.080
you do have a valid reason to
use Flash for a device where

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.710
it's not going to run, you
should consider failing very

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.253
gracefully instead of
just giving a 404 message,

00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:34.669
or plug-in not
found, or something

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.640
that a user can't
really understand.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.179
So one of the things
to keep in mind

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.460
is when you're choosing a
technology stack, consider

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.480
using your familiarity
as a developer.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.770
With that stack,
keep the user in mind

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.212
when deciding
which stack to use.

00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:48.170
Because, again, you're
building the application

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:54.010
to live on your user's
device, which is their device.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.600
So another related to this
selection of technology

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.110
stack is determining which
version of a platform

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.030
to use, like what APIs to use.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.600
So, for example,
on end rate, you

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.410
might think that based on
market share statistics

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.890
and so on, that if you want
to deliver an application that

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.790
reaches the largest
number of users, then

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.290
you're going to target
a lower version API.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.060
So that's not
entirely the truth,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.230
because market stats
don't show you everything.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.070
While that might be true,
if you provide a lowest

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.100
common denominator
experience, then arguably,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.660
the users of your application
won't be that delighted.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.030
So what we're saying is
that you can deliver delight

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.950
while taking these
constraints into account.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.530
So for example, if you take
KitKat features into account,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.360
that is, build that
into your application,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.026
so that KitKat users
of your application

00:09:43.026 --> 00:09:45.600
can experience all
the KitKatness,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.440
but at the same time,
Gingerbread users

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.150
can also experience sort
of the baseline capability

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.520
of your application.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.960
That way you're
delighting folks that

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.890
have higher versions of
Android on their phone,

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.105
for example, while not really
taking anything away from,

00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:04.980
let's say, the folks
that are on Gingerbread.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.540
PATRICK LARVIE: The signature
of a really, really awesome app

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.880
isn't the fact that
problems never occur,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.670
it's the fact that
the app handles

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.740
those problems very,
very elegantly.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.369
So before you release
that app, imagine that,

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.660
no matter how awesome it is,
and I'm sure it's awesome,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.559
you are going to have
all kinds of problems.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:25.100
You're going to have
error messaging.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.680
You're going to have
networks that go out.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.560
You're going to have
batteries that run out.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.010
You're going to have people like
me with big fat fingers that

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.240
aren't very accurate
on touch screens.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.980
You're going to
have bad lighting.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.010
You know those awesome
graphics that you have,

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.750
people may not see them in
all lighting conditions.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.780
Plan for these things.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.870
Again, the signature
of an awesome app

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.310
isn't that problems don't occur,
is that a fantastic app will

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.414
handle these problems
very elegantly.

00:10:50.414 --> 00:10:51.330
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.770
I think on mobile, one of
the most important things

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.730
to keep in mind is that
network coverage is spotty

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.130
and bandwidth varies
quite greatly,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.240
and so one of the
key things to nail

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.610
in a good mobile experience
is to get offline mode right.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.080
Because if you don't take that
into account, a lot of times

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.300
you might have a UX
fail, where somebody

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.947
goes to use your
application and you

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:16.280
know it was working great
with perfect network coverage,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.147
but they're in a
particular part of town

00:11:18.147 --> 00:11:20.480
where your carrier doesn't
have that great of a coverage

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.535
and there's no Wi-Fi.

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:22.160
And guess what?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.580
Your application
just stops working.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.210
And that just leaves a
bad taste in their mouth.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.370
So Gmail is a really good
example of offline mode,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.670
where Gmail just hides the fact
that you have or don't have

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.920
network conductivity and
allows you to compose emails,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.200
it allows you to
manage your inbox

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.370
and so on, and then as soon
as you get connectivity,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.280
it just goes ahead and syncs
everything with your Gmail.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.680
So one nice thing is when
you're creating meaningful error

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.840
messages, I think it's
really important to also

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.510
give the user a
path to resolution,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.390
so that they can
recover from this error

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.160
rather than just notify
them that something bad has

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.830
happened.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.250
So I hope you
enjoyed our episode.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.220
Stay tuned for the final episode
in this three part series,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.260
which is coming soon.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.850
Just remember, by following
these three steps,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.570
you too can avoid
common pitfalls

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.500
and make applications awesome.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.210
