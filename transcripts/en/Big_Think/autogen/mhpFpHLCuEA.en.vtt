away with it and we learned a lot from

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390
away with it and we learned a lot from
 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.300
away with it and we learned a lot from
it but even when I flew on my first

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
it but even when I flew on my first
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.250
it but even when I flew on my first
shuttle flight on the 74th shuttle

improved it but the odds of dying that

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340
improved it but the odds of dying that
 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.380
improved it but the odds of dying that

but it's hard to get life insurance as

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830
but it's hard to get life insurance as
 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.880
but it's hard to get life insurance as
an astronaut actually but but the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
an astronaut actually but but the
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.680
an astronaut actually but but the
question you really need to ask that is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690
question you really need to ask that is
 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.490
question you really need to ask that is
do I want to learn to walk do I want to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500
do I want to learn to walk do I want to
 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.740
do I want to learn to walk do I want to
ride this bike do I want to get married

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750
ride this bike do I want to get married
 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.660
ride this bike do I want to get married
do I want to learn to drive a car what

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670
do I want to learn to drive a car what
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.080

risks are worth taking in my life

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090
risks are worth taking in my life
 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.730
risks are worth taking in my life
because even if you decide okay I'm

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
because even if you decide okay I'm
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140
because even if you decide okay I'm
gonna take no risk I'm gonna stay at

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150
gonna take no risk I'm gonna stay at
 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.399
gonna take no risk I'm gonna stay at
home and hide under my pillow

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409
home and hide under my pillow
 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.810
home and hide under my pillow
there's still risk with that and you're

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820
there's still risk with that and you're
 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.050
there's still risk with that and you're
still gonna die eventually anyway so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
still gonna die eventually anyway so
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
still gonna die eventually anyway so
it's kind of a measure of what was worth

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
it's kind of a measure of what was worth
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.880
it's kind of a measure of what was worth
doing in your life and therefore what

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
doing in your life and therefore what
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.340
doing in your life and therefore what
was worth taking a risk for once you've

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350
was worth taking a risk for once you've
 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.680
was worth taking a risk for once you've
got that behind you and said okay I'm

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
got that behind you and said okay I'm
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.719
got that behind you and said okay I'm
gonna be an astronaut I'm gonna fly a

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
gonna be an astronaut I'm gonna fly a
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.589
gonna be an astronaut I'm gonna fly a

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599
rocket ship
 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.949
rocket ship
that's a risk I'm going to take now it

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
that's a risk I'm going to take now it
 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.710
that's a risk I'm going to take now it

incompetent nervous passenger your job
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.260
incompetent nervous passenger your job
now is to defeat the risk like when you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
now is to defeat the risk like when you
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.510
now is to defeat the risk like when you
learn to ride a bike if you just stay as

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
learn to ride a bike if you just stay as
 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.890
learn to ride a bike if you just stay as
a passenger on the bike you're never

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
a passenger on the bike you're never
 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.850
a passenger on the bike you're never
gonna know what to do with the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
gonna know what to do with the
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.740
gonna know what to do with the
handlebars and you're never gonna master

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750
handlebars and you're never gonna master
 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.780
handlebars and you're never gonna master
riding a bike and once you can ride a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
riding a bike and once you can ride a
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.820
riding a bike and once you can ride a
bike you know you've got a freedom you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830
bike you know you've got a freedom you
 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.800
bike you know you've got a freedom you
never had before and rocket ships are

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
never had before and rocket ships are
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.950
never had before and rocket ships are
just the same you have to decide what

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960
just the same you have to decide what
 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.780
just the same you have to decide what
risks are worth taking and then start

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
risks are worth taking and then start
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.400
risks are worth taking and then start
changing who you are learning how to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410
changing who you are learning how to
 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.350
changing who you are learning how to
turn the handlebars so that you could

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360
turn the handlebars so that you could
 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.330
turn the handlebars so that you could
make this thing do something that

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340
make this thing do something that
 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.940
make this thing do something that
otherwise might hurt you or kill you and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
otherwise might hurt you or kill you and
 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.760
otherwise might hurt you or kill you and
then once you've got that done it can

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770
then once you've got that done it can
 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.470
then once you've got that done it can
take you to places and give you richness

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
take you to places and give you richness
 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.660
take you to places and give you richness
in your life that you never would have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
in your life that you never would have
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.630
in your life that you never would have
had access any other way and in my case

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
had access any other way and in my case

had access any other way and in my case
when you make it through that launch

Humanity so I think it's worth asking

Humanity so I think it's worth asking
 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.990
Humanity so I think it's worth asking
yourself what risks are worth taking and

yourself what risks are worth taking and
 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.120
yourself what risks are worth taking and
once you've decided to take them then

once you've decided to take them then
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.400

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410
change who you are so that you can win
 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.710
change who you are so that you can win
you can defeat you can master that thing

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
you can defeat you can master that thing
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.270
you can defeat you can master that thing
and open a door for yourself that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280
and open a door for yourself that
 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.770
and open a door for yourself that
otherwise was just shut

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
otherwise was just shut
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.030
otherwise was just shut
