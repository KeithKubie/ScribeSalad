WESLEY CORNWELL: This is
actually the second production

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.040
that I've done costumes for.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.640
Mostly, I do set and
lighting design on campus.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.630
One of the things that I love
about theater design or theater

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.830
at Princeton really in
general is that it perfectly

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.240
combines the academic
and intellectual rigor

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.610
of understanding a
play, or a musical

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.770
or a dramatic text, and
then the creativity side,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.110
and the production side,
and realizing that text,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.790
bringing it into
three dimensions

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.090
and performing it
for an audience.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.840
Because I feel strongly
that that's what

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.210
these texts or musicals
are meant to do.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.910
They're meant to be performed.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.380
For me, the advanced
design class

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.100
is the perfect forum in which
different areas of design

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.360
come together in the
same room to talk

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.990
with each other
and the director,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.470
from the beginning
saying, these are

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.370
all people in a room
who are coming together

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.990
to tell one story.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.980
And how can we use clothing
to support the set?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.500
And how can the lights support
the clothing, and the set help

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170
the lights, and the direction?

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.390
And all of these different
pieces coming together

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.770
to tell different
bits of the same story

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.810
for a cohesive production
at the end of the day.
