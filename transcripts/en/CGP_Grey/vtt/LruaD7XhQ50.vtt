00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
The United States of America --

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.500
you too Hawaii, and Alaska,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.880
to scale, for once.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.540
Ever since these states united to create America,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.200
the federal government of America, …

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.540
… they and she fought mightily over the land --

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.440
-- which plains or forests or mountains or swamps to end up in each hand.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.640
On the map, it looks like states hold all the cards, but they don't.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.380
Just under one third of land in the United States is federal.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.980
But, that’s an average.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.140
Looking at the percent of Federal Land in the states…

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.960
the 𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 we go, the 𝑓𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑟 the land, and the less of the state that’s in each state.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.860
There's eastern states with under one percent Federal Land, …

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.940
… and five western states that control less than half of the land 'in their borders.'

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.240
How?  What?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.940
First thing first: how did this happen?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.400
America wasn't always the mighty united.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.320
Like us all, she started small, when states were young,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760
new, and few, giving away but little for her to play.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.180
But then America grew:

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.440
Louisiana purchasing, Mexican cessioning,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.520
and manifest destinying her way across the continent.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340
But in this age of empires,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.860
it won't do any good to say she owns the land…

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.400
… unless she gets her citizens out there to occupy the vast,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.200
‘totally unoccupied’ continent.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700
So America turns from hoarder to minimalist,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.140
disposing of as much of the land to new states

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.800
and new settlers as she can.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.360
Sometimes giving it away in literal races, …

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040
… where plots of land were drawn,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680
homesteaders waited at a starting line, and BANG!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.240
First family to a plot owns that plot.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.120
Says who?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.380
Says America!

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.560
She's booting up a private property ladder

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.040
from virgin lands,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.880
using contracts, and guns.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.740
10% of all the land in the US was given away for free

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.600
just to get people out West.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.220
See also: railroad companies,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
which got the land either side of any track they could build

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.840
for the length of a continent.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.060
If you could live on or improve the land in the 1800s,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.840
America would probably give it to you.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.100
But by the 1900s,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.820
most of the states are mostly in place,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.120
and the Age of Empires and Wagons Westward is over.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.260
But America still had a ton of land

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.400
she didn't or couldn't give away.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.720
And now that the states are settled, well...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.820
What she has is all she will ever have...

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.640
She turns away from her gifting minimalism,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.960
and becomes a curator of her collection of land.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.000
This change was rather a shock to states

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.100
expecting the land in their borders

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.960
would be land in their borders, …

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.620
… that Federal Land would continue to be turned over

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.120
as it had for a century.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.040
But, no.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.320
Thus, this map and a lot of angry western states,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.180
now up against a fully operational federal government,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.280
altering the deal.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.760
Some states, like poor Utah and Nevada,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.960
found themselves with hardly any state

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.440
in their state or...

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520
... Arizona: “Hey, hey!  What about the reservations?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.400
Are you going to talk about them? ...

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.380
… Are they Federal Land?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.480
Some of us have a lot of reservations in our state.”

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.220
CGP Grey: “Ahhh, the reservations.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.080
Yes, what a great story for another time…

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740
… Look, we can't do the reservations right now, we just can't!”

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.140
Okay, history aside, America has all this land now,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.560
but like, what is it for?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.160
What is it for? A lot.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220
Almost all of the following will have an

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.200
'in general' before it…

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.480
… because there are almost 2,000 separate bureaucracies

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.800
administering land that, …

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.180
… were it a single country,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.480
would be in the top ten list of biggest countries.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.560
But in general, most of the Federal Land falls under the control of the President, …

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.720
… to whom a dozen secretaries report,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.680
of which we care about three, that run five departments.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.260
First, the Department of Defense:

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.860
she runs military bases,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.320
and nuclear silos, and all the toys of war.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.860
America has to keep them somewhere,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.880
and if sororicide taught her anything,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.120
it's don't trust the states with weapons.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.800
So keep them close on Federal Land she does.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.640
While America's military is big,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.000
the Department of Defense holds the least land of the top five.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.920
Next is: The National Park Service:

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.820
The Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.000
and Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.120
If there's an epic vista
you've visited or heard of in America,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.480
it's probably one of hers.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.680
The National Parks
is the celebrity of the group,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.600
and can really stand out.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.000
Next biggest is the Fish and Wildlife Service.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.160
Much less known, except if you're in Alaska where 85% of her land is.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.400
Fish and Wildlife is in the business of animal conservation,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.520
keeping land for America's species under her aegis,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.000
not to be developed.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.620
Then, there's the Forest Service --

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.560
often confused with National Parks,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.280
but not remotely the same.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.220
There's many a breathtaking national forest
you can hike through,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.480
but they're not parks.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.840
They're more America's resource tiles,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.140
leased for logging.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.000
Plus, grassland tiles for grazing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.320
Forest Service's job is to balance extraction
with maintenance.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.260
How well she does this
is an endless source of argument

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.960
between America and the states

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.840
and the companies that want
to use those resource tiles.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.420
It's a job that guarantees

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.560
someone is always going to be angry.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.240
Only you can prevent forest fires?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.800
That's the Forest Service,
because she deals with these kind of fires,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.960
as well as these kind of fires.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.720
And it's a job she splits
with the last and the biggest:

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.040
The Bureau of Land Management.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.020
She does it all,
from resolving cow disputes,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.400
to leasing land for mining,
to building parks, …

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.780
… to preserving the coastal waters of California

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.280
(which, surprise California, are Federal Land!).

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.140
BLM does a lot

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.800
and is the biggest which can make it very confusing

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.560
about which agency does what, but think of it this way:

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720
There are three goals:

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.680
Conservation, Recreation, Extraction.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.720
BLM does all three.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.360
FS does Conservation and Extraction.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.800
F&amp;W does Conservation.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.440
And NPS does Conservation and Recreation.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.520
Again, in general.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.280
These four plus War control 97% of Federal Land.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.300
The last three percent is miscellaneous:

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.660
used by departments like the Postal Service,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.160
or NASA, or the Department of Energy or others.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.220
OK, this is lovely,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.280
but like what does it mean to say that land is federal?

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.280
Is it part of the state or not?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.600
Well, this brings up the delicate and sensitive balance

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.680
of power between the states and America.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.360
And there's an enormous amount of words words words

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.480
around the sovereignty of governments.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.960
But, ultimately, Federal Land belongs to America

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.940
and she can do with it what she wants,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.840
and the states have to just suck it.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.560
Most starkly in Nevada, where Federal Land was used for nuclear bomb testing.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.880
Yeah, that's a pretty big hole you punched in Nevada, America.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.940
Oh, not just the once...

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.000
Oh... Oh... Oh...

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.320
When push comes to shove,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.600
America can shove.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.680
That's the most extreme example,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.460
but Federal Lands will often have their own separate

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.080
federal law enforcement officers.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.960
Like the Investigative Services Branch:

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.400
a kind of FBI for National Parks.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.700
Though state borders do matter here, for lesser crimes,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.880
federal officers will often dump suspects into the state courts to deal with.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.440
Private citizens can't buy property on Federal Land.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.120
There are Americans who will tell you they live in a National Park.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Cape Cod and Fire Island National Parks are examples of this.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.960
But if you zoom into official maps,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.600
you'll often find hilarious borders that swoop around

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.840
and in between developed and undeveloped areas.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.960
There’s also military bases, which will have soldiers living in them,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.680
but they can't own anything.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.360
And because it's Federal Land,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.620
the Department of Defense that builds the housing can ignore all of a state’s laws

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.160
about housing or health codes.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.600
So, a state can't control in a meaningful way Federal Land in her borders.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.960
Hundreds of acres of federal grassland might suddenly be filled with grazing cattle, …

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.200
… or POW! be declared a national monument and preserved forever, …

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.520
… or plumbed for oil and mined for minerals,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.760
with the state just standing on the sidelines watching.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.260
Thus, states can't build their own towns or parks or factories in Federal Land to,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.360
you know, collect any taxes from the land.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.560
Which, once America made her intention to keep Federal Land forever, …

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.180
… made the states with a lot of it start to grumble,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.640
grumble, grumble, GRUMBLE.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.435
America: “Fine.

00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:47.560
I'll give you payment in lieu of taxes. Are you happy now?”

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.220
States: “Is this a joke?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.380
Is this for real?”

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.720
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.720
All of this means today there's a big political divide

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.100
between the states that have a lot of Federal Land

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.800
and the states that don't.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.480
With Eastern States thinking of Federal Land as belonging to the nation as a whole, …

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.520
… which is easy to do when

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.240
you don't have a lot of it within your borders and Federal Land, to you,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.920
means visiting Glacier National Park on vacation.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.600
Meanwhile, Western states are getting nuclear bombs detonated in their back yards, …

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.140

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.280
