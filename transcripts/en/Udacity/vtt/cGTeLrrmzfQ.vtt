00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.330
Let's go back to the main project view.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.110
Once you've created the necessary
services and activities,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.070
you need to register them in the Android
Manifest XML so that Android-ware on

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.810
the phone and wearable side knows that
you have watch faces to select from.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.900
Let's have a look at the wearable
Android XML file first.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.532
Firstly, you need to request
PROVIDE_BACKGROUND and

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.110
WAKE_LOCK permissions.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.550
You need to do this on the phone side
as well since the phone app must always

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.050
request every permission
needed by the wearable.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.800
Let's now look at the service
definitions in the manifest.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.009
You can see that each watch face
has a unique service entry.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.980
Let's look at the definition
of DIgitalWatchFaceService.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.880
You'll notice we've
declared our service,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.440
given it a human readable name And
specify BIND_WALLPAPER for permissions.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.410
The first item we have inside here
is android.service.wallpaper.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.315
This needs to refer to
a watch_face.xml file.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.570
And when we look at the declaration,
it looks like this.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.560
You can see here, there's
a wallpaper element declared here.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.980
Next we have the preview and
preview circular attributes.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620
These are used to define images
that will be shown as previews on

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.300
the companion or
watch when selecting a watch face.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.930
You can see that if we right-click and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.840
go to the declaration,
this is what it looks like.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.240
You can specify a separate image for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.230
round displays if you
have a different layout.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.190
And if you don't provide one,
it'll fall back to the square one.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.930
You can create these images by just
taking a screenshot of your watch face

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.790
running on a device or emulator.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.560
We also have
a companionConfigurationAction,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.240
which specifies if we'll be providing
an activity on the phone companion side

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.060
to configure the watch face.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.550
This enables the little gear
icon on the phone side.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.940
That we tried earlier.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.870
We create a unique name here
with our own package name and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.420
tag it CONFIG_DIGITAL.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.460
We also have
a wearableConfigurationAction

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.520
which specifies we'll be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.590
providing an activity to run on the
wearable to configure the watch face.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.900
This enables the little gear icon on
the wearable side to make changes.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.220
We use the same unique name as the phone
companion configuration action earlier.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.280
We also declare an intent filter for

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.240
a wallpaper service with
a category of watch face.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.230
Like here to complete
the definition of our service.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.200
Finally, we need to declare our
DigitalWatchFaceWearableConfigActivity

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
which is the activity we'll run if the
user wants to configure this watch face.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.288
We need to add an intent filter that
includes the default and wearable

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.640
configuration categories for the watch
face picket to see this activity.
