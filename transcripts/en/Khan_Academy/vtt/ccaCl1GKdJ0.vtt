00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.070
Let's say that I run some
type of a pension fund,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.340
and I have $1 billion that
I need to invest someplace.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.530
And I dig around a
little bit, and there's

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.280
this Company A over
here, and it needs

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.640
to borrow a billion
dollars, and it's

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.280
willing to give 10%
interest in exchange

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.240
for borrowing that
billion dollars.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.770
So if I give these
characters over here

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.330
my billion dollars, if I lend
it to them, if I lend them

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.680
the billion dollars,
on an annual basis,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.770
they're going to
give me 10% interest.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.510
There's a problem here though.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.190
The rating agencies, the
ones that in theory should

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.666
be independent, they've only
given Company A a BB rating.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.790
And this is a pension fund.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.870
I have to only invest in the
safest of safest of securities.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.780
I have to invest only
in things that are AA.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.930
And so here might enter
a character like AIG,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.450
and obviously things have
changed since their heyday.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.470
But AIG, based on at
least Moody's perspective,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.440
has a AA rating.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.810
So AIG could say, hey, look
pension fund, why don't you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.430
lend them the money,
and what we're

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.120
going to do is enter into
a credit default swap.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.030
And what that essentially
is, is a form of insurance.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.810
Of that 10% every year, why
don't you give us 1% of that?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.760
And in financial
lingo, that's sometimes

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.370
referred to as 100 basis points.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.740
And in exchange for that, in
exchange for that 100 basis

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.590
points a year, you could view
this as the insurance premium,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.110
we are going to ensure
that if for whatever reason

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.480
Company A defaults on that
debt, you can give us the debt,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.180
you can give us
that debt security,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.060
and we will just give you
back your billion dollars.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.680
Now from the pension's point of
view, this sounds pretty good.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.200
They're now getting a net 9%
of interest, 10% minus the 1%.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.230
And they're essentially getting
to lend to a BB company,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.229
but it's in effect
like lending to a AA,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.950
because as long as AIG
is good for the money,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.380
then the pension fund is
going to get their money back

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.400
one way or the other.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.130
Now where this gets
a little bit shady

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.460
is AIG right here didn't
have to do anything.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.830
What's interesting about
credit default swaps--

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.580
credit default swaps
sometimes referred to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.740
as CDSs-- is that even
though they are insurance,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.800
for all purposes
they are insurance,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.170
they are not regulated
like insurance.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.559
So typically an
insurance company

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.100
when they insure
something, they have

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.820
to set aside some money, in case
that thing actually happens.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.450
And they have to work out the
probabilities and all of that.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.190
Credit default swaps were
not regulated in that way.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.310
So AIG could do
this without having

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.290
to set aside any type of money.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.970
And they could do
this over and over

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.700
and over and over again,
kind of snowballing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640
all of their
potential liabilities.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.070
And so you could imagine,
it's really good money

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.210
while no one is
defaulting, but all

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.020
of a sudden when people
start defaulting, then

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.530
all of a sudden AIG is
going to be in trouble.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.670
And all the people who
thought they had, in effect,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.656
AA debt because AIG was
insuring it, might not.
