ANI MOHAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.490
ANI MOHAN: How's it going?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.040
Hope you've been having
a great I/O so far.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.401
Anyone go to the Kygo
concert last night?

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:12.900
Yeah?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.300
It was a lot of fun.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.569
So I'm Ani, I'm a product
manager on the Chrome team,

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:18.360
and I'm really excited
to talk to you today

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.900
about the Physical Web,
which is a lightweight way

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.710
to bring interactivity
to everyday objects

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.000
and environments.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.947
So this talk will
cover three things.

00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:30.530
One, I'll tell you a little bit
about what the Physical Web is

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.740
and how it works,
to, I'll give you

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.820
a flavor for how developers are
using the Physical Web today

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.395
and how you can get
started with it,

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.770
and finally, my
colleague Scott's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.311
going to come up on
stage to tell you

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.390
a little bit about
where we're headed.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.200
But first, I want to
start with a story.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
So I love museums,
especially art museums,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.780
but one of the most
frustrating things at a museum

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.490
is when I'm looking
at an exhibit,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.820
but I want to learn more
about what I'm looking at.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.041
And if there's not a
description posted right next

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.540
to the exhibit, this can be
kind of a frustrating experience

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.500
today.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.480
Maybe when I walk into
the lobby of a museum,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.209
there's posters
everywhere that tell

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.774
me to install an Android
app or an iOS app

00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:08.440
to learn more about
what I'm looking at,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.450
but this kind of
frustrating, because I

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.007
have to do work the very first
time I walk into a museum.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.340
And why should I have an app
sitting around on my device

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.080
when I'm probably not going
to come back to this museum?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.740
You know, maybe there
are QR codes peppered

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.240
throughout the exhibits
alongside the art,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.990
but that's again
kind of annoying,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810
because I need to fumble
around on my phone

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.450
to find the QR code
scanner app and walk up

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.370
really close to the art,
and, you know, it's no fun.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.640
I would love it if this
information were just there

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.850
at my fingertips.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.560
So museums are one
thing, but there's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.049
all sorts of other
contexts in which

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.090
you might want to interact
with your environment,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.780
whether it's other
objects or other places.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.430
Now, today, there
aren't too many

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.280
of these kinds of
contexts, and they

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.700
tend to be associated
with things

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.530
that we call smart devices.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.760
Maybe a smart TV or
a smart refrigerator.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.020
These big personal electronics
that we might have in the home.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.250
It's not a big deal
to download an app

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.510
when we purchase them and
do initial set up work.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.910
There's not a lot of
friction, because there's not

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.150
too many interactions
we need to take.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.050
But if we look at
Moore's Law in action

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.180
over the past few
decades, we know

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.800
that with declining
hardware costs,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.290
there's going to be a lot
more of these kinds of devices

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.210
on the horizon.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.210
And we're already starting
to see some of these,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.690
from things like smart locks
to smart washing machines.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.580
Now, fast forward a few years
and the number of these devices

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.260
is simply going to explode,
from things like smart parking

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.390
meters, to coffee
shop interactions,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.980
to kitchen appliances.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.750
There's going to be all sorts
of devices and locations

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.302
where I'll want to interact.

00:02:38.302 --> 00:02:40.760
And for this, we'll need a new
kind of interaction paradigm

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.340
that scales to a low
friction experience

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.802
where I don't have to do work
before I engage my interaction.

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:49.510
Now, let's go back to
our museum example.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.640
You know, what if instead of
me going and doing set up work

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.740
or having to install something
when I walk up to the exhibit,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.701
it could just broadcast
something directly to me?

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.200
What if I don't
have to do any work,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.260
but I get the information
I need, when I want it,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.030
and where I want it?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.475
So it turns out that this
isn't just theoretical.

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:12.780
It's possible today
using the Physical Web.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.160
So what is the Physical Web?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.570
Well, our mission is to
enable you to walk up and be

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.030
able to use anything.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.540
You know, our core
value proposition

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.830
is that when you walk
into an environment,

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.290
you can very easily see
a list of URLs associated

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.260
with the space
around you, so you

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.130
know what you can interact with,
what objects, and locations,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.885
and devices in the area
that you can interact with.

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:37.600
You know, it's
ultimately just built

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.880
on top of the web, which means
two key things in this context.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.790
One, it means that URLs
are the fundamental unit

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.910
of interaction.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.130
So every device, every
location, every object

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.230
can have a URL
associated with it

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.710
that's broadcasting
to your device.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.697
But two, it also
means that it's open,

00:03:55.697 --> 00:03:58.280
which means that anyone can get
started with it without asking

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.740
for permission, from
the smallest hacker

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.509
developer to a large company.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.800
Now, I want to tell you more
about what this looks like

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.630
and how it's used, but
first let's give you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.040
a glimpse of how it might look.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.490
Uh-oh.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.394
I swear, this is not the
end of the presentation.

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:22.810
There we go.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.930
So imagine that you're
in a space where

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.930
there might be something
like a vending machine,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.190
and there's a URL associated
with the vending machine

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.920
that you want to be able to
really easily interact with.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.850
So you might walk in,
the vending machine

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.402
could just be
broadcasting a website,

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:38.110
and you'll see it up
here on your device.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.560
And you know, this is a
concept of how this might look,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.890
but we'll show you
some more real world,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.540
realistic applications as
well today, that are in use.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.140
Now, how does the Physical
Web actually work?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.895
Trying to advance the slides.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:58.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Be
right with you, Ani.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.860
ANI MOHAN: Sure.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.360
There we go.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.700
perfect.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.770
So at its core, the Physical
Web is made up of three things.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.860
So one, Bluetooth
low energy beacons.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.600
Two, a scanning
service that actually

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.740
sits on your device that can
scan for and decode these URLs.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.320
And third, a proxy service.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.260
So let's unpack each of these.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.220
So the first phase
of the Physical Web

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.740
is Bluetooth low
energy beacons that

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.620
are placed in the environment.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.440
So what are Bluetooth
low energy beacons?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.920
These are relatively
inexpensive, low powered,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.730
multi-battery year life devices
that can broadcast content

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.070
over Bluetooth.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.180
So last year, Google released
an open specification

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.330
call Eddystone, which defines
a format for communication

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.322
for how beacons can broadcast
content into the environment.

00:05:46.322 --> 00:05:48.530
I'm excited that since the
announcement of Eddystone,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.860
today, there's over
30 manufacturers that

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.770
make Eddystone beacons
that you can buy.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.900
Now, one of the properties
of an Eddystone beacon

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.010
is that it can broadcast a URL
using the Eddystone URL frame

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.050
format, meaning that a URL can
be encoded and placed directly

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.780
on the beacon and
broadcast into the space.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.020
So that's the first phase.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.650
Beacons out in the wild,
broadcasting websites.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.370
Now, the second
phase is that there

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.920
needs to be something
on your device

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.710
that can actually scan
for, decode, and display

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.120
these URLs to the user, and
using low level iOS and Android

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.740
platform scanning
APIs, any developer

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.750
can create a scanning utility
that can display these Physical

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.120
Web URLs.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.890
But we wanted to make
this really easy for users

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.940
to get started today
using the Physical Web,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.670
without having to install
or download something new.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.010
So what we're doing on the team
is encouraging lots of apps

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.080
to actually incorporate scanning
into the application itself.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.890
And so our team is
the Chrome team,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.240
and we work on bring Physical
Web support into Chrome.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.450
And I'll show you a little
bit later what this Chrome

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.810
experience looks like,
but what makes me really

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.030
excited is that it's not
just Chrome that's involved

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.060
with the Physical Web.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.480
We work closely with Opera,
which announced support

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.210
for the Physical Web in the
labs version of their release

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.280
last October.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.860
And Samsung is exploring ways
to surface Physical Web results

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.582
in the Samsung S browser.

00:07:09.582 --> 00:07:11.540
And if you were here
yesterday, if you attended

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.610
the Nearby talk, you might have
seen that Nearby Notifications

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.790
is a new Android surface to
showcase Physical Web results.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.560
So really excited to see all
this momentum in the ecosystem

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.260
and see many different types
of apps adopt and embrace

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.800
Physical Web support baked in.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.710
Now, the third phase
of the Physical Web

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.500
is the proxy service, which
is a server side service that

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.010
sits in between Bluetooth low
energy beacons and the scanners

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.690
that appear on a user's device.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.760
And this proxy plays two
very important roles.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.960
So the first is that
it keeps users save.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.830
It make sure that
malicious URLs that

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.970
might be broadcast over
Bluetooth low energy beacons

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.520
never ultimately show
up on users' devices.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.330
But secondly, and increasingly
importantly, the proxy actually

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.960
ranks and sorts the URLs
that users ultimately see.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.450
You can imagine a
world where there

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.350
might be a lot of these beacons
scattered in the environment.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.820
Users might see a
long list of URLs.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.699
And the user shouldn't
have to choose

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.990
which one is most important
to them or relevant to them

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.250
at that point in time.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.160
The proxy can play this
role in doing the sorting.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.800
And in the ethos of the
physical web being designed

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.630
as an open ecosystem, the
proxy is an interoperable piece

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.540
of the system.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.780
So users can ultimately
choose whether or not

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.893
to incorporate it into their
Physical Web experience.

00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:33.809
So let's show you a
little bit about what this

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.850
might look like in practice.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.580
So last year, we
on the Chrome team

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.980
announced support for
physical web on iOS,

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.594
and this is our way of signaling
to the broader ecosystem

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:45.260
that, hey, the Physical
Web is something

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.560
that Google does truly embrace.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.020
If you have an iPhone today,
you can actually set this up

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.350
by adding the Chrome widget to
the Today view of iOS, where

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.080
you can simply opt
in to the experience,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.780
and any time you swipe
down onto the Today view,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.632
you'll be able to see
the website appear.

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:04.340
So again, in our
vending machine example,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.290
this is just a gif
of this in action.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.020
You swipe down and you see
the URL being broadcast

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.130
by the vending machine.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.120
What I'm really excited about
is that two months ago, we

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.580
announced support for Chrome
on Android integration

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.500
with the Physical Web.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.875
And we're really proud of this
implementation, because it

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:22.916
really takes advantage of
some of the cool things

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.680
that you can do with
the Android platform.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.096
One of the main
properties here is

00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:28.740
that we surface these Physical
Web results via what we call

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.190
a low priority notification.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.110
A notification
that looks and acts

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.110
like any other notification
but doesn't actually

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.930
vibrate the user's device.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.710
And so this is a key
principle, because we

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.450
don't want to create a
world where every time you

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.140
walk by a beacon,
your phone goes off.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.700
No one wants to deal with that.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.550
We want to make it so that the
websites are available for you

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.440
to access to see these
results when users proactively

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.480
ask for it.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.500
So what this might
look like in practice

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.180
is-- again with our
vending machine example.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.850
That's another gif
of this in action.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.427
You swipe down and you'll see
the notification sitting there

00:09:58.427 --> 00:09:59.510
in your notification tray.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.220
You tap on it, it starts
scanning for nearby URLs,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.400
and it displays it right there.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.360
And so again, if you have
an Android device today,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.980
and you turn on
Bluetooth, you'll

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.310
be prompted to opt
into the Physical Web

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.110
whenever you first
walk by a beacon,

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.190
and you'll be able to take
part in this experience today.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.440
And actually, we want to
make it really easy for folks

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.842
to see what this looks like
at I/O. So throughout I/O,

00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:23.050
we've deployed Physical Web
beacons that are actually

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.750
broadcasting the I/O
schedule so that you

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.250
have the schedule
at your fingertips

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.490
no matter where you are.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.980
Also, within individual
rooms we have spaces URLs.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.720
It's a new product
that Google launched

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.470
on Monday that make
it really easy for you

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.845
to interact with other people
in a certain session space.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:42.490
So I encourage you to check out
the Physical Web on an iPhone

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.734
or Android device.

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:45.650
But of course, something
like the Physical Web

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.700
is, perhaps, best
illustrated in person.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.230
So what we're going to do
now is a technology demo

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.980
to show you how this might work.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.990
So Scott's coming up and
setting up a candy machine

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.330
that we have right here.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.530
And so the experience
we're going to show you--

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.190
we can switch to
the wolf vision--

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.600
is what it might
look like for me

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.530
to actually interact
a device like that.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.030
You know?

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.420
A device it's just kind
of out in the wild.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.140
Not one that I might
have seen before.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.170
Something I want a
friction-free, quick

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.590
interaction with.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:23.640
So now I'm going to
switch over to my phone,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.610
and I have Physical Web
enabled, so let's see

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.790
if I can discover that URL.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.780
So I'll simply swipe down,
tap on the physical web

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.939
notification.

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:34.480
Looks like a lot of people here
are broadcasting Physical Web

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.979
URLs.

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:36.702
That's awesome.

00:11:36.702 --> 00:11:38.160
I'll scroll down,
and look at that.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.860
I see the candy machine
that's broadcasting a website,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.647
so I'll tap on it.

00:11:41.647 --> 00:11:43.480
And at this point, the
Physical Web is done.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.370
All it did was enable
friction-free, quick

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.200
interaction to get to
a website without me

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.250
having to know what to go to.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.820
But here's where the web
really starts shining.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.984
Some of the cool new
things that the web can do

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:55.400
are being featured
throughout I/O,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.150
but I want to tell you about
one thing in particular,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.965
which is called Web Bluetooth.

00:11:57.965 --> 00:12:00.430
It's the ability for a
website to connect directly

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.020
to a device over Bluetooth.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.090
So that candy machine
actually doesn't

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.400
have any internet connectivity.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.020
It's just emitting
content over Bluetooth.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:21.069
So if I connect to it,
I can now just walk up

00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.860
and get some candy.

00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:25.910
[CLINKING]

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.290
There we go.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.660
Look at that.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.040
Just walk up and use.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.341
And so that's just
a sample for what

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.840
are some of the
cool things that you

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.048
can do with the Physical Web.

00:12:41.048 --> 00:12:43.540
And of course, it's a technology
demo, and things like this

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.540
aren't necessarily
experiences that you're going

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.623
to use in the world today.

00:12:46.623 --> 00:12:49.460
But what I am excited
about is that developers,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.932
both large and small, are using
the Physical Web in all sorts

00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:53.890
of creative ways today.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.820
And I'm going to give
you a flavor for what

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.211
a couple of these
experiences look like.

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:01.460
So first, I want you to
imagine that you're in London.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.810
Let's say you're a
visitor to London,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.150
and you're hurriedly
trying to get onto a bus.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.740
You know, you're
boarding a bus stop.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.390
[CLINKING]

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.100
Isn't that funny?

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.600
See?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.650
It's so easy to use.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.990
Anyone can use it.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.030
We'll turn it on after.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:27.115
So imagine you're in London.

00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:28.520
You know, you're a
traveler to London,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.270
you're trying to get onto a bus,
and you're really stressed out

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.520
because you don't
know when your bus is

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.720
going to arrive at the stop
that you want to get off at.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.450
You know, today,
there's not necessarily

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.850
a great solution
to this problem.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.170
You probably need to find
the right website to go to.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.836
Maybe you're hurriedly trying to
find the right app to download.

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:43.789
But you're a traveler.

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:45.580
You don't want to have
to worry about this.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.840
So what you can do with
the Physical Web today--

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.798
and this is an experience
that's live in London

00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:51.570
as of a month ago-- is that
you can get onto a public bus,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.032
swipe down and
see a Physical Web

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.240
notification, because there's
beacons deployed inside

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.390
of these buses.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.670
Tap on the website being
broadcast by the physical web

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.800
beacon and get taken to a web
application that shows you

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.485
real time estimated
traffic data.

00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:05.860
And again, one of the cool
new things that the web can do

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.350
is actually send you
push notifications.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.740
So even when you don't have
your phone screen turned on

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.670
or your browser's
not open, the website

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.170
can send you a notification.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.150
So you could do something
like, hey, notify me

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.399
when I get to a particular
stop that I want to get to,

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:21.025
and put your phone
away, and your phone

00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:22.399
will just send
you a notification

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.320
when you get there.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.620
So this entire
experience was enabled

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.580
by the frictionless
discovery of this website,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.000
and it's an example of the
use of the Physical Web that

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.250
is especially powerful when
you see some of the things

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.020
that the web can do.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.280
And so this is live across
100 buses in London today,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.190
and the team that
deployed it is working

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.300
on rolling it out to more buses
over the course of this year.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.590
But as I mentioned, one
of the things that gets me

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.430
and our team really excited
about the Physical Web

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.888
is that it's
something that's open.

00:14:50.888 --> 00:14:53.120
It's something that anyone
can get started with.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.661
And so this next example that
I'm going to show you, I think,

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.510
really illustrates this point.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.040
After we shipped Chrome
on iOS last year,

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.565
we were pleased to discover
five months afterwards

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:05.190
that there's a middle school and
Alabama called Brooklyn Middle

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.710
School that uses
the Physical Web

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.650
to supercharge their every
day school experience.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.270
And so when we dug
a little bit deeper

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.890
to find out how they're
using the Physical Web,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.265
we realized that
there were a lot

00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.030
of creative applications of it.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.800
So when you walk into
the lobby of the school

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.220
and wander into the
area where they showcase

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.462
the athletic and
academic trophies,

00:15:24.462 --> 00:15:26.170
you can actually swipe
down on your phone

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.044
and get taken a Physical
Web experience where

00:15:28.044 --> 00:15:30.370
you see YouTube videos
associated with when

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.960
those sports trophies
were collected,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.870
so you get a little more context
about what you're looking at.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.369
But it's also used
in the classroom.

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:39.309
You know, when you walk by
rooms where teachers might

00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:40.850
be teaching, you
can actually quickly

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.190
get access to notes that the
teachers might be distributing.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.950
Or, if you're
inside the classroom

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.650
using the physical
web, you can quickly

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.080
get access to the assignments
that the teacher might

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.140
be broadcasting for
homework later in the day,

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.740
or be able to engage in a
quick, interactive poll.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.120
You know, all quick, minute,
friction free interactions

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.241
that you have within the school.

00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:02.240
And we're excited to see
the school really start

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.330
to embrace the Physical Web.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.288
You know, the students
started creating signage

00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:07.450
that educated each
other, and parents,

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.802
and potential visitors to
the school how to turn it on,

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.510
and they're evangelizing
the Physical Web

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.010
within their local
community, trying

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.634
to convince local museums
and local stores to adopt it.

00:16:16.634 --> 00:16:18.050
And the principal
is even speaking

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.910
at sort of a nationwide
educational circuit

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.630
to talk about how the Physical
Web can improve the school

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.296
experience.

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:26.420
So examples like these
really get our team excited,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.490
because part of the
beauty of the physical web

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.430
is its simplicity
and its openness,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.570
and that anyone can really
get started to build

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.170
interesting experiences.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.269
And so those two are just
sort of a flavor for how

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:39.560
the physical web is used today.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.020
And I want to give you a
brief glimpse into a few more.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.562
So our local Bay Area basketball
team, Golden State Warriors,

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:45.394
who won last night--

00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:46.020
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.270
ANI MOHAN: They use
the Physical Web.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.020
Yeah, there we go.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.434
We could probably pause a
little bit longer for that.

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:52.975
They actually deploy
the Physical Web

00:16:52.975 --> 00:16:55.060
at Oracle Arena,
where they greet

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.490
fans who walk into the
stadium with highlight videos

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.320
and give them cool
teaser content.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.050
The Consumer
Technology Association

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.740
which runs the annual
Consumer Electronics Show

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.440
deployed Physical Web beacons
at CES this past January,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.339
where they provide
a way for visitors

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.050
to engage in a virtual scavenger
hunt throughout the venue.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.381
There's museums, both
locally and abroad,

00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:18.839
that are using the Physical
Web to provide experiences very

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.172
similar to the one that I
talked about in the beginning,

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:24.030
sort provide this immersive,
engaging museum experience.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.530
And there's a whole lot more
that are using the Physical Web

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.950
in all sorts of creative ways.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.970
And of course, the
days are still young.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.530
This is still an
early ecosystem,

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.750
but we're excited to see such a
diversity of use cases already

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.260
being used.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.930
But it's not just the
case that developers

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.310
are putting out beacons.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.855
We're realizing that the press
is also increasingly starting

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:44.480
to take notice.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.020
And increasingly what
they're commenting on

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.910
is how simply the
physical web can

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.770
enable a light weight
IoT-like experience

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.760
in a variety of contexts.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.980
And since our Chrome
on Android launch,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.880
we've noticed that
users are increasingly

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.010
encountering and interacting
with these beacons.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.850
From about two
months ago to today,

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.550
we're seeing roughly 10 times
the number of encounters

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.390
that users have
with these beacons.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.730
And of course, you know,
these numbers are still early.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.480
It's still a very
young ecosystem.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.524
But the signs look
promising, and we're

00:18:13.524 --> 00:18:14.940
excited to see
where this will go.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.150
So that's a little bit about how
the Physical Web is used today,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.280
but I want to bring
this over to you.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.100
Developers.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.130
How can you get started
with the Physical Web?

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.850
Well, to answer this
question, you first

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.060
need to figure out two things.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.600
You know, one, what does
your use case specifically

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.340
look like, and two,
how big of a space

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.300
are you trying to enable your
Physical Web experience in?

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.450
Are you trying to broadcast
a single piece of content

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.950
in a relatively small space?

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.870
And the example we like
to talk about there

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.500
is, let's say
you're a restaurant

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.290
and you want to provide a
really easy digital menu

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.975
for the people who
walk into your store,

00:18:52.975 --> 00:18:54.800
into your restaurant.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.712
Are you trying to cover
a broad area with sort

00:18:57.712 --> 00:18:58.920
of a single piece of content?

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.670
This is something
like what we're

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.000
doing at I/O, where
throughout I/O, which

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.737
can't be covered
by single beacon,

00:19:03.737 --> 00:19:05.070
we're broadcasting a single URL.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.759
The link to the schedule.

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.550
Or are you trying to
do something even more

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.810
engaging and even more
complex, where you're

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.720
trying to deploy multiple
beacons across multiple spaces

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.539
with a variety of URLs?

00:19:15.539 --> 00:19:17.080
Answering this
question will help you

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.010
figure out, one,
how many beacons

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.930
you need to enable the
experience that you'd

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570
like to provide, and two,
what your content management

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.610
strategy looks like for the
URLs that you're broadcasting.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.900
So once you answer
this question,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.251
you'll need to actually
go out and get beacons.

00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:32.750
So it turns out
that if you actually

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.999
have an Android device, one
of the more modern Android

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:38.200
devices, either a Nexus phone or
one of the more recent flagship

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.765
Samsung devices, Motorola
devices, LG devices,

00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:43.140
you can download this app
called beacon toy from the Play

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.940
Store that lets you create
a virtual beacon straight

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.734
from your phone.

00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:48.150
So when you download
this app, you

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.700
can set up the appropriate
configuration parameters

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.830
to see what a beacon
configuration, process looks

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.080
like and choose what
URL you would want

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.730
to broadcast, and simply go.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.274
You know, it's a way of having
a lightweight way of interacting

00:20:00.274 --> 00:20:01.690
with beacons and
getting your feet

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.130
wet with what this
experience looks like.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.730
But once you're ready to
actually deploy beacons,

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.890
you can go to this website
right here, g.co/beacons,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.900
and you see a list of over 30
Eddystone manufactures that you

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.916
can choose from to actually
go and put this hardware out

00:20:18.916 --> 00:20:20.730
in the environment.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.320
But of course, you
know, this wouldn't

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.550
be Google I/O
without a giveaway,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.636
and so I'm excited that tomorrow
at 3:00 PM in our Mobile Web

00:20:28.636 --> 00:20:30.260
sandbox, we'll actually
be distributing

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.400
some of these beacons, and Scott
will have some more details

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.740
around what that'll look like.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.830
But I encourage you to
come out and check it out

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.788
if you like to play with
some of this hardware.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.170
So once you've
gotten beacons, you

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.450
bought them and you're ready to
deploy them in the environment,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.900
you need to figure out what
URLs you want to broadcast,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.820
and we've designed this system
to be fairly flexible so that,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.100
as long as it's not a malicious
URL that the proxy filters

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.730
away, it's something
that you can broadcast.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.906
But we want you
to use HTTPS URLs,

00:21:02.906 --> 00:21:04.280
and that's because
we think HTTPS

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.870
is table stakes for the
security of the modern web.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.690
And a lot of the
cool, new web platform

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.490
features that you
might have been exposed

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.736
to yesterday and over
the next few days,

00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:15.360
such as that push
notifications example

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.390
and the Web Bluetooth
example that I showed you,

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.920
require HTTPS in
the root domain.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.350
So the Chrome implementation
of the physical web

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.120
only works with HTTPS URLs.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.130
This is true on Android
today, and it will soon

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.540
be true on the iOS
implementation.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.350
So that's that.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.360
You got to choose what HTTPS
URL you want to broadcast.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.410
And finally, you'll
want to figure out how

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.800
to manage your URL deployment.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800
And what I mean by
this is, let's say

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.880
you configure your beacon
to broadcast a URL,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.640
but you want to change it later.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.420
It's frustrating to
go close to it again

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.470
and having to do a
hardware reconfiguration.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.261
Wouldn't it be great
if you could manage it

00:21:49.261 --> 00:21:50.320
through the cloud?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.400
So using a URL redirector, just
an off-the-shelf redirector

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.400
that lets you update the URL
server side, you can do this.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.730
So you simply place a
shortened URL onto the beacon,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.750
and then from the
redirector interface,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.867
you can simply update
the destination URL.

00:22:04.867 --> 00:22:06.950
So you don't need to worry
about going in hardware

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.700
and keeping your
configuration up-to-date.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.820
So I encourage you to go to
our website, physical-web.org,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.320
which we just newly
relaunched yesterday,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.110
to provide all sorts of demos
that can inspire you to show

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.350
you how you can use
the Physical Web,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.960
and to give you a bunch of
getting started resources that

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.480
bring this to life and help
you understand in more detail

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.604
the steps that you need to
take to get started with

00:22:30.604 --> 00:22:31.920
the deployment.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.600
So with that, I
want to turn it over

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.016
to Scott, who's going to tell
you a little bit about where

00:22:36.016 --> 00:22:37.468
the Physical Web is going.

00:22:37.468 --> 00:22:40.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.440
SCOTT JENSON: Thank you.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:46.940
OK.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.060
Thanks, Ani.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.060
Appreciate that.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.660
Now that you guys have got the
basic idea of what the Physical

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.934
Web is and kind of a little
bit more how it works,

00:22:54.934 --> 00:22:56.100
let's talk about the future.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.940
We've been very busy over
this last year producing

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.580
a whole series of videos
that kind of push and show

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.377
what you can do with
the Physical Web,

00:23:10.377 --> 00:23:12.210
and people have responded
very well to them.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.340
And these are all
on physical-web.org.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.255
And they really show the
kind of leading edge things

00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:19.880
that you can do, and
it really opens up

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.040
people's eyes to the fact
that this is so much more

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.420
than just a QR code.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:31.230
But what's really
interesting about that

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.510
is that what we're trying to
get across is the Physical Web

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.390
and the mobile web in particular
is more than just markup.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.848
Over the last couple
of years, it's

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:41.700
been really quite clear that the
web can't just be desktop web.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.197
It's got to be mobile web,
and it's got to be responsive.

00:23:44.197 --> 00:23:45.780
But the Physical Web
is trying to take

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.150
that one step further
and make it, effectively,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.900
the mobile web of nearby things
so that you really can, as Ani

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.636
said, walk up and use anything.

00:23:53.636 --> 00:23:55.010
And so we're trying
to figure out

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.052
how to enable that kind
of really mobile web.

00:23:59.052 --> 00:24:00.510
And I want to talk
about the future

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.349
in three kind of buckets.

00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:04.140
The first is going to
be web functionality.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.764
Ani kind of hinted
at this, as to where

00:24:05.764 --> 00:24:07.560
the web is going itself.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.310
The next I want to
talk about is hardware,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.990
because this is
changing very rapidly.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.550
And the final one is
just simply use cases.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.610
As a designer, I
spend an awful lot

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.280
of my time working with
people, designing new products,

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.690
and usually, the biggest
thing that holds us back

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.720
is not the technology.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.800
It's us.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.720
It's how we think
about the technology.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.760
I want to talk about
that a little bit.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.270
So about web itself.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.310
Right now, it's
just so easy to get

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.560
started with the physical web.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.410
You just need a beacon
and you need a website.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.050
I get asked all the time.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.330
I love this question.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.580
So what's the SDK
for the Physical Web?

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.360
Uh, the web.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.845
I mean, that's it.

00:24:47.845 --> 00:24:49.970
If you don't have a website,
you can't get started.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.390
That's the whole point
of the Physical Web.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.223
It's really quick and
light weight to do it.

00:24:53.223 --> 00:24:55.480
But even with that
snarky response,

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.500
you can enable all sorts of
really exciting and interesting

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.050
things.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.680
We made a lost dog finder,
movie posters, any type

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.840
of information on demand.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.230
These aren't really interactive.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.560
They're just information
that you need in space.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.760
Ephemeral public interactions
are really good for this.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.190
So even this lowly,
simple web page, I think,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.250
has incredible value.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.010
So let's take a look
at this next example

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.362
here, which actually initially
came from an experiment

00:25:28.362 --> 00:25:29.820
on YouTube, and we
like it so much,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.153
we kind of made our own version.

00:25:31.153 --> 00:25:34.620
If someone could roll
the video please.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.010
So what this is showing
is the Physical Web

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.244
discovering a beacon
of a nearby restaurant.

00:25:39.244 --> 00:25:41.410
It's a little bit what Ani
was talking about before,

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.970
but in this
particular case, it's

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.126
showing a restaurant
called Bob's Deli.

00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.750
And then when you
click on it, it says,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.840
oh there's eight people in line.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.965
Do you want to get in line.

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:50.580
And so you click Yes.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.970
At that point, you're opting
in to push notifications,

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.220
in which case you've opted in.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.595
You could put the
phone to sleep.

00:25:56.595 --> 00:25:57.990
You could put it in your pocket.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.710
And then when it's
your turn, the phone

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.350
will vibrate and wake up.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.520
Now, the physical web
as a general scanner

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.930
does not want to vibrate,
because it's a generic service,

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.260
but once you've opted in,
that's a whole different story.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.260
And what I love about
this is that, A,

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.501
this makes us look awesome,
but we did nothing.

00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:16.000
Right?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.980
This is the web being awesome.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.860
We got lucky.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.722
Right?

00:26:19.722 --> 00:26:21.930
And I think this is really
kind of an important point

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.400
to make about the Physical Web
is that as the web gets better,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.760
we can just do more
and more stuff.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.600
Next slide, please.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.070
So the physical web, is
in a sense, this low bar.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.340
We're just trying to just give
you the things around and let

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.640
more things happen.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.606
So for example, there's
HTML, there's Web Sockets,

00:26:40.606 --> 00:26:41.730
there's push notifications.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.160
These are all like the tinker
toys kind of lying at your feet

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.800
that you can use right now to
build really compelling things,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.280
and we think that's kind of fun.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.920
But let's just step like
five minutes into the future

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.010
and we can talk about
things like progressive web

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.009
apps, which we're talking
about a lot right now.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:57.240
You can use these right now.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.890
But then, as Ani showed,
web Bluetooth connect

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.080
is really making
people's eyes go wide,

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.750
because it allows you to connect
to cheap, tiny little things

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.940
that have no
connectivity whatsoever.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.470
And that's still rolling
out, but it's coming.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.667
It's part of a W3C standard,
and people are starting

00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:14.750
to play with it right now.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.120
Obviously, someone already
had it turned on their phone

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.050
just a few minutes ago, so you
know it's available right now.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.160
By the way, at 1:00
PM on stage two

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.551
is another talk called
What's Next for the Web,

00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:28.550
and they're calling out
a whole bunch of things,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.841
and they're going to be
talking about in particular web

00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:31.590
Bluetooth.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.970
So if you're interested in
that, please go to this talk.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.120
But if we want to
get more crazy,

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.120
we've been having some really
interesting conversations

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.250
effectively within
the GitHub talking

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.010
about really crazy new ideas.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.570
Now, there's no
promise here, there's

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.380
no real, immediate
things happening,

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.310
but the fact that we're having
passionate, fun conversations

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.150
on our GitHub shows how excited
people can be about where

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.290
the Physical Web could go.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.990
So for example, the next
generation web Bluetooth

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.444
is going to be able to scan
Instead of just connecting

00:28:01.444 --> 00:28:02.860
to the device in
front of you, you

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.550
can actually find
a range of devices.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.240
So go back to the
museum example.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.740
You could have a
whole bunch of URLs

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.200
that all are, say, SF MOMA,
but they're slightly unique.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.140
Exhibit one, exhibit
two, exhibit three.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.060
We can collapse all of those
so instead of seeing them

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.140
individually in our scanner,
you just see San Francisco MOMA,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.520
and when you click on
it, it does the scanning,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.990
finds all of the related
beacons and then says, oh.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.320
I'll show you the one
that you're closest to.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.110
Or it could show you the list,
or it could show you a map.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.450
The point is, we don't care.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.650
We are going to
allow everyone else

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:37.850
to have their own experience.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.450
The Physical Web is meant to
be this little tiny jumping off

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.010
point into your web experience,
and you can do anything

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.840
that you want to
with it, and we feel

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.484
that's best because
we get out of the way,

00:28:48.484 --> 00:28:49.650
and that's really important.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.066
It's kind of one of the reasons
why the web is so awesome.

00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:54.310
We let you guys
build on top of us.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.560
But the other one that gets
a little bit more exciting

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.330
is beacon triggers.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.160
So Service Worker
already allows you

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.610
to register for events
like push notifications,

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.310
but what would happen if you
could register for a beacon

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.810
event?

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.760
Your phone would
be in your pocket.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760
You'd be walking around.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.229
You get close to a beacon,
you can actually get an event.

00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:12.770
The ServiceWorker can respond
to s and actually do something,

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.840
and you'd never take the
phone out your pocket at all.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.700
This is a little bit
more blue sky thinking,

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.610
but this is what we mean by
the future of the Physical Web.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.790
These are the kind
of directions we

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.755
can go using exactly
the same technology.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.560
So the key thing to
remember about all these

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.430
is that from our
point of view, we

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.670
have a simple scanner
that lets you kind of find

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.190
an app that uses
WebSockets, or something

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.810
that uses web Bluetooth,
or even a simple HTML page.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.810
There's all sorts of
different technologies

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.520
that you guys can
use to implement it,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.740
but from the user's point
of view, it's just a list.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.807
And when they click on
it, they just go to it,

00:29:51.807 --> 00:29:53.390
and that's what's
really nice about it

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.852
is that, from the
UX point of view,

00:29:54.852 --> 00:29:56.310
it's just a list
that you click on,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.350
and depending on whatever
tinker toy you use,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.700
you can do your own thing.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.370
And again, it's
one of the reasons

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.630
why the web is so great, because
you have layered technologies.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.620
The physical web API
doesn't need to grow

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.820
is what I'm saying.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.620
Now let's talk about hardware,
because it's really stunned me

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.660
how quickly the hardware has
changed, because initially,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.780
when I first started in
2014 on this project,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.660
we had beacons that
we were giving away

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.180
that lasted about six
months on a battery.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.440
Last year, we released a beacon
that lasted for two years.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.930
And now with the brand new
chips that are coming out

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.780
that only one volt, the same
beacon or the same battery

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.270
could last nearly a decade.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.700
This is really changing rapidly.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.590
This is what Moore's
law really means.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.040
And I often get people
who say, the physical web

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.551
is an ecological disaster.

00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:44.300
We're going to throw
batteries everywhere.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.800
Like, well, actually, it's a
really good concern, thank you,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.600
but when we get this
low of a power thing,

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.690
you can just put a solar cell
on it and it can run forever.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.740
And not only that,
it's such low power

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.830
that the solar cell can
generate more than enough

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.765
to charge a capacitor
so it doesn't run just

00:30:59.765 --> 00:31:00.390
during the day.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.316
It can run at night.

00:31:01.316 --> 00:31:02.690
So we're getting
to the point now

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.740
where these beacons
won't need batteries

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.570
in a very short period of time.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.987
So this is pretty exciting
stuff as to where that's going.

00:31:08.987 --> 00:31:10.611
But there's already
a company right now

00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:12.240
that makes a Physical
Web beacon that

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.854
clips onto fluorescent lights,
and it has a solar cell in it,

00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:16.520
and it runs as long
as the light are on.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.310
I think that's awesome.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.769
And that's also why that we
are not in the beacon business,

00:31:20.769 --> 00:31:22.809
because we're going to
let everybody else kind of

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:24.102
do these really cool things.

00:31:24.102 --> 00:31:25.310
But then take a look at this.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.910
This is a beacon that was
developed by Google's Verily

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.720
team as an experiment.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.327
It's the size of a nickel,
and for those of you

00:31:32.327 --> 00:31:33.910
not from the United
States, a nickel's

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.590
approximately 21
millimeters wide.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.512
And it is a teeny
little thing that

00:31:38.512 --> 00:31:40.470
runs on a teeny little
battery, and the battery

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.646
lasts for about two months.

00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:43.020
And they're actually
embarrassed,

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.061
the Verily team was a
little embarrassed by this,

00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:47.130
because this is
their debug beacon.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.490
They claim they can easily
make it four times smaller,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.390
and in production in
probably two years,

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.600
it would be, like, less than $1.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.130
So now we're talking
about not only things

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.970
that can last for a while, but
that can be very, very cheap.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.510
So imagine this
particular thing.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.759
Can we roll the video, please?

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.130
This is a fake pill bottle
with a fake prescription

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.990
and a fake address,
and my name on top

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.410
that basically
shows a pill bottle

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.735
with one of these little
beacons at the top.

00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:18.610
And the idea is that
the pharmacist will just

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.720
pull the tab out and
start broadcasting,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.540
and because it uses
a URL redirector,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.740
you just simply scan
it and then point it

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.570
to that particular
record, and then

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.528
it can just show you in
your list, oh, look it.

00:32:28.528 --> 00:32:30.044
This is your Xyzal prescription.

00:32:30.044 --> 00:32:32.210
And then, using the web,
you can detect the language

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.543
that the user wants, and so
you can change the language,

00:32:34.543 --> 00:32:36.074
you can show YouTube videos.

00:32:36.074 --> 00:32:37.490
If there's a sensor
in the beacon,

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.090
you can even tell when was the
last time you took the pill.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.050
It doesn't need to
use web Bluetooth.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.330
It can be built into the URL.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.871
There's really fun
things to do here.

00:32:43.871 --> 00:32:47.190
And again, this is just a
simple, lightweight HTML page,

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.460
but it shows you,
as the hardware gets

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.490
smaller and cheaper,
we can drive it

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.510
into almost trivial
little things.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.880
And keep in mind that
this is going to broadcast

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.030
extremely low power signal.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.859
So it'll only be about
a half a meter away.

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:01.650
So you have to be really
close to the thing

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.030
in order to get it.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.170
Next slide, please.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.040
Now let's move to my third
point about use cases,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.330
because if there's one
thing I've noticed,

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.320
it's that the world has
kind of imprinted on beacons

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.546
are for retail, and
every possible thing

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:19.920
you ever want to
do with a beacon

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.150
has got to be tracking
the user in a store.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.845
Makes me a little sad, you know?

00:33:25.845 --> 00:33:27.960
It's like, there's
so much more to it.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.502
So let's kind of--
and it's exciting,

00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:31.168
by the way, that
people are doing things

00:33:31.168 --> 00:33:33.755
like with vending machines, and
bus stops, and pill bottles.

00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:35.713
We actually are talking
to a company that wants

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:36.929
to do this with pill bottles.

00:33:36.929 --> 00:33:38.470
And there's fun
things are happening,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.132
but the really
exciting part, the part

00:33:40.132 --> 00:33:42.360
that gets me super
psyched, is the fact

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.670
that this could be used
for personal things.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.690
So let's say that
you're in a room

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.990
and you're broadcasting
the URL to your slide deck,

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.171
or you've got a for sale
beacon on your house,

00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:54.170
and instead of having
those pieces of paper that

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.840
get wet in the rain or run
out, the can just pick it up

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.100
as they walk by.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.349
And you know, our lost
dog collar example.

00:34:00.349 --> 00:34:02.140
And I really want to
go back to the example

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.010
that Ani gave before
about the high school.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.745
That just made us
so excited when

00:34:06.745 --> 00:34:09.880
we saw that, because it's
that kind of no permission,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.900
just go for it, just
do it is what's so

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.300
powerful about this technology.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.877
So we very much are excited
that a lot of big companies

00:34:16.877 --> 00:34:19.460
are interested, but we're really
looking forward to these new,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.043
lighter weight things
that can happen.

00:34:21.043 --> 00:34:23.429
So let me show you a
particular demo of something

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.704
that we could do with this.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.460
Can we have the WolfVision
turned on, please.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:34.150
I can't see.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.260
Can you guys see this?

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.760
Good.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.259
OK.

00:34:38.259 --> 00:34:40.712
So let me just switch
over to Twitter.

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:42.670
One thing that we've
written is this little app

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.040
called PW Share, at
it's just something

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.020
that we've internally.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.250
and it links into the
Android sharing mechanism.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:53.659
So anything that does sharing
an Android can call PW Share.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.130
So if you're doing
a Google Map link,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.500
if you're doing a Chrome web
page, anything you want to,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.880
you just can share it like
you'd share anything in Android.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.230
And so in this case, I'm
going to go into Twitter,

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.860
and I am going to tweet
effectively, a photo of you

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.090
guys.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.830
So can we please
just everyone wave?

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:14.900
Thank you.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.542
Awesome.

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:16.875
I'm sorry I didn't get you guys.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.170
So I'm going to say yes, and I'm
going to say that looks good.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.010
I'm going to tweet.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:26.510
OK.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.725
So now that tweet is out.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.600
For those of you who
are following me, great,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.840
but I'm now going-- I'm sorry.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.000
Can you see that now?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.500
Good.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.780
OK.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.060
So now all I have to do is
just click on the Tweet,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.810
go into share,
and then I'm going

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.460
to scroll down to PW
Share, and the URL's

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.190
going to be going
URLs broadcasting.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.300
That's all I had to do.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.550
Now, my phone is actually a
little bit like a beacon toy.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.540
Now, this is intentionally
set to a low power

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.090
because you don't want
to blast the world,

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.130
but those of you guys that
are in the front rows, maybe

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.755
halfway through, I
don't know for sure,

00:35:58.755 --> 00:36:01.240
should be able to see my
tweet and be able to go to it.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.510
So this is, again, this type of
low level, light weight thing.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.300
Now, I'm not quite sure
sharing a tweet is necessarily

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.850
the highest use
case, but sharing

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.600
where you're going for
a restaurant, where

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.567
you guys are meeting
later, that kind of stuff.

00:36:12.567 --> 00:36:14.400
It's just an example
of this lightweight way

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.316
of thinking that we want
to kind of play with.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.400
So again, in summary,
these are the three points.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.517
The fact that the web
is getting awesome

00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.100
and it's going to
make us look awesome

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.690
and we don't deserve it.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.100
Second, hardware is
getting really low power

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.940
and small in really useful
ways, and three, these new use

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.730
cases are going to make us think
outside of the typical kind

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.490
of retail example.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.280
I also want to make
sure that I call out

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.720
Leon's talk on Friday at one
o'clock, The Physical Web,

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.580
Make It So.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.060
It's the developer
relations talk.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.810
It's going to go deep,
deep, deep into how

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.140
to really program websites
and so forth to really

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.330
make this work, so please
be sure to attend this.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.830
And then finally,
as Ani said, this

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.455
would be Google I/O
without a giveaway.

00:36:57.455 --> 00:37:00.600
We want to give away
a Physical Web beacon.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.320
We are not in the
beacon business.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.120
However, we're very excited
to extend this open source

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.380
way of thinking.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.750
So Nordic has already released
an open source version

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.216
of their Eddystone beacon.

00:37:11.216 --> 00:37:12.840
This particular
beacon, we did with ARM

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.562
and we're releasing
it with them.

00:37:14.562 --> 00:37:16.770
And so this is going to
encourage other manufacturers

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.420
to make more beacons.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.874
This is a slightly
more developer one.

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:23.040
It has an on off switch,
which you probably wouldn't

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.380
do in a retail situation.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.560
But the point is,
for developers, it's

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.601
really hand to turn the
damn thing off sometimes.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.980
But this particular
beacon is handy

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.160
because it also has
the Bluetooth Gatt

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.910
service that lets
you configure it

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.450
through a Bluetooth connection.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.750
So this is going to be the
world's first beacon that

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.620
is an Eddystone beacon that
broadcasts a Physical Web

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.040
URL to a progressive
web app that then uses

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.980
web Bluetooth to connect
to beacon and change

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.990
the URL that's being broadcast.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.060
It's kind like a
snake eating its tail.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.130
But it kind of
encapsulates so much

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.030
of what Google I/O is about.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.120
It's the idea that these
technologies all work together

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.810
to be kind of fun.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.950
And so the URL it
broadcasts is the URL

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.000
that you need to change it.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.620
And so you just press it once
to turn on and press it once

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.386
to turn off.

00:38:11.386 --> 00:38:12.760
So anyway, we'll
talk about that.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.760
And so we will be giving
these away Friday at 3:00 PM.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.850
And so please come by
the mobile web sandbox.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.700
It's approximately
there, and it's

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.090
next to the big,
giant, wooden bus boat

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.960
thing, if you guys saw that.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.740
And so we'll be there.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.970
We're not going to be stamping
your hand or anything,

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.180
so please be cool.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.330
We don't have that many.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.580
Just please take one.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.496
The whole idea is for
you guys to play with it

00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:39.280
and poke around.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.654
In the meantime,
you're more than

00:38:40.654 --> 00:38:42.770
welcome to use the beacon
toy, as we talked about.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.500
So that's it for now.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.314
Thank you guys very much, and
we'll take questions afterwards

00:38:47.314 --> 00:38:47.980
as we were done.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.040
Thank you so much.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.990
