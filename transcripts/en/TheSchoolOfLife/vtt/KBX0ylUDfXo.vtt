00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.060
A philosophy of ORAL SEX

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.880
It has to do with loneliness and self-disgust

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.060
When we begin as babies in this world

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.560
if we're lucky, everything about us is acceptable and adorable, from our toes to our temples

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.060
Then gradually we grow up

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.560
and become shamed of our nakedness and guilty about so much

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.940
it becomes taboo to touch and be touched

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.700
we have no choice but to keep a minimum of 60, or even better, 90 cm distance

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.040
between us and others at all times

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.220
but deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320
to be accepted as we truly are

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.480
in every area

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.520
hence the significance of oral sex

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.240
it sounds disgusting when we think of doing it with an innapropriate person, and that's the point

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.340
Nothing is erotic that isn't also, with the wrong person, revolting

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.500
But with the right person

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.600
at the precise juncture where disgust could be at its height

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.560
we feel only acceptance

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.960
welcoming permission

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.380
The privileged nature of a relationship is sealed by an act which with someone would've been sickening

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.900
Oral sex is interesting and exciting because it's about closeness

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.140
Normal life continually requires us to be polite so much of the time

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.060
We have to repress all that's ostensibly bad within us

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700
our lust and our desires

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.800
We can't both be accepted by society and reveal who we really are

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.800
hence the erotic ecstasy

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.860
which is more accurately, really, just emotional relief

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.340
when oral sex permits our secret self with all its bad and dirty sides

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.060
to be witnessed and enthusiastically endorsed by someone else

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.960
The bond of loyalty between a couple

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.720
grows stronger with every increase in explicitness

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.000
the more unacceptable our behavior would be to the larger world

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.620
the more we feel as if we're building a haven of mutual acceptance

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.040
Sex liberates us for a time, and that punishing dichotomy between dirty and clean

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.720
It literally purifies us by engaging the most apparently polluted sides of ourselves in its games

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.140
We can press our mouths, the most public and respectable aspects of our faces

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.320
eagerly to the most contaminated parts of the other

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.100
Thereby symbolizing a total psychological approval

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.420
much as a priest would accept a penitent

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.920
guilty of many transgressions

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.260
back in the fold of the church with a light kiss up on the head

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.820
The pleasure of oral sex is deeply rich and significant

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.900
It isn't primarily about a pleasant physiological sensation at all

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.240
it's about psychology, acceptance and a promise of an end to loneliness
