00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.500
Every single thing that I've done has
been possible because of my parents,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.620
because of my incredible family.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.900
My mom is originally from Guatemala City,
Guatemala; my dad is originally from Nayarit,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.330
Mexico. They both came to the U.S. very
very young, on their own, searching

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.040
something bigger, they wanted to better
their lives.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.820
One of the biggest reasons I
think that social justice has become

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.830
such a huge driving force for me, such a
huge passion is growing up with the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.460
stories of my parents, undocumented
immigrants trying to live in a country

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.490
that they've never been before, just
trying to survive, just trying to get by.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.530
The struggles and the humiliations that
they had to face because of that, that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.310
doesn't seem okay to me, that doesn't
feel right.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.759
Compassion, humility, honor, honesty, hard
work, perseverance, core values that I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.460
hold because of my family.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.860
Class of 2017,
congratulations!

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.860
[cheering]

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.840
I think there are so many different
experiences and dynamics and identities

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.789
that are represented at Harvard that
historically just were not there. Often

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.590
times it can be these unique points of
view that are challenging Harvard to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.420
grow and to shift and to become more
dynamic.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.629
Getting to hold that piece of paper in
our hands that says this is how we are

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.110
going to aid you, you know where I'm
coming from and you know the type of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.010
background that I'm coming from, you
still believe that we want to bring you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.060
here and contribute to our campus and
learn as much as you can and take

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.300
advantage of these opportunities, it
helps make it more real.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120
Launching very much into this career of
working at nonprofits, I hope that I can

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.360
truly and firmly say that I've done
everything I can to minimize what I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.750
consider unnecessary and unjust struggle
to impact and better the lived

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.520
experiences of others. Those are the
things I'm working towards.
