and then of course this is very

they actually have the problem with this
system is that this obviously

reintroduce one layer of centralization

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:37.189
reintroduce one layer of centralization
 

00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:39.909
reintroduce one layer of centralization
over the internet and the system only

00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:39.919
over the internet and the system only

works so long as we can't ask those

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:41.809
works so long as we can't ask those
 

00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:44.949
works so long as we can't ask those
operators and so what if instead of

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959
operators and so what if instead of
 

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.929
operators and so what if instead of
delegating those tasks to the

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:46.939
delegating those tasks to the
 

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:49.059
delegating those tasks to the
centralized potatoes we could create

instead a decentralized payment system
 

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:54.609
instead a decentralized payment system
and the system as it exists it's Bitcoin

the issuance of Bitcoin is defined by a

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:22.850
the issuance of Bitcoin is defined by a
 

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.059
the issuance of Bitcoin is defined by a
computer protocol which precisely

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:25.069
computer protocol which precisely
 

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:27.489
computer protocol which precisely
stipulate the total amount of bitcoins

00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:27.499
stipulate the total amount of bitcoins
 

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:30.249
stipulate the total amount of bitcoins
that will ever be created 21 million and

00:16:30.249 --> 00:16:30.259
that will ever be created 21 million and
 

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:32.829
that will ever be created 21 million and
the speed at which those bitcoins will

00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839
the speed at which those bitcoins will
 

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:35.289
the speed at which those bitcoins will
be generated so today it is 12.5

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:35.299
be generated so today it is 12.5

characteristic of gold Gold cannot be

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:46.039
characteristic of gold Gold cannot be
 

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.409
characteristic of gold Gold cannot be
created out of nothing

00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:47.419
created out of nothing
 

00:16:47.419 --> 00:16:49.689
created out of nothing
it must be extracted from the ground and

00:16:49.689 --> 00:16:49.699
it must be extracted from the ground and
 

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:52.509
it must be extracted from the ground and
then as time passes and the reserve of

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519
then as time passes and the reserve of
 

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:55.149
then as time passes and the reserve of
gold gets depleted then the harder it

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:55.159
gold gets depleted then the harder it
 

00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:58.569
gold gets depleted then the harder it
becomes to find new gold and in the same

00:16:58.569 --> 00:16:58.579
becomes to find new gold and in the same
 

00:16:58.579 --> 00:17:00.759
becomes to find new gold and in the same
way bitcoins cannot be created out of

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:00.769
way bitcoins cannot be created out of
 

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.639
way bitcoins cannot be created out of
nothing new bitcoins are generated every

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:03.649
nothing new bitcoins are generated every
 

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:06.369
nothing new bitcoins are generated every
time a computer identified the solution

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:06.379
time a computer identified the solution
 

00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:08.289
time a computer identified the solution
to a mathematical problem whose

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:08.299
to a mathematical problem whose
 

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:10.659
to a mathematical problem whose
difficulty increases with the network

00:17:10.659 --> 00:17:10.669
difficulty increases with the network
 

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:12.909
difficulty increases with the network
size so this means that the math people

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919
size so this means that the math people
 

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:15.340
size so this means that the math people
are contributing the home computing

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:15.350
are contributing the home computing
 

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.590
are contributing the home computing
resources to the network the new harder

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600
resources to the network the new harder
 

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.929
resources to the network the new harder
it actually becomes to generate new

00:17:19.929 --> 00:17:19.939
it actually becomes to generate new
 

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.600
it actually becomes to generate new
bitcoins and so this mathematical

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:22.610
bitcoins and so this mathematical
 

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.899
bitcoins and so this mathematical
problem is actually similar to the

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:25.909
problem is actually similar to the
 

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:27.759
problem is actually similar to the
problem of finding the solution to a

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:27.769
problem of finding the solution to a
 

00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:31.060
problem of finding the solution to a
padlock so one needs to try every single

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.070
padlock so one needs to try every single
 

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.789
padlock so one needs to try every single
possibility in order to find the right

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799
possibility in order to find the right
 

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:36.220
possibility in order to find the right
combination but once the solution has

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.230
combination but once the solution has
 

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.480
combination but once the solution has
been found it's very easy for

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.490
been found it's very easy for
 

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.310
been found it's very easy for
one else to verify that it is the

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320
one else to verify that it is the
 

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.870
one else to verify that it is the
correct solution now of course you might

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880
correct solution now of course you might
 

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.660
correct solution now of course you might
wonder because it is indeed a virtual

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:47.670
wonder because it is indeed a virtual
 

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.120
wonder because it is indeed a virtual
currency then how can we trust the

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.130
currency then how can we trust the
 

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.520
currency then how can we trust the
system how can we be sure that people

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:52.530
system how can we be sure that people
 

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.590
system how can we be sure that people
are not going to reproduce and multiply

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600
are not going to reproduce and multiply
 

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.140
are not going to reproduce and multiply
the bitcoins in the same way as they can

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.150
the bitcoins in the same way as they can
 

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.740
the bitcoins in the same way as they can
reproduce digital content and so the

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:00.750
reproduce digital content and so the
 

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.260
reproduce digital content and so the
Bitcoin network operates on top of this

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.270
Bitcoin network operates on top of this
 

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.480
Bitcoin network operates on top of this
auto technology the blockchain which

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.490
auto technology the blockchain which
 

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.640
auto technology the blockchain which
makes it possible to exchange value in a

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:07.650
makes it possible to exchange value in a
 

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.169
makes it possible to exchange value in a
secure and this centralized manner

00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179
secure and this centralized manner
 

00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:11.810
secure and this centralized manner
without the need to rely on any trusted

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820
without the need to rely on any trusted
 

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.570
without the need to rely on any trusted
authority of intermediary operator and

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580
authority of intermediary operator and
 

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.370
authority of intermediary operator and
so how does this work

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380
so how does this work
 

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.820
so how does this work
exactly well instead of assigning to

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:19.830
exactly well instead of assigning to
 

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.280
exactly well instead of assigning to
this centralized operator the task of

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.290
this centralized operator the task of
 

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.620
this centralized operator the task of
verifying every transactions with

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:24.630
verifying every transactions with
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.470
verifying every transactions with
Bitcoin the history of all transactions

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480
Bitcoin the history of all transactions
 

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.020
Bitcoin the history of all transactions
is stored on this common database the

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.030
is stored on this common database the
 

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.750
is stored on this common database the
blockchain and this database is shared

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760
blockchain and this database is shared
 

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.120
blockchain and this database is shared
among all the network participants who

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.130
among all the network participants who
 

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.160
among all the network participants who
are all contributing to the verification

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.170
are all contributing to the verification
 

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.930
are all contributing to the verification
and to the validation of those

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940
and to the validation of those
 

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.600
and to the validation of those
transactions and because everybody holds

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:41.610
transactions and because everybody holds
 

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.060
transactions and because everybody holds
a copy of the blockchain it is virtually

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.070
a copy of the blockchain it is virtually
 

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.549
a copy of the blockchain it is virtually
impossible to chip because if one tries

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559
impossible to chip because if one tries
 

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.410
impossible to chip because if one tries
to modify even a single one of those

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:48.420
to modify even a single one of those
 

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.510
to modify even a single one of those
transactions the fraud will be

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520
transactions the fraud will be
 

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.790
transactions the fraud will be
immediately detected by all the network

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:52.800
immediately detected by all the network
 

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.090
immediately detected by all the network
participants and then once those

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100
participants and then once those
 

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.190
participants and then once those
transactions has been validated they are

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200
transactions has been validated they are
 

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.650
transactions has been validated they are
stored in a chronological order inside a

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660
stored in a chronological order inside a
 

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.380
stored in a chronological order inside a
block of transactions which incorporate

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.390
block of transactions which incorporate
 

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.540
block of transactions which incorporate
a reference to the previous blocks and

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:05.550
a reference to the previous blocks and
 

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.880
a reference to the previous blocks and
this reference is part of the same

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:07.890
this reference is part of the same
 

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.650
this reference is part of the same
mathematical problem which I have

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660
mathematical problem which I have
 

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.860
mathematical problem which I have
described before and this means that the

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:12.870
described before and this means that the
 

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.470
described before and this means that the
only way to validate transactions on the

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480
only way to validate transactions on the
 

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.660
only way to validate transactions on the
Bitcoin blockchain is to find the right

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.670
Bitcoin blockchain is to find the right
 

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.700
Bitcoin blockchain is to find the right
combination that will enable the system

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:19.710
combination that will enable the system
 

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.310
combination that will enable the system
to attach a new block of transaction to

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320
to attach a new block of transaction to
 

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.320
to attach a new block of transaction to
the previous chain of blocks and so the

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.330
the previous chain of blocks and so the
 

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.970
the previous chain of blocks and so the
blockchain is after all just this long

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980
blockchain is after all just this long
 

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.310
blockchain is after all just this long
chain of transactions which reference

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320
chain of transactions which reference
 

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.410
chain of transactions which reference
each other and the longer is the chain

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:33.420
each other and the longer is the chain
 

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.540
each other and the longer is the chain
then the higher is the security of the

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:35.550
then the higher is the security of the
 

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.760
then the higher is the security of the
network because the modification of a

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:37.770
network because the modification of a
 

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.710
network because the modification of a
single one of those transactions will

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720
single one of those transactions will
 

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.049
single one of those transactions will
invalidate the reference to the previous

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059
invalidate the reference to the previous
 

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.750
invalidate the reference to the previous
blocks which will inevitably break the

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760
blocks which will inevitably break the
 

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.320
blocks which will inevitably break the

agree with David the issue with

00:20:08.889 --> 00:20:08.899
agree with David the issue with
 

00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:12.279
agree with David the issue with
blockchain is not what it is which is

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:12.289

actually I will disagree about the fact

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:28.669
actually I will disagree about the fact
 

00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:31.210
actually I will disagree about the fact
that the technology is old in the sense

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220
that the technology is old in the sense
 

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.750
that the technology is old in the sense
that the blockchain is based on a set of

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760
that the blockchain is based on a set of
 

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.700
that the blockchain is based on a set of
existing technologies which are quite

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:36.710
existing technologies which are quite
 

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.620
existing technologies which are quite
old but the combination of all those

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.630
old but the combination of all those
 

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.480
old but the combination of all those
technologies together is actually quite

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:40.490
technologies together is actually quite
 

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.669
technologies together is actually quite
new it was created it was created with

00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679
new it was created it was created with
 

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:46.840
new it was created it was created with
the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 and the

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:46.850
the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 and the
 

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.060
the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 and the
particularity of this is that the

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.070
particularity of this is that the
 

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.830
particularity of this is that the
blockchain for the first time managed to

problems that will not have been
 

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.010
problems that will not have been
resolved until now except by relying on

resolved until now except by relying on
 

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.899
resolved until now except by relying on
a centralized operator which is the

00:20:58.899 --> 00:20:58.909
a centralized operator which is the
 

00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:01.269
a centralized operator which is the
question of double spending right so if

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:01.279
question of double spending right so if
 

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:03.460
question of double spending right so if
I have a centralized operator and every

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:03.470
I have a centralized operator and every
 

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.260
I have a centralized operator and every
every transaction needs to go through

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:05.270
every transaction needs to go through
 

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.990
every transaction needs to go through
this operator in order to know whether

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000
this operator in order to know whether
 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.029
this operator in order to know whether
it's valid or not then it's quite easy

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039
it's valid or not then it's quite easy
 

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.070
it's valid or not then it's quite easy
to to avoid any kind of double spanning

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080
to to avoid any kind of double spanning
 

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.230
to to avoid any kind of double spanning

it's really difficult to actually
 

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.350
it's really difficult to actually
resolve the problem and the the the

radical innovation of Bitcoin is

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520
radical innovation of Bitcoin is
 

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.340
radical innovation of Bitcoin is
actually that it provided a mechanism by

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.830
which if I sent ten pounds here and ten
pound staff then there is this form of

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840
pound staff then there is this form of
 

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.630

consensus making that will actually

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
consensus making that will actually
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.180

decide event of the earth but valid
 

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.100
decide event of the earth but valid
independently they are but valid so you

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.110
independently they are but valid so you
 

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.600

cannot just say design is correct design

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:43.610
cannot just say design is correct design
 

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.549
cannot just say design is correct design
is incorrect and because the network

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559
is incorrect and because the network
 

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:48.370

which one I actually have emitted false
 

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:52.299
which one I actually have emitted false
then you need this kind of consensus

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:52.309
then you need this kind of consensus
 

00:21:52.309 --> 00:21:53.830
then you need this kind of consensus
mechanism that will actually dictate

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840
mechanism that will actually dictate
 

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.169
mechanism that will actually dictate
whether this one is considered valid of

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:56.179
whether this one is considered valid of
 

00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:58.149
whether this one is considered valid of
this one is considered valid and does it

00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159
this one is considered valid and does it
 

00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.310
this one is considered valid and does it

via that system a way of
disintermediation or does it need a

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:09.430
checking mechanism beyond that if that
 

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.390
checking mechanism beyond that if that
trust breaks down if that consensus is

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400
trust breaks down if that consensus is
 

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.420
trust breaks down if that consensus is
somehow broken is there any need for

Bitcoin the consensus is basically what

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200
Bitcoin the consensus is basically what
 

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.620
Bitcoin the consensus is basically what
dictates the validity of a transaction

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:28.630
dictates the validity of a transaction
 

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.300
dictates the validity of a transaction
right so well first they need to be

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:30.310
right so well first they need to be
 

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.800
right so well first they need to be
mathematically valid and then you need

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:31.810
mathematically valid and then you need
 

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.930
mathematically valid and then you need
to decide which one will actually go now

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:33.940
to decide which one will actually go now
 

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.840
to decide which one will actually go now
of course the the system itself is

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:36.850
of course the the system itself is
 

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.930
of course the the system itself is

actually have control over more than 50%
 

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.920
actually have control over more than 50%
of the computing power in the network

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:46.930
of the computing power in the network
 

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.810
of the computing power in the network
otherwise you can actually to some

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:48.820
otherwise you can actually to some
 

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.540
otherwise you can actually to some
extent double span you can you can crop

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.550
extent double span you can you can crop
 

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.370
extent double span you can you can crop
the network in validating transaction

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:53.380
the network in validating transaction
 

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.580
the network in validating transaction
and then mining on the other side much

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:56.590
and then mining on the other side much
 

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.320
and then mining on the other side much
faster in order to validate also a lot

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.330
faster in order to validate also a lot
 

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.090
faster in order to validate also a lot
of transactions so as long as you stay

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:00.100
of transactions so as long as you stay
 

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.540
of transactions so as long as you stay
under the 50% threshold then at least

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:03.550
under the 50% threshold then at least
 

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.930

problem is is a different problem the

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:08.650
problem is is a different problem the
 

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.910
problem is is a different problem the
problem is what if I make a transaction

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:11.920
problem is what if I make a transaction
 

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.220
problem is what if I make a transaction
and this transaction was not meant to

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.230
and this transaction was not meant to
 

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.130
and this transaction was not meant to
you but to someone else then usually I

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:17.140
you but to someone else then usually I
 

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.290
you but to someone else then usually I
will be able to go to my bank and

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:19.300
will be able to go to my bank and
 

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.270
will be able to go to my bank and
without that transaction whereas here I

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280
without that transaction whereas here I
 

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.310

what will happen governments will take

what will happen governments will take
them over and they'll run them and then

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.779
offenders that sort of thing and you
know ico people I talk to people they

know ico people I talk to people they
 

00:42:11.789 --> 00:42:14.210
know ico people I talk to people they
really want to do this right and they're

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220
really want to do this right and they're
 

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.890
really want to do this right and they're
worried will they bust us I say well no

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900
worried will they bust us I say well no
 

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.450
worried will they bust us I say well no
not if you're honest but there's just so

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460
not if you're honest but there's just so
 

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.549
not if you're honest but there's just so
many dishonest people out there because

00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559
many dishonest people out there because
 

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:22.609
many dishonest people out there because
when they see an exciting new thing this

00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619
when they see an exciting new thing this
 

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:24.710
when they see an exciting new thing this
attracts starry-eyed naive people who

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720
attracts starry-eyed naive people who
 

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.390
attracts starry-eyed naive people who
think this is their ticket to get rich

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400
think this is their ticket to get rich
 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.450
think this is their ticket to get rich
and it then attracts a whole lot of

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460
and it then attracts a whole lot of
 

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.049
and it then attracts a whole lot of
scammers to prey upon them so yeah I

00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:33.059
scammers to prey upon them so yeah I
 

00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:35.480
scammers to prey upon them so yeah I
mean maybe I expect that in a few years

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:35.490
mean maybe I expect that in a few years
 

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.460
mean maybe I expect that in a few years
cryptocurrencies will be a normal

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:37.470
cryptocurrencies will be a normal
 

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.589
cryptocurrencies will be a normal
regulated sort of financial instrument

00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599
regulated sort of financial instrument
 

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:42.109
regulated sort of financial instrument
but a whole lot of people are going to

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119
but a whole lot of people are going to
 

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:44.240
but a whole lot of people are going to
get busted first and because they just

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.250
get busted first and because they just
 

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:48.170
get busted first and because they just
won't be told I Prevert what to David's

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180
won't be told I Prevert what to David's
 

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.029
won't be told I Prevert what to David's
point will we get to will we get to a

00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:53.039
point will we get to will we get to a
 

00:42:53.039 --> 00:42:56.390
point will we get to will we get to a
regulated blockchain system or does that

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400
regulated blockchain system or does that
 

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.370
regulated blockchain system or does that
defeat the point of blotter you said

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380
defeat the point of blotter you said
 

00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.980
defeat the point of blotter you said
there'll always be a need for lawyers

00:42:59.980 --> 00:42:59.990
there'll always be a need for lawyers
 

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.809
there'll always be a need for lawyers
can you control it can you regulate it

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819
can you control it can you regulate it
 

00:43:02.819 --> 00:43:05.029
can you control it can you regulate it
in some manner which means that some of

00:43:05.029 --> 00:43:05.039
in some manner which means that some of
 

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:07.069
in some manner which means that some of
the attacks that David is making upon it

00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079
the attacks that David is making upon it
 

00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:09.620
the attacks that David is making upon it
is it is a world for criminals basically

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:09.630
is it is a world for criminals basically
 

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:15.740
is it is a world for criminals basically
to buy to work is there or is there a

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:15.750
to buy to work is there or is there a
 

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.720
to buy to work is there or is there a
way that blockchain can be regulated

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:19.730
way that blockchain can be regulated
 

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.089
way that blockchain can be regulated
which means that some of those concerns

00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099
which means that some of those concerns
 

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:25.230
which means that some of those concerns
that are raised by David can be

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240
that are raised by David can be
 

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.350
that are raised by David can be
well I'm putting my heart of a lawyer

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:29.360
well I'm putting my heart of a lawyer
 

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.070
well I'm putting my heart of a lawyer
here yeah um I think anyhow you never

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:33.080
here yeah um I think anyhow you never
 

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.990
here yeah um I think anyhow you never
regulate a technology it doesn't mean

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000
regulate a technology it doesn't mean
 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.330
regulate a technology it doesn't mean
anything it's you regulate a particular

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:37.340
anything it's you regulate a particular
 

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.210
anything it's you regulate a particular
use application of the technology and

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:40.220
use application of the technology and
 

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.240
use application of the technology and
again what you regulate is first we need

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.250
again what you regulate is first we need
 

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.800
again what you regulate is first we need
to look at what the applications are and

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:44.810
to look at what the applications are and
 

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.870
to look at what the applications are and
then you regulate when is derive into

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880
then you regulate when is derive into
 

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.190
then you regulate when is derive into
something that is against public health

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200
something that is against public health
 

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.360
something that is against public health
morality now the challenge is that like

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:52.370
morality now the challenge is that like
 

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.730
morality now the challenge is that like
if we actually look at the dinner chef

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:54.740
if we actually look at the dinner chef
 

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.400
if we actually look at the dinner chef
at of like the early internet days we

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:57.410
at of like the early internet days we
 

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.740
at of like the early internet days we
could see that there was all these same

00:43:59.740 --> 00:43:59.750
could see that there was all these same
 

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.570
could see that there was all these same
very similar negative about with

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:01.580
very similar negative about with
 

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.730
very similar negative about with
creating this kind of like completely

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:03.740
creating this kind of like completely
 

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.860
creating this kind of like completely
decentralized network and like the

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:05.870
decentralized network and like the
 

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.630
decentralized network and like the
Declaration of Independence of the

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640
Declaration of Independence of the
 

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.000
Declaration of Independence of the
cyberspace government's not having the

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.010
cyberspace government's not having the
 

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.980
cyberspace government's not having the
heart nor the capacity to actually exert

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:11.990
heart nor the capacity to actually exert
 

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.480
heart nor the capacity to actually exert
the sovereignty over the internet and

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:13.490
the sovereignty over the internet and
 

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:15.700
the sovereignty over the internet and
then very soon we have noticed that

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:15.710
then very soon we have noticed that
 

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.890
then very soon we have noticed that
actually it's not that difficult to

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:17.900
actually it's not that difficult to
 

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.870
actually it's not that difficult to
regulate the internet because there is a

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880
regulate the internet because there is a
 

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.430
regulate the internet because there is a
bunch of intermediaries and if we

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440
bunch of intermediaries and if we
 

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.350
bunch of intermediaries and if we
regulate the intermediaries then we can

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:23.360
regulate the intermediaries then we can
 

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.180
regulate the intermediaries then we can
indirectly regulate the people

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.190
indirectly regulate the people
 

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.950
indirectly regulate the people
interacting on those platforms now the

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960
interacting on those platforms now the
 

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.840
interacting on those platforms now the
interesting question with blockchain is

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:28.850
interesting question with blockchain is
 

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.270
interesting question with blockchain is
that we actually lose this figure of the

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280
that we actually lose this figure of the
 

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.010
that we actually lose this figure of the
intermediary which is probably the most

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.020
intermediary which is probably the most
 

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.100
intermediary which is probably the most
efficient means of regulation on the on

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:36.110
efficient means of regulation on the on
 

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.780
efficient means of regulation on the on
the cyberspace and so the question is

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:37.790
the cyberspace and so the question is
 

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.300
the cyberspace and so the question is
does it mean that we are actually you

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:40.310
does it mean that we are actually you
 

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.970
does it mean that we are actually you
know actually materializing those early

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:42.980
know actually materializing those early
 

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.920
know actually materializing those early
dreams of crypto anarchy and things like

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:44.930
dreams of crypto anarchy and things like
 

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.020
dreams of crypto anarchy and things like
this well probably not because there is

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:47.030
this well probably not because there is
 

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.190
this well probably not because there is
actually different kinds of

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200
actually different kinds of
 

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.170
actually different kinds of
intermediaries alright so you have the

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:50.180
intermediaries alright so you have the
 

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.930
intermediaries alright so you have the
miners you have the developers you have

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:52.940
miners you have the developers you have
 

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.840
miners you have the developers you have
the validators you have the exchanges

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:55.850
the validators you have the exchanges
 

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:57.640
the validators you have the exchanges
you have like the blockchain Explorer so

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:57.650
you have like the blockchain Explorer so
 

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.950
you have like the blockchain Explorer so
there is a bunch of new intermediate of

00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960
there is a bunch of new intermediate of
 

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.030
there is a bunch of new intermediate of
events just like the commercial

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040
events just like the commercial
 

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.550
events just like the commercial
operators so you cannot regulate the

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:03.560
operators so you cannot regulate the
 

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.780
operators so you cannot regulate the
technology and you cannot regulate

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:04.790
technology and you cannot regulate
 

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.940
technology and you cannot regulate
Bitcoin and you cannot stop Bitcoin but

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:06.950
Bitcoin and you cannot stop Bitcoin but
 

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.800
Bitcoin and you cannot stop Bitcoin but
what you can do is actually implement

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:08.810
what you can do is actually implement
 

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.020
what you can do is actually implement
specific regulations saying that no

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:11.030
specific regulations saying that no
 

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.940
specific regulations saying that no
commercial actor in a particular

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:12.950
commercial actor in a particular
 

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.240
commercial actor in a particular
jurisdiction can accept Bitcoin you can

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.250
jurisdiction can accept Bitcoin you can
 

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.640
jurisdiction can accept Bitcoin you can
require exchanges of whatever operator

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:18.650
require exchanges of whatever operator
 

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.620
require exchanges of whatever operator
is actually dealing with bitcoins to

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:20.630
is actually dealing with bitcoins to
 

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.290
is actually dealing with bitcoins to
actually fulfill very extensive amounts

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:23.300
actually fulfill very extensive amounts
 

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.160
actually fulfill very extensive amounts
of formalities

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:24.170
of formalities
 

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.530
of formalities
so that all the small startups need to

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:26.540
so that all the small startups need to
 

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.940
so that all the small startups need to
run away and then the only of those

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:27.950
run away and then the only of those
 

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.040
run away and then the only of those
large large institution that you can

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:30.050
large large institution that you can
 

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.530
large large institution that you can
actually very easily regulate so the

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:32.540
actually very easily regulate so the
 

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.960
actually very easily regulate so the
game nowadays is actually to identify

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:34.970
game nowadays is actually to identify
 

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.480
game nowadays is actually to identify
what are those new avenues without the

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:37.490
what are those new avenues without the
 

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.330
what are those new avenues without the
new levels the

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:38.340
new levels the
 

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.370
new levels the
exist on which you can actually affect

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380
exist on which you can actually affect
 

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.800
exist on which you can actually affect
the use of the technology knowing that

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:42.810
the use of the technology knowing that
 

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.990
the use of the technology knowing that
you can never actually stop the

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000
you can never actually stop the
 

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.270
you can never actually stop the
technology itself right and so as long

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280
technology itself right and so as long
 

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.060

the imitability of it the distributed

the imitability of it the distributed

consensus and according to the vision of
 

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.820

distributed consensus then you can

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:01.830
distributed consensus then you can

criminals and not it's not actually
decentralized a12 if you look at what's

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020
decentralized a12 if you look at what's
 

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.109
decentralized a12 if you look at what's
happened to Bitcoin it's it's run by

00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119
happened to Bitcoin it's it's run by
 

00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:33.859
happened to Bitcoin it's it's run by
three platforms and actually all all

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:33.869
three platforms and actually all all
 

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:35.780
three platforms and actually all all
things that are supposedly decentralized

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:35.790
things that are supposedly decentralized
 

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.520
things that are supposedly decentralized
in the end end up

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:37.530
in the end end up
 

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.599
in the end end up
centralized well of course bitcoin is

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:41.609
centralized well of course bitcoin is
 

00:49:41.609 --> 00:49:43.400
centralized well of course bitcoin is
used by different types of people but

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:43.410
used by different types of people but
 

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.710
used by different types of people but
but it's also honest to say that most

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720
but it's also honest to say that most
 

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.990
but it's also honest to say that most
like I think that the research was like

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000
like I think that the research was like
 

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.250
like I think that the research was like
97% 98% is used by legitimate businesses

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260
97% 98% is used by legitimate businesses
 

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.500
97% 98% is used by legitimate businesses
to conduct legitimate so it's a little

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:54.510
to conduct legitimate so it's a little
 

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.510
to conduct legitimate so it's a little
bit of fuss around the fact that it's

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520
bit of fuss around the fact that it's
 

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.670
bit of fuss around the fact that it's
only used by criminals actually say we

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680
only used by criminals actually say we
 

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.640
only used by criminals actually say we
pick us overseas us u.s. dollar is

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:01.650
pick us overseas us u.s. dollar is
 

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.500
pick us overseas us u.s. dollar is
probably used much by much more

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:03.510
probably used much by much more
 

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.130
probably used much by much more
criminals

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140

bitcoin is right by I probably three

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:06.990
bitcoin is right by I probably three
 

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.530
bitcoin is right by I probably three
magnitudes by now so that's one of the

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540
magnitudes by now so that's one of the
 

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.780
magnitudes by now so that's one of the
things and the other was centralization

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:11.790
things and the other was centralization
 

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:15.800
things and the other was centralization
sensation of decentralization only ever

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:15.810
sensation of decentralization only ever
 

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.080
sensation of decentralization only ever
exists until something becomes powerful

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:18.090
exists until something becomes powerful
 

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.150
exists until something becomes powerful
and then it becomes centralized because

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160
and then it becomes centralized because
 

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.120
and then it becomes centralized because
in the end there becomes an operating

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:23.130
in the end there becomes an operating
 

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.970
in the end there becomes an operating
force which which becomes centralized

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980
force which which becomes centralized
 

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.550
force which which becomes centralized
yeah well you see that the developers

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560
yeah well you see that the developers
 

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.960
yeah well you see that the developers
are really fighting this back in a way

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:29.970
are really fighting this back in a way
 

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:31.280
are really fighting this back in a way
they are offering all these types of

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:31.290
they are offering all these types of
 

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:32.990
they are offering all these types of
different cryptocurrencies which is

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000
different cryptocurrencies which is
 

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.060
different cryptocurrencies which is
harder to centralize so we cannot

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.070
harder to centralize so we cannot
 

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.980
harder to centralize so we cannot
develop a single machine that can mine

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:36.990
develop a single machine that can mine
 

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:40.070
develop a single machine that can mine
it and you can also see that even though

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:40.080
it and you can also see that even though
 

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.320

the players and the mining is getting

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:42.330
the players and the mining is getting
 

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.270
the players and the mining is getting
centralized there is a great incentive

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280
centralized there is a great incentive
 

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.910
centralized there is a great incentive
to actually keep Bitcoin immutable the

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920
to actually keep Bitcoin immutable the
 

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.340
to actually keep Bitcoin immutable the
incentive to keep it as it is and don't

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:49.350
incentive to keep it as it is and don't
 

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.100
incentive to keep it as it is and don't
steal even if your biggest miner don't

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.110
steal even if your biggest miner don't
 

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.080
steal even if your biggest miner don't
steal from the network from some

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:54.090
steal from the network from some
 

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.150
steal from the network from some
particle addresses because of course you

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160
particle addresses because of course you
 

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.190
particle addresses because of course you
would damage the the thing that you are

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200
would damage the the thing that you are
 

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.500
would damage the the thing that you are
working for is there so I don't think

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:00.510
working for is there so I don't think
 

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.540
working for is there so I don't think
it's a big problem there was a huge

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:02.550
it's a big problem there was a huge
 

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.850
it's a big problem there was a huge
debate between the fork when the Bitcoin

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:04.860
debate between the fork when the Bitcoin
 

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.920
debate between the fork when the Bitcoin
cash fort and and to address the the

cash fort and and to address the the
 

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:11.210
cash fort and and to address the the
scalability of Bitcoin and there are

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220
scalability of Bitcoin and there are
 

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.160
scalability of Bitcoin and there are
people that didn't agree with it it's

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:13.170
people that didn't agree with it it's
 

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.200
people that didn't agree with it it's
also quite centralized but now both

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:15.210
also quite centralized but now both
 

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.090

just wanted to mention one thing then

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:18.450
just wanted to mention one thing then
 

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.630
just wanted to mention one thing then
when aetherium fork the interesting

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640
when aetherium fork the interesting
 

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.700
when aetherium fork the interesting
thing was that actually the people that

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:22.710
thing was that actually the people that
 

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.740
thing was that actually the people that
didn't want to fork it that didn't want

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:24.750
didn't want to fork it that didn't want
 

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.830
didn't want to fork it that didn't want
to go and take the money from the person

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:27.840
to go and take the money from the person
 

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.140
to go and take the money from the person
that stole those funds you know they

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.150
that stole those funds you know they
 

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:31.700
that stole those funds you know they
were the legitimate ones because

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:31.710
were the legitimate ones because
 

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.710
were the legitimate ones because
although at the beginning of that Dow

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720
although at the beginning of that Dow
 

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.230
although at the beginning of that Dow
contract was written that the code is

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240
contract was written that the code is
 

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.890
contract was written that the code is
the law and the hacker didn't change the

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900
the law and the hacker didn't change the
 

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.320
the law and the hacker didn't change the
law he just used as it was written right

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:42.330
law he just used as it was written right
 

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.650
law he just used as it was written right
so when you look now in theory 'm the

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660
so when you look now in theory 'm the
 

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.840

people that actually kept all it the old

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:47.850
people that actually kept all it the old
 

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.570
people that actually kept all it the old
way they were the ones that did it

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:50.580
way they were the ones that did it
 

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.510
way they were the ones that did it
legally right and the the consensus

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520
legally right and the the consensus
 

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.210
legally right and the the consensus
actually to take money back was against

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220
actually to take money back was against
 

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.980
actually to take money back was against
the law that was set which is

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:57.990
the law that was set which is
 

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:02.979
the law that was set which is
interesting

00:52:02.979 --> 00:52:02.989
 

00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:06.019
because I mean in in contract law at

00:52:06.019 --> 00:52:06.029
because I mean in in contract law at
 

00:52:06.029 --> 00:52:07.670
because I mean in in contract law at
least you have like the wording of the

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680
least you have like the wording of the
 

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.099
least you have like the wording of the
contract which says one thing but it's

00:52:10.099 --> 00:52:10.109
contract which says one thing but it's
 

00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:11.930
contract which says one thing but it's
actually just a representation of the

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940
actually just a representation of the
 

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.029
actually just a representation of the
intention of the parties and what

00:52:14.029 --> 00:52:14.039
intention of the parties and what
 

00:52:14.039 --> 00:52:15.739
intention of the parties and what
actually count what he's being enforced

00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:15.749
actually count what he's being enforced
 

00:52:15.749 --> 00:52:17.120
actually count what he's being enforced
is always the intention of the parties

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.130
is always the intention of the parties
 

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.549
is always the intention of the parties
so under how many case with paper-based

00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559
so under how many case with paper-based
 

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:20.930
so under how many case with paper-based
contract in which you have something

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940
contract in which you have something
 

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.670
contract in which you have something
frightened but that is completely not

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680
frightened but that is completely not
 

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.559
frightened but that is completely not
understandable and if the judge decides

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:24.569
understandable and if the judge decides
 

00:52:24.569 --> 00:52:27.259
understandable and if the judge decides
that indeed the parties did not in turn

00:52:27.259 --> 00:52:27.269
that indeed the parties did not in turn
 

00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:28.819
that indeed the parties did not in turn
that way even if it's written on the

00:52:28.819 --> 00:52:28.829
that way even if it's written on the
 

00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:30.739
that way even if it's written on the
contract it's not it's not going to be

00:52:30.739 --> 00:52:30.749
contract it's not it's not going to be
 

00:52:30.749 --> 00:52:32.420
contract it's not it's not going to be
on fast because the intention is what

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:32.430
on fast because the intention is what
 

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.370
on fast because the intention is what
matter so in the case of the Dow the

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380
matter so in the case of the Dow the
 

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.019
matter so in the case of the Dow the
intention of the party was obviously not

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:36.029
intention of the party was obviously not
 

00:52:36.029 --> 00:52:38.210
intention of the party was obviously not
to have the homeowner taken away by an

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220
to have the homeowner taken away by an
 

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.249
to have the homeowner taken away by an
attacker so of course it has never came

00:52:40.249 --> 00:52:40.259
attacker so of course it has never came
 

00:52:40.259 --> 00:52:41.930
attacker so of course it has never came
to court so we don't know what the judge

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940
to court so we don't know what the judge
 

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.489
to court so we don't know what the judge
will not say but there is a high

00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:43.499
will not say but there is a high
 

00:52:43.499 --> 00:52:45.769
will not say but there is a high
probability that a judge will say that

00:52:45.769 --> 00:52:45.779
probability that a judge will say that
 

00:52:45.779 --> 00:52:47.539
probability that a judge will say that
because the intention of the party did

00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:47.549
because the intention of the party did
 

00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:49.190
because the intention of the party did
not reflect the working of the court

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200
not reflect the working of the court
 

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.979
not reflect the working of the court
therefore the actual real legal contract

00:52:51.979 --> 00:52:51.989
therefore the actual real legal contract
 

00:52:51.989 --> 00:52:53.720
therefore the actual real legal contract
that was created was the one that did

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:53.730
that was created was the one that did
 

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:57.130
that was created was the one that did
not include that feature as Primavera

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:05.630
you're saying Jaime what will be the
hierarchical source to govern this new

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640
hierarchical source to govern this new
 

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.430
hierarchical source to govern this new
sort of network you know we have all

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440
sort of network you know we have all
 

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.989
sort of network you know we have all
these threats from criminals or from

01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:08.999
these threats from criminals or from
 

01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:11.359
these threats from criminals or from
people who will music legitimately what

01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:11.369
people who will music legitimately what
 

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.160
people who will music legitimately what
will be the outside authority that

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:13.170
will be the outside authority that
 

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:17.299
will be the outside authority that
governs it Jaime they're number four and

01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:17.309
governs it Jaime they're number four and
 

01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:19.880
governs it Jaime they're number four and
then number three in the back yeah sorry

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:19.890
then number three in the back yeah sorry
 

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:25.160
then number three in the back yeah sorry
oh I yeah I guy I agree that is what

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.170
oh I yeah I guy I agree that is what
 

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.170
oh I yeah I guy I agree that is what
tends to happen and I think governments

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180
tends to happen and I think governments
 

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.349
tends to happen and I think governments
will regulate it I can't tell you

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359
will regulate it I can't tell you
 

01:04:30.359 --> 01:04:33.049
will regulate it I can't tell you
exactly what that is going to be I've

01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059
exactly what that is going to be I've
 

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:35.059
exactly what that is going to be I've
mentioned before a couple of examples to

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:35.069
mentioned before a couple of examples to
 

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:39.890
mentioned before a couple of examples to
do with simple things the way that you

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900
do with simple things the way that you
 

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.870
do with simple things the way that you
can stop the technology of course

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880
can stop the technology of course
 

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.819
can stop the technology of course
everyone says you can't but is to just

01:04:43.819 --> 01:04:43.829
everyone says you can't but is to just
 

01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:47.450
everyone says you can't but is to just
ban its use I mean so to say sorry

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460

that's the prospect in ten fifteen

I can most likely see this I don't want
 

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.030
I can most likely see this I don't want
that to happen but the most likely way I

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040
that to happen but the most likely way I
 

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.590
that to happen but the most likely way I
can see this being controlled by

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:15.600
can see this being controlled by
 

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.630

the problem with most existing

the problem with most existing
 

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.070
the problem with most existing
production based systems is that they

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:28.080
production based systems is that they
 

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.510
production based systems is that they
are so you have a decentralized

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520
are so you have a decentralized
 

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.790
are so you have a decentralized
structure and you to plug on top of that

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:31.800
structure and you to plug on top of that
 

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.440
structure and you to plug on top of that
at the centralized government structure

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:33.450
at the centralized government structure
 

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:35.900
at the centralized government structure
hug but the closest thing to a

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:37.860
distribute the governance system that we
 

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.010
distribute the governance system that we
know today is actually the market and so

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020
know today is actually the market and so
 

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.080
know today is actually the market and so

deduction based system so far they

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920
deduction based system so far they
 

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.770
deduction based system so far they
implement a market-based government

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780
implement a market-based government
 

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:49.960
implement a market-based government
system and but as we have seen in

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:49.970
system and but as we have seen in
 

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.550
system and but as we have seen in
hundreds of year and as like if you have

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:52.560
hundreds of year and as like if you have
 

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.870
hundreds of year and as like if you have
a market-based system that is not

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880
a market-based system that is not
 

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.550
a market-based system that is not
protected to some extent like the

disappear and eventually this entropy

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:00.870
disappear and eventually this entropy
 

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:03.110
disappear and eventually this entropy
tool of centralization because people

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:03.120
tool of centralization because people
 

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.610
tool of centralization because people
are accumulating resources and using

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:04.620
are accumulating resources and using
 

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:05.840
are accumulating resources and using
those resources in order to accumulate

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:05.850
those resources in order to accumulate
 

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.120
those resources in order to accumulate
more resources so the problem today and

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.130
more resources so the problem today and
 

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.650
more resources so the problem today and
again this goes back to the governance

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660
again this goes back to the governance
 

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.930
again this goes back to the governance
question as long as we rely on

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940
question as long as we rely on
 

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.120
question as long as we rely on
market-based governments and that's the

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.130
market-based governments and that's the
 

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.620
market-based governments and that's the
case of Bitcoin with the mining power

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:15.630
case of Bitcoin with the mining power
 

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.930
case of Bitcoin with the mining power
it's the case of the Dow which was with

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940
it's the case of the Dow which was with
 

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.730
it's the case of the Dow which was with
like the amount of token that you hold

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740
like the amount of token that you hold
 

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.040
like the amount of token that you hold
and so far then of course we will always

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:22.050
and so far then of course we will always
 

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.400
and so far then of course we will always
unless we create a 90 centralization

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:25.410
unless we create a 90 centralization

governance is going to always evolve

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:30.870
governance is going to always evolve
 

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.360
governance is going to always evolve
into a centralized system and the

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:32.370
into a centralized system and the
 

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.010
into a centralized system and the
challenge today and this is what we're

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020
challenge today and this is what we're
 

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.960
challenge today and this is what we're
working with Dow stack with Aragon and

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:35.970
working with Dow stack with Aragon and
 

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.760
working with Dow stack with Aragon and
things like this is how do we actually

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:37.770
things like this is how do we actually
 

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.280
things like this is how do we actually
design new mechanism of governance which

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:40.290
design new mechanism of governance which
 

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.530
design new mechanism of governance which
are not market-based which are not

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:42.540
are not market-based which are not
 

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.450
are not market-based which are not
plutocratic based but which actually

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460
plutocratic based but which actually
 

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.550
plutocratic based but which actually
implement a real distributed governance

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:46.560

always be some kind of dynamics that you
 

01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:52.790
always be some kind of dynamics that you
cannot control but that is not

my question for primavera is that you

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:15.930
my question for primavera is that you
 

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:18.530
my question for primavera is that you
mentioned earlier on at the danger if

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:18.540
mentioned earlier on at the danger if
 

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.220

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:24.060
blockchain could you just explain that a
 

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.940
blockchain could you just explain that a
little bit more

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:25.950
little bit more
 

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:28.370
little bit more
according to like the little example

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380
according to like the little example
 

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.470
according to like the little example
that I have given so the idea is that

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480
that I have given so the idea is that
 

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.910
that I have given so the idea is that
everyone is racing to create

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920
everyone is racing to create
 

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.380
everyone is racing to create
transactions into a block and then they

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:36.390
transactions into a block and then they
 

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.090
transactions into a block and then they
need to find the right combination in

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:38.100
need to find the right combination in
 

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.110
need to find the right combination in
order to attach it so the basically it's

01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:42.120
order to attach it so the basically it's
 

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.880
order to attach it so the basically it's
a probabilistic thing so you never know

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:43.890
a probabilistic thing so you never know
 

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.440
a probabilistic thing so you never know
who it's going to be but if you have a

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:45.450
who it's going to be but if you have a
 

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.940
who it's going to be but if you have a
lot of hashing problem you have a higher

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:46.950
lot of hashing problem you have a higher
 

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:49.280
lot of hashing problem you have a higher
probability to find the right solution

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:49.290
probability to find the right solution
 

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:51.170
probability to find the right solution
to attach the block now the problem if

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180
to attach the block now the problem if
 

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.990
to attach the block now the problem if
you have more than 50% is that I'm gonna

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000
you have more than 50% is that I'm gonna
 

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.790
you have more than 50% is that I'm gonna
I'm gonna try and mine a particular

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:55.800
I'm gonna try and mine a particular
 

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.200
I'm gonna try and mine a particular
block with a transaction I'm gonna

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:57.210
block with a transaction I'm gonna
 

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:59.780
block with a transaction I'm gonna
attach it right now at the same time and

01:07:59.780 --> 01:07:59.790
attach it right now at the same time and
 

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:04.030
attach it right now at the same time and
keep mining another and an alternative

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:04.040
keep mining another and an alternative
 

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.470
keep mining another and an alternative
discussion of the chain in which I'm

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480
discussion of the chain in which I'm
 

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.260
discussion of the chain in which I'm
spending the same ten dollars to someone

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:09.270
spending the same ten dollars to someone
 

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:10.850
spending the same ten dollars to someone
else right so this one has been

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:10.860
else right so this one has been
 

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.710
else right so this one has been
validated because it has been mined and

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720
validated because it has been mined and
 

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.660
validated because it has been mined and
then it keeps evolving but if I have

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:14.670
then it keeps evolving but if I have
 

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.150
then it keeps evolving but if I have
more than 50% when I create this piece

01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160
more than 50% when I create this piece
 

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.120
more than 50% when I create this piece
of cashel I can go faster and because

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:20.130

bifurcation everyone will always follow

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:28.260
bifurcation everyone will always follow
 

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.890
bifurcation everyone will always follow
the longest chain so if here I'm not

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900
the longest chain so if here I'm not
 

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.470
the longest chain so if here I'm not
touching two Lots then both of them are

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480
touching two Lots then both of them are
 

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.960
touching two Lots then both of them are
equal if not that is one lock here

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:35.970
equal if not that is one lock here
 

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:37.670
equal if not that is one lock here
another lock here and this one has an

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:37.680
another lock here and this one has an
 

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.650
another lock here and this one has an
auto lock after then everyone will

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660
auto lock after then everyone will
 

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.450
auto lock after then everyone will
follow this as being the valued chain

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460
follow this as being the valued chain
 

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.700
follow this as being the valued chain
which means that this distant ten

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:43.710
which means that this distant ten
 

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:45.710
which means that this distant ten
dollars that I have spent here has now

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:45.720
dollars that I have spent here has now
 

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.260
dollars that I have spent here has now
been spent and accepted but at the same

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:48.270
been spent and accepted but at the same
 

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:49.490
been spent and accepted but at the same
time now they don't exist anymore

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500
time now they don't exist anymore
 

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.530
time now they don't exist anymore
because now I shift to this bifurcation

01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540
because now I shift to this bifurcation
 

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.870
because now I shift to this bifurcation
but so the ability of having more than

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880
but so the ability of having more than
 

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.630
but so the ability of having more than
50% enable you to mine faster than the

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640
50% enable you to mine faster than the
 

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.580
50% enable you to mine faster than the
rest of the network and therefore being

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:58.590
rest of the network and therefore being
 

01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:02.030
rest of the network and therefore being
able to speed up and modify while

01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040
able to speed up and modify while
 

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.250
able to speed up and modify while
bifurcate and create a bifurcation that

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:04.260
bifurcate and create a bifurcation that
 

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.710
bifurcate and create a bifurcation that
is longer than the Courant chain so we

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:06.720
is longer than the Courant chain so we
 

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720
is longer than the Courant chain so we
need antitrust we need antitrust yeah

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:08.730
need antitrust we need antitrust yeah
 

01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:11.930

also talked a lot about blockchain and

01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:25.109
also talked a lot about blockchain and
 

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:27.950
also talked a lot about blockchain and
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies what we

01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies what we
 

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.660
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies what we
haven't talked about is the use of

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:29.670
haven't talked about is the use of
 

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.809
haven't talked about is the use of
blockchain technology if you use the

01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819
blockchain technology if you use the
 

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:34.910
blockchain technology if you use the
term distributed ledger technology to

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:43.290
which was not hacked in now how many
years nine years nine years without any

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:43.300
years nine years nine years without any
 

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.420
years nine years nine years without any
major flaw which is pretty a very big

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:47.430
 

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:49.950
difference that you can actually look at

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960
difference that you can actually look at
 

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.350
difference that you can actually look at
the code and you like someone like it's

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360
the code and you like someone like it's
 

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.610
the code and you like someone like it's
kind of the open source model you know

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:53.620
kind of the open source model you know
 

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.470
kind of the open source model you know
that someone can look at it and then if

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480
that someone can look at it and then if
 

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.270
that someone can look at it and then if
you trust that's enough eyes are on this

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280
you trust that's enough eyes are on this
 

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.190
you trust that's enough eyes are on this
thing the difference with the existing

01:14:59.190 --> 01:14:59.200
thing the difference with the existing
 

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.250
thing the difference with the existing
system is that I think the first problem

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:02.260
system is that I think the first problem
 

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.870
system is that I think the first problem
is going to be with judges when they're

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880
is going to be with judges when they're
 

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.970
is going to be with judges when they're
looking at complicated proofs and some

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:05.980
looking at complicated proofs and some
 

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.170
looking at complicated proofs and some
will say well I definitely owned it

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:07.180
will say well I definitely owned it
 

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.610
will say well I definitely owned it
because look at this blockchain case

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:08.620
because look at this blockchain case
 

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.080
because look at this blockchain case
well no you didn't but and they don't

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.090
well no you didn't but and they don't
 

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.760
well no you didn't but and they don't
understand what on earth it is so the

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:11.770
understand what on earth it is so the
 

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:14.010
understand what on earth it is so the
first sort of test cases of this I think

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:14.020
first sort of test cases of this I think
 

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.600
first sort of test cases of this I think
will be in the courts when the judge is

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:15.610
will be in the courts when the judge is
 

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.850
will be in the courts when the judge is
try to work out well why should we trust

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:17.860
try to work out well why should we trust
 

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.820
try to work out well why should we trust
a blockchain based system exactly yeah

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:20.830
a blockchain based system exactly yeah
 

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.380
a blockchain based system exactly yeah
but I think I can see that we can get

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:22.390
but I think I can see that we can get
 

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:23.940
but I think I can see that we can get
round so that had cases but have you

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:23.950
round so that had cases but have you
 

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:27.930
round so that had cases but have you
done cases I mean did our would have

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:27.940
done cases I mean did our would have
 

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.520
done cases I mean did our would have
been a wonderful case but it doesn't

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:29.530
been a wonderful case but it doesn't
 

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.560
been a wonderful case but it doesn't
happen we did a moot court though and

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:31.570
happen we did a moot court though and
 

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.810
happen we did a moot court though and
that was fascinating because we had two

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:33.820
that was fascinating because we had two
 

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.390
that was fascinating because we had two
lawyers arguing one counts a particular

of our case about the DA and we had to

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:38.710
of our case about the DA and we had to
 

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.560
of our case about the DA and we had to
judge and the to judge eventually

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:40.570
judge and the to judge eventually
 

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.030
judge and the to judge eventually
actually refused to give a verdict

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040
actually refused to give a verdict
 

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.620
actually refused to give a verdict
because they just said that they could

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:43.630
because they just said that they could
 

01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:46.160
because they just said that they could
not understand anything

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:46.170
not understand anything
 

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:49.110

possibility that crypto currencies could

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:29.130
possibility that crypto currencies could
 

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:31.430
possibility that crypto currencies could
undermine the nation-state as we know it

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440
undermine the nation-state as we know it
 

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.899
undermine the nation-state as we know it
now excellent and um hi I was just

01:21:35.899 --> 01:21:35.909
now excellent and um hi I was just
 

01:21:35.909 --> 01:21:37.669
now excellent and um hi I was just
wondering if you if you think that the

01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679
wondering if you if you think that the
 

01:21:37.679 --> 01:21:39.290
wondering if you if you think that the
sort of potential of blockchain is going

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300
sort of potential of blockchain is going
 

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.000
sort of potential of blockchain is going
to be sort of ruins before it gets there

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:41.010
to be sort of ruins before it gets there
 

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:42.620
to be sort of ruins before it gets there
the reason I'm asking is if you think

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:42.630
the reason I'm asking is if you think
 

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.700
the reason I'm asking is if you think
about things like currency

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:43.710
about things like currency
 

01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:46.160
about things like currency
cryptocurrency Bitcoin it's essentially

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:46.170
cryptocurrency Bitcoin it's essentially
 

01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:47.569
cryptocurrency Bitcoin it's essentially
not a currency anymore it's a commodity

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:47.579
not a currency anymore it's a commodity
 

01:21:47.579 --> 01:21:49.279
not a currency anymore it's a commodity
so the people who are you know making

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:49.289
so the people who are you know making
 

01:21:49.289 --> 01:21:51.319
so the people who are you know making
money offer are the bankers who we were

01:21:51.319 --> 01:21:51.329
money offer are the bankers who we were
 

01:21:51.329 --> 01:21:53.720
money offer are the bankers who we were
meant to kind of get around by using the

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:53.730
meant to kind of get around by using the
 

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:55.279
meant to kind of get around by using the
crypto currency in the first place

01:21:55.279 --> 01:21:55.289
crypto currency in the first place
 

01:21:55.289 --> 01:21:56.899
crypto currency in the first place
so if we're thinking about you know

01:21:56.899 --> 01:21:56.909
so if we're thinking about you know
 

01:21:56.909 --> 01:21:59.390
so if we're thinking about you know
using blockchain to solve that you know

01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400
using blockchain to solve that you know
 

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.060
using blockchain to solve that you know
patient records in the NHS do you think

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:02.070
patient records in the NHS do you think
 

01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:04.129
patient records in the NHS do you think
it's gonna be sort of ruined before we

01:22:04.129 --> 01:22:04.139
it's gonna be sort of ruined before we
 

01:22:04.139 --> 01:22:06.739
it's gonna be sort of ruined before we
even get there yes so David you need to

01:22:06.739 --> 01:22:06.749
even get there yes so David you need to
 

01:22:06.749 --> 01:22:08.209
even get there yes so David you need to
answer the first one what would be a

answer the first one what would be a
 

01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:10.220
answer the first one what would be a
good thing that blockchain could solve

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:10.230
good thing that blockchain could solve
 

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.959
good thing that blockchain could solve
which touches on the earlier gentleman's

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:11.969
which touches on the earlier gentleman's
 

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.430
which touches on the earlier gentleman's
question about what are the what are the

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440
question about what are the what are the
 

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.989
question about what are the what are the
legitimate things that blockchain could

01:22:14.989 --> 01:22:14.999
legitimate things that blockchain could
 

01:22:14.999 --> 01:22:15.709
legitimate things that blockchain could
help us with

01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719
help us with
 

01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:17.450
help us with
I think the good ending here is the one

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460
I think the good ending here is the one
 

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.759
I think the good ending here is the one
that's happening which is not things

01:22:19.759 --> 01:22:19.769
that's happening which is not things
 

01:22:19.769 --> 01:22:21.259
that's happening which is not things
that are full decentralized

01:22:21.259 --> 01:22:21.269
that are full decentralized
 

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.450
that are full decentralized
cryptocurrency style systems but just

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460
cryptocurrency style systems but just
 

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.830
cryptocurrency style systems but just
having that append-only ledger

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840
having that append-only ledger
 

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.720
having that append-only ledger
which is really cool and it's the data

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:27.730
which is really cool and it's the data
 

01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:28.800
which is really cool and it's the data
structure that's good

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:28.810
structure that's good
 

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:31.140
structure that's good
but the distributing of systems is

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:31.150
but the distributing of systems is
 

01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:31.860
but the distributing of systems is
something

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:31.870
something
 

01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:34.110
something
it loses efficiency and this means in

01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120
it loses efficiency and this means in
 

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.630
it loses efficiency and this means in
practice it can't compete that well so

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:36.640
practice it can't compete that well so
 

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.490
practice it can't compete that well so
what we'll see is we'll see just the

01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:38.500
what we'll see is we'll see just the
 

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.440
what we'll see is we'll see just the
ledger marketed with brand-name

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:40.450
ledger marketed with brand-name
 

01:22:40.450 --> 01:22:43.200
ledger marketed with brand-name
blockchain and I think that will be the

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:43.210
blockchain and I think that will be the
 

01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:46.160
blockchain and I think that will be the
good ending on the technological side so

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:46.170
good ending on the technological side so
 

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.970
good ending on the technological side so
Provera what do you think of that what

01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:47.980
Provera what do you think of that what
 

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.860
Provera what do you think of that what
being what what about a good thing a

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:49.870
being what what about a good thing a
 

01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:51.690
being what what about a good thing a
straightforward good thing that the

01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:51.700
straightforward good thing that the
 

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.030
straightforward good thing that the
public can understand oh yeah if it

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040
public can understand oh yeah if it
 

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.680
public can understand oh yeah if it
wasn't for blockchain that wouldn't be

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:55.690
wasn't for blockchain that wouldn't be
 

01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:59.580
wasn't for blockchain that wouldn't be
happening okay quick it's a dirty

01:22:59.580 --> 01:22:59.590
happening okay quick it's a dirty

already so what is the currency of all

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:02.200
already so what is the currency of all
 

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.570
already so what is the currency of all
the token based system which is

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:03.580
the token based system which is
 

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.220
the token based system which is
basically treating your home magic

01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:05.230
basically treating your home magic
 

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.620
basically treating your home magic
Internet money which is the one that we

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:07.630
Internet money which is the one that we
 

01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:09.270
Internet money which is the one that we
have been exploring the most until now

01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280
have been exploring the most until now
 

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.140
have been exploring the most until now
the second one is the registry like

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:13.150
the second one is the registry like
 

01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:14.490
the second one is the registry like
using the blockchain not as a

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:14.500
using the blockchain not as a
 

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.260
using the blockchain not as a
decentralized payment system but rather

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:16.270
decentralized payment system but rather
 

01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:18.600
decentralized payment system but rather
as a registry system and then you can

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:18.610
as a registry system and then you can
 

01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:21.060
as a registry system and then you can
just cool things by executing a

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:21.070
just cool things by executing a
 

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:22.800
just cool things by executing a
transaction and recording a particular

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:22.810
transaction and recording a particular
 

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.570
transaction and recording a particular
piece of content on that low chance that

01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:24.580
piece of content on that low chance that
 

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.100

you're moving from this kind of

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:26.110
you're moving from this kind of
 

01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:28.950
you're moving from this kind of
translate system to proof based system

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960
translate system to proof based system

translate system to proof based system
in which you can constantly check

01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:30.460
in which you can constantly check

abandoned upon provide better

01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:34.180
abandoned upon provide better
 

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.240
abandoned upon provide better
auditability and then the third one and

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:36.250
auditability and then the third one and
 

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:39.000
auditability and then the third one and
I think that's the more futuristic but

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:39.010
I think that's the more futuristic but
 

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:40.890
I think that's the more futuristic but
it's getting there but it's still very

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:40.900
it's getting there but it's still very
 

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.360
it's getting there but it's still very
experimental is all the thing that

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:42.370
experimental is all the thing that
 

01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:43.770
experimental is all the thing that
relates to smart contracts so the

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:43.780
relates to smart contracts so the
 

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.420
relates to smart contracts so the
ability of deploying software on a

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:45.430
ability of deploying software on a
 

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:47.880
ability of deploying software on a
blockchain in order to in a way that is

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:47.890
blockchain in order to in a way that is
 

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:49.920
blockchain in order to in a way that is
not controlled by any single operator

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:49.930
not controlled by any single operator
 

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.540
not controlled by any single operator
but that is actually executed in a

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:51.550
but that is actually executed in a
 

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:52.920
but that is actually executed in a
distributed manner by all the

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:52.930
distributed manner by all the
 

01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:55.620
distributed manner by all the
participants and this is what can create

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:55.630
participants and this is what can create
 

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:59.360
participants and this is what can create
those kind of new type of cooperative

01:23:59.360 --> 01:23:59.370
those kind of new type of cooperative

there is no centralized operator that is
actually dictating the heels of the

Bazaar which is this kind of like eBay
 

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:27.000
Bazaar which is this kind of like eBay
but without eBay we have like some

but without eBay we have like some
 

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:30.210
but without eBay we have like some

to implement Biba without uber and
obviously we realize that it's very easy

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:45.550
obviously we realize that it's very easy
 

01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:47.009
obviously we realize that it's very easy
to implement the first two categories

01:24:47.009 --> 01:24:47.019
to implement the first two categories
 

01:24:47.019 --> 01:24:49.350
to implement the first two categories
are very easy to implement because one

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360
are very easy to implement because one
 

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.939
are very easy to implement because one
is just pure month you just need to

01:24:50.939 --> 01:24:50.949
is just pure month you just need to
 

01:24:50.949 --> 01:24:52.620
is just pure month you just need to
calculate whether the account are

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:52.630
calculate whether the account are
 

01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:53.790
calculate whether the account are
actually correct and then make a

01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800
actually correct and then make a
 

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.350
actually correct and then make a
transaction the second one is just

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360
transaction the second one is just
 

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.750
transaction the second one is just
registration notarization so that's very

01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760
registration notarization so that's very
 

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.459
registration notarization so that's very
easy the difficulty with this map

01:24:59.459 --> 01:24:59.469
easy the difficulty with this map
 

01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:01.620
easy the difficulty with this map
contract again it's the government so

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:01.630
contract again it's the government so

decentralized organization then how do

01:25:07.529 --> 01:25:07.539
decentralized organization then how do
 

01:25:07.539 --> 01:25:09.359
decentralized organization then how do
you make sure that this organization is

01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:09.369
you make sure that this organization is
 

01:25:09.369 --> 01:25:11.430
you make sure that this organization is
being managed is being governed in a way

01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440
being managed is being governed in a way
 

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.750

that actually makes sense that actually

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760
that actually makes sense that actually
 

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.640
that actually makes sense that actually
is viable when you don't have this

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:14.650
is viable when you don't have this
 

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:16.919
is viable when you don't have this
centralized institution and from it the

01:25:16.919 --> 01:25:16.929
centralized institution and from it the
 

01:25:16.929 --> 01:25:19.140

reason why those is not contract based

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:19.150
reason why those is not contract based

organization are not yet fully fledged
still just experimental is because we

01:25:23.939 --> 01:25:23.949
still just experimental is because we
 

01:25:23.949 --> 01:25:26.640

structure to manage the organization fit

01:25:29.399 --> 01:25:29.409
structure to manage the organization fit

people are using it for different
 

01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:35.490
people are using it for different
reasons now but that was always the

01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:35.500
reasons now but that was always the
 

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.680

digital technology works and will
 

01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:48.960
digital technology works and will
continue to improve so it's not only

so it's tax evasion as I see is actually

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:58.750
so it's tax evasion as I see is actually
 

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.240
so it's tax evasion as I see is actually
the people that are good at tax evasion

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:00.250
the people that are good at tax evasion
 

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:01.920
the people that are good at tax evasion
are going to get even better at it in

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:01.930
are going to get even better at it in
 

01:28:01.930 --> 01:28:03.840
are going to get even better at it in
the years ahead it is gonna get harder

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:03.850
the years ahead it is gonna get harder
 

01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:05.790
the years ahead it is gonna get harder
and an increasing burden of Taxation

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800
and an increasing burden of Taxation
 

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.310
and an increasing burden of Taxation
will fall on an already aggrieved middle

01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320
will fall on an already aggrieved middle
 

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.680
