00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: --get it.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.880
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Welcome to The
Friday Review of Games.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.250
DAN GALPIN: Wait, what
shot are we on?

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.180
I'm only on screen.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.110
You're not even on
screen, Ian.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.710
Wait.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.150
Now it's a black screen.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.630
Hold on.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.650
We can do this.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.930
MALE SPEAKER: There's
this one.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.970
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.220
Yeah, there we are.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.004
Oh, cool.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.300
All right.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.530
All right.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.480
DAN GALPIN: Welcome to The
Friday Review of Games.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.930
As always, I'm Dan Galpin, and
with me is Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.490
DAN GALPIN: And we're going
to have a nice, casual

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.150
conversation with our game now
behind us using the advanced

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.310
green screen technology we
have here in the studio.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.080
And the game behind us, by the
way, is "Greedy Spiders 2,"

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.140
just to give a call out to it.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.980
But more importantly,
let's find out what

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.940
we're drinking today.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.740
Well, Ian's drinking
Mountain Dew.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.450
Dude, I was up all night.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.840
You know what I was up
all night doing?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.620
Making an intro video.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.720
DAN GALPIN: Oh yeah, the one
that didn't get played.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.430
That's all right.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually,
it's a different one.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.947
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's
a different one.

00:00:57.947 --> 00:00:58.129
I know.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:58.312
I know.

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:01.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was for the
App Planet, [? yeah. ?]

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.060
I don't know, man.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.450
Sometimes I wonder.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.850
So producer Daniel Pham
is not with us today.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.310
He is off on a whirlwind tour
of New York and London.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.320
Because as you know,
it's Fashion Week.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.310
He's got a lot of couture
houses to visit.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.400
Pretty much everyone in Europe
who does fauxhawks will be at

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.002
the London Fauxhawk
Convention.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.250
DAN GALPIN: I think it's
exciting for him to get to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.840
meet a bunch of his
peers this way.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.710
So we wish you the
best, Daniel.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.150
Keep on truckin', and we still
totally believe that you have

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.910
a girlfriend, even though
we never met her.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.730
DAN GALPIN: He doesn't want
her to meet us, actually.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.220
I think he know that's
pretty much the end.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Really
can't blame him.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.630
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: 'Cause isn't
he pretty young?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.180
I bet his girlfriend
is about mid-20s.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.560
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, probably.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, he doesn't
want her to meet you.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.440
All right, so we've got
some games today.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.990
DAN GALPIN: We do.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.845
We have some games.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:03.650
We have some beer.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.830
Let's start drinking
now please.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.290
All right, do we
have an opener?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.450
That's the most important
thing.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.199
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of course we do.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.460
So today we're drinking
Rogue Dead Guy ale.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.890
We're going back to a classic.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.375
DAN GALPIN: This is for people
who've stayed up till 4:00 in

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:13.630
the morning.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.230
Actually, both Ian and I stayed
up to all hours of the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.410
night last night.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: Such a bad idea.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.200
DAN GALPIN: So we're both
feeling like dead guys.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.850
Raa--

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.860
brains--

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.300
this should be zombie edition,
actually, of the show because

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.980
that's kind of how I feel
like right now.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.490
So this is a new studio setup
for us, and we actually have

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.580
real-time statistics.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.440
But I can just barely read it.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.820
It looks like-- what is that--
two people are watching?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.790
DAN GALPIN: Some like that.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.050
Yeah.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: So two people
are watching.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.840
Awesome.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.000
Thanks to both of us--
both of you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.770
DAN GALPIN: Wait, one of those
is the producer, isn't it?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ooh, damn it.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.570
DAN GALPIN: Oh, well.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.900
Anyways, thanks to you, man.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.000
We appreciate it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.780
All right, so anyway,
we love you guys.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.116
And as always--

00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:58.620
DAN GALPIN: There's more
than that slightly.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: So producer
Louis is monitoring the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.090
YouTube chat channel.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.540
So if you guys want to have some
conversations, just say

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.150
something, maybe spark us
off on another wild

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.530
goose chase, awesome.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.600
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.815
We are here to be casual.

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:19.030
Once again, it is a casual
Friday review.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.040
We're going to look at
a couple of games.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.900
But we also want to use this as
a jumping-off point just to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.990
talk about Android gaming and
how you program and sell games

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.440
on Android in general.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.190
DAN GALPIN: And this has been
a big week, too, for Google.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.110
We announced the new Chromebook,
which I'm really

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.780
excited about.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.380
And I think a lot of people
don't recognize, but that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.985
Chromebook has some serious
potential for games.

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.560
And it's really the first one
that I think actually has a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.630
GPU that's more powerful,
potentially, than the CPU.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.690
And so I think we're going to
see some really, really cool

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.335
stuff about it.

00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:51.125
And so I'm excited.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.530
It's using the Exynos 5, and
it's a very low-resolution

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.340
device for that Exynos 6.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.050
So it's going to be a really
nice game machine.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exynos 5, that's
an exciting chip.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.030
DAN GALPIN: It is an
exciting chip.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.340
So the Chromebook actually
earned the distinction of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.415
being the first device to
ship with an RMA-15.

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:11.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
some good stuff.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.330
That's an out-of-order
part, isn't it?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.230
DAN GALPIN: It is.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.870
It is.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.715
It's got a really long pipeline,
so you do have to be

00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:17.980
a little more careful, I think,
in terms of you stall

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.119
the pipeline--

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:19.529
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.010
But an out of order pipe
is going to be a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.790
lot harder to stall.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.990
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: And this
is actually is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.670
probably a good thing.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.250
DAN GALPIN: Actually, it's
speculative out-of-order.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.100
A9 is also out-of-order.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.494
A15 is also speculative
execution, I believe.

00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:33.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, OK.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.755
Is there a first speculative
part?

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:37.110
DAN GALPIN: I don't remember.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.755
I can't remember, actually,
the difference--

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.560
I know the pipeline is longer,
and beyond that--

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I hope
it doesn't crash.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.330
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.900
But I'm really excited
about that.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.680
I think the price point is
great, and the track pad feels

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.050
really, really good.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I know that
was kind of a problem

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.240
earlier, wasn't it?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.390
DAN GALPIN: Well, the
original, original

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.760
Chromebooks--

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.920
I think people underestimated
that.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.520
And now, I think they've made
that a really, really good job

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.408
of getting good parts, getting
good sensors, and

00:05:00.408 --> 00:05:01.070
integrating it well.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.840
So I think it's a great
little machine.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.300
I'm excited.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.980
I'm excited to see what people
do with games on it.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.500
That's a little bit far off from
Android, but I thought

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.240
I'd do a shout out to--

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
I was gonna say.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.970
Yeah, do you want to talk about
the new Windows machine

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.610
next, dude?

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.610
DAN GALPIN: The new Windows
machine, dude, it uses a T30.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.060
That's old news, man.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.550
I mean, come on.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.970
That's the part from
six months ago.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right, my
Mountain Dew is finished.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.570
It's time for beer.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: So yeah, it's
been a good week.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.710
We've had some up and down.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.380
I'm definitely, again, just
working through a lot of test

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.000
suites with different game
developers, trying to figure

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.270
out what it is.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.832
So here's something
that surfaced--

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:50.950
DAN GALPIN: No pun intended.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right--

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.630
that I think is really important
just recently.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.620
And I think this actually may
apply to the Exynos 5--

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:08.680
is we saw some game developers
with either incorrect results

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.920
in the fragment shader
or basically

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.530
massively incorrect Z results.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.890
DAN GALPIN: And what's
interesting about it, we're

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.140
moving towards devices--

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.230
all the next generation of GPUs,
whether that be the T604

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.750
that's in the Exynos 5 or the
Adreno 320, these are all

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.830
unified shader models.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.190
And so they're designed to be
both compute monsters and the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.550
GPU as well as graphics
monsters.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.425
And so what we're
seeing there--

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.915
is your head in the display
there, man?

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:39.680
I think it is.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: Louis,
you promised, dude.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.880
DAN GALPIN: Also the corner of
the monitor's in the display.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.490
That's kind of cool.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually,
you know what?

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.790
Mom!

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.700
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.440
Dude, you need to move
that, seriously.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.080
DAN GALPIN: Can you lower that
monitor just a little bit?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, just
lower the monitor.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.410
DAN GALPIN: One more.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.230
There we are.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.640
All right.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: If you could just
maybe stop having a head,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.310
that would be good.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.080
DAN GALPIN: Hunched,
he's gonna be like

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.110
Quasimodo after this.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I guess we
could pan up a little bit.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.200
DAN GALPIN: We totally could.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.870
But anyway, so what that means,
when you get into

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.930
devices that are designed for
compute is now they actually

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.820
have a unified shader model.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.675
And so now we're seeing things
where before, a lot of times,

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:22.590
they would sort of fudge in
vertex shaders in terms of

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.430
whether you have
medium-precision or

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.890
low-precision, it might not
actually have a true

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.220
medium-precision.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.510
But now that we're actually
having these that are designed

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.280
to deal with compute,
medium-precision may actually

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.800
mean something.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, part of the
problem is that for a long

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.800
time, in a lot of parts--

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.270
so the problem is these things
are defined as low is less

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.652
than or equal to medium is less
than or equal to high.

00:07:46.652 --> 00:07:48.260
DAN GALPIN: You're guaranteed
16 bits with

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.060
medium is the problem.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.870
But it could be more.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: But it
could be more.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.550
DAN GALPIN: And it often is.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.025
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, it
usually is, actually.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.460
So what we were seeing is there
are some parts-- and I

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.660
believe the Exynos 5 is one of
them-- that uses 16 bits for

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.040
medium-P. So if you were using
medium-P and getting by with

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.460
24 bits of precision, now you
get swashed down to 16, we're

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.860
seeing these bizarre
Z-fighting issues.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.680
DAN GALPIN: And again,
we're talking about

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.880
vertex shader precision.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.450
Most the time, pixel
shader precision,

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.420
actually, is unchanged.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.940
They were already crazily
optimizing pixel shaders in a

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.300
lot of these devices.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.669
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, the
artifacts you're going to get

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.144
are not nearly--

00:08:34.144 --> 00:08:36.510
you'll get banding.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.760
DAN GALPIN: But when you have
vertex shader, you'll have

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.190
geometry that suddenly is
fighting with other geometry.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.590
And if you draw it on one order
on these devices, it's

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.440
just going to overlap.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.240
And so it's kind
of terrifying.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.230
So one thing to note is that
when you're actually using a

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.420
vertex shader and you're using
medium-precision, you're

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.980
really only guaranteed
16 bits.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.420
And unfortunately, it's not easy
to necessarily test that

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.130
in terms of just having a GPU
that's a reference design.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.590
But it is something you
should consider.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:13.060
And it's actually worthwhile to
put some exceptions in your

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.860
code and actually try to check
those things and debug them.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.100
Because you can actually test
for those, it's just that you

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.470
may not have a GPU sample
that yet exposes it.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.060
So it's an interesting device.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.210
Again, all of the new devices
are not necessarily going to

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.680
have that issue, but they are
going to definitely have

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.457
issues because we're moving
towards unified models here in

00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:33.060
mobile-- which is exciting.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.670
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it
is really cool.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.500
I mean, I don't know if I'd
characterize it as being

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.970
because of unified shaders.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.240
I think it just happened to
come along with that.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.930
It's a little cold in here.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.010
OK, actually I just wanted
to cover up my man boobs.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.460
DAN GALPIN: No, I totally,
totally get that.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.810
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.980
So let's talk a little bit
about the game behind us.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.710
Because it is here, and the
people are sort of wanting--

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.440
so this is "Greedy Spiders 2."

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I remember--
"Greedy Spiders," didn't we

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.720
play that and it was sort
of a puzzle game, right?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.840
DAN GALPIN: It is
a puzzle game.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: You had to
move your flies or

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.250
something like that.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.990
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, so the goal
with this one is to--

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.485
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
this is cute.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.790
DAN GALPIN: --is to free your
flies from the spiders.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.980
And it's actually fairly
tricky to do that.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.270
The spider will always follow
the path towards the nearest

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.810
bug in terms of the numbers
of segments.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.970
And so you can use
that against him.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.786
So as you see here, the goal is
now to isolate him from all

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:38.505
of the other bugs as quickly
as possible.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.240
And that's how we get
the best score.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.770
And then once he's isolate, the
bugs will get to go free.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.950
And there's all sorts of stuff
the game starts throwing at

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.900
you in addition.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.110
So the first one is cutting,
you can freeze them.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.910
There's also other stuff you can
do to the spider in order

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.990
to prevent it from
eating the bugs.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.920
And I think it's a really
clever game.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.130
The puzzles get really, really

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.160
challenging as it goes through.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.970
This is an example of a game
that's done very, very well.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.100
The back key, you see, does not
do anything here, which is

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.950
unfortunate.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.140
It actually should technically
do something--

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.520
but nothing.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're watching
the confidence monitor, right,

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.190
so you have an idea of what
people can and can't see?

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.440
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, so I'm pushing
the back key here.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.130
You can actually see the outline
of the tablet here.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, no it's OK.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.850
It's OK.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.900
Here, I'll show you
how we do this.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.780
DAN GALPIN: Oh yeah?

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, we
just move your chair.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.640
As you can see--

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.530
DAN GALPIN: As you can see--

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: --there are
stars in this game.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.280
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.990
This is great, actually.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.140
One of us can actually play the
role of the letter turner,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.900
the Vanna White role.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: No,
you know what?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.300
I'll tell you exactly why I
wanted to set up this way.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.745
Because I'm just goddamn sick of
talking about the back key.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:54.750
Plus actually, there
was that hater.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.240
DAN GALPIN: Was there a hater?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, not
on our show, but on

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.750
me and Reto's show.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.080
The guy went off, he's
like, man don't

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.690
listen to those guys.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.820
They probably work for Apple.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.080
They're trying to
ruin Android.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.700
DAN GALPIN: Dude, really?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.800
Look, no one from Apple
would wear this hat.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I
guess that's true.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.350
Well, you know what was actually
really hilarious,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.500
though, was one of the things
he said was, I can't believe

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.540
you're telling people not to
have an exit dialogue before

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.560
you back out of the application
because every

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.740
application should have that.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.220
What if it takes a long
time to reload?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.730
And I'm like, that's a
really good point.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.990
But really, the only apps that
get a pass on that are games

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.810
because yes, games can take a
while to reload on earlier

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.000
systems or if you're under
tremendous memory pressure.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.780
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.120
In general, if you really want
to throw a dialogue up because

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.880
of loading, it's OK but in
general, it's better to just

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.750
not do it at all.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.000
I'm still of the mindset
that user will

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.240
figure out fairly quickly--

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, now that
you don't lose your context

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.970
when you lose focus,
then I think that

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.780
that's absolutely right.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.020
Because the user is either going
to go right back to the

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.940
game, in which case you should
still have your context and

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.150
you should still have
everything.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.350
Basically you should pause and
then just let them resume.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.550
Or the user doesn't care anymore
and your game will get

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.170
killed off.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.500
And as long as you handle the
notifications correctly,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.530
you're probably going
to be fine.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.450
DAN GALPIN: Well, you know,
we're so happy.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.680
This game actually does
not have a menu key.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.790
It's doing a lot of
things right.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.440
But I'm sitting here
and I have to--

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.435
OK, first of all, this
is something

00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:36.640
weird about these games.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.090
I have the bricks, and the
bricks say I'm actually going

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.190
back to this other menu that
looks like bricks.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.320
And then we've got an on-screen
back key here.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:43.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wait, wait.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.655
Oh, yeah.

00:13:44.655 --> 00:13:45.390
Yeah.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.715
DAN GALPIN: But that
back key does work.

00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:47.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's a
little unfortunate.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.410
Can you swipe?

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.030
DAN GALPIN: You can.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.620
You can swipe.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well,
it's a different--

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.390
DAN GALPIN: It's not a proper
swiping motion, but it is--

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's one
thing, by the way, that I've

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.820
noticed on a couple of games.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.130
They'll implement a swipe,
but they won't

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.510
implement it with physics.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.910
And as you get on to bigger
devices, it's really annoying

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.440
because you have to drag your
whole finger all the way

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.100
across the devices.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.130
DAN GALPIN: It's particularly
nice if you can use the

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.990
physics that's built
into Android in

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.960
terms of gesture detector.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.520
It makes the game feel like an
Android game, and it makes it

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.590
feel a little bit customized
for that device.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.290
Exactly.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.940
Because the gesture detector and
the flywheel physics will

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:35.600
in general do the right
thing as far as the

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.160
momentum of your swipe.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.610
And people are going
to be used to that.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.430
Because all these other
apps use it.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.470
So if you tune it so that you
really, really like it and

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.260
it's different from the system
default, you might want to

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.550
just ask yourself why
you did that.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.920
DAN GALPIN: Well, it is really
funny because there's a lot of

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.740
games that actually have
tried to tune this.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.760
And you really notice it.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.770
It's a visceral quality.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.890
The game feels thick
or sticky.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.820
And what we find is that our
physics are a little looser

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.040
than some other touch-based
operating systems, especially

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.290
in the newer versions.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.970
We really wanted to have this
very active and alive and

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.200
elastic feel to the
user interface.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.230
And so when you have a game
that's using it, it feels

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.770
like, ugh, I'm going through
this sludge trying to get

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.410
through the UI.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.470
So in general, I think
it's a great idea.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: There
is one really bad

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.630
thing about it, though.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.600
And actually, look it up
in the ViewPager code.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.790
There is a fudge factor that we
apply to our own physics,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.325
like a factor of four.

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:38.150
DAN GALPIN: It's true.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.592
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because we suck.

00:15:39.592 --> 00:15:42.260
But whatever.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
If there's a fudge
factor, great.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:44.925
Grab it out of the source.

00:15:44.925 --> 00:15:46.390
It's a constant factor.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.460
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.960
All right, so anyways I
really love this game.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.870
Honestly, it's an incredibly
well-designed game.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.750
It's really, really fun.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.460
The graphics are really
well done.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.160
It's very cute, and it
definitely is a game, looking

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.592
around the Halloween season, I
think this is one that has

00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:04.530
legs that people are going
to want to play with.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.480
Even little details--

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: I see what
you did there.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.280
It has legs.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.130
Nice.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.610
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.380
I know.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.670
So I love the fact that his
eyes even move here on the

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.120
title screen.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.100
It's very, very cute.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.460
You have the little obvious
option for music, sound

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.570
effects, and off on the radio
with the little animations.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.125
You can change the difficulty
on it from easy to hard.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.620
You know, whatever.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.435
IAN NI-LEWIS: You can't
do that, actually.

00:16:32.435 --> 00:16:35.100
Yeah.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.870
DAN GALPIN: I mean, you can
actually determine whether or

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.950
not they've rated you
on Google Play.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.930
So kind of silly.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.345
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:41.345 --> 00:16:43.280
Actually, the truth is--

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.110
I hope these developers hear
this from us because they will

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.340
eventually hear it from
the Play guys--

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.430
it's against policy to
incentivize reviews.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.985
So if the Play team
sees that--

00:16:54.985 --> 00:16:57.400
DAN GALPIN: Actually, it's
borderline because they're not

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.600
asking for a good review or a
bad review, this is one that

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.850
the team finds kind
of borderline.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.089
And it's this side of goofball
because you can actually tell

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:07.950
whether they've reviewed it.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.760
So what usually happens
is, sure, I'll rate

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.540
you on Google Play.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.595
And then I go to Google Play
and I hang out here for a

00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:15.040
little while, and I load--

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right,
and it never loads.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.740
So they don't come back.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.059
DAN GALPIN: Load the page.

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:18.260
And then I come back.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.770
And it's like, usually the game
goes, woo-hoo, rated on

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.269
Google Play.

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:22.790
Plus five.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.089
Again, kind of silly, since you
can't actually detect it.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:34.170
But that being said, whether
it's helping you or not, I

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.590
think the team is OK as
long as you're not

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.900
asking for a specific.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: So check it out.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.970
Look who just walked in.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.930
It's Reto Meier.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:41.920
DAN GALPIN: No way.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.930
Welcome to the neighborhood,
Reto.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Why is Reto Meier
slumming in here with

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.917
the game guys?

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:50.189
RETO MEIER: When I was watching,
it sounded like the

00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:54.520
audio from the tablet was
coming through online.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whose fault
would that be?

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.140
DAN GALPIN: Well, it
could be anyone's.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.500
I'm going to mute this
tablet just in case.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:00.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: Good point.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.290
RETO MEIER: Thank you.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.250
DAN GALPIN: You're welcome.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.830
Thank you, Reto.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Reto,
representative of the man.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.510
Thanks, Reto.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.240
Appreciate it.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.256
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:18:08.256 --> 00:18:11.460
I appreciate that one.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.220
Daniel Pham is off teaching
people all over the world how

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.900
he does his magical producership
in his giant

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.460
world tour-- in addition to the
fauxhawk convention, which

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.250
of course is very important.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.630
So we're all kind of figuring
things out.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.900
We realize how much we
rely on him here.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes, we do.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.750
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:37.210
So we can switch to
another title.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.460
So we've actually looked at
a lot of the ones here--

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey, producer
Louis, what

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.220
happened to our HDMI?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.430
LOUIS: Looks like you
lost your tablet.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.090
DAN GALPIN: Oh, I did.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:43.860
[? LOUIS: You can't ?] move.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.680
DAN GALPIN: No way, really?

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.060
LOUIS: Yep.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.440
Now it's back.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:45.950
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.430
Woo-hoo!

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.430
All right, so we've looked at a
lot of these before, so I'm

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.550
not going to go into
any detail.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.660
I'm just going to bring
them up and be like,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.355
wow, that looks bad.

00:18:57.355 --> 00:18:59.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: But why
does that look bad?

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.460
DAN GALPIN: Well, it's because
this game has never been

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:07.090
really tested on a tablet
display is what I think.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.320
But I'm not sure.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.250
It could just be it's intended
to be squashed like that.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.080
But this is "Greedy Monkey."
And also, this game is just

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.410
one that has a lot of potential
in terms of being a

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.740
physics puzzler.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.570
And it just doesn't quite
live up to it.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:29.900
The goal is actually you need
to clear away the boards so

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.360
that the banana will make
it to the monkey.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.960
This is the laziest
monkey on earth.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.050
And there's so much that I can
say in terms of polish, in

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.790
terms of everything
from the font.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.090
The graphic style is actually
relatively consistent, but you

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.460
even see, like there are some
things that are outlined and

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:46.910
some things are not.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, the stars
have a little bit

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.370
of a bevel to them.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.330
It's just really inconsistent.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:52.920
DAN GALPIN: I love the
the background.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.192
I would actually like to see
everything take the style of

00:19:55.192 --> 00:19:56.510
the background.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're right.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.970
The background is
kind of cool.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:59.570
DAN GALPIN: I love that style.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.790
I think it also scales
really, really well.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.310
What's great about not having
distinct outlines is that they

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.085
actually scale and look great
on every display.

00:20:07.085 --> 00:20:09.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's a good
point because if you've got a

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.620
black line around, that's going
to scale differently,

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.520
and it's going to end up
actually being invisible on

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.150
some devices and too
thick on others.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.395
DAN GALPIN: Exactly,
and you end up with

00:20:18.395 --> 00:20:19.620
these aliasing artifacts.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.810
Like, you can see here on the
board on the very, very left,

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.845
you can't really make out the
outline because of the angle

00:20:24.845 --> 00:20:26.000
the board is sitting at.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.325
The outline wasn't there at all,
and we actually chose an

00:20:28.325 --> 00:20:30.310
art style that was more
consistent with the nice

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.310
gradient fills of
the background.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.400
I think it would look
a little bit better.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.700
Don't want to say a lot about
this game, it's just there's a

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.080
lot of polish that
can be done here.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.830
And I think we did look at it a
long time ago, but my memory

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.580
is such that I don't
even know.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.320
"Mibo" is kind of interesting.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.250
The main thing, dude, if you're
going to use AndEngine,

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.100
don't use the standard AndEngine
package, man.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.720
Change the package name.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.220
It's like, really, I was looking
at it, and I'm like,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.700
this is com.andengine--

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.960
this is not an AndEngine game.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.940
This is a game by
an individual.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.290
This is a game that requires
accelerometer.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.260
It's definitely retro.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.340
What I'm impressed by is this
game is super, super tiny.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.000
I think this game is, like, 800
or 900k, which makes it

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.800
one of the smallest games.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.980
And given that, it actually
does quite a lot.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Are you just
trying to keep these

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.035
dudes in the air?

00:21:19.035 --> 00:21:21.750
DAN GALPIN: You're trying to
keep these guys in the air,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.630
and you eventually get combos,
you see, which I can't really

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.710
do very well here.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what
we need for this place?

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.980
We need one of those remotes
where your phone is the

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.080
accelerometer.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.360
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, that would
be kind of kick-butt.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.860
If only there was a way to
actually use my other phone as

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.230
a real HID device and there
was some sort of remote

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.975
framework for dealing
with sensors.

00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:44.930
That would be kind of cool.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.010
You know, Jeff.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.910
That's you.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.480
Yeah, I'm not going to be able
to do this very well on this

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.670
tablet, partially because I have
it in the dock, which of

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.115
course, I do mostly
for stability.

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:56.560
But actually, the starry
background looks

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.245
pretty good with us.

00:21:57.245 --> 00:21:58.055
I kind of like that.

00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:58.907
IAN NI-LEWIS: How's that
stability thing working out

00:21:58.907 --> 00:22:00.157
for you, by the way?

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
DAN GALPIN: I kind of
like this starry

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.570
background behind us.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.450
I will say, this game makes a
better background than others.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.375
it's pretty blurry
on the tablet.

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:08.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.530
It's not bad, actually.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.100
DAN GALPIN: It's not.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.690
I kind of like--

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, if we just
had a little bit more depth of

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.970
field, I could totally believe
that we were just sitting in

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.110
front of a video wall
or something.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.370
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.750
I tell you, I really want us
to be silhouettes, though.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.200
I totally want us to do the
"MST3K" thing and have us

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.830
really, really tiny
in the corner.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.480
Take our shot, instead of just
composing it straight,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.720
actually make it smaller and
take us and compose us in a

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.480
little corner.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh man, you know
who could totally make us into

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.540
silhouettes?

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.180
DAN GALPIN: Daniel Pham.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.320
DAN GALPIN: So maybe next
time, we'll do that.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.230
That would be kind of awesome.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.050
And so for next week,
by the way--

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.790
just to let you know, we'll
mention this at the end-- but

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.280
I do want people to nominate
Halloween-themed games.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: That shouldn't
be hard.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.020
DAN GALPIN: There are
so many out there.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.810
And everyone is throwing
Halloween.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's like, we
might actually just do games

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.750
on the app clinic too because
Reto was like, yeah, we'll do

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.640
Halloween apps at the
end of October.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.550
I'm like, really?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.600
What's a Halloween
app, exactly?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.830
But yeah, Halloween's
huge for games.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.890
DAN GALPIN: Well, there are
sound boards-- like

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.290
Halloween-themed sound boards,
there's Halloween live

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.595
wallpapers.

00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:16.400
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, for some
reason, I guess the people

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:16.790
aren't too interested in them.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.220
DAN GALPIN: Halloween cards.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't know.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.570
DAN GALPIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.900
Anyways, there's a lot of
Halloween stuff, so we're

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.250
excited about that.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.820
Maybe I won't wear
a hat that time.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.420
We'll see.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: So you'll
go as a crazy old

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.440
man with long hair?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.600
DAN GALPIN: That's right.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.180
Actually, I walk down
the street and

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.650
people hand me stuff.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.720
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.115
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you should
totally be a hobo.

00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:39.040
DAN GALPIN: Like, no,
no, I'm not begging.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.250
Please, OK?

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.650
This is just the way I dress.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:42.960
I'm sorry.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.600
I've got holes in my shoes.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.650
So in any case, where are
we going with this?

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.360
Yeah, the game, it works.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.590
And it's cute.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.500
And it's very small.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: You promised me
that there was going to be

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.170
interesting stuff about
each game that we

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.420
were looking at today.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.440
You promised me.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:23:59.760
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.150
I lied.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.880
So the other two games
that we're--

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: I mean, the fact
that it's really small is very

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.360
interesting.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.710
That's cool.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.260
DAN GALPIN: It is, actually.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.930
Actually, the only thing I
wanted to mention was, please

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.810
don't use the default
package of anything.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.670
Create your own package name.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.760
That was my primary comment.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.900
The game is actually
pretty fun.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.480
It's very simple,
but it's fun.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.270
So the other two are "Overkill"
and "Zombie

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.880
Raiders." I'm pretty sure we've
looked at both of them.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't remember
"Zombie Raiders." I definitely

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.250
remember "Overkill." That's a
shooting gallery game, right?

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.870
DAN GALPIN: Yes. "Overkill's"
a shooting gallery game.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.700
I put it on here just because
we can take a

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.800
quick look at it again.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: It has
a pretty cool icon.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.715
I don't remember the game
looking as good as the intro

00:24:35.715 --> 00:24:37.700
in the icon, though.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.710
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, the real sad
thing about this game is that

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.820
it completely lacks animation.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.540
It's sort of like
a semi-robotic

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.510
shooting gallery with--

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.420
but you can take a look.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: But this whole
beginning stuff.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.655
Just the entire menu
system is awesome.

00:24:56.655 --> 00:24:59.050
DAN GALPIN: And I love
the little bullets.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.830
And then you get to the game
and wow, this looks really

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.380
well-rendered.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.750
And then you start playing, and
you're like, hey, first of

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.895
all, this is a dual joystick
control despite the fact that

00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:11.460
it looks like you might
be tapping.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.030
That's actually not
how it works.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that explains
a lot about why I

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.595
never got any good scores
in this game.

00:25:18.595 --> 00:25:19.310
It's weird.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.140
It's like, they've
got this great

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.710
rendering, but they couldn't--

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.590
I mean, I've definitely
got sympathy for that.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.750
We've got the same problem in
the game we're writing.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.820
Because we ran out of money
before we got the main

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.880
character rigged.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.610
DAN GALPIN: That's true.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: So you know what I
was thinking we should do is

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.350
just give him rocket boots.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.640
Because then we don't
have to rig him.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.230
We'll just make the rocket
boots swivel.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.600
DAN GALPIN: That could work.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: So anyways,
you can also swipe.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.810
Actually, you can swipe with
two fingers to change guns.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:54.580
It actually has some nice
gesture support.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.360
But kind of--

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's tough, man.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.300
You can definitely compare just
what you're seeing right

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.560
now on the screen with some
of the other games

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.460
we've looked at it.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.720
And you know what game
you want to play.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.280
You're like, oh my god,
that is different.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.336
And it's really, really
crisp and beautiful.

00:26:14.336 --> 00:26:17.380
And not all of us are
born designers.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:17.680
DAN GALPIN: Back key
not working.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's hard for
me to say exactly what

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.330
makes this so good.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.900
I think part of it's an
attention to color, part of

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.340
it's a consistency throughout
the design.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.990
I mean, you're looking at this
high-res, real world bitmap

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.710
and then over the top of it are
these things, the font and

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.360
the layout is just very crisp.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.610
DAN GALPIN: They did a great
job on the menu system.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.120
The game itself, I really
want some more

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.680
animation in the game.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.000
And I know they were definitely

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.170
constrained by size.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.370
But it's not a small game.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.600
It is a game that's actually
using AP expansion files.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.490
It clocks in at about
54 megs, I think.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.040
And part of the problem is
that in shooting games,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.500
there's some great stuff from
Glue, to be honest, that

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.320
competes directly with this.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.910
Several of their games are
shooting galleries but with

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.100
more sophisticated
3D environments.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.430
And so I don't know.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.270
This game is fun.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.550
It is very well done.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.880
I did actually have a
chance to play it.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.520
It is difficult to play on
a tablet sitting on a

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.410
surface like this.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: But yeah, and if
I had to choose between a

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.530
beautiful menu system and a
beautiful excellent game play,

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.740
of course I'm going to
choose gameplay.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.470
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, no.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.300
The menu system, though,
is awesome.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.920
Honestly, kudos to you guys,
man, for making an awesome

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.125
menu system here.

00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:36.270
The back key still
doesn't work.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: I told you, man,
we spent a year talking about

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.470
the back key.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.970
You either know it
or you don't.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.380
DAN GALPIN: So "Zombie Raiders"
is actually a really

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.750
interesting game that takes
an incredible amount

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.320
of time to get into.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.140
And it's actually kind of an
adventure, puzzle, fighting,

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.710
shooting game.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.860
So basically, as you can see,
you actually have to unlock--

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.430
there's a zombie invasion
going on.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.350
And what you have to do
is actually get to

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.590
these various areas.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.310
And you find items you have to
use, and you have to figure

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.550
out where to use the items.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:12.050
And it's a detailed, long,
involved game.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: But this isn't the
one where you're flying an

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.884
airplane full of
zombies, is it?

00:28:15.884 --> 00:28:16.331
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:17.400
No, that one I love.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.210
That game's great.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:23.160
This game, I think, in terms of
a mobile game, this one's a

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.495
little harder.

00:28:23.495 --> 00:28:28.740
It requires a large amount of
time investment to really get

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.920
into and play this game.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.410
From a graphic prospective,
things are--

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.343
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's cool.

00:28:33.343 --> 00:28:36.990
You know what this really
reminds me--

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.400
how long has it been since
we've seen just a fun,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.660
top-down isometric?

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.200
DAN GALPIN: I still
haven't seen one.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.130
But this is top-down
and isometric.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.030
I guess that's sort of
mutually exclusive.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.610
But yeah, this is isometric.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.480
Well no, it reminds
me of "X-COM."

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.970
But where's the shadows?

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.450
Dude.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.460
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Shadows on these
characters aren't hard.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.670
All you need is a couple
of circles.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.810
DAN GALPIN: Not even
a fake shadow.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.710
There's even a little shadow
underneath that little marker.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.890
It's sort of odd.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
it's weird.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.390
DAN GALPIN: The graphics
are really blurry.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.010
I would love to see them
be a little higher

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.210
res than they are.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.630
I didn't notice because--

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.810
so here's a question
to our audience.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.460
We were just talking about
this the other day, is if

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.460
you're going to run an automated
program to detect

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.350
issues like this-- so what we're
talking about is over on

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.860
the right side of the screen,
we've got these things that

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.020
are almost behind Dan's head.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.890
So these are crisp.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.420
Whereas all of this, it's a
little hard to tell because

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.750
it's so textured but
it is not crisp.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.090
I'd say the density is about--

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.190
DAN GALPIN: Actually, it's
kind of nice because it

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.155
creates depth of feel for
us in our shot here.

00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:47.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:47.685
Good point.

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:48.840
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.860
It looks like it's
way behind us.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Except we like
we're sort of positioned in a

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.000
weird netherspace over
an isometric field.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.480
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, well,
I think that's OK.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, the point
is, what would you do to

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.730
detect this?

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.600
Because to put it in layman's
terms, I think we're trying to

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.620
detect places where--

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.050
there's crisp, but then
most of it's blurry.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.590
But the problem is, if you're
just measuring frequency or

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.690
whatever, some things
are going to be a

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.470
low-frequency signal.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.770
And especially things like this
gameplay, the only places

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.870
that you notice it, the only
places where it has to be

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.710
crisp, are the places that you
would expect it to be crisp.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.590
And maybe that's it.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.810
Maybe what we need to do is
shrink it down, find the

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.660
silhouette edges, and then see
how many of the silhouette

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.880
edges are actually blurry
at higher resolutions.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.680
DAN GALPIN: Well, exactly.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.430
It would also be an interesting
example to do just

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.430
that-- to actually change
the size of the display.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.000
Look at this game at different
display sizes and compare how

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.020
blurry it gets.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.870
And then we could actually see
where it had the highest

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.120
amount of information.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
that's true.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.960
If we just characterize the
information theoretically, if

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.970
the information doesn't go up
when the screen size does,

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.940
then that's a problem, right?

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.280
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.030
We'd even take each image
and apply a scale

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.890
factor, scale it down--

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:08.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: No,
you're right.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.550
You're absolutely right.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.570
Because that's the truth.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.230
It doesn't have anything
to do with frequency.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.300
It has to do with information.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.580
Because if you're making a
bilinear prediction at each

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.770
pixel, and the prediction is
always right, then there's no

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.460
information beyond what
the quarter of the

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.566
size would have been.

00:31:28.566 --> 00:31:29.670
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Genius.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.310
DAN GALPIN: Well--

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.720
thank you-- we're solving all
of our problems here on the

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.060
Friday Review.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.920
But yeah, so this game is really
blurry on tablets.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.580
It's OK on phones.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.290
Honestly, on a Galaxy Nexus,
you can see this too.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right,
well, I'm really bored.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.300
Let's take a question
from the audience.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:44.850
Hey, producer Louis?

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:45.640
DAN GALPIN: Are there
any questions?

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.150
LOUIS: There are questions.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.590
Are there any game genres that
you think are underrepresented

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.830
on touch-screen phones that
would do well if optimized?

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: RTS, man.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.070
Why aren't there more
RTS games out there?

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.100
There are a lot of tower defense
and stuff like that,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.810
but when I'm playing "StarCraft"
it's like, this

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.096
seems like it would make
sense on a touchscreen.

00:32:05.096 --> 00:32:06.840
DAN GALPIN: Totally.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.860
Well, I think in general, I want
to see games that take

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.300
advantage of the connectivity.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.850
Most of these are like 100%
connected devices.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.590
And I'd love to see RTS games,
and not only to play against

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.990
the computer but actually allow
you to play against

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.830
other players.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.690
I think that there's really
an opportunity for--

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, see, I don't
feel that way because I

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.420
hate other people.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.630
But touch screen--

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.235
now, that's something
I can get behind.

00:32:30.235 --> 00:32:31.440
DAN GALPIN: I mean, I think,
I would love to see--

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.130
"StarCraft" was a great
single-player experience.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.405
But as a multi-player
game was where it--

00:32:37.405 --> 00:32:38.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
no question.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.450
But that doesn't feel
like it's the core

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.350
to the phone, right?

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.640
Or are you just saying that in
general, we're not seeing

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.660
enough multi-player experiences,
even though these

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.230
things are--

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.410
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, even
though these things

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.030
are connected devices.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.090
Like, I want to see people
do a lot of really cool

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.360
multi-player stuff.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I mean part
of the problem is I feel

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.140
like "StarCraft" would have been
a completely different

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.840
experience if clicking
on a Zerg had cost

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.040
me 5/10 of a cent.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.550
DAN GALPIN: No, that's true.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:05.970
That's true.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: And when we're
talking about bandwidth caps

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.160
and stuff like that,
it's really hard--

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.875
DAN GALPIN: Oh, I thought
you were talking

00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:12.290
about in-app purchases.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:12.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, that too.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:13.660
That too.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.660
DAN GALPIN: We're now charging
you $0.50 every

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.576
single time you click.

00:33:17.576 --> 00:33:18.826
That's kind of genius.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, you know what
would be great is if you

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.505
die three times, then you have
to pay $0.25 to continue.

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:30.940
I always wondered why that
model didn't come back.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.520
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.062
IAN NI-LEWIS: Maybe
because it sucked.

00:33:32.062 --> 00:33:32.370
I don't know.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.200
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, probably.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.330
Although it never stopped
me from playing

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.580
far too much Robotron.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: But wasn't it
great when nickel arcades came

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.040
into being?

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.590
DAN GALPIN: Mm--

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Did you have a
nickel arcade near your house?

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.250
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.520
No, we did not unfortunately.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.940
We did have arcades that
had major, major

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.800
token deals, though.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.810
So they had days you'd come to
the arcade, and were like, and

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.560
now you get quad tokens.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.160
And so we'd come out with
giant sacks of tokens.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
there you go.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.080
Yeah, totally.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.930
No, I had a nickel arcade
near my house when

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:04.910
I was growing up.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.430
Oh, and when I lived in
Salonica, they had a 10

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.680
drachma arcade.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.889
Yeah, and drachma are worth
about as much as Korean won.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.320
DAN GALPIN: I actually remember
when I went to

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.170
Prague, actually, I was really
excited because the arcade was

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.000
less expensive because
of the time.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.429
Actually, they're still
not using Euro.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: In Prague,
they're not?

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.000
DAN GALPIN: No, no.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.840
They have joined the Eurozone
but they are still using their

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.610
own currency, as I recall.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.332
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:34:36.332 --> 00:34:37.290
I think so.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.880
Anyway, so the arcade
was actually

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.305
relatively cheap there.

00:34:41.305 --> 00:34:46.435
So at that point, I was
playing a lot of--

00:34:46.435 --> 00:34:49.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what I
really miss is that Mickey

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.090
game that came out.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.449
And it never hit the States
because I think

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:55.969
of licensing deals.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:56.520
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.532
I didn't play that.

00:34:57.532 --> 00:34:58.700
I've heard of it, though.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: I remember,
actually, I don't think I got

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.100
much past the first level.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.530
The first level was really fun
because you were on the

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.380
giant's table from Mickey
and the Beanstalk.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.050
And you know, you were jumping
on the jello and the cakes and

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.537
stuff like that.

00:35:09.537 --> 00:35:11.380
It was really cool.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.140
DAN GALPIN: So let's see,
anything else coming off the

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.180
live stream?

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.072
LOUIS: So you guys mentioned
AndEngine.

00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:18.964
And Jim McLeod said
you guys love it.

00:35:18.964 --> 00:35:22.275
What do you think
about libgdx?

00:35:22.275 --> 00:35:24.800
DAN GALPIN: I don't have
experience with it.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: We haven't
tried it.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:30.970
So as far as loving AndEngine,
what I like about AndEngine is

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.720
that they've done a really,
really good job of building a

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.055
usable 2D, sprite/tile gaming
framework on top of the

00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:40.820
Android APIs.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.010
And I've seen a lot of great
games come out of AndEngine,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.690
so I always kind of smile when
I see another AndEngine game.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.800
Also, Nicholas really has
done a great job.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.780
And it's one of the nice things
that Zynga has actually

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.230
brought back to the community is
that they've contributed a

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.330
lot of lines of source
since he's been

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.540
there back into AndEngine.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.450
So I don't usually get to say
kudos to Zynga very often, but

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.240
kudos to Zynga for continuing
that effort.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.790
LOUIS: And this is not for Ian
because he hates people, but

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.745
are you disappointed by the
limited number of games that

00:36:12.745 --> 00:36:15.200
have multi-player?

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.640
DAN GALPIN: I would say
definitely, yes.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.540
We're starting to see more.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.660
There's been more
and more games.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.010
And also--

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let me just
answer that, even though

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.360
nobody wanted me to.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.260
Yes, you're right, I cannot get
enough of racist teenagers

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.120
who spend all their time getting
better than me at all

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.760
games all the time ever.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.400
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, no, I would
say that there's different

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.300
kinds of games too.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.720
There are games that work very,
very well with anonymous

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.760
matchmaking.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.010
And anonymous is kind of cool.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:48.800
A lot times there's no

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.270
communication between the players.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.580
So I don't even get to find
out the way that they feel

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.765
about gay people, for example.

00:36:55.765 --> 00:36:56.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, it's true.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.890
I mean, I have a weekly
"StarCraft"

00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.910
match with my buddies.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.010
And we play on one team
and we get matched

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.220
against some other team.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.780
And usually the conversation is,
hey, good luck, have fun.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.900
And sometimes it's them
trash-talking, which is always

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.330
good because you know when
somebody trash-talks in

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.210
"StarCraft" they have to
do it over text chat.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.200
So obviously their actions
permitted are going down.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.300
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.790
Exactly, when you have the U-R
S-O G-A-E, it's like--

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:33.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think the main
problem is that a multi-player

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.770
game, at least for me,
is an appointment.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:45.630
So when I have an appointment,
I have devices that I can be

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.840
at at a specific time
that are much, much

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.890
faster than a phone.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.800
So I don't usually look for a
multi-player game on the phone

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.830
because I'm probably going
to sit down at my desktop

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.270
computer, which is 100
times more powerful.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:03.700
But what I do really enjoy is
the idea of being able to do a

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.570
synchronous multi-player
on the phone.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.390
And I don't think that I would
be like this, but I can

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:15.750
totally see a lot of people
that would be into the

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.430
experience of doing a quick
enough LAN session or

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.210
something like that.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.270
DAN GALPIN: Well,
I love anonymous

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.210
matchmaking, actually.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.730
I think that mobile really
lends to it.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:25.920
I've got five minutes here.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.940
I have no time to
grab friends.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.670
And that happened all the
time, even in "World of

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.240
Warcraft." You'd run into a
bunch of people-- hey, we're

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.060
all about to do this
same mission.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.090
Awesome, can I join you?

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.310
Yes, let's go to kill the

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.830
blah-blah and get the blah-blah.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.940
And so that kind of stuff, I
think, lends itself very, very

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.140
well to mobile.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.730
An example would be "Dungeon
Hunter 3," actually, has a

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.280
mode where you say, hey,
I've got a room.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.190
Let's find other people.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.340
Let's go attack this.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.670
That works really well, and you
don't have to find a whole

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.230
bunch of friends to do it.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.720
And you can actually chat.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.340
But it's such a pain to chat on
mobile that it leaves the

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.200
conversation, actually,
relatively short.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's
really tough.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.990
I don't think that I really got
into multi-player gaming

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.420
until voice chat became
ubiquitous.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.030
Now, theoretically, there
wouldn't be anything stopping

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.630
somebody from releasing a chat
client that could run in the

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.430
background and do the stuff.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:27.270
Again, I'm always astounded by
how much amazing computing

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.240
power we can carry in our
pocket, but we're still

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.600
carrying it in our pocket
and powering it

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.020
by tiny little batteries.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.190
It's nothing compared to
something that you

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.940
plug into the wall.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.130
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's true.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.880
And I think that we're
going to get there.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.550
But currently, in terms of
multi-player, I think that

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.240
there are certainly fantastic
success stories in mobile.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.130
But most of them have been
asynchronous multi-player.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.280
Or the other thing that works
really, really well that I

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.030
like to see are challenges where
you actually can play

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.230
against the ghost of someone.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.750
Your friend can be like, nyah,
nyah, I just got this high

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.510
score and et cetera,
et cetera.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right, because
that's really when I'm gaming

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.020
on my phone is because
I've got a little

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.120
bit of time to grab.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.760
And I need the experience that
is going to reward that as

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.540
opposed to having to
call up my friend.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.350
And of course, it'll say my
friend is online, but of

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.240
course he's online because
he's got his

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.060
phone in his pocket.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.570
Everybody always does, right?

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.300
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: So it's tough.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.880
I mean, there's definitely
challenges that we didn't face

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.190
when we were doing the
desktop stuff.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.580
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
or on the Xbox.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.600
You're on the Xbox, most likely,
you're either watching

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.850
videos-- in which case, man,
don't even try to message me--

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.190
or you're playing games, in
which case-- well, actually,

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.360
don't try to message me most
of the time either.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:42.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.140
Yeah, that's pissing me off.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.505
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:48.710
Can't you see, man?

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.040
But at least you're actively at
a console where you usually

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.300
have a fast internet connection
and you're in the

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.820
mood to potentially interact
with humans,

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.580
although not always.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.510
LOUIS: Any concerns about
multi-player bandwidth?

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of course.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.710
Although I would say that the
bandwidth issue is much less

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.110
of a concern than latency.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.600
You can always fix bandwidth.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.830
It's very difficult
to fix latency.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I think we're
finally getting into

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.510
some networks.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.690
Like, LTE has some actually
great latency numbers on a

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.660
non-congested network.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.660
And so we're finally getting to
the point where some of the

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.800
things that were at one point
either limited to either LAN

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800
connections--

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.010
it's kind of funny.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.990
My friends who were serious
about gaming would be like,

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.370
all right, I can't have a cable
modem because there's

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.280
too much latency.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.870
I can't be on Wi-Fi because that
adds too much latency to

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.090
the DSL line, which is the
only thing it provides

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:42.430
[? alone ?]

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.860
of latency so that I have a
chance of not getting fragged.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.650
And we're not anywhere near that
in terms of mobile yet.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.670
But there are certain kinds of
twitch experiences that are

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:59.320
starting to work on an actual
cellular network.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.700
And I think that's exciting.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.980
LTE is really enabling
all that.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.830
So I think we'll see
more and more.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:04.740
But it still is tricky.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.580
And one of the things is, when
you're doing matchmaking, you

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.540
want to find out, how
good are my pings?

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.150
Can I get a quality
of service?

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.620
If the quality of service
falls below a certain

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.320
threshold, what does that mean
in terms of the game?

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.370
It does add additional
design challenges.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:18.445
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, really, I
think, the biggest problem is

00:42:18.445 --> 00:42:22.720
that your ping time is extremely
unpredictable when

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.740
you're own mobile.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.385
Even if you're stationary, it
can be very unpredictable

00:42:27.385 --> 00:42:30.255
because it's so susceptible
to ARP interference.

00:42:30.255 --> 00:42:33.000
DAN GALPIN: Our Wi-Fi
is actually a

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.880
perfect test ground.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.410
If something works on our Wi-Fi
here, it probably will

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.980
work on a mobile network

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: That might
actually be true, yeah.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.250
But I mean, if you've got a
femtocell or a Wi-Fi network,

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.350
I think that there's all sorts
of things you can do.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.510
The nice thing is that the
same games that lend

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.980
themselves particularly well
to a touch-screen only

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.160
interface are the same games
that very frequently don't

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.060
require incredibly
good latency.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.640
So I'm sure there are people
who really honestly enjoy

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:16.710
playing FPSs on mobile, I'm not
one of them just because I

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:20.560
feel like I have so many better
ways to play FPSs.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.730
And I don't have a better way
to play, let's say, "Tower

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.005
Defense" or, like I said, RTS.

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:31.420
And the nice thing about those
games is that while they're

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:35.690
not fully deterministic, it's
really, really easy to do

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.270
latency hiding in those
situations.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.350
Now, one of my favorite
multi-player games, as you all

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.140
know, is the "Big Win"
series by Hot Head.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.480
And they hide latency
beautifully just by

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.290
pre-computing everything.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:53.270
But here's the dirty
little secret--

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.680
you're like, oh, well, yeah,
of course it's all

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.230
predetermined.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:00.920
But the truth is that most
sports games can do very

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.990
similar things.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:07.690
For instance, "NFL Fever" and
"NHL Rivals" from Microsoft

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:15.060
sports, we would basically start
an animation sooner on

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:21.260
the originating client and hold
it out for more frames.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.480
And this is the same thing
as the old "Warcraft" and

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.980
"StarCraft." if you click on a
peon, and he says, OK, I'm

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.510
going to do my thing.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:36.570
And he is acting lazy, well,
that's not laziness on your

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.140
peon's part.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.440
That's latency compensation.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.520
Because if you can hold off on
actually doing the thing for 5

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.590
or 10 frames, which isn't very
long, then you can completely

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.840
get rid of ping time problems.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.930
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.880
And listen, I've played
a lot of FPS games

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.315
a lot now on mobile.

00:44:55.315 --> 00:44:58.380
"Shadowgun" was a great
experience.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:58.842
IAN NI-LEWIS: It always
flabbergasts me

00:44:58.842 --> 00:44:59.690
that you can do that.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.230
DAN GALPIN: Except for the one
level where you have to run

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.900
backwards, which made me
want to shoot someone.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, was
that when the drill

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.460
came through the wall?

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.080
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, the
drill's coming.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that
was terrible.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.500
DAN GALPIN: Just awful.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.710
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was the meat
circus of "Shadowgun."

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.800
DAN GALPIN: It actually was.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.820
And you just got ground
up over and over.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.135
And I made it through.

00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:17.880
I actually beat that
level twice.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.140
You had to beat that level
because we had to get past it

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.630
to show it in Barcelona,
right?

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.590
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, in Mobile
World Congress.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.380
I was like, I'm gonna
pass this level.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: That
was hilarious.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.130
DAN GALPIN: But yeah, I played
"Shadowgun," I played "Dead

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.900
Trigger," actually I played
through "Batman--

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:40.410
The Dark Night." I played
through a lot of "Spider-Man."

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.760
I love "Mass Effect:
Infiltrator."

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.885
Did I say that already?

00:45:42.885 --> 00:45:43.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of
course you did.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:45.560
DAN GALPIN: I played through a
lot of that. "Dead Trigger," I

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.470
did a lot of.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.050
There's been a lot
of really, really

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:52.240
great experiences there.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.090
And it's interesting because
there's two different models.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.470
There's ones like "Mass Effect"
which really tries to

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:00.760
use swiping and to create a
totally different interface--

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.040
and sometimes it just
drives me crazy--

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.290
and then there are the things
like "Shadowgun," which are

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.710
basically doing joystick
simulations.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.570
And it was funny because I
actually don't know what I

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.895
like more because I totally
appreciate the crazy stuff

00:46:15.895 --> 00:46:17.300
"Mass Effect: Infiltrator"
does.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.330
But the problem is when you're
actually playing on a tablet,

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.870
you are just reaching
all over the place.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.440
You're going up to the corner
and dragging stuff and doing

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.130
gestures here and there.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.485
And it does get to be
a little bit crazy.

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:31.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I feel like
that's a common problem,

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.380
is that people will design a
great touch interface, but

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.060
they'll design it around a
particular form factor.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.800
And that's not the world
we live in anymore.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.940
And Android has lots
of form factors.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.300
Everybody has at least two.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.280
DAN GALPIN: Well, my favorite is
"N.O.V.A. 3." So "N.O.V.A.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.680
3" actually has a mode, you can
actually go and drag the

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.540
different controls around.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.530
Except you can't actually drag
the one that does reload, with

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.760
is stuck at the top
of the screen.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.640
So you can have everything
else right within thumb's

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.300
reach, and then you're
going, reload.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.660
All right, back, back, back.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.300
Reload.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.840
So again, kudos, I love the
concept of having customizable

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.340
controls, but they kind of all
have to be customizable at

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.780
that point.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.200
And again, "N.O.V.A. 3" is great
for that kind of game.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.890
But definitely, we're at an
era where the hardware can

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.760
actually do some really
nice FPSs.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.990
We're seeing stuff that rivals,
in many ways, actually

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.370
is better quality than what we
saw on the PS2 and on the

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.480
original Xbox.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you can
definitely get past the Xbox 1

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.030
and PS2 phase.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.190
For me, I didn't actually get
into FPSs until the Xbox 360,

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.970
and I'll tell you why.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.070
Part of it was that was
the first console--

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.560
and you remember, that came
out before the PS3.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:53.970
So it was the first console
that had a unified shader.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:57.100
And it was also the first
console that had any real

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.470
memory, so it drove really
high texel density.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.870
And I just found that the blurry
stuff is really hard to

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.990
go back to.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:10.260
DAN GALPIN: And I will say, I
played a crap-load of "Halo"

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.870
and "Halo 2" on the
original Xbox.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.120
And we used to get together for
LAN parties and we used to

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.995
have Frag-fest.

00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:17.760
And that was really fun.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.520
In fact, I love just the fact
that we had to put everyone

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.790
together in the same room and we
had everyone walking around

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:28.160
carrying these gi-normous
Xboxes and monitors.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.720
Super-dorky but kind
of awesome.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:29.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whatever.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.920
Gi-normous Xboxes?

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.340
Try carting around
your desktop.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.240
DAN GALPIN: Well,
we did that too.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.130
But I mean, that's why the
Xboxes seemed like, oh, this

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:40.070
is so easy compared to
carting around--

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:40.358
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:48:40.358 --> 00:48:42.870
Did you see Koh actually has
a special Xbox backpack?

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.460
It was custom made.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.460
DAN GALPIN: That is because Koh
is cooler than either of

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.910
us in that that kind
of geeky way.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:49.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Where is she?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.620
Is she in Korea now again?

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.560
DAN GALPIN: I don't know.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.500
Probably.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love
how we do that.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.780
It was like, hey, we need to
hire someone for games, and

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.470
there's this person who really,
really likes games.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.430
And she's got a lot of contacts
in the industry.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.020
Awesome.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.160
Oh, hey, is she Asian?

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.130
What kind of Asian?

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.190
Oh my god, really?

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.790
Korean?

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:07.130
Bye.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.420
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.750
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.960
No, I don't think she's
actually in Korea now.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.350
I think she had another meeting
today, actually.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of
course she did.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:15.760
DAN GALPIN: Of course she did.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of
course she did.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.490
Anything else on there, Louis?

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.230
LOUIS: There's lots of questions
around nomination of

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.220
games, either to get reviewed
here, but also featuring.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.640
The developer of "Greedy Monkey"
is watching, one of

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.210
those which is on display.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.049
And of course, they want to
know, how do they get to the

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:31.190
next step and get behind the
featuring committee?

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.620
DAN GALPIN: Well, I mean,
the truth is, on

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.040
a tablet like this--

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.730
I haven't had extensive
experience on a phone-- but in

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.850
terms of something like "Greedy
Monkey," you have to

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.420
look at the quality of the stuff
that's getting featured

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.560
now in terms of just the
graphical integrity that we're

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.380
talking about.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.510
The bar is pretty high.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.350
And the reason is because
they're taking this game and

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:52.880
they're putting it in front of
millions and millions of

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.450
Android users.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.180
We're talking about over a
million activations a day of

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.480
just new devices, not to mention
all the ones that are

00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.170
sitting out there.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:03.650
And so the bar has
gotten higher.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, there's
a few things there.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.710
I mean, in terms of the
bar, the minimum bar--

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.835
we published it just a few
days ago on developer--

00:50:12.835 --> 00:50:13.350
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, we have an
app quality checklist.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:18.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, the app
quality checklist, essentially

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.800
that's derived from the
guidelines that Dan and I

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.410
helped write for game
featuring quality.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.840
DAN GALPIN: A shout out
to our QA team who

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.610
did an amazing job.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:29.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ian Armstrong
actually put them into words.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.210
He is so much more literate
than us when it

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.560
comes to test plans.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.190
DAN GALPIN: And it was
interesting because what's

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.140
great about the quality
guidelines is that you can

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.800
actually use it as
a test plan.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.010
So it actually says, here are
the things that we're trying

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:42.810
to test for.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.070
And then it actually says, and
here are a bunch of tests you

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.040
may use to actually try to
test for those things.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.660
So first of all, everyone should
look at app quality and

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.210
tablet app quality, especially
for games, and try to make

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:56.480
sure that it gets there.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.720
And so part of it, they're going
to look at graphics in

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.870
terms of style, in terms
of pixel density.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.690
And "Greedy Monkey," it needs to
be taken to the next level

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:07.220
in terms of polish.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, let's
see what's featured now.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.755
The other thing that I think is
really important for people

00:51:11.755 --> 00:51:19.930
to understand is that the
featured apps have to be at

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:23.790
least four stars and
lots of downloads.

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.540
DAN GALPIN: Almost always.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, every now
and then, we'll go looking for

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.750
diamonds in the rough,
for sure.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.090
DAN GALPIN: Well, if
there's velocity.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.480
So sometimes what happens is
some guy publishes a game

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.580
that's awesome.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.160
Except that they didn't test it
on anything but one device.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.920
And then there's like,
everyone starts

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.880
giving it one star.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: So occasionally
we'll see a game that has what

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.670
we call a U-shaped distribution
for reviews.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.100
So it'll be like all
fives and all ones

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.250
and nothing in between.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.140
And that's a really good sign
that we should feature this

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.960
game as soon as they fix
or blacklist devices.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.630
And that's very typical.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:00.440
But let's take a look--

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.900
DAN GALPIN: I haven't played
"Death Dome." That looks

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.590
pretty cool.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:06.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: This does
look pretty cool.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.800
DAN GALPIN: I haven't played
it yet, but I want

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.770
to give it one star.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.320
Wait, what is that review?

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's
an awesome review.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.030
I totally want--

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.550
DAN GALPIN: Why?

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.260
Because it won't even open and
finish downloading the data.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.230
That's a good--

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.550
and there's not that many one
star reviews on this site.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.160
DAN GALPIN: That's
unusual, yeah.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Most people
seem to be doing well.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:33.530
But if you look at these things,
it used to be that we

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.040
were desperate for games.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.480
I'm talking about a while ago.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.810
DAN GALPIN: Three years ago,
if the game played and it

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:42.770
looked OK--

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:44.750
but now, the bar is so high.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, like,
"Pirates of the Caribbean,"

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.330
that's a Disney game.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.180
You've got Gameloft, Com2uS.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.910
DAN GALPIN: "NFL Pro." "Rayman
Jungle Run" is awesome.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.925
"Bard's Tale" is epic.

00:52:53.925 --> 00:52:55.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: The truth is
that the top five or six

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.740
developers put out more
games than we

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.600
could possibly feature.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.615
DAN GALPIN: Again, look at all
the independents here, though.

00:53:01.615 --> 00:53:02.370
It's awesome.

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:02.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: But we do.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.370
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.010
So that's the thing.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.690
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, if all we wanted to do was

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:16.240
feature great quality games,
there are a huge number that

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.660
are made by really, really
well-funded people.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.950
We don't just want to feature
well-funded games or games by

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.040
the top five developers.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.570
We really, really want to
feature some other things.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:35.190
But usually what it takes is a
very strong recommendation.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.040
Sometimes it will be people that
just made it really big

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.950
on other platforms.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.400
Like for instance, "Triple
Town" was very big on the

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.970
original Kindle.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.960
DAN GALPIN: Well, "Triple
Town" was just an

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.710
incredibly fun game.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Plus we're
buddies with that guy.

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.610
He's a really good guy.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:53.740
He used to run Xbox
live arcades.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.140
DAN GALPIN: But I think with
"Triple Town," it was one of

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.610
those that actually
got submitted.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:00.820
So "Triple Town" went through
a process-- it got submitted

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.370
to a whole bunch of Googlers
who were just

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:03.905
randomly looking at games.

00:54:03.905 --> 00:54:07.900
And all of them lost so
much productivity.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:12.000
Literally, these people came
back to us and said, you can't

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.320
recommend this kind of game to
us because we just are missing

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.560
all of our objectives and key
results for the quarter

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.280
because of "Triple Town."

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: But here's really
what it comes down to--

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.850
a lot of people say, well,
how do I get noticed?

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:29.210
And we did for a while
run this show as a

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.350
crowd-sourcing thing.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.760
We've kind of stopped
doing that.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.680
We've kind of stopped thinking
of this as being a conduit

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.010
into featuring because
we just weren't

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.160
seeing good enough results.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.740
It turns out that there's a lot
of really intriguing indie

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:48.190
stuff by people who are
super-low budget.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:53.480
But for the most part, the
really, really good stuff

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.640
floats to the top.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.560
So for instance, we look at
the Android gamer sites.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.890
We look at the mobile
gamer sites.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.510
We talk to developers and say,
what are you playing?

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:09.690
So I don't think we're the
ones that are going to

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.140
discover you is really what
it comes down to.

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.040
DAN GALPIN: There have been a
couple of games that have come

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.350
through here that have
become featured.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.480
And a couple of ones
where they were--

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.640
Like "Gunman Clive,"
for instance, we

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.740
all loved that game.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.850
We hadn't seen it before.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:23.640
Absolutely.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.750
And I think that that
will still happen.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:26.950
But you have to understand--

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:27.520
DAN GALPIN: "Word Hero"
was another one.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: --that the
bar is really high.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.300
DAN GALPIN: "Word Hero" here
came through here, and we're

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.550
like, with some polish,
this game has all

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.320
of the right bones.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.320
It's going to be a great game.

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.680
And I've never seen a developer
work so hard to

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.244
polish their game and get it
ready for tablets and get it

00:55:41.244 --> 00:55:43.140
ready for multiple devices
and get a much

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.110
better feature graphic.

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:48.680
And he did great stuff to
make sure that it was

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.520
going to pass our--

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's another
thing, by the way.

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.260
Look at these feature
graphics.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.100
They're lush.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.500
They're beautiful.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.380
DAN GALPIN: I mean,
"Clouds &amp; Sheep."

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.155
IAN NI-LEWIS: They're
well made.

00:55:55.155 --> 00:55:57.860
DAN GALPIN: HandyGames did a
brilliant job with that.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.880
You can see, even "Wild Blood,"
which is kind of small

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.900
and low contrast, you
can still read it,

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.960
even on this tablet.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:10.190
And that's an epic game too
in terms of its content.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.330
You will see a lot of
Gameloft games.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.670
You'll see a lot of Com2uS
games, a lot of EA games.

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:19.620
There are big studios that
are well funded.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:26.380
So I guess the point is that,
I would say, maybe once a

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:30.200
month, a game that we see from
our moderator page is good

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.240
enough to get featured.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.570
So I wouldn't pin all
your hopes on it.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:39.900
But if you do want to be
reviewed on this show, the way

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.650
to do it is to go to our
moderator page, which you'll

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.450
have to search for because I
don't have the URL handy, but

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.360
the Friday Review moderator.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.970
And just nominate it
for the date that

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:50.610
you're interested in.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:51.620
And if it doesn't get
picked up that

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.600
date, nominate it again.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.160
And if people aren't voting
for it, maybe

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.770
ask yourself why.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:00.800
DAN GALPIN: I mean, looking at
the five games we have today,

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.330
in terms of a combination of
graphical polish, gameplay,

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:08.110
all of these different
elements--

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.660
"Greedy Spiders," we featured
the original.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.490
We'll probably feature "Greedy
Spiders 2" as well.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:17.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's as good as
it was before or better.

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.260
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's as good
as it was before or better.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: But that's
a really polished game.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.420
DAN GALPIN: It's a really,
really polished game.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: And you've got
to remember too, we would

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:28.680
really, really love to believe
that featuring is something

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.740
that we can just do for games
because they're awesome,

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.570
because we really want to
support indie developers.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:35.860
It's not.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.360
The featuring process is
actually for filling our

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.010
storefront and making
Google Play a more

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.180
attractive place to be.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.060
DAN GALPIN: Well, we want to
make sure when people download

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.450
something off the store that
they're happy with it.

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:48.100
Because that's what gets
people going back.

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.650
And that's what makes the
featuring process work.

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:53.120
We want to make sure that when
we do have a great indie title

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.860
that comes through
that we put it up

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.080
there and it does something.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.485
IAN NI-LEWIS: So you know what's
really awesome, though,

00:57:58.485 --> 00:58:05.792
is what they've started to
do with collections.

00:58:05.792 --> 00:58:07.550
Because if you go in here--

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.340
DAN GALPIN: In, like,
a tabletop games.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, so Tavares
Ford, who's a buddy of ours,

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.090
made this collection
of tabletop games.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:19.040
DAN GALPIN: It doesn't even
sound like a real name when

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.580
you hear his name.

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.260
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know, right?

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.080
DAN GALPIN: It sounds
like a car.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ford Prefect
or something.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:22.980
DAN GALPIN: Exactly, exactly.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:25.480
He's actually part of
"Hitchhiker's Guide."

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:25.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.850
And it's weird too because one
of the guys that did WebGL on

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.740
Chrome is named Gregg Tavares.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.010
And so it's like, everybody
always gets it mixed up.

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.865
But there's a few things,
like, check this out.

00:58:39.865 --> 00:58:45.700
"Neuroshima Hex," we learned
about "Neuroshima Hex" from, I

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.390
think, one of our
old co-workers--

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:49.270
was it Chris?

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:53.620
And we were super-unimpressed
at first.

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:57.390
But then they did some updates,
and it actually

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:58.560
started getting fun.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.077
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I mean, look,
we even have "Rage of

00:59:00.077 --> 00:59:00.730
Bahamut" up there.

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:03.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, "Rage of
Bahamut," I mean, you gotta

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.480
toss in a ringer, I guess.

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.890
But the point being, though,
that I think this is going to

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:12.650
turn into a channel for
more attention.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:15.120
Because for instance, for
the longest time--

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.030
DAN GALPIN: I was so excited
about the retro site.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.710
Because remember, for the
longest time, we'd get these

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:20.670
great retro games in.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:23.150
And we're like, OK, but we can't
feature very many retro

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.480
games because if people come
in and they don't know the

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.460
retro thing and they don't
understand, then they're going

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.300
to see this and they're going to
think, oh, I guess Android

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.400
games are all full of
gigantic pixels.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.480
And I mean, maybe that was
a reasonable fear.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.390
Maybe it wasn't.

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:40.460
DAN GALPIN: But if you
put it in a retro

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.420
category, it really helps.

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.810
And so I think what's exciting
is that we're actually

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.240
starting to improve the
merchandise and get

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.315
more stuff in there.

00:59:46.315 --> 00:59:49.480
And I think ultimately, what's
even more exciting is you know

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:55.320
what, it's very possible that
let's say that a female user

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.820
comes in here and the average
female-- not to be

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.480
completely--

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.745
is potentially not interested
in "Death Dome" and "Wild

01:00:03.745 --> 01:00:06.920
Blood." That might not
be appealing to their

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.620
demographic.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.000
In fact, what they want to see
is "Magic Tree" and "Rayman"

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.520
and "Triple Town."

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think everybody
wants to see "Magic

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.380
Tree." Come on, look at that.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.100
DAN GALPIN: I know, I know.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.000
It's true.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:17.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: So cute.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.610
DAN GALPIN: So I think that's
the one thing that's really--

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:23.110
or "Clouds &amp; Sheep." I love
"Clouds &amp; Sheep."

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Those guys--

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.350
we still need to go
and visit them.

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:26.670
DAN GALPIN: We do.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.250
They're awesome.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:28.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Where are
they at, Norway?

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.290
DAN GALPIN: No, they're
in Germany.

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, they're
in Germany.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:32.605
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
they're great.

01:00:32.605 --> 01:00:35.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, I only think
he's Norwegian because of his

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.720
boss hairstyle.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.020
DAN GALPIN: Well, he looks
like a Viking.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Doesn't he?

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:39.140
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, he does.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.220
He does.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:40.730
We're talking about the CEO.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: And they have
that game, right?

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.070
"Happy Vikings?" God, that
was a terrible game.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:46.930
DAN GALPIN: It was
their worst game.

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: I hated
that game so much.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.200
DAN GALPIN: They love
that game, though.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: They really do.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.460
But it's weird because every
one of their other games is

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.280
actually pretty awesome.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.500
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, they're
brilliant.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.520
And "Clouds &amp; Sheep" is--

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.774
IAN NI-LEWIS: Maybe you need
to get to level three on

01:00:58.774 --> 01:00:59.680
"Happy Vikings" or something.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.820
DAN GALPIN: Actually, the other
one that they have, just

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.760
recently, which I do
love-- and I'm now

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.800
blanking on the name--

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.610
it's "Townsmen" is the
other one you should

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.560
play from those guys.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, look at how
over time we are, man.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.090
We're so self-indulgent.

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:18.000
Louis, is there a final question
you just want to go

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.710
out with a bang on?

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.860
LOUIS: I would say
that was it.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.046
But if you're really greedy,
you can talk about game

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.256
controllers.

01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:26.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what,
game controllers are awesome.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.250
At some point we're going to
support them, and life is

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:30.770
going to be sweet.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.560
That's all we have time
for everybody.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.610
Thank you very much
for tuning in.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:35.680
We love you guys.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.890
We're really excited to
see you next week.

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:42.090
We will do a little bit of
gameplay, a little bit of

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:45.360
dishing, a little bit of live
questions, and we're going to

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.770
drink a lot of beer.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.130
DAN GALPIN: Dead Guy
Ale set us up

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.540
really well for Halloween.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: I can't believe
I only bought 12 ounces of

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.350
beer to this thing.

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:53.730
DAN GALPIN: I know.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:55.520
Well, after drinking
a Mountain Dew--

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
like bringing

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.000
a banana to a gunfight.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.495
DAN GALPIN: You shot a Mountain
Dew and then you

01:01:58.495 --> 01:01:59.000
drank a beer.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.350
That's like canceling
each other out.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.830
That's like not even
a start, really.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, for me,
that's Saturday morning.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.075
DAN GALPIN: Oh, OK.

01:02:07.075 --> 01:02:07.850
That makes sense.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, we're
going to be back next week.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.330
Don't forget to catch--

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.430
DAN GALPIN: Nominate
Halloween games.

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.840
I'm going to change it
so that it actually

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.680
says Halloween games.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nominate
them and vote.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.030
And don't do that thing where
you get all your friends to

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:19.870
down vote everything.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.160
Because we're totally
onto that.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.585
The system doesn't
work that way.

01:02:22.585 --> 01:02:23.140
DAN GALPIN: Down vote sucks.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: Don't
be that guy.

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:24.850
Come on.

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:25.740
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, that guy--

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Get your zombie
games and your pumpkin games.

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:31.720
Just don't nominate anything
that's like a regular game and

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.710
then they stuck a witch
hat onto somebody.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.640
That stuff is lame.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.510
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:39.500
It wouldn't be anything
like that.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.200
DAN GALPIN: No.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:40.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, not at all.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:41.440
DAN GALPIN: Not at all.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, we
will see you next week.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.950
Don't forget to tune in on
Tuesday early morning for

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.800
Android design in action
with Roman Nurik.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.740
On Friday morning, 11:30, Reto
Meier and I do the app clinic,

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.330
which is now moving in a far
more technical direction.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:00.800
We'll see how long we can
keep that up because

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.040
now it's real work.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.160
And then we will be drinking
beer like a mother every

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.410
Friday until they kick us out.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.840
DAN GALPIN: That's right.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.480
I think actually, they are
kicking us out now.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's get going.
