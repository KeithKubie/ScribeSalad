00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm Robert Krulwich and our topic today on Radiolab.

3
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:07.350
Is Zoos the saddest places on the planet?

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.720
What do I have to do? No, they're not the satisfaction. You know, I'm right.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.910
The point look,

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
despite everything we've said up to now about the true wildness of a zoo animal,

7
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.190
the fact remains,

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710
looking into the eyes of we live animal can be an extraordinarily transformative

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:30.560
experience, and don't ask me, ask Alan Rabinowitz. Okay.

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.660
I am Alan Rabinowitz. She's going to be our last stop on the show.

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.690
I'm the head of a program that seeks to explore the earth's last great wild

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.030
areas and try to protect them.

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.700
Alan Rabinowitz is around Noun,

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.650
animal conservation as he set up wildlife preserves all over the world and jazz

15
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.560
like you. He's not particularly thrilled by zoos,

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.970
although without a zoo, and I'm thinking of the Bronx Zoo in particular,

17
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.290
he wouldn't be who he used today because when Allen was very young, very young,

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
he had a terrible stutter. Oh, I couldn't talk.

19
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.770
My Body would spasm you. So if you wanted to say coming,

20
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.470
mom,

21
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.470
is he Cummings a hard contact coming is the tongue against the upper palate so

22
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.180
you couldn't get the word out.

23
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.210
I didn't speak a fluent sentence to another human being until I went to this.

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
Finally, this clinic, when I was a senior in college, a senior in college,

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.420
I never went on a date. I never kissed a girl other than my mom.

26
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.400
Anybody connect to anybody? I had no friends.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.170
That's how I had none.

28
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.820
I had little animals that I would take into the closet with me and I would talk

29
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:49.760
to them fluently and that's how it was for Alan for much of his childhood.

30
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:54.170
The only time he says he could free his tongue to talk was in the dark with his

31
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.060
pets, green turtles,

32
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.370
hamsters and shareables and and chameleons, which would all die.

33
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.100
I would talk the way we're talking.

34
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.940
I could talk fluently to the animals and his father one time overheard him

35
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.020
talking to the dark. I thought, well, maybe we should take this boy to the zoo,

36
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.640
to the Bronx zoo, to the Bronx. He used to bring me to the old great cat house.

37
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.900
Horrendous. You remember the great gray cat, classic,

38
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.520
old concrete floors, but you'd go in,

39
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:33.980
I mean talk about an experience you've walk in and here growler Rari.

40
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.960
I mean it sounded incredible. Raw power

41
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.140
and he loved being there.

42
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:45.490
He just loved all those noises of like 20 cats all together,

43
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.860
vocalizing at the same time.

44
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.540
Maybe it was the sound which appealed to me as a kid that couldn't speak.

45
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.020
And once again in front of the Katz was with, he was alone. You could talk.

46
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.000
Yes, my father.

47
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.630
It's funny cause he knew I talked to the animals so he would stand back.

48
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.710
He knew if he came too close I'd stopped because I would stutter cause he was

49
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:17.220
there. But if he wasn't, you could talk more fluently. I can talk fluently.

50
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.850
And there was one, one old Jaguar

51
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.440
and I remember as a kid I would stand there and I would watch that.

52
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:28.980
I'd watched this magnificent, huge, strong beast.

53
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.330
This massive, strong animal had blank eyes.

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.750
It just looked blank and it was pacing back and forth and back and forth.

55
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.460
I felt this animals like me cause I felt strong. I felt good,

56
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.930
I felt powerful inside,

57
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.980
but yet I was trapped inside this cage of my buddy and that's what Alan

58
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.620
Remembers. Turning to that cat as a kind of fellow exile

59
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.610
and whispering a promise that I would try to find a place for us.

60
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:00.391
I remember that.

61
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:04.800
I remember saying once I'll find a place for us,

62
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.860
and they didn't mean that particular, I don't know what I mean.

63
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:10.350
I can't really look back and know exactly what I meant,

64
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.270
but I felt no matter what I would find a place for us.

65
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.720
<v 0>And that problem, I would find a place for us.</v>

67
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.830
You kept that promise in his head for for two decades he went on and visit a

68
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:28.700
speech therapist.

69
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.080
He learned how to use his mouth and tongue to get past his stutter,

70
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.923
not completely,

71
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.960
but enough to finish college and then go on to graduate school and Study

72
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.640
Wildlife Ecology and it was at his graduation party from graduate school.

73
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.110
We got the offer that would change his life that my going away party,

74
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.560
my major professor asked me if I wanted to go to Belize and do and study

75
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:52.520
Jaguars, not just study them,

76
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.960
count them in an objective survey of how many Jaguars are really in the country

77
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.490
and ask how do you count Jaguars and that's when the professor said, well,

78
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.080
you got to catch him. Catch a Jaguar. How do I know? I have no idea.

79
00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:07.910
It's like saying, go catch a dragon.

80
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.830
Everybody knew the Jaguars are still the almost Ghostlight cats in a forest.

81
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.170
Nobody had ever kept your Jaguars in the range fires.

82
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.510
That was exactly what the professor was proposing.

83
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.420
Go to a little country in Central America.

84
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.000
Please go deep into it's jungle collar,

85
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:27.940
as many jaguars as you can so that we can track them and learn about them.

86
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.380
Weeks past,

87
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.420
picture Allan on the edge of the jungle in Belize with absolutely no idea what

88
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:37.610
to do next. We opened the map of beliefs.

89
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.610
It had one dirt road down the entire country.

90
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.100
Allan figures the only way he's going to catch a Jag.

91
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.690
What do I do this just to talk to people who hunt? Jaguars. Oh, they're there.

92
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.501
They're a,

93
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:52.000
he calls the Mayans and they live in the farm forest and I went to to,

94
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.110
to the hunters and they told me run them with dogs and one hunter still had

95
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:01.340
Jaguar dogs and I'll tell you of everything I've ever done in my life,

96
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.480
I still ranked that as the absolute hardest because when these dogs get on a

97
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.880
Jaguar scent, it's a blood [inaudible].

98
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.410
You're running full speed through the jungle.

99
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.640
The Mayans are in front of us running and chopping at the same time.

100
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.610
And I knew in my mind that that would poison the snakes,

101
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.070
but you can't think about it. Good.

102
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.590
You don't have time to look what you're running or get beat.

103
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.530
And one time dashing behind dogs and machete waving hunters,

104
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.470
disaster struck. He would just about the actually triaging.

105
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.600
One of the crew got beat by a poisonous snake and he died.

106
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.310
So everybody quit. Nobody had worked for me. They all thought I was Jenks.

107
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.650
So then I had to figure out how to capture Jaguars by myself.

108
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.760
Nobody works with me. Finally,

109
00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:52.350
one Mayan Indian came to work for me and we ended up building traps and I would

110
00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:56.610
put live pigs because they didn't want dead meat. They would want live meat,

111
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.960
which they could kill themselves.

112
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.700
So I put live pigs in the back of these traps and have to go feed the pigs every

113
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.870
single day. The first trap I built, I built it out of two by fours.

114
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.370
I caught a Jaguar.

115
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.900
The Jaguar chewed its way through the two by four door and busted its way out of

116
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:14.220
the two by four slow.

117
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.690
I mean they are powerful animals and then I built ion rebar.

118
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.000
Even then I made a mistake.

119
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.090
One Jaguar got so mad it bit the iron rebar and polled at the eye and rebar and

120
00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:29.040
snapped its canines.

121
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.940
It snapped its own canines trying to bust the iron rebar.

122
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.830
<v 0>I mean its roots were hanging out and I put it down.</v>

124
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.780
I tried to do preventive dentistry,

125
00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:44.781
I had to cut the roots and it was lying there dying and I just felt so bad.

126
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.860
<v 0>I carried the Jaguar back to my cabin.</v>

128
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.170
I lay next to it and it died on the floor next to me. I just lost it.

129
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:58.560
I lost it. But one good thing came out of this experience.

130
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.160
He learned to build a better trap. And so cat by cat,

131
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.010
by Cat Allen was able, and he was the first to do this.

132
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.910
He was able to count the Jaguars in that forest and there were thousands of

133
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:11.580
them, but he had the sense, and again this was,

134
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.780
he was first that they were in real danger because around them people were

135
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.580
cutting down their forest. Then if the forest went, the Jaguars go to.

136
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.730
So that's when he began, uh, the campaign,

137
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.860
which eventually led him to the prime minister.

138
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.170
I was given a chance and not only did the,

139
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.070
did the prime minister agree to meet me, but he,

140
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.940
he invited me to address him in the whole cabinet, but only 15 minutes.

141
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.421
Now remember,

142
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:41.320
this is a guy who for two whole decades could barely speak his stutter,

143
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.740
which is now less of a problem, was still there.

144
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.210
And now he's being asked to address a prime minister and a cabinet in a high

145
00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:51.940
pressure. Make it a break. At 15 minutes or last situation,

146
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.010
I knew I couldn't stutter. I mean I only had 15 minutes. I said, look,

147
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.790
you will lose nothing by this. If you don't protect it,

148
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.680
guaranteed it's going to be gone because the citrus people want it for both

149
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:09.540
timber and citrus. Make it a forest reserve and make it tentative.

150
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.720
Make it a five year agreement. If I can prove to you,

151
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.410
I can bring in far bringing in outside money in five years,

152
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:19.080
what do you have to lose? And if it works,

153
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.420
you've got a Jaguar preserve. You have the world's first Jaguar preserve.

154
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.410
Now his pitch was supposed to last 15 minutes up to the time he was allotted,

155
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.510
but he went way over.

156
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.200
I ended up staying in there an hour and a half and the vote was a tie in the

157
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:34.680
cabinet.

158
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.630
The prime minister himself broke the tie in Alan's favorite and by the anti

159
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.240
grid. The prime minister voted in my favor. That made it.

160
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.580
It got great press as the world's first Jaguar preserve. To this day,

161
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:51.090
it's the world's only area designated specifically as a Jaguar prison.

162
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.060
<v 3>And by the way, the whole time with the prime minister and all that whole time,</v>

163
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.680
he never stuttered

164
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.773
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

165
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.760
<v 3>so Alan decided his work was more or less done.</v>

166
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:07.270
He could go home now to New York and just before he left,

167
00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:11.080
he decided to go for one last walk in the jungle. The last visit,

168
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.240
he wasn't looking for Jaguars, he wasn't expecting to see one,

169
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:15.910
this was his goodbye.

170
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.570
But when he was looking down at the ground as you walked along,

171
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.640
suddenly he thought, well, hello,

172
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.310
because they're on the ground right in front of him,

173
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.680
was a fresh print of a Jaguar,

174
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.260
<v 0>a big one, bigger than any I had seen in that area.</v>

175
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.710
And that just got my blood, the blood going.

176
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.480
So I started following it. You almost never,

177
00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:42.650
never see a Jaguar when you follow its tracks because it knows you're there.

178
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.520
I mean, I was hoping against hope and maybe I'd see the Jaguar,

179
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:50.090
but actually I didn't think I would because they always knew I was coming and

180
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:54.260
they'd always go away. And then it started getting dye started getting laid,

181
00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:57.230
and I didn't want to be in the jungle at night and I'd have a flashlight or

182
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:58.064
anything.

183
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.280
So that's when I turned around there was the Jaguar about 15 feet away behind

184
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:09.050
you. It was behind me, been behind me, probably quite a ways.

185
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.820
So it knew that you were tracking it and it decided to find out who you were.

186
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.230
It circled around and it probably cut off into the forest.

187
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.270
Watch me as I passed,

188
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.860
then got back on the trail and just stayed back a good ways.

189
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.510
And it was pretty clear this cat had been creeping closer and closer to where by

190
00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:33.770
the time I turned around and shortened the distance between us, really small.

191
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:36.230
I mean that was, so, he was in leaping distance.

192
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.610
I couldn't have gotten away from it. And I knew that.

193
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.090
So I did what I thought was the right thing,

194
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:48.170
which is make myself small, make myself subdominant,

195
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:53.410
just crouched down and then a Jaguar did something which I didn't expect it to

196
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.580
do. It sat down.

197
00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.380
That was strange to me

198
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.880
and then I got scared and I stood up and I stepped back because I felt the

199
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:11.251
distance was too close now that that it didn't like and all this time,

200
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:13.900
I mean I'm totally aware, I have no place to go

201
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.340
<v 3>and with no place to go, nowhere to run.</v>

202
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.740
Alan just stood there frozen in place and the Jaguar Rosen hit too.

203
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.750
Just stood absolutely silent.

204
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.890
<v 0>Then it just turned, started walking off into the general</v>

205
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.520
and before it disappeared into the rush,

206
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.770
it turned back to look at me

207
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.090
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

208
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.090
<v 0>Then I really looked at it in the eyes and they were wild eyes.</v>

209
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.460
There was fire in the Jaguar's eyes.

210
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
The last thing I remember very clearly is looking into to its size and thinking

211
00:12:55.751 --> 00:13:00.040
of seeing the Jaguar in the Bronx Zoo as a child,

212
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.000
but seeing the wildness in this animal's eyes.

213
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.570
It didn't look anything like that cat and the cage.

214
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.930
It showed strength and freedom and then we had just protected this incredible

215
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:18.331
area which now would be its home and I remember telling the cat at one point

216
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.890
that I'd find a place for us.

217
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.843
