00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.850
This episode of DNews is presented by Kay
Jewelers.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.160
Every kiss begins with Kay.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.180
We’d love to believe our partner is perfect,
and we fell for them because they’re the

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:18.410
one, but in reality, it’s all about circumstance.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.070
Forming human or animal pair-bonds is a complicated
thing.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.700
There so many different parts, priorities,
and social systems - it’s shocking we ever

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.789
pair up at all.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
While the obvious things, like looks and personality
are emphasized by magazines and love stories,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.350
there are a number of other scientific studies
looking at how we pick our partners.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.420
Framing effect is a social communication theory
which examines how we look at the world around

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.789
us, the FRAMES we put around things.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.420
For example, if you buy meat, they sell it
as 80-percent fat FREE -- which means it's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.660
still 20-percent fat, but you don't think
about that, because they FRAMED it in a more

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.989
positive way.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.519
WHOLE milk sounds super thick in comparison
to 2 percent, but whole is only 3.5 percent.

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.289
It's all about the framing, and we do this
when we're looking for partners too.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.070
Often, we instinctively stumble into the right
way to frame an idea.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.030
For example, if a woman wants a man to find
her attractive, she might wear her favorite

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.030
red shirt.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.170
A study in the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology from 2008 found the color

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.450
of our clothing changes the perception of
a possible partner.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.780
We're not talking the cut or how flattering
the clothing is, simply the color.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.090
It's commonly understood that red is the love
color, and this research supports that idea.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.939
Volunteers were shown a variety of pictures
of women, the color of the backgrounds, photo

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.789
borders and even the shirt of the subject
was digitally altered to red or other colors.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.770
The red consistently increased ratings of
attractiveness for men, but not for women.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.270
The color didn't change estimations of kindness,
intelligence or likeability; only attractiveness.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.369
Another new study in Evolution and Human Behavior
explores positive versus negative framing.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.860
Positive framing is saying 80-percent fat
free, because that's what you WANT, while

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.499
negative framing would be 20-percent fat -- because
you're focusing on the thing to avoid.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.049
This new research found the framing effect
for mating is even more pronounced for women

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.130
than men -- and women are on the lookout for
the NEGATIVE frame.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.810
They presented one of two frames to their
participants: either seven out of ten know

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.250
this person is kind, OR three out of ten know
this person is not kind.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.670
One or the other, not both.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.500
Note that the information is EXACTLY the same,
three to seven; it's just presented differently.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.230
According to their results, women focused
on the three, not the seven and were far less

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.260
likely to say they'd date someone who was
presented in the negative frame!

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.830
The researchers believe it has to do with
evolutionary focus on rearing offspring.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.950
According to them, choosing a poor provider
or unloving father would have serious consequences.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.450
I felt a little skeezed by this research,
so I dug a bit further.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.680
Turns out, a study in Psychological Science
says societal frames matter too.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.230
Researchers looked at 31 nations, and how
each society framed the sexes, either more

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.270
equal, or less equal; and how that affected
partner selection.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.820
In gender-unequal societies, people were more
likely to pick a mate using more traditional

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.960
evolutionary tropes.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.321
Conversely, the more gender-equal the societal
frame was, the less likely men and women were

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:12.850
to choose a partner along the lines of evolutionary
psychology.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.270
More equality means men and women weren't
ONLY looking for a strong provider in a man

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.550
and ability to birth children -- of course,
we can't escape our evolution entirely.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.490
Partners just didn't value those traits as
highly.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.230
And, of course, red still wins.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.290
Keep wearing red.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.340
What do you think of all this?

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.800
Do you pay attention to how you're framing
yourself?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:43.550
Maybe 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.570
you should!
