First and foremost, using hover effects as part

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.030
of your primary user interface is really a bad

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.990
idea. Touch screens don't generally support hover. And even

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
worse, for those that do, your finger is typically

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.420
obscuring whatever you would hover over. Secondly, you'll also

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.860
notice that in great touch interfaces You need to

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.380
make sure the size of hit targets, like links

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.700
and menus, is appropriate. A mouse is a very

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.820
accurate pointer, much more so than a finger. Most user interface

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.590
guidelines suggest using hit targets that are at least ten millimeters.
