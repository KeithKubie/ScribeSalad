00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.201
My opponent tonight
was President Trump's

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.070
White House
communications director.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.405
Here's what you need to know.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.906
He calls himself "the Mooch."

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.741
That's it.
That's all you need to know.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.943
Anthony Scaramucci, everybody.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.912
(cheering and applause)

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.382
Mooch, can I call you the Mooch?

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.084
-You can call me the Mooch.
-Mooch.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.952
-Anything you want.
-I'm gonna call you the Mooch.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.387
I want to talk leaks.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.956
Last week,
White House aide Kelly Sadler

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.191
said of John McCain,

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.660
"It doesn't matter.
He's dying anyway."

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.429
That's rough.
I mean, that's obviously

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.097
an inappropriate thing to say.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.934
It's, uh... You know, I think
she apologized in private,

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.503
and there was thoughts
about her apologizing in public.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.273
I have no idea why she's not
apologizing in public,

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.375
but it would be a good idea
for her to do that.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.643
-But-but I think...
-Yeah, so why...?

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.078
Yeah, why doesn't she come out
and apologize?

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.214
Well, I think the president has
had a long-standing feud

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.516
with, uh, the senator,
and I think, uh,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.552
you know, there's been
a political feud there,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.454
um, but, like, as I've said,

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.689
that he is an American patriot.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.224
You don't have to agree with him
politically,

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.894
but the truth of the matter is,
we have to move past it,

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.797
and I think
you are catching wind

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.701
that The White House has got
a bunch of leakers in there.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.003
That was a hit job
on Kelly Sadler.

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.039
Now raise your hand in this room

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.807
if you've never said anything
that you regret.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.809
I know I have. I mean, one of
the things that I said got me...

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.044
Well, I think
a lot of it is on tape.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.645
-One of the things...
-(laughter)

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.314
-Not a lot of it, thank God.
-There's some of it.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.683
Thank God a lot of it isn't
on tape.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.585
-Just a little bit
of it's on tape. -Sure, sure.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.420
But the...
but the truth of the matter is,

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.955
you know, people do,
you know, so...

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.890
-People say things they regret.
-They say things they regret.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.325
And so, hopefully, uh,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.193
they won't fire Kelly.
She's great at her job.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:35.862
She's been very loyal
to the president,

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.697
and she's not a leaker,
by the way, so...

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.999
-She's a classy person. I like
her. -Well, what's the issue

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.367
with these leaks
that are coming out right now?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.703
It's a bad culture.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.438
You know, you've got a group
of people in there

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.006
that really only care
about themselves.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.075
They don't really care
about the president's agenda.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.377
Um, they obviously
are all anonymous.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.812
They do it surreptitiously.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.648
It's a currency
with the journalists.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.884
And so, uh,
they call up the journalists,

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.886
and they leak nefarious things
about each other.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.287
I mean, the fact

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.856
that they were having
a conversation about leaking,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.360
and Sarah Huckabee-- who I think
is an awesome professional--

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.228
says "Okay, I'm gonna
say something now,

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.764
and it's probably gonna get
leaked to the press" and then,

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.600
the exact words that she's
saying gets leaked to the press

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.402
is a sign of the rampant
dishonesty

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:17.870
that's in the system, and so...

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:19.872
-Or that she can see
into the future. -Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.407
(laughter)

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.743
Well, I hope she sees good
things for you and me, baby.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.077
-Fingers crossed.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.245
Well, there's what the...

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.413
I'm feeling pretty good
about it, though.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.881
-You like...? It feels good?
-Yeah. Yeah, no.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.316
I like our rapport.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.151
Well, thank you for... Yeah.

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:34.287
-Mooch, it's... feels comfy.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.722
Yeah, Jordy.
Go ahead.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.292
The left is gonna push back, and
they're gonna say these leaks

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.327
that are coming out
of The White House--

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.296
they're emblematic
of a larger problem,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.664
that they come from on high,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.299
that people are upset
with the president. Is it...?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.935
Do you point blame at, uh...
at what... the environment

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.469
-Donald Trump's created? John
Kelly? -So, I mean, a lot of...

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.805
a lot of these guys got-got
into The White House.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.807
They were astonished
that the president won.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.209
Some of them were frankly
booking for...

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.843
Who were a lot of these guys?
Who...?

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.712
-You know, it's-it's no...
-Come on.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.781
-There's no... there's no...
-You like this rapport. Come on.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.082
-Who are the guys?
-There's no... There's...

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:04.684
I got... I got to...
I got to be honest with you.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.986
I-I would be very happy
to name them,

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.921
but I'd have to look at the
roster. I don't really remember,

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:12.258
uh, from six, eight, nine months
ago. That's the truth.

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:14.360
-Mooch! Mooch! -That's the
truth. -(audience groaning)

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:15.494
-Yeah.
-See, this is the problem.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:17.163
-"I'd like to name them, but..."
-Nah.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.398
I'm happy to name 'em,
but I just don't remember.

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:22.368
If you show me the roster,
I can pick out the leakers,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.769
and you can put the two dots...

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.671
You don't have to be
Carrie Mathison from Homeland

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.140
to figure out
who's doing the leaking.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:29.375
It's very easy to figure it out.

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:30.977
So, okay, let's say...

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.712
So, so,
but here's the problem, okay?

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:36.182
The-the culture got set up
that way by Reince Priebus.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.084
He flooded the place
with "Never Trumpers."

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.719
He flooded the place
with RNC people

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.454
who don't like the president.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.256
And so now they're going after
the president

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.524
18 months into the presidency.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.494
And so, it's nonsensical,
and those people

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:51.330
either need to stop, and there
needs to be a forcible change

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:53.666
in culture,
or they need to be removed.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.468
-It's really that simple.
-But so, what do you do?

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.603
-If you... The Mooch is back
in The White House...

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.605
Well, if I had... if I had
12 days, I would have fired

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.607
-three or four more people...
-I was gonna say. Yeah.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.176
And if I had 15 days,
I would have probably fired

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.945
another three
or four more people.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.481
And then, I guarantee you that
the leaking would have stopped.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.483
Uh, Mooch, I want to talk
about Sean Hannity.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:14.020
Big news article came out today
that he's almost talking daily

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.254
-with President Trump.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:16.789
Do you like that?
Do you like to see

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.557
finally Trump finding his people
in the media

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.294
so he can get his message out,
like the big Handster?

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.762
I thought he was talk...
I thought...

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.297
I thought he was talking to you
daily.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.698
I'm, like, very disappointed.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.900
-I'm checking in with him
every now and then. -You are?

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.902
-Yeah, yeah.
-Does he like that hairstyle?

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:31.937
-I mean, I don't know. That's...
-The man is obsessed with hair.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.974
-You know that. -Yeah. I mean,
the way you're doing that,

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.642
though, is, like, fantastic.
It's, like, right up there

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.010
with The Donald.
It's really good.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:39.979
-You-you... Really?
-I like it, yeah.

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.580
Wow.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.016
(cheers and applause)

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.885
-That's how...
-If you put a little bit

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.720
of orange highlight in there,

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.822
-I think I can get you the comms
job, actually. -Really?

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.257
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's...

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.025
Just a little bit of an orange
highlight, you'll be fantastic.

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.927
Look, I love Sean.
He's one of my best friends.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.629
Uh, he's close to the president.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:59.699
Uh, I don't think
it's any problem for him

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.467
to be talking to the president.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.135
I think, you know and I know,

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.905
anything after 8:00 on these
networks are opinion pieces,

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.140
and so,
Sean's loaded with opinions.

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:10.676
I don't think they're looking
at him the same way

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.379
they're looking at other people
in the news organization.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:14.780
Having said all that,

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:17.516
I think he's a very, very good
investigative journalist.

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.585
-I think he's uncovered a lot
of things as far... -But as...

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:20.686
But do you think that's...?
Is...?

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:21.954
You know,
the left is gonna push back.

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:24.357
They're gonna say like,
"He should be talking to experts

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.525
"and not journalists
with opinions,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.894
"or opinion-makers
who say they're journalists..."

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:31.163
Well, I mean, listen,
you guys...

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.998
-"...or Sean Hannity."
-You guys... you don't don't...

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:34.900
(applause and cheering)

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.869
You guys don't like it.
I like Sean.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.771
I think Sean's
a very accomplished guy.

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:41.040
He's a... he's been
a brilliant entrepreneur,

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.642
and, uh, he's close
to the president and his family.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:44.777
I don't see the big deal.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.245
-We're talking
about the old gang. -Yeah.

00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.114
Do you ever get
to see the old gang--

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:51.317
the Stevie Two-Shorts,
The Self-Fellator, or, uh,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.652
Rancid Penis--
you ever get to see him?

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.788
I mean, Stevie Two-Shorts--
why would you call him that--

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.823
-because of the self-fellating?
-Well, he self-felates,

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.325
but he's got...
He wears the two shirts.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.727
I like the Sloppy Steve thing.
I think that's fun.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.863
Adolph. I like calling him
"Adolph Bannon" once in a while.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.799
-I think that's fun, but, yeah,
I mean, yeah. -Yeah.

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:08.768
-(audience groans loudly)
-Well, that's what he's like.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:11.437
Well, that's what he's like. I
mean, just pay close attention.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.439
-Do you talk to Donald Trump?
-Once in a while.

00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:16.575
Yeah? Does he ever say anything
about me?

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:19.211
-Yeah, he loves your show.
Yeah, if you get... -Yeah?

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:20.679
Like, I said,
if you get me your résumé,

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:22.948
I think you and John Kelly would
get along unbelievably.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:24.383
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:26.886
Probably as well as John Kelly
and I got along.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.855
-Mooch, tell me something
I already know. -Yeah.

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:31.056
Uh...

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.591
(laughter)

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.428
You're going to see, uh, peace
in the North Korean peninsula.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.596
You're gonna see
full denuclearization

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:38.964
of the, uh, peninsula,

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:41.367
and you're probably going
to see a deal with the Iranians

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.803
at some point, a good deal
for the United States.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.104
That I already knew.

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:47.173
Anthony Scaramucci.
The fight continues.
