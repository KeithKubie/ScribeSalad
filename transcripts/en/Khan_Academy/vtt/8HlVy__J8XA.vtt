00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:02.860
- In the first video on passive transport

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.381
we talked about the most passive

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.686
of passive transports and that is simple diffusion.

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:11.420
And we talked about how small non-charged,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.342
non-polar molecules would actually have the easiest time.

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:16.867
Things like carbon dioxide or molecular oxygen,

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.073
would have the easiest time diffusing

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:21.035
through the cellular membrane.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:23.844
They're small enough to kind of get through the little gaps

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:26.688
here and then since they have no charge or polarity

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:29.957
they're gonna be fairly indifferent as they pass through.

00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:31.477
And then we talked about in-between you have things

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:33.496
like water molecules which are small enough to pass

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.578
through the gaps but they have some polarity

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:37.750
so they're not going to be able to get through super easily,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.766
but they will be able to seep through.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.797
And then we talked about things

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:42.150
that would have a tough time.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.877
And that's charged particles because charged particles,

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.094
and we have some ions right over here, a sodium ion,

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:48.278
a potassium ion.

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:51.077
Even though these are fairly small they're going to interact

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:54.676
a lot with the phosphate heads right over here

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:57.810
with this charge, which is gonna make it hard for them

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.742
to actually penetrate through the membrane.

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:02.925
What I wanna talk about in this video

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.631
is still passive transport.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.976
And remember passive transport is about not using energy.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:10.743
It's about moving down the concentration gradient.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.047
But we're gonna talk about ways that passive transport

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.927
can happen a little bit easier for some

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.926
of these molecules over here.

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.834
And that's because their transport,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.270
their passive transport, is going to be facilitated.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.049
So what we're going to talk about in this video.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.103
Let me just figure out a place

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:29.343
where I can write it, is facilitated, faciliated diffusion.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.162
So let me write that down.

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:34.330
"Facilitated,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.788
"Facilitated Diffusion"

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:40.895
So last video was just straight up diffusion,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.915
now we're gonna talk about facilitating it.

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:44.257
So what do you think,

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:46.677
if you were trying to engineer something,

00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:49.939
that would make it easy for these types of molecules,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.033
either a water molecule or an ion,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.983
to move down its concentration gradient?

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:55.343
What would you do?

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:57.388
Well you might say, "Well if I didn't have

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.048
"to mess with all of this, you know,

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:01.962
"all the hydrophilic heads and then the hyrophobic tails

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:03.744
"and then the hydrophilic heads here."

00:02:03.744 --> 00:02:05.263
Well that would make it pretty easy

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:06.877
to move down your diffusion gradient.

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.672
And that's exactly what has emerged in nature.

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:13.852
Essentially just tunnels through the membrane.

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:17.291
And so one form of facilitated diffusion can happen

00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:19.730
through what we call channel proteins.

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:23.913
Let me write this in orange, for no good reason.

00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:27.906
"Channel, channel, channel proteins."

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:30.806
"Channel proteins."

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:33.266
And an example of a channel protein

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.927
might be this one right over here.

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.840
And maybe this one is specialized for being

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.634
a channel for water and so we would call this,

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:44.051
this particular one, we could call an aqua porin.

00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:46.365
"Aqua, aqua porin".

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.467
Which is just a channel protein for water.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.057
And so you see it has this hole on top.

00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:52.250
And let's say you had more water molecules

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.094
outside the cell than you have inside the cell.

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.950
And you wanted to move down its concentration gradient,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.630
or maybe you have a higher concentration of solute here,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.754
and so we're going to have osmosis occurring.

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:07.532
So the water molecules they're more likely to come,

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:10.000
they're more like to come from the outside to the inside

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.811
than from the inside to the outside,

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.493
and so you could have water molecules going there.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.147
They don't even really have to mess with the membrane,

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:20.005
they're just gonna go through this aqua porin

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.728
and then come out on the inside of the cell.

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:26.708
And you have similar channel proteins for ions.

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:29.033
So this might be one for ions.

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.481
And so, let's say that this is a sodium,

00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:35.415
these are sodium ions right over here.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.200
They're charged, they would have trouble getting through.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.653
But this channel protein might be specific to them

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.374
and allows them, it allows them, to go through.

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.521
And as we'll see when you study things like neurons,

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.732
we'll see that these channel proteins, especially for ions,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.228
are incredibly important for amplifying

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:58.617
an electrical signal down, or a chemo-electrical signal,

00:03:58.617 --> 00:03:59.813
I guess I could say.

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.369
And they can also be gated, they can also open and close

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.110
depending on different conditions

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.537
that are in different parts of the cell.

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.428
So these channel proteins they could just be open.

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:09.867
Or they could be open and closed,

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:12.325
gated, based on different conditions.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:14.032
Which you can see that's actually key

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:16.144
to what happens in nerve cells,

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:18.173
that we'll see in future videos.

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.226
Now another type of facilitated diffusion can occur

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:25.973
through what we call carrier proteins, "carrier proteins".

00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:28.838
And I wanna be clear I'm gonna talk about carrier proteins

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.571
but people are still studying exactly how they work.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.702
But the view is, okay let me just draw the membrane here.

00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:38.289
Let me draw, let me draw, a membrane.

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.554
I'm gonna draw a carrier protein in the membrane.

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:45.257
So this is a...

00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:50.112
This is a cross-section of my membrane.

00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:54.820
My phospholipid bilayer here, almost done.

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.461
And then a carrier protein, and the way I'm gonna draw it

00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:00.091
isn't exactly how a carrier protein would actually look,

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.404
but it will hopefully give you the right idea.

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:06.870
So maybe it's like this, maybe it's like this.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.069
And if things wanna move down their concentration gradient.

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.702
Let's say you have a higher concentration above.

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:15.923
And I'm just gonna say some arbitrary particle

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:19.092
has a higher concentration above than it does below.

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:23.346
They can actually attach potentially, or kind of get into

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.586
a compartment over here, and then that would trigger

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:29.278
the carrier protein to change its shape so that,

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.746
and let me see if I can draw its changed shape well.

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:34.812
So it could change its shape.

00:05:35.763 --> 00:05:37.971
This is when it's taking stuff from above.

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.912
And then when it sees that, "Hey I've got stuff here",

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:47.318
it can change its shape to look something like this.

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:49.125
So it could kinda flip around.

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:51.209
Let me get the other tool.

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:55.628
It could, whoops, really having trouble with my tools today.

00:05:57.802 --> 00:06:00.648
Alright, it could flip around like this.

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:03.544
So before it was open to the top but now,

00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:04.897
it could flip around, and the stuff that

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.326
it just collected from the top,

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:09.769
could be dumped inside the cell.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.804
And once again this is passive transport because it's all

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:15.439
about things moving down their concentration gradient.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.181
If there was no cellular membrane here

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.841
these things would have moved in this direction.

00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:20.585
You would have had more things moving in this direction,

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:21.648
in a given amount of time, than you would

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.896
have had things going in the opposite direction.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.533
But the cellular membrane was getting in the way,

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:26.833
but then this carrier membrane

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.677
can facilitate that passive transport.

00:06:29.677 --> 00:06:32.835
It can facilitate the actual diffusion.
