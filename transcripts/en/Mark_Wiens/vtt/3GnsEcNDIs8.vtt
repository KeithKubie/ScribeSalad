00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.010
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.140
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Karachi, Pakistan

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.430
and this morning we
are at the fish market.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.850
It's six a.m., we're
gonna buy some seafood

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.050
and then the plan for the day

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.810
is we are going to cook some seafood.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.763
We're gonna go to a beach house.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.270
We'll see what happens but
it's gonna be an amazing day

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.267
and we are starting at the
fish market this morning.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.850
(upbeat music)

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.420
This is the main fish market here.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.890
We're at the Karachi fishery.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350
Ali, good morning.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.240
- Good morning.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.460
- [Mark] How are you?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.330
- Half sleepy.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.163
- Half sleepy.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.063
The market is already buzzing though.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.267
There are people transporting
barrels and buckets

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.400
and wheel barrows full of fish.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.554
And then the fish is just
kind of laying out all over

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:52.070
the entire area of the market.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.543
Just mounds of fish and ice, fresh fish.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.626
Hello, how are you?

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.709
- Fine, fine.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.427
- Is that the tuna?

00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:15.770
It's still kinda dark so
we're waiting on better light

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.290
but in the mean time we've stepped inside

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.400
the fisherman's cantine.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.330
This is just like a mess hall.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.520
Quite a lively environment
in here, very cool.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.380
We're gonna stop here maybe
to eat a little something

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.980
but definitely to have some tea.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.360
So they don't have any seafood
at the fisherman's cantine

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.470
but mainly what people are eating

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.980
are paratha and drinking tea.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.840
And a paratha is like a fried bread.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.170
First they have the dough in rounds,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.120
kinda like a cinnamon roll, like a swirl,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.510
and then they roll out the dough

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.250
so it has kind of those
layers onto the hot griddle

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.530
in some oil, and that fries
until it's just golden

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.550
and that's just like a simple,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.293
very common breakfast in Karachi.

00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:59.876
(upbeat music)

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.990
Yeah, that's always good, always good.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.710
I don't think this one is
spiced with any cardamom,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.530
I think that's just straight tea.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.840
But yeah, check out this paratha.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.930
It's hot, it's flakey, it's fried fresh.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.640
You can feel that golden crunchiness.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.690
Oh yeah, that is hot.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.270
And it's very good.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.160
Slightly greasy.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.290
But you've got that contrast
between the crunchy,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.970
crispy outside, and the gooey interior.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.820
And you have to follow that with tea.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.010
The dipping method, so
you dip it into your chai.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.131
Oh I got the milk skin with that.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.714
(upbeat music)

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.330
Yeah, that is good.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.267
You still got that crunch
because you just dip it fast.

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.827
You flash dip it but then it's absorbed

00:02:57.827 --> 00:02:59.780
a little bit of that tea so it's juicy.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.730
Okay step outside, good morning.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.480
The sun has risen.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.050
The commotion from the fish market.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.940
It's still buzzing,
just the piles of fish.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.293
People transporting fish
from place to place.

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.434
Oh yeah (laughs).

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:19.787
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:21.400
But that was a good breakfast.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.390
A great way to start the day

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.920
and one of the most
common of all breakfasts

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.493
eaten across Pakistan.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.832
Very good.

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:29.665
Good, good, good.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.010
Actually one of our friends
is going to buy the seafood

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.080
because we don't really
know what we're doing

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.900
buying the seafood, so
he's gonna buy the seafood.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.040
Actually I think he already came

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760
earlier this morning than
us to buy the seafood.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.070
Gonna take it back to the beach house

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.300
and then that's where we're gonna cook.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.690
So we're not actually buying
the seafood ourselves.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.670
We just came here to walk
around and see all the fish

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.170
and just enjoy the atmosphere.

00:03:56.993 --> 00:03:59.576
(upbeat music)

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.930
The fish market this morning was great.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.320
We've now picked up
Joel and Ying and Micah

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.320
and we are driving en route
to, where are we going?

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.823
- Hawke's Bay.

00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:15.656
- [Mark] Fox Bay.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.270
- Hawke's Bay.
- Hawke's Bay, alright.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.260
That's where the beach house is.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.765
We're on our way to Hawke's Bay.

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:24.515
(cheerful music)

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.330
Awesome.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.230
Oh and by the way,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.760
Ali and I have switched places.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.650
Ali is gonna...

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.320
- Hi this is Ali from migrationology.com.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.943
We are live from Hawke's Bay, Karachi.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.370
Mark has decided to stay back in Pakistan

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.740
so I'll have to do it onwards guys.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.840
Get used to this face.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.243
- How are you?

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:08.420
They're already preparing
some of the food in the front.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.290
But this is a beautiful house

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.890
right along the beach, along the sand.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.883
Hawke's Bay.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.710
Oh man, that is bright and beautiful.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.873
The Arabian Sea.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.041
We're really not that far away from

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:29.041
the gulf from Dubai, UAE, from Oman.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.430
It's pretty close here.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.700
(cheerful music)

00:05:42.582 --> 00:05:43.676
- Beef boti.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.509
- [Mark] Boti?

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.490
- [Man Grilling] Beef boti and some kebab.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.560
- They're cooking all the food
in the front of the house.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.181
The beach is at the front,

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.040
we're at the back of the house.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.220
That's what it is.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.280
But they're grilling up
the chicken right now.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.510
There's kebabs.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.310
They're also gonna be grilling
some Pomfret fish and shrimp.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.520
And then over on this section

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.520
they have live crabs which they
are gonna show us right now.

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.471
(upbeat music)

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:19.380
They have fresh mud crabs as well.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.450
I think those are mud crabs.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.370
Just walked in with a
gunny sack of fresh crabs.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.750
Breaking those apart, that's
gonna be a crab curry.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.240
- To be boiled, the crabs.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.090
- [Mark] Oh okay.

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.267
- [Harun] And called crab lollipop.

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.766
- [Mark] Crab lollipop.

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:34.599
And this one is prawns masala?

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.432
- [Man Stirring Pot] Yeah.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.700
- They're gonna be making crab curry,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.850
but at the moment he's
making prawns curry.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.549
- Crab kebabs.
- Crab kebabs?

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:49.293
Oh, nice, on the grill?

00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:51.564
- [Sheruz] No, they're going to be fried.

00:06:51.564 --> 00:06:52.930
- They will be fried also.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.910
Wow.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.080
Okay we are having the full
Pakistani seafood feast.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.730
I am feeling extremely hungry

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.137
after smelling these aromas
coming out of the backyard.

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:05.650
(upbeat music)

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.483
Crab lollipops?

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:08.650
- [Harun] Yeah, I'm broking the shell.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.483
- [Mark] Nice.

00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:12.600
- [Harun] And here's some meat.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.550
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:07:14.414 --> 00:07:15.366
And what is your name?

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:18.150
- Harun.
- Harun, great man.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.853
Very nice to meet you.

00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:20.686
- Thank you so much.

00:07:20.686 --> 00:07:21.957
- Thank you for cooking.
- Thank you.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.950
- [Mark] Are you from this
area, from Hawke's Bay?

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.890
- [Harun] Yeah, no, no, I am from Karachi,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.639
and live in Kiamari.
- Ah okay.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.222
(upbeat music)

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.170
And then just shook it
perfectly so that the sauce

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.423
all coats every little
crevice of that crab.

00:08:14.572 --> 00:08:17.290
(pan sizzling)

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.700
The dishes just keep on coming.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.660
Now he's frying fish and at the same time

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.950
he's making crab cutlet.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.170
So there's potato that you mash down

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.740
with some crab meat that he's
making into little patties,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.143
and I think those will fry as well.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.770
This is gonna be an all-out
Pakistani seafood feast.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.200
They just keep coming up
with more and more dishes,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.330
or just letting me know
about more and more dishes

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.640
as they go along.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.716
Wow, but I think we
are getting very close.

00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:48.563
They're starting to set up the table.

00:08:50.212 --> 00:08:52.962
(cheerful music)

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:05.098
Wow.

00:09:05.098 --> 00:09:05.931
Was I not recording?

00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:08.950
So we're all sitting down
to feast now with Sheruz

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.610
and Alisa.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.550
Thank you so much for them hosting us

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.320
and for putting together, organizing this

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.570
and for inviting us to their beach house.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.950
And for the chefs for
preparing all this food.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.270
We have like, there's at
least 14 different dishes.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.920
The aromas, the spices.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.550
Mostly it's seafood but
there's also some meat

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.500
so we have the best of
the land and the sea.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.850
It's everything you could possibly want

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.470
on a single table when you're in Pakistan.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.284
And are you supposed to
eat it with the cutlet?

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.830
- [Sheruz] Yeah.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.663
- Okay awesome.

00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:39.890
We're all gonna begin
with the crab cutlets,

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.790
which are freshly fried
potato and crab in here.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.900
And we added some of the chutney

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.433
which is tomato and
tamarind in the chutney.

00:09:51.087 --> 00:09:52.130
Oh wow.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.123
Oh it's so good.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.800
You taste that crab and
then the potato is just like

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.883
mashed up in there.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.010
And that chutney, you were
right about that chutney.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.000
It's unbelievable.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.833
Thank you.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.410
That chutney, it's tomato and tamarind

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.950
so it has a tartness to it,
and then at the same time

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.904
it has like you can taste the
spices and the cumin in there.

00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:17.070
(cheerful music)

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.160
This just like melts in your mouth.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.420
The next dish that we have to try first

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.700
is the crab lollipop which
are the claws, de-shelled,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.050
and then with that
curry sauce all over it.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.990
This is beautiful.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.003
And so you just grab one of the claws.

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:37.111
(cheerful music)

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.780
Yeah.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.860
That is just like way better
than any sugar-filled lollipop

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.550
you could ever have.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.330
And it's just as sweet,
and then just coated

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.930
in that contrasting blend of of spices.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.830
Unbelievably good.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.450
You can taste all the spices
and yet they're all just like

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.260
balanced to perfection
and you wanna just lick

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.273
every crevice of that crab.

00:11:06.273 --> 00:11:09.023
(cheerful music)

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.343
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.580
- Oh with the tamarind.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.240
Just like brings out the flavor.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.060
- And then behind it
there's this sweetness

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.390
of the prawn itself.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.230
- Put some of this onto the plate.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.870
Oh and you can sees whole cinnamon sticks.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.507
You can just see all those spices.

00:11:37.507 --> 00:11:38.340
You can see the chilies in there.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.423
You can just see that rich sauce.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.893
(upbeat music)

00:11:49.924 --> 00:11:51.841
It's crazy, crazy good.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.920
It's such a harmony of spices

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.770
and you can actually taste
the tomatoes I think in there.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.680
Has that kind of tomatoey tartness.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.410
Then blended with all the
spices, the little prawns.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.110
Now it's time to just go head first

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.360
and just dive into the
food, dive into the seafood

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.110
and just go all out.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.210
Tamarind chutney?
- Yeah, this one.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.043
- Alright.

00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:13.227
Ali has said that the
chicken is amazing too.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.260
Chicken tikka, that's unbelievable.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.880
Like all of the moisture and juices

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.960
have just been absorbed and held up

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.920
within the side of the chicken.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.753
That's real perfect.

00:12:30.753 --> 00:12:32.803
And then into the tamarind chutney again.

00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:37.758
Mmm.

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:39.060
You can taste the sour tamarind.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.500
It's tart.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.520
It tastes like there's some mint

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.400
and maybe coriander inside of it as well.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.963
Okay, next up our beef bihari.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.983
(upbeat music)

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.183
You're just gonna be licking
your fingers this entire meal.

00:13:14.312 --> 00:13:17.610
It's just dish after
dish of just pure joy.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.649
And that fish has a real
buttery texture to it.

00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:22.940
That has been shallow fried
too, it has that crispy edge.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.880
You can taste all that salt crust,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.253
the spice crust on there.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.313
Another plate of crab curry.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.863
Lollipops, they refilled it.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.080
Nice.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.263
Thank you very much.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.890
There's nothing greater than
a refilled plate of lollipops,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.943
crab lollipops.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.463
Some more fresh lollipops.

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:48.167
(cheerful music)

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.910
That just slides right out.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.743
Oh wow.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.760
Even with that blend of spices
and the curry coating it,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.960
the sweetness of the crab
just like penetrates through

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.240
that entire spice but then both the spice

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.994
and the sweetness of the
crab compliment each other.

00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:12.443
I'm gonna dip that tail
into the tamarind chutney.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.870
Yeah Pomfret is one of my favorite fishes.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.190
Fish, because of the
texture and the juiciness

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.690
and again, the fish is coated in spices

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.810
before being grilled.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.540
And then with that tamarind chutney.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.410
That tamarind chutney is such a perfect

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.543
sourness and tartness.

00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:32.700
(cheerful music)

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.533
Kebab.

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:37.850
It just collapses in your mouth.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.490
Everything is spectacular but
I think the two best things

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.120
are the lollipop crab drum stick curry

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.973
as well as that prawn Karahi curry.

00:14:47.347 --> 00:14:49.759
(cheerful music)

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:52.420
That's just unbelievably flavorful.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.870
I love how it's not oily but
it's just like pure spices.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.320
You taste that tomato mash.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.130
You taste the black pepper in there,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.600
the turmeric, the cumin.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.720
Every now and then you
chomp down on a cumin seed.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.720
Sauce is so enriching both to
your mouth and to your life.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.880
This is a tomato chutney
loaded with spices

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.180
and also tamarind, and then that chile.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.050
I'm gonna try to pile this all up

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.913
onto this bite of fish.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.270
That chile just like burst with juice.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.320
Not too spicy but very fragrant.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.430
And then that chutney, yeah
that chutney is award winning.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.040
Okay another fresh pomfret
right off the grill.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.873
It's hot.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.133
Oh it's so juicy.

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:42.369
(relaxed music)

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.330
I just can't stop,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.840
and partly I can't stop
because I'm in one of the most

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.790
breathable expandable outfits.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.660
That's one of the best reasons.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.910
As your stomach expands you
just continue to feel great.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.954
There's no belt to loosen.

00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:05.704
(cheerful music)

00:16:10.677 --> 00:16:13.830
(waves crashing)

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.620
Kinda windy out here but we
just finished with lunch.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.010
That was an incredibly delicious meal.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.130
One of the best Pakistani meals we've had

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.370
on this entire trip.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.170
And this is actually our
final day in Pakistan.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.180
Tonight we fly out from
Karachi back to Bangkok.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.060
So what a meal to end with.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.940
A massive thank you to Sharuz and Alisa

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.440
for hosting us at their beach home.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.700
For all the chefs that prepared the meal,

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.450
it was spectacular.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.800
From here we're driving back to Karachi.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.200
Well I guess we're still
kind of in Karachi here

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.770
but anyways this is,
what a beautiful place.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.550
What a spectacular seafood meal.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.610
Oh man.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.760
And that ocean breeze.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.276
(cheerful music)

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:55.347
- Very nice to meet you.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.054

(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.691
Very, very much.

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:04.700
- No, thank you for reminding us

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.890
that we live in a beautiful country.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.810
- [Mark] And an amazing culture.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.510
- If you come again, let us know.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.150
- Thank you, yes.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.750
Thank you so much
- Always welcome.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.583
for hosting us.

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:19.669
(cheerful music)

00:17:20.523 --> 00:17:22.356
Thank you so much man.

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:29.290
(speaker announcing airline information)

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.600
Just made it to the airport in Karachi.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.900
Today was the final day
of our trip in Pakistan

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.830
and it was an amazing
day to end this entire,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.670
to wrap up this entire
Pakistan food and travel series

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.250

of every single day of this entire trip.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.160
It has been a trip of a lifetime.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.653
The people that we encountered.

00:17:57.613 --> 00:18:00.200
All the way from Lahore to Peshawar

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.447
to the Hunza Valley and
all of Gilgit-Balkistan.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.900
And then finally ending in Karachi.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.330
We've met just countless people

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.516
that have just been so
kind and so generous

00:18:13.516 --> 00:18:16.570
and showed us such a welcome to Pakistan.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.070
I wanna say a massive thank you to Ali.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.510
He organized our entire
trip from start to finish,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.880
starting with the visa.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.350
Our entire trip to Pakistan

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.460
would not have even been
possible without Ali.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.660
Check him out, I'll have his Instagram

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.010

but he's an amazing guy.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.603
Thank you, Ali.

00:18:36.603 --> 00:18:37.820
Thank you very, very much.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.190
It was a trip of a lifetime.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.270

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.600
