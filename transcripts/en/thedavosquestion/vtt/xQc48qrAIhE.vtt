00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:04.429
James Chapman

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:10.170
James: My feeling is that China is being well
managed and the government have provided necessary

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:21.400
stimuluses to promote growth within China.
And so, Ithink China will pull out all right.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.160
With regard to the world generally, it seems
to me that the Chinese, one way or the other,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.480
earn a great deal of assets which are denominated
in U.S. dollars and they will want to protect

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.030
the value of those assets and so they will
probably not sell them. And so, therefore,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.640
the Chinese government and China generally
speaking will not make the recession worse

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.210
and I don't think that the growth in China
will have a great deal of direct impact on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.649
pulling the West, essentially the West, out
of the recession. I think the West will pull

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.140
itself out of the recession. I've got great
confidence in that. But, so that's my view,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:21.890
my overall view on this question. I'm a frequent
visitor to China and I know that China will

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.409
survive very well and will continue to prosper,
though I'm not quite sure that that will have

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.810
a direct impact on the general recession in
the West. So, that's my answer.
