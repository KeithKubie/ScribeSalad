00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.780
The speed of light is
3 times 10 to the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.520
eighth meters per second.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.320
If it takes 5 times 10 to the
second, or 5 times 100, or

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.450
however you want to view it,
seconds for light to travel

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.470
from the Sun to the Earth, what
is the distance in meters

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.790
between the Sun and the Earth?

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.510
Express your answer in
scientific notation.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.150
So this is a simple distance
is equal to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.440
rate times time problem.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.690
And I think what they really
want to test is our ability to

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.410
manipulate numbers in
scientific notation.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.750
So what is our rate here?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.320
What is the speed of the
thing in question?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
Well they tell us right here,
the speed of light is 3 times

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.590
10 to the eighth meters
per second.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.840
So we could write that down.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.000
And then what is the time?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.760
They say if it takes 5 times 10
to the second seconds for

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.670
light to travel from the
Sun to the Earth,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.920
so that's the time.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.330
And they say what's the
distance in meters?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.680
So I just take the product
of these two things.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.635
The distance is just going to
be the product of 3 times 10

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:32.210
to the eighth and 5
times 10 squared.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.670
Now, what's fun about scientific
notation is that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.100
you can just rearrange the
numbers you're taking the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.360
products of, because that's
just the property of

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.340
multiplication, if everything
is just being multiplied,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.220
order doesn't matter.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.080
And so we could rewrite this
right here as 3 times 5, I'll

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.320
try to keep the colors the same,
3 times 5 times 10 to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.670
the eighth times 10 squared.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.060
And let's see what happens
to the units.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.949
You have meters per second
times seconds.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.120
Second in the numerator, second
in the denominator,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.000
they cancel out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
And you're left just with
that meters over there.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.630
And that is nice because our
answer needs to be in meters.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.080
The distance in meters between
the Sun and the Earth.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.750
So what's this going to be?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.370
So you have a 3 times
a 5 right here.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.710
That's 15.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.960
And then you have that being
multiplied by 10 to the eighth

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.940
times 10 squared.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.490
10 to the eighth times
10 squared, that's 10

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.040
to the 8 plus 2.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.520
Or 10 to the tenth power.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.470
So the distance is 15 times
10 to the tenth meters.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.200
Now you might say,
hey, I'm done.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.710
That is the distance.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.690
And that looks like scientific
notation.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.390
I have some number times
some power of 10.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.010
But remember, if you really want
to be formal about your

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.720
scientific notation, this number
right here has to be

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.030
less then 10.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.950
The way I've written it right
now, it is clearly

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.030
not less than 10.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.460
So how can we rewrite it?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.970
Well what's 15?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.780
15 is the same thing
as 1.5 times 10.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.560
So we could write 15
as 1.5 times 10.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.360
And then it's going to be that
times 10 to the tenth.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
And of course, we have
our units there,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.820
meters right there.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.150
And now we're really close.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.210
We have 1.5 times 10.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.790
Or we could view that as 1.5
times 10 to the first times 10

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.630
to the tenth.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.570
And then we have 10 to the first
times 10 to the tenth.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.460
That is just 10 to
the eleventh.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.160
So the total distance from
the Sun to the Earth, in

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.550
scientific notation, is 1.5
times these guys, which is 10

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.200
to the eleventh meters.
