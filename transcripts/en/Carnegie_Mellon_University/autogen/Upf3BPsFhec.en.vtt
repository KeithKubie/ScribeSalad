every course the professor gives the the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830
every course the professor gives the the
 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.860
every course the professor gives the the
assignments out and they typically grade

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870
assignments out and they typically grade
 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.800
assignments out and they typically grade
the material by themselves and sometimes

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
the material by themselves and sometimes
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560

they enlist the help of the experts most

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
they enlist the help of the experts most

of the time they don't but what we're
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.420
of the time they don't but what we're
trying to create is a system by which

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430
trying to create is a system by which

anybody in any course can offload or get
 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.370
anybody in any course can offload or get
help from the people who have actually

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
help from the people who have actually
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.320
help from the people who have actually
developed the writing instruction tools

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330
developed the writing instruction tools
 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.020
developed the writing instruction tools
and develop the expertise so that they

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
and develop the expertise so that they
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210
and develop the expertise so that they
can use the best techniques for teaching

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
can use the best techniques for teaching
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.300
can use the best techniques for teaching
writing in their courses without much

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
writing in their courses without much
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.220
writing in their courses without much
effort so we're creating a one-stop shop

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230
effort so we're creating a one-stop shop
 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.020
effort so we're creating a one-stop shop
that's going to allow professors from

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
that's going to allow professors from
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.150
that's going to allow professors from
any discipline to come in learn what's

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160
any discipline to come in learn what's
 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.460
any discipline to come in learn what's
available pick the things that are

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470
available pick the things that are
 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.869
available pick the things that are
actually helpful to their course and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
actually helpful to their course and
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330
actually helpful to their course and
then get help implementing their course

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
then get help implementing their course
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.910
then get help implementing their course
get help collecting the data help

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
get help collecting the data help
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.200
get help collecting the data help
analyzing the data

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
analyzing the data
 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.670
analyzing the data
and improving the system as it goes

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
and improving the system as it goes
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.140
and improving the system as it goes
forward I think all of us are very

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
forward I think all of us are very
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.690
forward I think all of us are very
excited about that project because it's

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
excited about that project because it's
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.800
excited about that project because it's
something that could really affect

for a much much wider community I mean
we've had a lot of projects that have

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
we've had a lot of projects that have
 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.530
we've had a lot of projects that have
been funded by various foundations or

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
been funded by various foundations or
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.570

various government agencies and they've
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.130
various government agencies and they've
all hired a staff of experts and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
all hired a staff of experts and
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.690
all hired a staff of experts and
