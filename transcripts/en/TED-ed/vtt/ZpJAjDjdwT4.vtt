00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.298
When Tenrehte was first getting off the ground,

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:10.042
we entered our prototype PICOwatt

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.857
into a competition associated with CES,

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:14.235
Consumer Electronics Show,

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.486
the world's biggest industry trade show.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:20.414
And we built the prototype in my dad's basement.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:22.424
We had no idea if it was actually going to work

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.556
on stage at a live demo for CES judges.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.566
And the product, when we flew it to Arizona,

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.395
it wasn't working right off the bat.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.729
We were fixing software

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.160
and changing it at the last minute.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.363
And I got a sinus infection on the plane,

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:35.560
and I had to get up on stage

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.477
and do the demo anyway.

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:39.298
And I was holding on to my phone

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:40.339
to demo that the PICOwatt

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.903
would turn lights on and off on stage,

00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:43.640
and I had no idea if it was going to work or not,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.647
but I was hoping that it was.

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:47.564
And when I pressed on,

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:48.727
the light turned on,

00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:49.507
and the product worked,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.477
and it was just this serendipitous moment

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:53.294
between me and my partner Carlos

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:55.848
when the product worked live when it had to

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:58.316
in front of a huge stage,

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:00.224
you know, with a huge audience

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:01.256
and tons of judges.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.612
And I think it was at that moment

00:01:03.612 --> 00:01:05.727
I really knew we weren't just playing around

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:06.979
with a start-up company,

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.787
that we could actually do this.

00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:09.815
We could build products.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:10.796
We could get it out there

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.274
and that people would appreciate what we were doing.
