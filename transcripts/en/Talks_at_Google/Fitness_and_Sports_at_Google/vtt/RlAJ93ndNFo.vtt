[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:06.972
TODD GLASER: Thank you.

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.390
Thank you very much.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.950
And everyone, thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.780
I'm really sad that
Anna couldn't make it.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.140
She actually connected--
we got connected

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.640
through your friend and Ben
Weiland who had spoken here

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.300
either at this campus
or a campus up north

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.360
a couple of years ago.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.734
And when he reached
out and asked

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.800
if I wanted to come and
speak, I was honored.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.900
I mean, it's so cool to be here.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.090
I'm probably the least
computer-savvy human

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.070
in the room.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.970
But I can know how to tell
a story and take pictures.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.920
So thank you all for coming,
for sharing your time.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.620
Please at any time, if you
guys have any questions

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.520
about the stories, the
trips, the photographs,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520
I'm an open book.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.390
I love to share.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.230
So if at any time during the
presentation, feel free to ask.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.100
My name is Todd Glaser.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm a surf photographer.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.440
I grew up in San Diego.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.119
I grew up surfing
with my friends.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.160
It was a passion of mine
from a really young age.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.890
We would go to the beach
as much as we could.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.440
Even at high school, we had
surf PE instead of regular PE.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.630
So from a young age,
it was ingrained

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.960
where we got to go
play in the ocean.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.870
In doing so, when I was 15, a
friend of mine had a camera.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.656
And-- well, I guess I'll give
you a little bit of background.

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:26.530
When I was 15, a friend
of mine had a camera.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.321
And there was three of
us, and we would all

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.790
take turns shooting
photos of each other.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.100
We had one camera
between the three of us.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.945
We had one lens and
a water housing.

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:38.820
And back then, it was
a little bit different,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.320
because you kind of--

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.570
those things were hard to get.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.153
Like, even just a
water housing, which

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.040
is the case that
you put a camera in,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.470
you kind of had
to know a guy who

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.660
knew a guy who had a friend
who had a phone number

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.290
to get the guy.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.170
So one friend had it, and we
would all just take turns.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.710
And for about four years,
we used this camera,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.590
and I ended up falling
in love with photography

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.050
more so than my friends.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.390
So I ended up buying
it off my friends,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.600
and just kind of started
getting this rush,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.503
that every time the waves were
good and the light was good,

00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:10.919
I was able to be
out in the water,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.710
share time with my
friends, go on road trips,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.970
go down the Baja, go travel.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.680
I was fortunate.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.057
I got to go to some places with
some pretty incredible waves.

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.140
And when we would come
back, we'd all get together

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.140
and we'd sit around the
slides on a light table,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.000
and we would hang out
and share stories.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.750
And so that's really where my
passion for photography began.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.130
And for the first
five years, it was,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.510
like I said, one camera,
one lens, one type of film.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.000
And if it wasn't sunny, I
didn't know how to shoot photos.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.040
So I only shot photos
when it was sunny.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.380
And early in the
morning, because that's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.430
when the light was good.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.150
That's what the guys at
the film lab told us.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.580
I actually got my
first rolls of film

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980
developed right down the
street at a place called Chrome

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.752
Digital that's no longer here.

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:53.710
My mom worked at Qualcomm
just down the street,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.700
so she would drop it
off on her way to work,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.700
and then two days later,
we'd get the film back.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120
And that's really how
I got into photography.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.570
So I put together
a couple images.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.570
These are kind of a couple
of my favorite images

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.611
that I've shot over the
years to kind of give you

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:10.090
an idea of some of my work.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.055
And then I'm going to go into my
most recent project, which is--

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:16.740
it was a book and film project
that myself and a good friend

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.160
named Taylor Steele
made named "Proximity."

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.460
So I figured because we're in
San Diego, it's our hometown,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.790
I figured we should share a
couple images from right down

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.300
the street.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.324
So this is Black's Beach
right down by La Jolla Shores.

00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:33.240
For those of you that
aren't familiar with it,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.670
it's down at the Gliderport.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.300
What's funny about
this image is there's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.200
five people in the frame,
and it looks like it's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.310
a pretty empty lineup.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.140
If you were to take
a step further back,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.780
there's about 200 people in
the water, fighting for waves.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.260
AUDIENCE: And
they're naked, right?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.920
TODD GLASER: And they're--

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.150
no.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.785
That's where the
volleyball courts are.

00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:53.770
That's behind me.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.780
So I thought you
looked familiar.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.939
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.810
So you know, part of photography
really, it's going outside.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.650
It's being healthy.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.720
It's being an active lifestyle.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.020
That's something that I
love, that I love to share,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.500
that I love to be a part of.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.670
So I got into it far more
about going on adventures

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.180
with friends than I did about
being able to do slideshows,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.640
or being able to make books,
or getting images in print.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.770
I do love print.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.860
I do love print media.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm a big fan of it.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.260
Like, I said, I'm
a little, I guess,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.759
you'd call old
school in that since.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.050
I have a lot of books.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.220
So anyways, these
are a few images

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.540
that I just started out with.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.730
This is probably from one
of my first rolls of film

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.890
when I was 16.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.680
This is my friend Ian Harris.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.740
This is at Torrey
Pines State Beach.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.890
So as we get into
the slideshow, you'll

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.420
see images of multiple time
world champions, you know,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.070
some artists, a couple--

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.410
I think there's a few
musicians in here as well.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.960
People who I've had the great
fortune to spend time with, be

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.980
able to share, you know, very
far-off places of the world

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.530
together.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.100
But really, it all
comes down to, like, me

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.080
and a couple of high
school buddies, taking

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.965
turns shooting
photos of each other.

00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:10.340
So this is my
friend, Ian Harris.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.089
This is probably one
of the first photos I

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.810
shot that really I got the bug.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.987
I was hooked.

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:19.070
One of the things that's
so special about shooting

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.278
at Torrey Pines, which is
right down the street here,

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:22.620
is the valley.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.990
Any time in the
fall or winter time

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.024
when we get these offshore
winds, they all get

00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:28.190
funneled through the valley.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.070
So they end up making the waves
stand up a little bit longer

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.630
and it makes the waves
a little bit hollower.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.476
For anyone that surfs in the
room, you guys can relate.

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:37.850
For anyone that
doesn't surf, you

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.280
can also notice
that in that valley,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.650
there's one of the very few
places in San Diego where

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.470
you actually get orange light.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.580
In most of the other
beaches, if you look at place

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.371
like Black's Beach or
even La Jolla Shores,

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.349
the sun has to go over a
mountain to light up the waves.

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.140
You'll see these long
shadows on the beach.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.210
But Torrey Pines is very
unique in that sense

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.820
that you get the very,
very first rays of light.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.700
So while I am a surfer
and a photographer

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.250
and I've traveled
quite a bit, I'm

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.525
also kind of a poor
man's meteorologist.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.900
So these are all things that
we try and look at and think

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.191
about when we're making images.

00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.980
And I guess that kind of gets
me to the point a little bit

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.540
that all these images
we're going to share,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.220
these are all collaborations.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.494
You know, I don't think
any of these images are,

00:06:19.494 --> 00:06:21.410
I happened to be at the
beach, and this person

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.320
happened to be there.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.980
These are images that
we've seen a storm,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.260
we've seen a swell develop,
we've watched the weather,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.676
we've discussed what kind of
boards they're going to ride,

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:31.739
we've discussed what
kind of lens or film

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:32.530
we're going to use.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.160
So these are very
much a collaboration

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.660
between myself and the subject.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.660
This image was shot
with a wide angle lens.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.790
So I'm probably about two and
a half feet away from him.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.680
So it takes a lot of trust
between the subjects and myself

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.570
to be able to capture
images like this.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.560
So they're collaborations,
all these images.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.806
Some photographers like to
just post up at the beach.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:56.180
They'll go to Lower Trestles
or they'll go to the US Open

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.332
and hang out, and
just have a long lens,

00:06:58.332 --> 00:06:59.540
then they happen to be there.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.480
And whoever comes across
in front of their lens,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.400
those are the images they make.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.090
That's not the way
I like to work.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.445
I like to work with the guys.

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:11.030
You know, build a story, share
a story, and then, you know,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.990
enjoy the whole process of it.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.290
So this is another one.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.470
Rob Machado is a local
San Diego surfer.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.542
We grew up together.

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.000
His nephews that he used to
babysit grew up down the street

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.560
from me, so we'd spend
a lot of time together.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.330
We've come to be
really good friends.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.880
This is at Black's Beach again.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.820
What's so unique about
Black's Beach is the light

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.570
and how it reflects off the
cliffs back onto the water.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.100
Not a lot of places have that.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.410
And again, this is
with a wide angle lens.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.854
This day, Rob wasn't really
feeling like surfing.

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:44.270
He had some family
stuff going on.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.770
And I called him, and I was
like, hey, you know, this

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.730
is one of those days.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.600
It's pretty special.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.058
The light's beautiful,
and it's one

00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:51.170
of these real still afternoons.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.150
I think it's worth
making the trek down.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.987
And he trusted me just
from past experience,

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:57.945
and we were able to make
these images together.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.750
This is at La Jolla,
Windansea Beach, Joel Tudor.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.200
And you'll notice a lot
of the images I shoot,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.870
they tend to be more backlit.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.910
It's not so great
for advertising,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.710
but it tends to
kind of personify

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.340
the feeling of surfing,
the emotion of surfing,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.800
what is relatable to surfing.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.550
There's so many images in
the action sports world

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.070
that show what color
their t-shirts are,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.040
what color the board shorts are,
or what color the shoes are.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.530
To me, I think when
we're making images,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.390
it's more about
personifying the feeling

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.616
than it is about showing the
latest and greatest whatever

00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:35.740
it is that they're wearing.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.679
Of course, when it comes
to commercial applications,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.630
we do that at times.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.380
But as far as the
slideshow and the images

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.490
that we're choosing
to share, I'd

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.320
rather show images that show
the beauty and the individualism

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.170
of how the surfers surf
rather than maybe what they're

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.800
wearing.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.590
So this is Windansea Beach
with a 700-millimeter lens.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.410
AUDIENCE: So you're
shooting from the sand?

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.340
TODD GLASER: That was
from the sand, yes.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.450
This is another image.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.940
This is at [INAUDIBLE]
Hill Beach in Cardiff.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.070
This is the other beach
in San Diego that doesn't

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.990
have cliffs to block the light.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.050
So you'll notice, most
of the images shown

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.830
are all really early morning or
really late in the afternoon.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.320
A big reason for that is
a couple of years ago,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.534
I kind of had this epiphany.

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:19.950
I was traveling probably eight
to nine months of the year,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.670
going all over the world,
chasing waves, chasing swells,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.080
and I never had time to surf.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.630
Because whenever I was home,
I was still trying to shoot

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.890
and I was still trying
to work, and I just

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.860
didn't get a chance to
ride very many waves.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.100
So I made a rule for myself
about four or five years ago

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.890
that was if it doesn't happen
in the first hour of light

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.540
or the last hour of
light, it didn't happen.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.900
So that gave me a whole
lot more time to surf.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.920
And so call it selfish.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.060
Call it whatever you want.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.560
You know, I was tired of waiting
for people to show up late.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.851
The guys know if they get
there at 8:00 in the morning,

00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:53.711
I'm done.

00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:56.210
And it also kind of comes back
to shooting in the film days.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.709
You know, with digital, we have
these cameras that we can go

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:00.126
out and we can
shoot 1,000 photos,

00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.084
and they're-- not say
that they're meaningless,

00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:04.050
but everything kind
of blends into one.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.675
Digital cameras are great tools.

00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:06.550
They're here to stay.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.042
But there was something special
about picking and choosing

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:10.500
when you would load
a roll of film,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.920
when you would
choose to shoot it.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.416
And I think there's a lot of--

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:17.040
there's something to
be said about kind

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.716
of slowing your whole process
down and defining your moments.

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:23.340
I went bow hunting with a friend
of mine a couple of years ago,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.465
and he was telling me that.

00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:27.420
We went out all day,
and he had six shots.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.652
And he got a deer
in the second shot,

00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:32.860
and we were done for the day.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.530
So it was two shots,
and we were out all day.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.321
It was pretty cool.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.811
A great part-- yes?

00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:42.186
AUDIENCE: For that last image,
is someone riding the nose

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:43.284
into the barrel?

00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:44.450
TODD GLASER: Yeah, they are.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.241
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:47.270
TODD GLASER: So I went
out the day before,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.020
and I was just shooting
empty waves really

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.895
early in the morning.

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:51.240
And I called a friend of mine.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.850
This is Ryan Burch.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.820
And I was like, hey.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.664
The light was so
pretty this morning.

00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:57.330
We should try and
make a photo tomorrow.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.296
And he was like, cool.

00:10:58.296 --> 00:10:59.420
He's like, let's come down.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.669
I'm like, the waves are small.

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:01.470
Bring a longboard.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.620
And so we shot a
lot of photos that

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.700
are backlit you could
see him hanging 10.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.330
And this one, as I was
shooting, he was on the nose,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.320
and a lip fell over.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.260
So it was kind of a combination
of an empty wave looking out

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.060
the tube shot and a surfer.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.340
So it's almost
more of a portrait

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.870
than it is, like,
an action shot.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.240
And so I think what's so
great about photography

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.880
is focusing on the
subtleties than it is just

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.930
the peak moments.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.204
Another thing too
is we get to meet

00:11:29.204 --> 00:11:31.620
a lot of really interesting
people, a lot of great people,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.328
a lot of friends.

00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:34.660
This is Parker Coffin, a
really good friend of mine.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.580
He was 11 years
old at this time.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.007
I'd just flown into Hawaii.

00:11:38.007 --> 00:11:40.590
I was walking down to the beach,
a pipeline to check the surf,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.800
and he was walking down.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.580
He'd just broken his step-up
board, his favorite board--

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.980
it was a 6'3"--

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.655
at Pipeline.

00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:48.986
He was, like, 11
or 12 years old.

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.610
I've known this kid
since he was eight.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.920
And when I lived
in Santa Barbara,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.130
I would take him
surfing all the time.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.030
And I'd pick him up.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.810
He'd be starving.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.210
We'd have to go to In-N-Out.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.670
Two double doubles, two fries,
two milkshakes, and then

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.347
go surfing.

00:12:00.347 --> 00:12:01.680
And then we'd do it again after.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.436
So his nickname's Pork Chop.

00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:05.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.049
Now he's all fit.

00:12:06.049 --> 00:12:08.340
He, like, hit puberty and
he's, like, strong and stuff.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.673
But he's always Pork Chop to me.

00:12:09.673 --> 00:12:12.240
But it's funny, and part of
what I love about photography

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.497
is the history that happens.

00:12:13.497 --> 00:12:15.330
And at the time, he
doesn't think like much.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.290
So I was walking down the path.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.130
He was walking with his mom.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.930
And I'm like, what happened?

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.040
He's like, wave at Pipeline
broke and it broke my board.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.135
He's like, I'm so bummed.

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:23.010
I'm like, yeah, but you
just surfed Pipeline.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.760
I'm like, hold on.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.650
Stand there.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.000
So from a photo standpoint,
I shot two frames.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.394
I was using a medium
format film camera.

00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:31.310
I got low to kind of
give him a sense of power

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.184
and give it strength.

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.080
At the time, it was
literally a snapshot.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.940
At this point, I probably would
have just shot it on my phone

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.690
and not thought twice about it.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.620
But moments like this, now
that he's on the world tour

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.050
and he spends a lot
more time traveling,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.340
it's kind of fun to look back.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.240
I think this was one of
my favorite photos of him.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.060
This is another one of
Greg Long, big wave surfer.

00:12:53.597 --> 00:12:55.680
I've been fortunate to
meet a lot of great people,

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.145
a lot of interesting people.

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:01.860
Been a lot of exciting places
and a lot of situations

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.900
that aren't so great.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.460
This is just a low
tide afternoon.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.918
We were doing a
portrait, actually,

00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:08.460
for a Japanese
editorial magazine,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.917
and they asked us to shoot a
color two-page spread of him

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:12.750
with all his boards.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.099
And I thought this was a
little bit more interesting,

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:17.140
so this is what they got.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.571
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:20.947
When it's editorial, you
kind of have the freedom

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:21.780
to do what you want.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.363
When it's a commercial or you're
doing an advertising campaign

00:13:24.363 --> 00:13:26.670
and something that's going
to end up on a billboard

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.080
or on the side of a building,
you don't have that luxury.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.830
But part of being an editorial
photographer at times

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.410
is you get to use your
own creative license

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.577
to do what you think is best.

00:13:36.577 --> 00:13:39.160
He wasn't happy with me, because
I made him jump in the water.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.980
It was, like, November and
the water was freezing.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.080
And I was like, you know, if
you can surf 50-foot waves,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.871
you can jump in the
water for five minutes.

00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:45.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.562
So this image I
shot back in 2010.

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.270
This was probably one
of the first images

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.260
I made that was probably
the most widely seen image.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.920
It's Kelly Slater.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.240
It was the image
that was made to--

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.520
I guess to celebrate his
10th world title campaign.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.340
Kelly and I met in 2008 through
a mutual friend of ours,

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.810
a photographer
named Steve Sherman.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.393
He was traveling
with him at the time,

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.020
doing documentary photography.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.070
We met.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.590
I ended up getting hired by
Quiksilver the following year.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.530
And since then, Kelly and I have
spent a lot of time together.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.620
I've documented him
from his 10th world

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.180
title all the way to now.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.240
We made a film last year, a
documentary film last year.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.442
We're working on a new
project at the moment.

00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:32.400
And I've been very
fortunate to kind of be side

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.220
by side for a lot of
pivotal moments in his life

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.520
over the last 10 years or so.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.920
So this was the first one.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.490
This was the first time we
actually shot photos together.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.280
One of my favorite images
that we've made together.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.280
And on this wave, he
had four different poses

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.260
that all could have
been great images.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.024
And the funny thing
about this, and what

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.440
we were talking
about earlier, was

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.740
that this was a
secret spot wave,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.480
and there was probably
five guys out.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.824
And so when we got these
images, we're like, OK.

00:14:59.824 --> 00:15:01.740
He said this was the
best session of his life.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.531
And we're like, OK.

00:15:02.531 --> 00:15:03.125
What do we do?

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:04.500
We can't tell
anyone where it is.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.660
We can't tell anyone
that it happened.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.580
So we made the images
black and white.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.287
We never told anyone where
they were, because people

00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:12.120
would come up to us.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.860
Like, how's that photo
of Kelly at Pipeline?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.693
We're like, awesome!

00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:15.840
Or how's that one in Fiji?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.490
We're like, oh,
that was so good.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.300
What day was that?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.169
So still to this day, we've
never revealed where it is.

00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:22.710
Which is kind of
fun for us, and it's

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.810
kind of fun for the viewers
too to kind of guess.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.030
And even if you can't
surf waves like this,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.490
just going out and exploring
and having your own experience

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.550
is special.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.930
So that's one of the great
things about surfing.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.870
This is another one.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.245
So again, I guess this is just
a little bit of background

00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:39.210
information about myself.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.650
In 2011, a good friend of
mine, Taylor Steele and I,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.985
we got together and
decided to make a film

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.370
to kind of pay homage to
a great bodyboarder named

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:52.170
Mike Stewart, who in 1996
chased a swell from Tahiti all

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.620
the way to Alaska.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.860
So fast forward 15
years, and the idea

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.180
came up where we should
make a film together.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.990
Part of what I've been able to
do as a photographer is I've

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.270
been able to branch out
and make films and work

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.320
with amazing directors.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.829
I've been able to work
in the virtual reality

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:10.620
world a little bit.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.421
I've actually worked with
Google a little bit on some VR

00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:13.920
cameras.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.410
So it's really neat for
me to be able to share

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.612
these experiences, but
also be able to use

00:16:21.612 --> 00:16:23.820
all the different tools that
are available to us now.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.280
I mean, even when
it comes to tracking

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.780
a swell of this
magnitude, this was

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.970
the biggest swell still
to this point that's

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.740
happened since 2011.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.840
We use online websites.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.890
We use storm tracking.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.129
We use weather forecasts
to be able to look and see,

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.670
is this the storm
that's really going

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.300
to be the one that's going to
make us want to drop everything

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.310
in our personal lives,
get on a plane at night,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.200
and come home a
week or two later?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.460
This was one of those ones.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.940
We'd planned out a movie.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.320
And two weeks later, the
swell of all swells came.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.044
So this was the very first day.

00:16:55.044 --> 00:16:55.960
We dropped everything.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.950
We flew to Tahiti.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.706
And this was called the
code red swell at Teahupoo.

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:02.580
We couldn't get on a
boat, so my friend and I

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.750
paddled out from the beach.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.260
And I was swimming in the
water with a 70 to 200

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.550
millimeter lens.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.960
Swam for about 10 hours from
the beach and then swam in.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.550
That night, we came in.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.599
We went online and actually
Googled airplane tickets,

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.069
and booked a ticket to
Mexico the next day.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.900
So we timed it that by the
time that the swell hit Tahiti,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.819
we had 36 hours
to get to Mexico.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.630
So we flew from
Tahiti to Mexico,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.680
surfed the swell in Mexico
for a day and a half.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.290
From Mexico, we were meant
to fly to San Francisco.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.730
Missed our flight
because of a rainstorm.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.130
Had to divert to Los Angeles.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.460
Ended up surfing the
same swell in Los Angeles

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.150
before taking the red
eye that night to Alaska

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.370
and getting on a boat
outside of Homer.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.970
So in seven days, we did about
17,000 miles of traveling

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.270
and made a film about it.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.910
This was day 1 when we were all
bright-eyed and actually awake.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.040
By the end, we were delirious.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.090
I remember calling my
mom I think from Seattle,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.410
and she was like, are you OK?

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.390
And I'm like, I don't
know where I am.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.430
But this was Nathan
Fletcher at Teahupoo.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.170
Probably one of his
most iconic waves.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.359
So for those of you guys into
surfing, fans of surfing,

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:16.400
I'm a big fan of surfing.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.152
I surf every day.

00:18:17.152 --> 00:18:18.360
Actually, I surfed yesterday.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.485
I didn't surf this morning.

00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:22.930
But I love it, and
I love to share it.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.220
And it's funny, because a
lot of the photographers whom

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.640
I look up to are all--

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.330
they're rock and
roll photographers.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.290
I love surf photography, but
so much of surf photography

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.050
is being there.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.820
I think rock and
roll photographers

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.984
are the ones that really--

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:38.400
not so much shooting
the concerts,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.930
but the ones behind the scenes.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.380
The Danny Clinchs, the
Anton Corbijns, those guys

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.430
are my huge inspirations to
go out and do what we do.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.490
This is from a trip that
I'd just finished school,

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.060
and I was living in Santa
Barbara for three years.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.470
Like I was saying,
I got a degree

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.610
in commercial advertising.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.560
And the whole time
I was interning

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.140
with fashion photographers
and commercial photographers.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.090
I was trying to figure out what
I was going to do with my life.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.060
And the first thing I
did after school was I

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.810
went on a surf trip
with a couple buddies,

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.390
because I just figured I'd done
a four-year program in three

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.050
years.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:14.930
I need to go on a surf trip.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.290
And I was just shooting photos
of my friends on the side.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.748
This was one of the trips that
I did with a friend of mine.

00:19:19.748 --> 00:19:20.650
This is Greg Long.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.030
We came back.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.590
I called the guys at
"SURFER" and I was like, hey.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.000
We just went camping, and this
is a wave that hasn't really

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.050
been seen very much.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.967
It could be kind of cool
if you guys are interested.

00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:34.300
The next month, it was on the
cover of "SURFER" magazine

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.150
and ended up being the
2009 photo of the year.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.410
So this was my first submission
to "SURFER" magazine.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.570
And then from then, I got
hired and everything kind

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.490
of snowballed a little
bit quickly after that.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.480
But it really all stemmed from
going surfing with friends

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.300
and just having a camera.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.890
So fast forward, I guess,
a couple of years, and this

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.720
is the very first day, the
very first wave ever ridden

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.000
at Kelly's wave pool.

00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:07.900
Kelly and I, like I
said, we met in 2008.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.159
And about a year
or two later, we

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:13.450
were traveling probably six
to eight months of the year

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.700
together for probably
the last 10 years or so.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.381
My wife always jokes that he's
kind of like my second wife.

00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:18.880
[LAUGH]

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.910
So you know, we've become
close, and he's really

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.030
trusted me to document
the end of his career

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:29.290
with Quiksilver, the start
of his new companies.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.720
We made the first
photographs of this lake.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.140
It was originally called the
fish pond before it was even

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.870
called the Surf Ranch,
because everything

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.520
was private and secret.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.620
Everyone was an NDA.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.790
So we'd known about
this for a long time.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.540
We were actually on a surf
trip in Fiji when he got a text

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.340
and was like, there's
waves breaking.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.800
And he showed me the video,
and we changed our tickets

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.600
and flew home that night.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.950
Drove all night.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.480
Got to the location that was--

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.680
you know, we had no
idea where we were.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.080
Woke up the next
morning, and this

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.300
was the session that was
the first time the wave

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.620
pool had ever been seen.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.040
I remember shooting it for the
first time, going, all right.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.540
Here we go.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.998
And you know, I
was just coming off

00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:13.000
a 10-day trip where we'd
been shooting all day,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.290
and I hadn't slept very much.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.314
And John Moore, who was
the creative director

00:21:16.314 --> 00:21:18.730
of the project, comes up to
me and he's like, you nervous?

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.437
And I'm like, well,
why am I nervous?

00:21:20.437 --> 00:21:21.520
I'm like, why should I be?

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.140
He's like, you're the
only photographer here.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.240
And I'm like, oh, no.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.480
There was a 16-man film crew.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.144
They had six red cameras, water
units, and all this stuff.

00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:31.810
I looked around.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.280
I'm like, I'm only still person.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.230
And every person
that went there had

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.300
to put their cell phone
into a basket so no one

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.380
could take iPhone photos.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.150
So when he said
that, I was like,

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.820
well, if I wasn't
nervous enough, now I am.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.290
So you know, I guess that's
a little bit of background

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.430
about myself and some of
the work that I've done.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.760
But this is, I guess,
one of the images now

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.140
that I'm really proud
of, because now there's

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.900
going to be more wave
pools being built.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.630
Especially, you know,
all over the world.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.289
Went and talked to
Japan and Florida

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:03.580
and all these different places.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.542
But you know, I've been
fortunate to be able to be

00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:07.750
there for a couple of firsts.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.595
And so from a
documentary standpoint,

00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:10.720
that's always kind of neat.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.178
And I think you
guys can all attest

00:22:12.178 --> 00:22:13.450
to that with what you guys do.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.574
Making something first or
being there for something

00:22:15.574 --> 00:22:17.173
first is a special time.

00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:20.244
AUDIENCE: So Kelly didn't
know this was being built?

00:22:20.244 --> 00:22:21.409
This was new to him too?

00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:23.200
TODD GLASER: Kelly knew
it was being built,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.340
but he didn't know when
it was going to be ready.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.390
And so when he got the text
that waves were breaking,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.330
we dropped everything and got
on a plane and went there.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.840
So a lot of our lives for
the last 10 years has been,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.040
what's happening right now?

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.030
We're leaving today.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.170
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.220
And you get on a plane.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.250
And you know, sometimes it
leads to amazing experiences

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.600
like this, and other times
it leads to going and chasing

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.100
swells.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.130
But you know, I guess
what I'm sharing here

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.149
is predominantly my
still photography.

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:53.690
Most recently, I've
been getting more

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:57.770
into motion photography, water
cinematography, a little bit

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.040
of TV broadcast stuff.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.569
Which is fun, but I think
my heart and soul is always

00:23:01.569 --> 00:23:03.860
just in capturing images and
telling the stories, which

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.390
is the fun part for me.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:12.020
So this leads me into
my most recent project.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.942
Oh, and again, if you
guys have any questions,

00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:14.900
like, feel free to ask.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.287
Technical questions,
story questions,

00:23:18.287 --> 00:23:20.120
what it's like to not
sleep for a long time.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.390
Whatever you guys-- whatever
you guys want to know,

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.520
I'm an open book.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.020
Yeah?

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.340
Go ahead.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.292
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's been
a little talk about, like,

00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.756
the future of
competitive surfing,

00:23:27.756 --> 00:23:30.440
now that you have this wave
that's [INAUDIBLE],, which

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.124
is not the case in nature.

00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:35.076
Was that part of
the original intent?

00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:38.105
Or was it just to
create waves all day?

00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:39.980
SPEAKER 2: Todd, can
you repeat the question?

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.120
TODD GLASER: Yes.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.250
The question was-- that's
a really good question,

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.750
by the way.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.460
Thank you.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:51.140
The question was with the
creation of the wave pools

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.430
and man-made waves, is that--

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.630
could that be played into the
future of competitive surfing?

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.790
Was that kind of--

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.080
TODD GLASER: I think
it's slowly becoming

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.250
integrated into the
professional surf world.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.530
This year was the first
time that a wave pool

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.270
was introducted
into the world tour.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.180
They just had the very first
world tour event up in Lemoore

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.160
last month at the Surf Ranch.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.740
I think a big part, as far as
the business side of surfing

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:27.350
is, how do you, as far as
broadcast on TV or as far

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.772
as getting fan
base, how do you go

00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.730
to a potential sponsor,
a potential advertiser,

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.670
a potential TV
network and say, we

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.820
have 32 of the
greatest male surfers

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.030
and 18 of the greatest
female surfers,

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.320
and they're going to be in
France for the next 14 days,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.800
and we need three
days to run that.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.660
But we don't know when those
three days are going to be,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.760
and they might potentially
be a couple half days,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.218
and they might
potentially be that.

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:54.080
So as far as trying to market
that, or sell that, or brand

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.570
that, or even just televise
that, it's never been possible,

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.470
because TV stations
are like, look.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.770
The Super Bowl, we know
when it's happening,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.404
and we can plan a
whole year around this.

00:25:03.404 --> 00:25:04.820
But as far as
competitive surfing,

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.290
it's different,
because now surfers

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.540
are going to have the
ability to create runs.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.850
They're going to have the
ability to have a practice.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.852
It's almost like the
driving range of surfing.

00:25:12.852 --> 00:25:14.310
It's almost like
snowboarders where

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.550
they're able to practice
their run over and over

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.060
and over again.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.950
I still think there's
a lot to be worked out,

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.450
but it's kind for the first
time in surfing where everyone's

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.250
had equal opportunity.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.080
Now to play devil's
advocate, people

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.837
are going to argue that
a big part of surfing

00:25:30.837 --> 00:25:32.420
is being able to
read the ocean, being

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.836
able to understand
the conditions,

00:25:33.836 --> 00:25:35.930
choose the right equipment
for those conditions,

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.450
and be able to
adapt well to that.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.150
That eliminates a lot of that.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.580
I still think the
best surfers are

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.067
going to excel in
those situations,

00:25:46.067 --> 00:25:47.900
because they're going
to take what they have

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.612
and be able to grow with it
rather than just be subjected

00:25:52.612 --> 00:25:55.070
to being able to do the waves
over and over and over again.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.120
Do I think it'll ever
replace ocean surfing?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.620
No.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.078
I think it just
going to enhance it

00:25:59.078 --> 00:26:03.344
and get more people excited
about surfing and introduce it.

00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:05.010
Does that answer your
question a little?

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.780
OK, cool.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.610
Thank you for
asking the question.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.170
So this image is the first
image I'm going to lead into.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.590
I guess on my most
recent project,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.390
it's called
"Proximity," and it's

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.950
a film and book project that--

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.770
I mentioned him earlier, Taylor
Steele, who's a film director.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.840
We've made a couple films
together in the past,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.392
and this is the one where
about three years ago, I

00:26:26.392 --> 00:26:28.850
was out surfing in Cardiff,
and he was living in Australia.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.177
I hadn't seen him in a
while, and he's like, hey.

00:26:31.177 --> 00:26:32.510
We should do something together.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.330
It's been a little while.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.760
And I was like,
yeah, that'd be fun.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.540
I've always wanted to
make a coffee table book.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.915
And he was like, I really want
to make another surf film.

00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:40.440
Let's do something together.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.710
So we were surfing.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.000
We went and we had coffee.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.230
We wrote down some notes.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.200
And within a couple hours, we
had this idea of, what would it

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.030
be like to get four groups,
four pairs-- so two surfers,

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.140
a total of eight surfers--

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.190
together individually
and take them

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.170
to a place they'd
never been before,

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.930
mic them, and then
take a step back

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.450
and see what it would be
like to be a fan of surfing,

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.910
to be a fly on the wall,
and how they would interact?

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.160
So what we did is we
based it off the season.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.510
Spring, summer, fall, winter.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.140
Each season had a
pair of surfers.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.460
Kind of an older--

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.800
I'd say a more experienced
surfer and maybe

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.030
a less experienced surfer.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:24.040
So we did partnerships
with Kelly Slater, who's

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.180
an 11-time world champion,
and John John Florence,

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.410
who at the time hadn't
won a world title.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.310
By the time the project came
out, he'd won one world title.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.670
He's currently won two.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.817
This was the first trip--

00:27:34.817 --> 00:27:36.400
this is actually the
last trip we did,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.130
but this is a trip we
did with Dave Rastovich.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.800
He was a free
surfer, but he's also

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.260
very competitive with
Steph Gilmore, who's

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.570
a six-time world champion,
potentially winning seven

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.710
this year.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:48.850
Both super competitive.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.990
Both phenomenal surfers.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.540
Both considered to be dancing
on water in a lot of ways.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.410
So we were like,
what would it be

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.284
like to take them camping
in Baja for a week?

00:27:55.284 --> 00:27:56.620
What would they talk about?

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.180
How would they surf
with each other?

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.430
What would it be like?

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.590
And so in each part
of these projects,

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.450
we tried to think
of different things,

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.450
different give them
different scenarios for them

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.610
to hang out, feel relaxed,
and just enjoy time

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.305
away from competition, away from
all the stresses of being home.

00:28:15.305 --> 00:28:16.930
And be able to
experience somewhere new

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.290
for the first time.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.830
So this is the summer section.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.780
This is Dave Rastovich
and Stephanie Gilmore.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.155
And I'm just going
to start here.

00:28:26.155 --> 00:28:29.760
So on each trip, we had
different conversations,

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.560
and just kind of different
scenarios for them to hang out.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.518
For them, we thought,
you know, what would they

00:28:34.518 --> 00:28:36.100
talked about on a dusty road?

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.140
So we went to the middle
of Baja and miced them,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.848
and they went driving
for a couple hours,

00:28:39.848 --> 00:28:40.860
and we just recorded it.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.110
So in the book,
we use their audio

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.470
as a narration to tell
stories and give insight

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.360
into what it is that
they were doing,

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.568
what they were talking about.

00:28:50.568 --> 00:28:53.800
And in the film, that carried
through in the process.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.900
So these are just a couple
of shots of them hanging out.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.505
We just went looking for waves.

00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:00.890
Just had fun.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.810
Went camping.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.310
Unplugged.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.590
Kind of just got
away from everything.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.122
You know, as everyone knows
in the room, life gets busy.

00:29:10.122 --> 00:29:12.730
Even being a professional
surfer gets busy.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.260
They're traveling
all over the world

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.140
doing promos, surfing
competitions, making films,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.910
making books.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.550
It's a lot of fun, but it's also
a lot of stress on a home life

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.050
if you have a
personal life and are

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.330
trying to raise kids or
spend time with other people.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.085
So these are just a few images.

00:29:29.085 --> 00:29:32.890
Any time I had the opportunity
to get the two of them

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.160
together in a frame, that
was really special for us.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.050
With the title being
"Proximity," any time

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.210
the two of them were
together, that's important.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.590
None of these are really set up.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.170
So what we wanted
to do is we wanted

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.670
to give them the opportunity
to hang out, and then just take

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.503
a step back so they
didn't feel like there's

00:29:47.503 --> 00:29:49.870
a camera always in their face.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.580
My job on this project was
to organize the surfers,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.270
pick the locations,
pick the swell,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:04.150
and help with basically all the
details, all the production.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.010
Taylor organized a film crew.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.950
So on all these trips, we
would have three to four film

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.300
cameras, and I was the
only still photographer.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.810
We partnered on that project.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.655
So from my standpoint,
if you were

00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:16.030
to see a
behind-the-scenes photo,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.510
I'd have a wetsuit halfway on,
a camera in a water housing,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.640
and, like, a 500-millimeter
lens over my shoulder,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.098
and just running
around in circles,

00:30:23.098 --> 00:30:24.550
trying to capture
as many moments

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.091
as you can in a
short amount of time.

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:28.540
Because when you
work with a team,

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.970
you're able to just focus on
what it is that you're doing.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.240
But with my background in the
water, I could only do so much.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.725
I really had to
try and map out how

00:30:35.725 --> 00:30:37.600
I was going to tell the
story the best that I

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.240
could with the limited
amount of time.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.210
Most of these trips were
about seven days long.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.680
This trip, we had
the great fortune

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.280
of being there for 10 days.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.850
The trip with John and Kelly,
we were there for three days,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.060
just to kind of put
it into perspective.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.700
It took overall from first cup
of coffee to first premiere

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.380
was two years.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.490
And we're still of
touring a little bit,

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.100
but it's a project
I'm really proud of.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.180
So this was a swell.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.730
And what's interesting about
this is both Dave and Steph

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.220
live an hour apart from
each other in Australia,

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.080
and they'd never
surfed together.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.000
They'd never been on
a surf trip together.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.465
And when we organized the trip,
we called them in Australia

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:16.960
and we were like, hey, guys.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.730
There's this big swell
coming to Mexico.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.860
Can you guys fly 14
hours to drive 14 hours?

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.380
So there was kind
of a bit of stress

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.440
as far as organizing
these trips.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.740
But I think it all worked out.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.550
I think she was the
standout of the swell.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.650
She surfed better than
anyone in the water.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.880
And it was so cool.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.260
And it's not a
male-female thing.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.340
It's a surfer thing.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.100
Anyone that surfs can look
at the beauty in that surfing

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.070
and go, wow.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.280
That's something that I
would hope to aspire to.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.570
And the fact that she was doing
six or seven turns of that

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.449
on a wave was pretty neat.

00:31:52.449 --> 00:31:53.990
Each guy has their
own unique style--

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.614
each surfer has their
own unique style.

00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:59.215
When I say guy, I'm
referring to men and female.

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:01.240
Dave has this really
cruisey, competitive style,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.910
but he grew up as a
competitive swimmer.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.657
And actually, the
guy who he swam with

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.740
ended up going on to win
a gold medal in Olympics.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.910
So he's super competitive.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.880
He was almost so competitive
that he had to totally remove

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.990
himself from it.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.274
Steph, on the other
hand, is so competitive.

00:32:17.274 --> 00:32:18.940
But as soon as she
takes the jersey off,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.170
she can totally let it go.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.470
So that was a really interesting
topic of conversation

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.470
between the two of them.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.306
Dave couldn't let it go.

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:26.907
AUDIENCE: In talking
about surfers

00:32:26.907 --> 00:32:28.365
and how competitive
they are, like,

00:32:28.365 --> 00:32:30.573
I know Kelly Slater's super,
super competitive, super

00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:32.810
focused [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.281
But like, how are the
other professional surfers?

00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:37.060
Like, is this their
day job, and they

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.393
just-- they're totally dedicated
to this during the day?

00:32:39.393 --> 00:32:40.880
Do they live and breathe this?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.070
Are they serious about it?

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.585
Do they just go out
and surf and have fun?

00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:46.960
TODD GLASER: I
think it depends--

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.930
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:48.840
TODD GLASER: Yes.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.100
The question was, are
the competitive surfers

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.890
always competitive, and
do they have fun surfing?

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.780
I think every person that you
see photos of in this slideshow

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.330
will say that they have
the best job in the world.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.281
They grew up surfing
with their friends.

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.030
They love surfing.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:04.863
They love to travel.

00:33:04.863 --> 00:33:06.670
They love to
experience new places.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.380
And they've all been
very, very fortunate

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.630
to be able to do what they do.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.470
Some of them do it as
a bit of an escape.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.190
Some of them do it as a--

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.560
they have something within them
that that really drives them.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.910
A lot of the guys featured in
this are all multitalented.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.899
So instead of just focusing
on surfing, they'll go golf.

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:25.940
They'll pick up a guitar.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.682
They'll paint.

00:33:26.682 --> 00:33:27.640
They'll do photography.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.570
They'll do art.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.290
So they're not so
singularly focused.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.140
And I've found with competitive
athletes, the ones who

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.870
are able to totally detach and
pick up a new trait come back

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:42.440
to their sport better than
just being so focused.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.255
Yes?

00:33:43.255 --> 00:33:45.195
AUDIENCE: One thing
that I heard is--

00:33:45.195 --> 00:33:46.165
I'm Brazilian.

00:33:46.165 --> 00:33:48.590
And I know the way
that Brazilians

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.712
think of surfing is completely
different from, like, Americans

00:33:52.712 --> 00:33:54.895
and Hawaiians and Australians.

00:33:54.895 --> 00:33:59.320
So [INAUDIBLE] changed the
way the format is right now?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.698
I feel like back in
the days, like, it

00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:03.928
was way more laid back.

00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:08.356
Like, maybe more kind
of not as professional.

00:34:08.356 --> 00:34:11.800
And now, it just looks
extremely competitive sometimes

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.952
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:13.952 --> 00:34:15.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:15.750
TODD GLASER: Yeah.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.260
The question was, has the
tour become more competitive?

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.100
Absolutely.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.130
I actually don't follow
the tour very much.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.409
I'm more of the guy that
when the tour is over,

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.860
I get the phone calls to go to
book projects and make films.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.409
I choose not to go to
a lot of the events.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.469
It's not that fun for me.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.468
It's a lot of time away.

00:34:33.468 --> 00:34:36.239
And usually, the waves
aren't that good.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.120
I think with the WSL
coming in and taking over

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.130
for the ASP World
Tour, they're actually

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.448
treating it like a profession.

00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:43.739
They're treating it like a job.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.780
The surfers now have
health insurance.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.070
They have retirement plans.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.070
They have the ability to set
themselves up financially

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.920
to when they're done
with their career,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.514
maybe not have to work as much.

00:34:54.514 --> 00:34:55.889
I think a lot of
the Brazilians--

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.210
I think there's no
doubt in my mind,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.160
the Brazilians are the
most passionate surfers

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.510
in the world.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.875
And a lot of them, they
have it as a way to get out.

00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:05.250
Not necessarily
get out of Brazil

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.020
because it's a bad place,
but it's a way for them

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.950
to see the world.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.390
And they're competitive, and
they treat it like a sport.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.770
And the country of Brazil
supports surfing like a sport.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.680
In America, there's so many
other things they can do.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.560
In America, surfing's
more of a hobby,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.570
and some people turn
into professionals.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.130
In Brazil, if
you're a surf star,

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.500
if you're Gabriel Medina,
if you're Filipe Toledo,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.110
you're right there with
Neymar as a soccer player.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.000
You're respected as a sport.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.280
Surfing in America, it's
a little bit different.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.980
We're still NASCAR,
football, baseball,

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.830
more traditional sports.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.480
And that's my perception of it.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.410
But I love the passion
that Brazil has.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.492
And it's interesting, because
a lot of people are like,

00:35:46.492 --> 00:35:48.450
you know, they're super
loud and they're rowdy,

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.650
but like, they need that.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.430
Like, surfing needs that.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.471
Surfing needs excitement.

00:35:51.471 --> 00:35:53.129
Because if it's just
all hippie stuff--

00:35:53.129 --> 00:35:55.170
you know, the other thing
too is with it becoming

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.770
more of a sport, they're kind of
cracking down a little bit more

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.272
on the lifestyle that made some
of the eccentrics eccentric,

00:36:02.272 --> 00:36:03.480
if you guys know what I mean.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.244 --> 00:36:06.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.880
TODD GLASER: Yeah.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.560
It's different, you know?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.850
I think when Martin
Potter was on tour,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:13.890
it was a lot different.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.170
And when Andy was on tour,
it was a lot different.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.770
Now they've kind of controlled
that a little bit more.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.090
To teach their own.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.100
It's made it more of a sport.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.300
You know, just a couple frames.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.460
This was a shot I'd
seen the day before.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.179
I just love the
shapes and texture.

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:32.970
It's a little bit of
dappled light on Dave.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.160
I'll probably scoot that
forward a little bit.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.067
Just not take up too much time.

00:36:38.067 --> 00:36:39.900
This is what it's like
to be on set with us.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.780
This is our director, Taylor
Steele, holding a beer,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.900
trying to explain to two of
some of the most stylish surfers

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.449
how to surf together.

00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:49.740
So with this project, we try
to think of different ways

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.014
to enhance the experience.

00:36:51.014 --> 00:36:52.680
One of the things we
did is we partnered

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.990
each one of the surfers
with a different artist.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.480
So when we premiered
the project,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.980
we rented out a
gallery in New York,

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.060
and we had all the boards
from the project on display.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.740
We had photos from
the book on display.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.970
We had a full virtual
reality room set up.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.640
So anywhere you went,
we had a team that

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.570
would film virtual reality.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.630
And we thought of different
ways that we could

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.290
enhance the viewer experience.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.620
And we thought, well, everyone
says surfing's a dance.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.200
Let's get these two to
dance on a wave together.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.680
So this is our director, trying
to explain to them how to dance

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.160
together with beer in hand.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.820
The photos are all
shiny and polished,

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.357
but really, we're having fun.

00:37:28.357 --> 00:37:29.190
We're going camping.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.023
We're going surfing.

00:37:30.023 --> 00:37:32.190
We're trying not to take
ourselves too seriously.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.110
So this is a result of that.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.910
They went and did
it seven different--

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.314
they went and turned
seven times on this wave.

00:37:38.314 --> 00:37:40.230
Actually, this is the
second time they did it.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.445
The first time was better for
the film, and they came in.

00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:45.570
And me being the photographer,
I'm like, hey, guys.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.700
Like, that was amazing.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.200
But I just didn't get the photo.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.432
Can you guys wait for it
to get a little bit darker

00:37:50.432 --> 00:37:51.390
and we'll try it again?

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.640
I really want to shoot it,
like, at tenth of a second.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.280
I want to make it slow
everything down and kind

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.840
of give it that panning feel.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.990
There's an old
ballet photo that I

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.150
saw that made me think
of motion and dance,

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.162
and so this was my
version of that.

00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:09.120
AUDIENCE: So are you in
the water [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.920
TODD GLASER: I was on
the land for this one.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.280
Yeah.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.113
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a tripod [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:13.113 --> 00:38:17.320
TODD GLASER: I have a tripod
and a big telephoto lens.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.010
And you know, at
this point break,

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.280
it's a really long point
break, and you don't

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.404
get a lot of opportunities.

00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:25.784
So a lot of the times with the
waves that surf really well,

00:38:25.784 --> 00:38:27.700
they don't necessarily
photograph really well.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.060
So a lot of times, you're
trying to pick and choose

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.650
what's going to photograph
better than what's

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.733
going to surf really well.

00:38:32.733 --> 00:38:35.320
So if you go catch
a two-minute wave,

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.020
it's terrible for photography.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.120
But if you can catch a
five-second wave 50 times,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.460
you have a lot more
opportunity to make moments.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.040
This is moving into the fall.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.082
How are we doing on time?

00:38:45.082 --> 00:38:46.414
SPEAKER 2: We've got 10 minutes.

00:38:46.414 --> 00:38:47.870
We've got some online questions.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.560
TODD GLASER: OK.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.727
I'll speed up really quick.

00:38:51.727 --> 00:38:52.560
This is the-- sorry.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.110
I can talk a lot, and I used
the coffee machine before.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:55.665
So sorry.

00:38:55.665 --> 00:38:56.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.700
All right.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.000
So this is the fall section.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.280
I'll just fast forward it.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.340
We went with Shane
Dorian, who's a big wave

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.910
surfer for a long time.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.420
Albee Layer, who's a
big wave surfer as well

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.130
who's about 20 years younger.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.460
The whole idea behind
getting these two guys

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.930
together was longevity.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.645
You know, there's one
thing to go out and catch

00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:18.102
a 50-foot wave once or twice.

00:39:18.102 --> 00:39:19.810
It's another thing to
do it for 30 years.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.910
Shane Dorian's done
that for 30 years.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.830
He's proven that time, safety--

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.790
he's invented that
inflation system.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.590
So if you're underwater,
you pull a cord,

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.260
and you have two CO2
cartridges that inflate,

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.760
so you float to the surface.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.970
Fortunately-- well,
unfortunately, he

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.620
had a situation that
made him do that,

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.450
and it made him think
about his two kids, which

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.866
is a terrible situation that
happened up in Half Moon Bay,

00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:43.960
but he was OK.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.000
Ever since then, he had
a two-wave hold down.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.510
Came up.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.710
Could barely breathe.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.640
And since then, he's saved a
lot of lives with his invention.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.610
So when I say these
images are a part of us,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.670
it's a part of our creation,
also part of what we're doing

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.930
is we're sharing these stories
to inform about safety.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.050
Because at the end of
the day, we're traveling,

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.670
we're exploring,
but we want everyone

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.890
to be able to come home
safely to their families.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.430
And have a good story to share,
and make you want to go travel.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.940
This is a wave that we
found up in northern Europe.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.500
None of us had
been there before,

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.050
and we forecasted this trip.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.060
A friend of mine had been
there, and he wrote me

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.810
directions on a napkin.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.310
And he called me
about a week later.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.420
He's like, I think it's
going to be good there.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.040
So I called.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.799
And it's one thing to
call on a surf trip.

00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:27.340
It's another thing
to call these guys

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.380
from their home in
their personal lives,

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.810
and then get a 14-man
film crew to go as well.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.500
So there's kind of
a bit of pressure

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.160
when you're making those calls.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.040
We got skunked for
the first three days.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.040
We ended up going to a
bar, and we called Kelly.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.610
We were like, Kelly.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.120
Here we are.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.490
Like, we don't know what to do.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.560
And he's like, I've
never been there.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.350
But like, if you can make
it to Portugal tomorrow,

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.180
it's going to be good.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.150
And we're like, yeah, we can.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.191
We [? can't ?] move that.

00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:49.930
We flew to Europe and
had to drive 10 hours.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.140
And we ended up-- the next day,
we drove around and ended up

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.660
finding this wave, and we
surfed it for two days totally

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.570
by ourselves.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.355
So this is Shane and
Albee pushing each other

00:41:00.355 --> 00:41:02.171
in these conditions.

00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.670
When it comes to
shooting, you don't

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.628
know how long these
sessions are going to last.

00:41:05.628 --> 00:41:07.600
So with a wide
angle, I went out.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.520
The water's probably
about 45 degrees.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.690
I shot three waves
from the water.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.925
This is one, that was two.

00:41:12.925 --> 00:41:14.300
And I figured, I
think we got it.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.175
And then went in and
kept shooting from land.

00:41:16.175 --> 00:41:16.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.140
So with time-- with time and
experience comes knowing when

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.756
you have it, knowing
when you don't.

00:41:22.756 --> 00:41:23.530
You know?

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.920
A classic pub shot.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.301
So for these guys, we had
their conversation in a pub.

00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:27.800
Sorry, guys.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.870
I'm going to speed
up a little bit,

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.953
because there's a section
I really want to get to.

00:41:30.953 --> 00:41:32.260
Rob Machado and Craig Anderson.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.240
We took them down to
[INAUDIBLE] Points.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.539
Two super stylish surfers.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.830
For anyone into photography,
the whole time while we're

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.744
producing and trying to make
all these projects happen,

00:41:41.744 --> 00:41:42.910
we had a ton of camera gear.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.280
I always kept a Leica
35-millimeter camera

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.915
around my neck.

00:41:45.915 --> 00:41:48.040
I was trying to scramble
to get all my camera gear.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.690
I looked up, and Rob and
Craig were checking it.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.315
I picked it up.

00:41:50.315 --> 00:41:51.790
I shot one photo on my Leica.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.620
It's a black and
white film photo.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.440
And this is a wave that we
found four days of driving

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.030
12 hours a day without surfing.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.910
We hadn't surfed up
until this point.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:04.700
And we finally jumped a fence,
and this is what we found.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.652
A couple portraits of Craig,
giving a sense of setting.

00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:10.390
You know, once you
have the land shot,

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.180
once you have the water shot,
you know, the portrait shots,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.580
you try and give it kind of
an intimate look at what it's

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.780
like to take off down the line.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.626
So these are all images that
were all shot in one day.

00:42:20.626 --> 00:42:22.000
So when we're
shooting, you know,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.070
I'm constantly running
a mental checklist of,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.167
like, how can we
tell this whole story

00:42:26.167 --> 00:42:27.250
in a short amount of time?

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.458
Because we don't know how
long this is going to last.

00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.340
We'd been totally
skunked for days.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.250
This turned into
our winter section.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.810
And we realized, you know what?

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.030
It doesn't quite
feel like winter,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.355
so we need to do one more trip,
which was a hard one to explain

00:42:40.355 --> 00:42:42.590
to everyone to get done.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.700
So we ended up chasing
a blizzard to the most

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.460
northern islands in Japan.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.210
And I thought it
was a great idea.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.870
I was sitting in
Hawaii at the time.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.640
It was, like, five days before
Christmas, and we're like,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.260
we have five days
before Christmas.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.810
I think we can do this
trip in three days.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:42:59.920
Fly to Japan.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.930
We drove in a blizzard
for two days, surfed

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.270
for about 40 minutes.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:05.770
Got totally skunked.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.890
Ended up changing our tickets
to leave one day early.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.000
Had we not changed--

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.890
one guy stayed
back and got stuck

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.990
in an airport for seven days.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.870
So this is us in winter.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.300
This was probably one of,
like, eight waves surfed

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.160
on the whole trip,
and we drove forever.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.570
And we're talking, like,
organizing guys from Australia,

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:28.059
getting guys from
California just to go to--

00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:29.850
and you know, they
believed in our project.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.016
So when we say, like, you
know, this is our project,

00:43:32.016 --> 00:43:33.910
like, everyone worked.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.650
It's a quintessential
film crew shot.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.050
We have a ton of
gear when we travel.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.110
With the film crew when we made
the film, we had a great team,

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.720
but we also had a lot of gear.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.090
So this is Davis,
one of the filmers,

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.160
passed out on all
the Pelican cases.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.790
This is the last section.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.370
This is Kelly Slater
and John John Florence,

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.060
arguably two of the greatest
surfers of all time.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.850
I know we're super
short on time.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.370
We were thinking of
different ways, what

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.100
would be interesting to get
them to converse, to have

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.150
them have a conversation.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.160
They'd never done a
surf trip together.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.950
I was like, why not get the two
most competitive surfers ever

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:13.602
and play a game of chess,
the most competitive--

00:44:13.602 --> 00:44:15.060
one of the most
competitive sports?

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.309
We tried to take them fishing.

00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:17.820
We didn't catch anything.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.320
Chess, on the other hand--

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.970
and for those of
you that play chess,

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.845
you could probably
see what's happening.

00:44:22.845 --> 00:44:25.920
This image was 100%
inspired by an image

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.570
that Walter Iooss shot,
1964 in the clubhouse

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.992
of two golfers, Arnold
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.

00:44:33.992 --> 00:44:36.450
It's a black and white image
if you guys have ever seen it.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.740
It's a direct
derivative of this.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.370
So this is homage to Walter
Iooss, one of the greatest

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.620
photographers of all time.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.860
I actually called him
and told him that.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.360
And he was like, well,
mine was black and white.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.380
And I was like,
uh, I don't know.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:46.880
Its color.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.560
You know, it's not
all about waves.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.320
It's about exploring,
looking out the windows.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.820
We've built this
great relationship,

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.170
and I've been able to kind
of share these stories,

00:44:58.170 --> 00:44:59.770
have intimate access to this.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.350
That's Kelly looking out.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.630
We flew, we arrived.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.380
We were meant to go
to a place for a week.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.790
We ended up being
there for three days.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.876
This is straight off the
plane, Kelly and John

00:45:07.876 --> 00:45:09.000
looking at an empty lineup.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.190
So a big part of
what we wanted to do

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.830
is photograph these guys
where no one else is.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:19.290
So when this project came out,
no one knew that it existed.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.959
So just getting these two
guys together was a task,

00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:24.750
and making sure there
weren't other cameras

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.210
around was a big task too.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.900
Kelly was really instrumental
in helping forecast the swell.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.080
So you know-- and
this was in 2016.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.480
To get two of the greatest
surfers in the world surfing

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.475
by themselves for three
days with zero cameras

00:45:38.475 --> 00:45:42.030
is kind of a tricky thing to do.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.550
This is them doing their thing.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.390
Again, anytime I had the chance
to get two of them together,

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.420
I would.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.096
Underwater is probably my
favorite way to shoot images.

00:45:52.096 --> 00:45:53.220
I apologize if I'm rushing.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.572
I know we're short on time.

00:45:55.572 --> 00:45:57.780
These next two images are
probably my favorite images

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.800
from the project.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.605
This one of Kelly is underwater.

00:46:02.605 --> 00:46:04.440
It was shot with a
really wide angle lens,

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.990
but it was shot with a
rectilinear lens rather than

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.500
a fisheye.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.130
Most fisheye lens are
real bulbous, like a GoPro

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.390
or even like a Canon fisheye.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.760
I did an automotive shoot
where we were tracking

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.672
on the side of a bridge.

00:46:16.672 --> 00:46:18.630
And I remember after the
shoot, I called Kelly.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.504
I was like, I just did
this automotive shoot,

00:46:20.504 --> 00:46:22.230
and there's this lens.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.020
It's amazing.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.860
And we built a water housing
and a port just for this lens.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.440
And we waited two years for
the waves to get good for us

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.670
to go to this location
with this place in mind.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.850
And when we got this
image, we were like, OK.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.419
It was worth it.

00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:36.210
This is one of the few
photos that hangs up

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.720
on his wall at his house.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.940
There's also the cover
of "SURFER" magazine.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.800
This image shows the art.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.340
So like I said
earlier, each surfer

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.840
was partner with a
different artist.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.006
This is the art by Richard
Phillips out in New York.

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:54.150
So we wanted this to be a
multilayered experience.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.920
Not just surfing, not just
waves, not just music.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.030
So with the project, we had an
original score, original crew,

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.020
original artwork.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.680
And all the boards
are at my house.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.400
So when we do these art shows,
you can go touch the boards,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.051
feel the boards
see them firsthand.

00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:10.550
All right.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.800
This is the last
image and probably one

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.420
of the images we're most proud
of, we're most grateful for.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.691
Kelly had had that wave before.

00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:20.690
Not the above water one.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.539
The below water one.

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.830
And earlier in the day, he
was like, I was in the water

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.200
and I ducked over, and I
watched John pass by me.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.450
He's like, is that what you
were trying to photograph?

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.370
And I said, yeah.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.520
I'm like, it looks so cool.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.967
The water's so clear.

00:47:32.967 --> 00:47:33.800
And he's like, cool.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.595
And then he was paddling back
out after that previous wave,

00:47:37.595 --> 00:47:38.970
and John was
already in the tube.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.550
And he's like, I'm going to
duck dive in front of you.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:41.537
And I'm like, no!

00:47:41.537 --> 00:47:42.620
John's got to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.000
We hadn't got a good photo yet.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.870
And you know, sometimes these
swells only last half a day.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.790
So Kelly duck dived in front of
me, and I'm thinking, oh, man.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:50.780
He blocked it.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.440
I don't know what to think.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.546
And he comes up, and he's
like, that was the one.

00:47:54.546 --> 00:47:55.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.884 --> 00:47:57.740
And so I'm just
thinking, oh, man.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.110
He totally-- this guy's so
competitive, he blocked him.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.568
He totally blocked the shot,
because he knew he got a shot.

00:48:02.568 --> 00:48:05.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.740
I went back to the boat.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.090
I sat in the corner of the boat.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.534
I undid the housing.

00:48:09.534 --> 00:48:11.450
And I'm just-- you always
start back to front.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.140
You never start at the front.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.210
The front's never good
with photo shoots.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.126
And this was the last
wave before we went back

00:48:16.126 --> 00:48:16.790
to the boat.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.140
And I was like, oh.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.090
I'm like, block, block, block.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:21.470
Oh, we have something here.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.225
And he walked by.

00:48:22.225 --> 00:48:24.100
John walked by, and he
was like, what's that?

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.700
And I'm like, I think we have
something kind of special

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.400
here if this thing's in focus.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.930
And then Kelly walked by, and
he's like, that's the one.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:30.480
I told you.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.012
it ended up being
the cover of the book

00:48:33.012 --> 00:48:34.220
and the cover of the project.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.220
And to me, this really
summed up "Proximity."

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.960
Again, at the time, John
had not won a world title.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.770
Kelly had won 11.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.170
I hate to say old guard,
but the older generation

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.590
watching the newer generation.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:51.730
And so there's a lot
of symbolism with that.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.430
Thank you guys.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.570
I apologize I rushed.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.045
I know there's questions.

00:48:55.045 --> 00:48:56.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.750
TODD GLASER: I do
still shoot on film.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.240
Not all the time,
but for this project,

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.005
I probably went through about--

00:49:04.005 --> 00:49:08.030
I probably shot
half of it on film.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.750
Most of the color
images are all digital,

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.530
and most of the black and
white images are all on film.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.560
I really just try to kind
of simplify my process

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.830
by bringing less gear.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.780
It's a lot to travel with,
especially when you're

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.250
the Sherpa carrying
all the stuff.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.830
My back appreciates not
carrying as much film stuff.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.610
But yeah.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.320
I'm trying to build
a darkroom right now.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.111
I love shooting it.

00:49:31.111 --> 00:49:32.627
I miss the tangibility of it.

00:49:32.627 --> 00:49:35.210
I miss being able to smell it,
even though it smells terrible.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.200
But it's the process.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.420
And everything moves super fast.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:42.010
I like to slow it
down a little bit.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:42.510
But yeah.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.590
I still do shoot
quite a bit of film.

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.590
Thank you guys, again,
for coming and listening.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.130
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.120
It was an honor to be
here, so thank you guys.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.670
