00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
In today's video,
we're going to see

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.400
if we can make paper burn
hot enough to liquefy metal.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:13.440
[Music]

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.800
This is paper.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.940
Paper was invented in China in
approximately the year 105 CE.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.880
It's usual for a lot of things.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.300
We use it for writing,
printing, drawing, folding,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
and occasionally,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.073
although it's not
a very common fuel,

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:30.813
we do use it for burning.

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:32.900
It's made from wood cellulose,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.500
and so, it's
a flammable product.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.800
The temperature which
paper burns is famously

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830
451 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.600
and that's not very warm
as fires go.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
In fact, it's about
as cool as you can get.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.400
But today, we wanted
to put something to a test.

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:49.400
We wanted to see
if we could take paper,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.480
which can burn fairly cool,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420
and make it hot
enough to melt metal.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.400
We've got a couple different
ways we're going to try that.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.409
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:57.300
We're going to see

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.924
if we can use just paper
as a fuel source to get hot

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:01.394
enough to melt our metal.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.474
First thing we're going to do,
it's kind of cheating honestly.

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:07.700
The metal we're going
to use is gallium,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.500
and gallium melts
at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.080
which is well below the 451
Fahrenheit of paper burning.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.900
So, I would be very surprised

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.097
if we can't get the gallium
to burn a little bit.

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:21.700
But we want to go
a step above that,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.000
and move to aluminum.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.547
I've got an aluminum can,
a ball of aluminum foil,

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:26.759
and some aluminum wire,

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.700
and we want to see

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.300
if we can get any
of these to melt.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.800
And to give ourselves a really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
good chance rather than
just having printer paper,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.043
we got a couple rolls
of paper as well.

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:38.000
It's the same stuff that's made
from the tree cellulose.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.800
It's just brown,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.848
and it hasn't been cleaned
and bleached to be white,

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:41.842
like the printer paper,

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:43.560
and conveniently,
comes in this little roll.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.259
So I'm thinking,

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.700
we might be able
to make some sort

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.280
of rocket stove style burner
out of this paper,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.980
and hopefully, we can get
enough heat consistently

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.400
to actually melt down
and liquefy our metal.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.399
Now, the first thing

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.150
that we're going
to try is our gallium.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.600
I'm going to put that
in this stainless steel cup,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.100
which has fairly thin edges
and bottom to it.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
So it should transfer
the heat pretty nicely.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.400
We're just gonna make a little
fire using this printer paper,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.000
and we're going to see if that's
enough to melt down our gallium.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.400
There's definitely heat
coming off of the paper,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.180
but it's not staying
in one place very well.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.400
So it's sort of hard to
concentrate our gallium over it.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.729
Although I think we are,
even with that issue,

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.135
starting to melt our metal.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.900
There you go.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.560
There's some liquid
metal right there.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.700
So, as proof of concept,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.614
can burning paper get hot
enough to liquefy metal?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.220
Well, the quick answer is yes,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.200
depending on how
your paper setup,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.000
and of course,
what metal you're using.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.976
It's pretty easy
when you use a metal

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.800
that melts at under a
hundred degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.400
which is not very common.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.999
That's not going
to be a big problem.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.300
If you've got gallium,
and you need to melt it,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.830
this is going to be
pretty easy to melt.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.479
You can just leave it
outside on a hot day,

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.500
and it's going to liquefy.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.900
So, we want to take
this up a notch,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.800
and we want to see

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.008
if we can get it
to melt aluminum,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.789
and that's why we've got
those rolls of paper.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:57.700
I've got a couple ideas

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.400
for how we might be able
to make that work.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.600
I've got this whole
roll of paper.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.100
I'm not going to try
and use a whole thing.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.600
I'm going to cut off a section
that's about 1 foot long.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.900
That's what we're going to use
for our first little test

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.200
furnace we're going to set up.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.500
I've now got this roll of paper,
and this has a lot more fuel

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.080
than those 5 or 6 sheets
of printer paper.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.500
But in addition to that,
it's all held together.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.000
So hopefully, all of the heat
will be concentrated.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300
My thought is that
if I light the inside on fire,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.400
it will just keep burning up
from the inside to the outside.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.960
And so, all of our heat will be
contained in one little spot.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.800
But even that,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.374
I don't think it's going
to be quite enough

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.360
so I want to make
another modification.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.600
When you're making fire,
you need a few different things.

00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:38.250
You need fuel,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.000
and that's gonna be the paper,
but you also need oxygen.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.963
So my thought is

00:03:41.963 --> 00:03:44.786
that will drill a hole down
near the bottom of it

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:46.832
that it can draw
oxygen in through,

00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:49.300
and if that doesn't seem
like it's enough,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.150
I've also got
this little bike pump,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.240
and I've actually used this as
a form of cheap bellows before.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.804
It's pretty simple.

00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:56.500
It's got a little
nozzle on the front.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.100
You just push on the back,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.028
and it blows the concentrated
blast of air out.

00:04:00.028 --> 00:04:01.300
So here's the other thing.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.060
We need to have good airflow.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.600
If we set the can right on top,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.100
it might just stop all the air
from going anywhere.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.500
So I might be able to hold
the can at its side,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.366
but then it's likely to roll off
with all the air flow,

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:14.232
and I need two hands
to work the pump.

00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:16.200
So instead of using
the can on this one,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.100
we might just go
with the aluminum wire.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.959
That would be pretty easy
to just hook a piece

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.130
of wire in there, and see
if it melts from the heat.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.140
Okay, we've got our roll of
paper with our oxygen vent hole.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.152
These two bricks were just
using to hold everything steady

00:04:31.152 --> 00:04:32.100
because you know,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.328
I might bump it or something

00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:34.990
while I'm trying
to pump air into it,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.300
and I have just a sheet
of aluminum foil underneath

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300
just kind of want to keep track
of what all is lost here.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.627
I expect a lot of paper ash
will fall out of that.

00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:43.650
But I'm also curious,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.966
if this does melts to the point
that it liquefies,

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:47.992
I kind of want to catch it
as it falls down,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820
lands on that piece of aluminum.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.900
So we're just going to get
this burning a little bit.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.074
See if it's self-sustaining
at all, and if not,

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:56.800
start adding some oxygen.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:07.720
[Music]

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.700
Well, right away,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.600
I'm going to say
that it's smoldering,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150
but we're not seeing much fire,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.980
so I'm gonna see if I can add
some good old-fashioned O2

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.540
will make a difference.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:28.140
[Music]

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.460
It kind of burns on its own,
but not super well.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.100
I think it does need
the additional oxygen

00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:34.269
from the pump so we're going
to keep using that.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.800
Let's put our wire in, and see
if we can get it to melt.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.900
Oh, it just broke.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.900
Oh, and there's actually some
little drips down there too.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.480
Okay.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.700
This is why I put
the aluminum down there.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.700
Right there, that
piece fell off.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.300
We've also got some little spots
down on the aluminum

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.500
that look like they
have dripped down.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.100
Well, those...

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.200
This little spot right here?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.480
[Music]

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.840
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.000
That's some little bits
of aluminum drips here.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
One actually fused
onto the aluminum foil

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.700
to the point that I
can't take it off.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.570
It just tears.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.099
So, as a proof of concept,
melting aluminum,

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.100
that worked okay.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.200
So now, I'm going
to try scaling this up,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.954
and I had that bigger
roll of paper,

00:06:14.954 --> 00:06:16.904
and I've got a plan
for how I don't have

00:06:16.904 --> 00:06:18.878
to use the little bike
pump the whole time,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.900
which I hope works
because that gets tiring.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.700
Much much bigger roll of paper.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.900
That is fuel for days.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.000
So, same general idea.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.100
We're going to have a hole down
at the bottom where we can have

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.000
some just airflow,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.914
and we're going to make
it a bigger hole,

00:06:34.914 --> 00:06:37.500
and it's actually going
to be big enough for this piece

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.500
of metal conduit.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.874
Well, I think this
is made of steel, but

00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:41.000
if it's made of aluminum, then,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
we're going to see something
interesting as it melts.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.700
But we're going to fit this in,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.056
and then this is going
to be attached on the other side

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:47.719
to an air pump.

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.049
Right about over that nozzle,

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:50.700
we use some tape
to hold it in place,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700
and that's just sit
off to the side,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.500
feeding are into our furnace,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.420
which should hopefully just
burn, burn, burn beautifully.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.000
It's a great size.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.150
This aluminum can for example
just barely fits in.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.069
It's got a little bit
of space on the sides.

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.800
I think we're also going to try
and drill a couple of holes up

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.900
near the top that
this steel rod can fit into.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.800
That way, it you just
act as a support,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.100
it can hold our can up
where we want it

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.100
without it just falling
right down to the bottom,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.900
and that way,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.500
I think we'll get a lot
of good air flow, and hopefully,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.100
melt this can down
to nothing really quickly.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.400
Okay.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.700
We've got our big roll,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.400
got the steel bar
to hold our can up,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.160
got our hose attached
to our pump.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.440
Just going to try and get
this started burning.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.060
Let's see what happens

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.800
if we just had
a good flow of oxygen.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.800
See how much heat we
can get out of this.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:08:02.500
[Music]

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.660
Feel like I should also say,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.300
I cut our metal conduit
a little bit shorter

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.080
just to get the airflow
more directly there,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.780
and it cut very easily
to the point that I suspect

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:12.965
this is also aluminum.

00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:15.547
So we may end up just melting
through our conduit

00:08:15.547 --> 00:08:16.300
at some point.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.800
Let's see.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.800
So I've noticed something
as I'm trying to melt this can.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.866
When it's in place,

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:23.000
the airflow is
a little bit restricted,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.300
and I've had it go out.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.500
So if it goes out again,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.100
I'm actually going
to take the can out,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.963
and let it burn

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:30.835
for a bit to sort of open
up the top of our furnace.

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:32.600
I really want good flow of air

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.400
because it's the oxygen
that we need.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:46.880
[Music]

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.780
Ooh, that's deformed.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.080
Down here at the bottom,

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:52.500
we've started melting
our aluminum foil.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.900
I just put that there as
sort of a catching spot,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.000
but it started to melt
it quite a bit.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.280
[Music]

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.300
We're getting a lot more fire
blasting out the bottom,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.358
and I don't know if that's just
because of the shape.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.900
Ooh, wow.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.400
Well, the can

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.500
is definitely losing
structural integrity here.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.529
But I want to try
flipping this upside down,

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.000
and it might just be that

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.250
because this is closer
to the air vent,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.430
it's getting more heat.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.230
So, we're going

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.680
to try just flipping
this whole thing upside down.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:10:02.360
[Music]

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.200
I would say that's hot
enough to liquefy metal.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.000
That's gone.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.660
We need to scale
this up a little bit.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.500
Oh, and we have started
melting our pipe as well.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.300
That's good.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:42.760
[Music]

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.600
That's some little
Minecraft figures

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.160
that we're going
to call me and Cali.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.450
I think we're going to try
and make a mold of one of these.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.000
So we've got some molding sand.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.494
We're going to try and press one
of these down into that,

00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:56.729
and make a copy
of it in our aluminum

00:10:56.729 --> 00:10:58.282
if enough aluminum melts.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.400
Okay, I like that.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.700
We're going to call that good.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.600
See about pouring
aluminum into that.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.200
It's a decent pool
of aluminum now.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:17.700
[Music]

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.640
So this is interesting.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.600
We had this burning
for a good while,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.100
probably 45 minutes.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.900
Just getting all
that metal heated up,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.675
melted down, turning
into a liquid,

00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:26.811
and it did liquefy it.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.205
It liquefied it quite well.

00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:29.600
I pulled the steel rod out.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.200
That was just in

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
there to help the crucible stay
in just the right position,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.000
add just the right
amount of airflow.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.441
The steel rod was in there just

00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:37.891
to help hold that crucible
in just the right spot,

00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.500
and have a good amount
of air flow.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.700
But that steel rod

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.641
was red hot to the point
where I think you probably

00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:47.100
could have even used that heat
to do some basic forging.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.881
Like I think if I'd taken
a hammer to that,

00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:51.300
it would have been soft enough
that I could manipulate it.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.600
So just using paper and oxygen,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.600
we are able to get
it hot enough

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.700
to heat up a steel bar to the point

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.600
that you could work it
as blacksmithing techniques.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.700
[Music]

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.500
Well, I'd say it's not a 100%
perfectly faithful reproduction

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.919
of our little
Calli Minecraft figure,

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.600
but it's the basic shape.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.800
That worked all right,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.552
and the flaw here was
not the melting of the aluminum.

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.315
The flaw here was
my molding technique,

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:24.100
where I just pressed the figure
down into the sand instead of

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.150
the careful like layering
you're supposed to do,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.200
like through a sieve.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.100
With this kind
of ultra fine sand,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.600
it can pick up a ton of detail.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.300
But it also is
a little bit sticky,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.399
and you're supposed to use

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:36.100
like some baby powder or
something to separate the two.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.300
Overall though,
paper melting metal?

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.200
Absolutely.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.180
It may burn it
451 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.300
but it can clearly get
way way hotter than that.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.700
Guys, that's not all.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.968
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.076
The box at the top is going
to take you to our last video.

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.079
You should go check that out.

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:51.918
The other box shows you

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:53.700
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.263
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:12:55.263 --> 00:12:56.587
that will subscribe
to the channel.

00:12:56.587 --> 00:12:58.300
That way, you never miss
out on a cool video.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:58.884
And of course,

00:12:58.884 --> 00:13:00.393
don't forget to ring
the bell so you get

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:01.400
the notification about it.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.485
We'll see you in the next one.

00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:03.360
Talk to you then.
