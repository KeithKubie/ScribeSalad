00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.820
Welcome back.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.950
We're on problem number 15.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.155
And I've tried it as best
as I can to draw it.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.210
And they're pretty much saying--
well, I'll read it--

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.740
Doug's biology experiment
involving timing 12

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.700
hamsters in a maze.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.079
Each hamster received at
least one practice

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.170
before being timed.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.390
The scatter plot above shows the
time each hamster took to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.960
complete the maze and the
corresponding number of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.450
practices that each
hamster received.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.360
Based on the data, which of the
following functions best

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.310
models the relationship between
t, the number of

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:42.230
seconds to complete the maze--
this is the t-axis-- and p,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.460
the number of practices?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.090
This is p, the number
of practices.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.480
So we want to find t
as a function of p.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.720
So t is a function of p.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.310
So, one, it looks like the
hamsters didn't learn much

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.310
when they got practice.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.190
No matter how much practice
they got, the hamsters, it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.160
looks like they roughly took
about the same amount of time.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.560
We could try to draw a line
here that fits this curve.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.020
Maybe it would look something
like this.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.690
I don't know, something
like that.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.290
I mean, it's not going to be--
you could try to be cute and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.160
try to draw something maybe with
a little bit of a slope

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.170
or anything, but I mean, really,
this looks like a flat

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.720
line when you look at it.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.400
So what would be the equation
of that line?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.450
Well, the equation of
that line would be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.680
like 45 or 44 or something.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.360
So if you said t of p is equal
to-- and actually, they have a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.180
choice that looks just like
that-- t of p is equal to 44.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.470
No matter how many practices
the mice got, regardless of

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.130
how many, they on average
take roughly 44 seconds.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.590
So practice doesn't really help
mice much, as opposed to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.110
students preparing
for the SAT.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.820
And all of the other ones
don't make any sense.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.320
I mean, t of p equals p.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.490
That would be something
like this.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.720
Choice A is something like
that, that has no sense.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.340
No, sorry, choice
A is our answer.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.350
Choice B looks something
like that.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.000
Choice C, 44p.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.220
That will be even
a super steep.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.690
That makes no sense.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.660
P/44, that's going to be like
a really shallow graph.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780
And then you could
have p plus 44.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.260
That would start here and then
have a slope of 1, so it would

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.800
look like that.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.720
So none of the other ones
are even close.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.150
So it's definitely choice A.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.060
t of p is equal to 44.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.310
Last problem.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.090
And I'll do a new color.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
Problem 16.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.440
And they drew this thing,
so I have a big square.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:52.170
And then we have a
square like that.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.270
Actually, I should just
use the line tool,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.470
that would be better.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.421
A square like that.

00:02:58.421 --> 00:02:59.840
A square like that.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.161
And then I have a square
like that, roughly.

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.390
It's not perfectly drawn because
these three squares

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.770
look the same, and they tell
us they're the same.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.132
They tell us that this is W.

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:17.940
And this is L.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.940
W, W, W.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.030
L, L.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.300
The pattern shown above is
composed of rectangles.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.510
This pattern is used repeatedly
to completely cover

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.960
a rectangular region 12 units
long and 11 units wide.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:47.290
So they're covering a region
that's 12L long and 10L wide.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.710
So this is like a thumbnail
of the floor.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.640
How many rectangles of dimension
L by W are needed?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.290
OK.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.790
Well, when they say how many
rectangles of dimension L by

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910
W, that's just each of
these rectangles

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.890
that they drew here.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.200
Right?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.650
Because all of these have
dimensions L by W, L by W, L

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.610
by W, L by W, L by W, right?

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.350
So if we could figure out just
how many of these-- this

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.460
pattern has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
of those on it, right?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.050
So if we could just figure out
how many of this pattern would

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.330
fit onto this, then
we're done.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.180
So how can we figure that out?

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.340
So do we know a relationship
between L and W?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.560
Well, sure.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.040
We see here that two L's are the
same thing as three W's.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.900
We know that 2L is equal
to three W's.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.950
And since all our dimensions
are given in L, let's solve

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.520
for W and substitute.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.570
So let's say that W is equal
to-- just divide both sides by

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.950
3-- W is equal to 2/3 L.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.850
All I said is 2L is the
same thing as 3W and I

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.770
divided it by 3.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.550
So W is equal to 2/3 L.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.350
So can we represent the height
and the width of this

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.190
rectangle now in terms
of only L's?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.540
Well, sure.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.150
What's the height?

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.140
What's the length of
this rectangle?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.470
Well, the length is definitely
just 2L, right?

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.420
L plus L.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.530
That's the length.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.880
And what's the width?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.690
Well, W is what?

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:45.320
It's 2/3 L plus L, so what's the
width of this rectangle?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.310
What's 2/3 of something plus
1 whole of that something?

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.030
Or 2/3 plus 3/3?

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.480
So the width is 5/3 L.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.920
So each of these rectangles
is 5/3 L by 2L.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.460
So how many of these rectangles
are we going to

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.030
have to put onto this floor?

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.040
How many total?

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.500
Well, going in this dimension
they have a length of 2L.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.220
So if we have to-- if they're
2L each, then we're going to

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.620
need six of them, right?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.900
We're going to need 6
in this direction.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.330
Because we're going to go a
total distance of 12L, and

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.570
they're 2L each.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.380
So they're going to be
6 in that direction.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.500
And how many are we going to
need in this direction?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.570
Well, we have to go a total
distance of 10L.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.810
And the width of each
of them is 5/3 L.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.500
So what's 10 divided by 5/3?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.360
So the L's cancel out.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.752
So 10 divided by 5/3 is the same
thing as 10 times 3/5.

00:06:50.752 --> 00:06:53.200
And that just equals 6.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.130
So we're going to need
6 rectangles in this

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.470
direction as well.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.650
So how many total rectangles
are we going to need?

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.090
Well, 6 times 6 is equal
to 36 total rectangles.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.120
And then, how many of these
smaller rectangles

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.030
are in each of these?

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.030
We'll need 36 of this pattern.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.830
And then how many of the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.890
rectangles are in that pattern?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.430
Well, we counted.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.690
There's 5.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.180
So we're going to need 5 times
36 total of these smaller

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.090
rectangles.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.820
So 5 times 36 is what?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.260
150 plus 30?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.470
It's 180.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.070
We will need 180 of these
smaller rectangles.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.140
So that is choice E.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.680
And we are done with
this test three.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.520
I'll see you in test four.
