00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.990
- [Voiceover] In the figure above,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.706
triangle ABC is isosceles.

00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:07.423
So that's triangle A, B, C,

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:09.298
so that big triangle, that's isosceles,

00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:11.811
which means two of its
sides are congruent,

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.076
have the same length.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:15.352
That is, side AB, they explain it here,

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:19.798
side AB, so side AB here,

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.793
is equal in length to side BC.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.334
So these two sides are equal in length,

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:28.245
so we could say that side
is equal to that side,

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.067
actually I wanna be careful just because

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:32.145
that looks like I'm
saying it from that point

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:34.473
to that point, but those two blue sides

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:35.676
are gonna be equal in length.

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:37.068
Triangle DEF.

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.285
D, E, F

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:41.885
overlaps with triangle ABC,

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.905
you know we see that,
they kinda formed this,

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:45.995
this star of David, or kinda this skewed

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:47.075
star of David.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.442
What is the value of angle p here?

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.207
Alright.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:52.902
Let's work through this.

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:55.398
So ABC is an isosceles triangle,

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:56.942
and I'm gonna draw it separately here,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:01.418
so ABC is an isosceles triangle.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.129
This is an isosceles triangle,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.508
and an isosceles triangle, if these two,

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.528
if these two sides are congruent,

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:11.361
then these base angles
are going to be congruent.

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.240
And they already tell us
that this angle up here,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.326
they already tell us that this
angle up here is 100 degrees,

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:22.112
and we know that all the interior angles

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:25.548
of a triangle add up to 180 degrees,

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:30.278
so if we call this x degrees
and this is x degrees,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.764
then we see that x plus x plus 100,

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:40.764
plus 100 is going to
need to be equal to 180,

00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.282
or we can get that 2x,

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:48.904
2x and then if we subtract
100 from both sides,

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:53.410
is equal to 80, or that
x is equal to 40 degrees.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.022
So just that like we're
able to figure out that

00:01:55.022 --> 00:01:58.343
both of these, both of
these, are going to be

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.525
equal to 40 degrees, and
that came straight out

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:04.032
of the fact that ABC is
an isosceles triangle,

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:07.491
these two base angles are
going to be congruent.

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:11.844
So this is 40 degrees
and this is 40 degrees.

00:02:11.844 --> 00:02:15.686
Now let's go to this little
small triangle right over here,

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:18.287
this little small
triangle right over here.

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:20.643
Once again, we know
that the interior angles

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:24.068
of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:26.611
So if this right over
here, actually this angle

00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:29.466
right over here is going
to be the same as p

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:31.684
because it's vertical, it's
a vertical angle with p,

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.494
so this is going to be p degrees as well,

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:38.545
and now we see p plus 40,

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:43.200
p plus 40 plus 60

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.698
plus 60 is going to add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:47.698 --> 00:02:49.705
That's the interior angles
of this little small

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.261
triangle right over here.

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.777
Or we could write p plus

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.983
if we add the 40 and the 60,

00:02:57.983 --> 00:02:59.226
you get 100.

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:01.547
p plus 100 is equal to 180.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.381
If we subtract 100 from both sides,

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:06.945
we get p is equal to 80 degrees.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:09.220
So what is the value of p?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.101
Or I guess this is p degrees.

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:13.922
So the value of p is,

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.436
the value of p is 80.
