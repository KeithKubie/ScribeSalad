00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.902
- [Instructor] We are
told b of one is equal

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:06.582
to negative seven, and b of n is equal

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:11.312
to b of n minus one plus
12, and they're asking us

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:14.645
to find the fourth term in the sequence.

00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:17.827
So what we have up here,

00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:19.910
which you could use a function definition,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.247
it's really defining
the terms of a sequence.

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:26.336
Especially if are to input
whole numbers in here,

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.749
it's the index on your sequence.

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.770
What we really wanna do
is, we wanna figure out

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.020
what is b of four going to be equal to?

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:38.834
Well if we just blindly apply this,

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:42.300
we would say all right b of four,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.981
so be of n, is equal to
b of n minus one plus 12,

00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.731
so it's gonna be b of
four minus one plus 12.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.342
Well four minus one is just three,

00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:57.342
so it's going to be equal
to b of three plus 12.

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:01.031
All I did is said okay, well
we're not trying to figure out,

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:03.331
or we're not immediately
trying to figure out

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.340
what b of one is.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.471
We're trying to figure
out what b of four is,

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:10.151
so n is equal to four, so b
of four is going to be equal

00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:14.068
to b of four minus one,
or b of three, plus 12.

00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:18.151
To evaluate this, we have to
figure out what b of three is,

00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:19.962
so let's write that down.

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.808
That's what's fun about
a recursive definition.

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:25.880
You have to keep recursing
backwards, so b of three.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.442
Well if n is three, that's
going to be equal to b of,

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.859
now n minus one is two, b of two plus 12.

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:37.393
We don't know what b of two
is, so let's keep going.

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:39.774
We need to figure out b of two.

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:43.530
If we use the same definition,
b of two is going to be equal

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.697
to b of two minus one plus
12, so b of two minus one.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.957
That's b of one plus 12, but
we don't know what b of one is,

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:55.841
so let's figure that out.

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.557
B of one is equal to, well
here we can finally use

00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:03.724
this top clause, so b of one
is equal to negative seven.

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.733
Now we can go and fill everything back in.

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.514
If b of one is equal to negative
seven, then we know that

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:13.243
this right over here is negative seven,

00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:15.956
and now we can figure out
that b of two is equal

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:20.039
to negative seven plus 12
which is equal to five.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.598
If b of two is equal to
five, well then this is equal

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:27.407
to five right over here,
and then now we know

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:30.706
that b of three is equal to five plus 12

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:32.456
which is equal to 17.

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:37.029
If we know that b of three is equal to 17,

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.948
then we're ready to calculate
what b of four is going to be.

00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:43.237
B of four is now, it's b of three,

00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:46.095
which we figured out was 17 plus 12

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:47.845
which is equal to 29,

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:50.650
and we are done.
