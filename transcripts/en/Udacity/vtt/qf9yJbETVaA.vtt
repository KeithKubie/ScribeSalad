00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.820
&gt;&gt; That is exactly the right question to ask. It's fun

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.939
to spend all day finding the VC dimension in various hypothesis

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.120
classes. But that is not why we are here. The reason

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640
we're, why we're here is to use that insight about VC dimension

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.560
to connect it up with sample complexity. And so here is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.940
the equation that you get. When you connect these things up.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.440
It turns out that if you have a sample set the,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.620
the size of your trading data, is at least as big as

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.790
this lovely expression here. Then that will be sufficient

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.090
to get epsilon error, or less, with probability 1

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.860
minus delta. And so, the form of this looks

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.880
a lot like how things looked in the finite

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.670
case. But, in fact it's a little bit weirder.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.590
So 1 over epsilon times quantity eight times the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.370
VC dimension of H. So that's where this quantity

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.600
is coming into play. So the VC dimension gets bigger,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.240
we're going to need more data. Times the log base 2

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.460
of 13 over epsilon. Sure. Plus 4 times the log

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.260
base 2 of 2 over delta. So, again, this log

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.250
of, of something like 1 over delta to the inverse

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.120
of delta, was in the other bound, as well, that's

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.480
capturing how certain we need to be that, that things

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.540
are going to work. And again, as, as delta gets

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.580
small, the failure probability gets small. This quantity gets bigger.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.890
And the num, and the size of sample needs to be bigger. But, but this is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.320
the cool thing. That the VC invention is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.270
coming in here in this nice, fairly linear way.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.820
&gt;&gt; So it sort of plays the same role as

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.590
the natural log of the size of the hypothesis space.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.310
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly right! And in fact,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.230
things, things actually map out pretty similarly in the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.860
finite case and the infinite case. That there's an

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.120
additive term having to do with the failure probability.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.340
There's a, you know, one over epsilon in the front of it and then

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.450
this quantity here, having to do with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.330
the hypothesis space, is either the size of

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.440
the hypothesis space or the dimension of it, depending. Well the size here is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.960
logged and the VC dimension is not, so that's a little bit of a difference.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.158
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:03.020
&gt;&gt; But but there's a good reason for that as it turns out.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.210
&gt;&gt; There is?

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.950
&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed. So why we, why don't we take

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.360
a moment and look to see what is the VC

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.760
dimension of a finite hypothesis class? The VC dimension

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.260
concept doesn't require that it's continuous. It's just that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.020
when it's continuous, the VC dimension is required. So

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.150
that maybe that's a useful exercise. Let's do that.
