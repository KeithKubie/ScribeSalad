00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.550
Here's a great example of the potential
of quality reporting to add

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.950
transparency to healthcare through
public reporting of quality metrics.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.780
Suppose you have diabetes and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.240
want to make sure your provider
cares for it properly.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.110
Where would you go to find that out?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.930
In general there's no good answer, but

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.840
in Indiana many providers voluntarily
report their data at the practice level.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.717
Here it is for
the Hemoglobin A1c process metric.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:34.440
Remember, that means doing the test
periodically as recommended.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.854
Three of the practices are below the
standard for the state, as shown in red.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:45.670
Two are below their regional average,
as shown in green.
