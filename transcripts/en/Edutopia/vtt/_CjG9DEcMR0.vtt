00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Physical education
has long been synonymous

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:16.306
with running laps, jumping
jacks, and competitive sports.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:20.706
But an increasing number of schools
are taking a fresh new approach

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:21.406
to PE.

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:28.106
At San Rafael High School in Northern
California PE is all about fitness,

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.666
fun, and high-flying adventure.

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:36.326
&gt;&gt;C.J.: The new physical
education is getting kids

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.296
to understand why they
are doing things.

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:42.046
You know, not just barking orders
but also helping them learn

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:45.106
and understand how their
bodies work, why it's important

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:47.226
to have this understanding
throughout their lives.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:52.066
We try to get buy-in from the kids
and we try to implement the fitness

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.226
and the exercise into
games and activities

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.456
where they're actually moving
their bodies and getting in shape

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.936
but they're also having fun.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:02.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology helps
to individualize the workouts.

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:06.386
&gt;&gt;C.J.: The watch is recording
the heart rate and the strap

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:08.136
under their shirts is picking it up.

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:11.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Healy uses a PDA to
take attendance and make notes

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:16.146
and adds the heart rate data to each
student's individual sportfolio.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:20.756
&gt;&gt;C.J.: The beaming device just takes
the data off the watch and sends it

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:22.786
to the computer which
plots it on a graph.

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.946
&gt;&gt;So here is Juan's fitness results.

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:29.176
&gt;&gt;Okay so you're going to
untie by working together

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:31.606
and you can discuss the
strategy if you need to.

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:34.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most classes
include a cooperative challenge

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.136
like untying a human knot.

00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:40.086
&gt;&gt;C.J.: We put them into groups
where they're with students

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.556
of all different races and
backgrounds and languages

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:46.876
and we give them challenges and
we give them problems to solve.

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Put your
arm down and walk over.

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:52.276
&gt;&gt;C.J.: You know in the case of kids
who don't speak the same language,

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:55.416
they have to find other ways to
communicate to solve the problem.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.876
&gt;&gt;Student: There you go, yeah.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.726
&gt;&gt;Judith: If you have to do it as
team and there are all these rules

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:02.986
as to how you do it, you're in the
problem-solving and critical thinking

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.586
and whether or not we put those
words to it at that moment,

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:06.936
that's what they're doing.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:08.806
Those are essential
skills in the classroom

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:10.116
and everything we do in life.

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.176
&gt;&gt;Student: There we go!

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:12.706
&gt;&gt;Student: You got it.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:16.066
&gt;&gt;C.J.: When the challenge is over
whether they're successful or not,

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.646
you always bring them back together.

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:20.236
You always debrief.

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:22.086
Get them to think about
what they've done.

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:23.466
&gt;&gt;Good, Juan?

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:24.466
&gt;&gt;Juan: We communicated.

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.366
&gt;&gt;C.J.: You communicated.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:26.096
&gt;&gt;Student: We didn't give up.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:27.756
&gt;&gt;C.J.: You didn't give up, okay.

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:30.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Everyone's
pulse rate quickens

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:33.546
as students don helmets
and gather ropes gear.

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:36.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: I can't go
any higher, I'm scared.

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school's
adventure room was the brainchild

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.686
of former P.E. teacher, Bill Monti.

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:43.326
&gt;&gt;Bill: This is real to the kids.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:45.146
I mean the risk factors are there.

00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:48.246
They see them and they
are afraid of them.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:52.606
However in all situations they
are being belayed or safe-guarded

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:56.196
by either a rope that's
fixed or a rope

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:59.146
that is being belayed
by a team-member.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.916
&gt;&gt;Student: Sit parallel,
sit parallel to the wall.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.776
&gt;&gt;Chevoy: You have people
like, you know, helping you.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.256
They don't just watch you.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:08.446
They help you through
every step you're doing.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:10.196
You get along with everybody.

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:15.646
&gt;&gt;Bill: We have leaders that emerge

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:18.336
because they maybe have
a little more confidence

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:22.076
or maybe they've had success sooner
than someone else in the group,

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:25.796
and so with that experience
they share it

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:27.166
with the other members of the team.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.236
&gt;&gt;Student: Safe, make it safe.

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:31.136
&gt;&gt;Bill: So we really
do teach leadership.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.106
&gt;&gt;Juan: This is like one of the
best P.E. classes I've ever been to.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:38.296
I'm mostly a leader in my class.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:42.166
When someone is not following
directions I mostly guide them

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:42.906
to the right way.

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:48.616
&gt;&gt;Ruth: It's more about teamwork and
making sure you don't screw and end

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:53.956
up falling on something, but
mostly the trust is a big one.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Alright, understand?

00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:56.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Adventure
P.E. is catching

00:03:58.306 --> 00:03:59.986
on in schools across the country.

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:03.766
New teachers at New Jersey's
Montclair State University are

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.346
learning how to impart
new P.E. skills.

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This one goes
a little bit faster, guys.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.056
Take your time, slowly.

00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:10.246
Very good.

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:13.126
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: Everyone here
ends up learning a little bit

00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:15.416
about everyone else
in a different way

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:19.236
than just skill-related
athletic stuff like power

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:20.506
and agility and quickness.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:21.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very slowly.

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:24.016
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: Because everybody has a
chance to put in what they need to do

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:24.976
and communicate together as a team.

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:28.146
&gt;&gt;Student: You can go first.

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:28.936
Do you want to go second?

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:32.086
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: They can learn some
of the character education values

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:35.796
that you need like integrity
and justice and responsibility

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.976
and all those kinds of things that
it's very hard to teach in school.

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:42.086
&gt;&gt;Student: Ready guys?

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:42.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Are you ready, Maddie?

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:42.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Yep.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:43.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Step on, step on.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:46.616
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: I'll ask them where
did they use these skills

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.356
that you're learning today in life?

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:51.946
&gt;&gt;Student: And the first thing they
said "We can use this in school."

00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:53.336
And we're like "How?"

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:58.276
&gt;&gt;Student: They said "Working
on projects in order to have--

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.846
get a good grade on projects everyone
has to put equal amount of effort."

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:03.016
&gt;&gt;Student: And they said if
they didn't talk together

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.426
when they were doing a project,
they'd both do the same thing

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:05.566
by accident and wouldn't
get the job done.

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:06.976
So I mean they were able to
apply it outside of the gym.

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're almost
to the bucket.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As some schools cut
back on P.E. and after-school sports

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:16.806
in pursuit of higher test scores,
others see the positive effects

00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:19.226
of exercise on mind and body.

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:23.336
&gt;&gt;Kira: Let's see if we can
help each other balance.

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the Bronx, Kira Morton
teachers her first graders yoga.

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:28.066
&gt;&gt;Kira: Fly like a butterfly.

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:31.456
&gt;&gt;Students: Fly like a butterfly.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.746
&gt;&gt;Kira: I do yoga with
the kids every single day.

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.916
The kids really respond well to it.

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:39.896
I found last year that my kids
were very jumpy and it was

00:05:39.896 --> 00:05:43.596
like the perfect thing
to get them settled down.

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:47.296
&gt;&gt;Sit up nice and tall, bring
your hands on your belly.

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:47.666
Breath in.

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:48.456
Ommmmmm...

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:50.016
&gt;&gt;It also helps me,
it helps me breathe.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.896
It helps me remember that
they are 5, 6, 7 years old.

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:55.986
We do need to find time for movement.

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:57.296
&gt;&gt;And drive.

00:05:57.746 --> 00:05:59.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Napa, California,

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:02.286
Sharon Campbell attached
a wind turbine

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:05.176
to a stationary bike
allowing her seventh graders

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.526
to generate electricity while
they burn off excess energy.

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:13.466
&gt;&gt;Sharon: I think every
classroom needs the bicycle even

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.736
if they don't have the
energy bank the way we do,

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:20.216
because I have youngsters
in here that will be working

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:23.546
on their project, stand up and
go over and peddle for five

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:25.356
or six minutes and come
and sit down again.

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:28.426
And they haven't even
thought about making power.

00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:31.806
They haven't thought about
the fact they can't sit still

00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:32.606
for another minute.

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:36.726
They just automatically go and
they burn off a little energy.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:42.786
&gt;&gt;Joel: Kids spend their time
in school sitting down, okay,

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:45.516
and that is by far the
worst thing you can do

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:46.976
for a kid and for learning.

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:50.236
&gt;&gt;You're going to start turning
like this where your arms just flop

00:06:50.236 --> 00:06:51.946
against your body like that.

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:53.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A former
sports psychologist

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:57.096
for the San Francisco Giants, Kirsch
believes students could benefit

00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:00.676
from doing a few simple
exercises in class.

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:04.136
&gt;&gt;Joel: These are techniques
related to balance, concentration,

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:09.146
flexibility, maintaining a
positive attitude, all the things

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:12.616
that are needed to
help the student learn.

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:16.256
When kid are working on a written
assignment for quite a long period

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:19.936
of time, they can just get off and do
these off to the side by themselves

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:23.486
to wake themselves up,
oxygenate their blood and go back

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:25.156
to their desk and continue
their work.

00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:28.396
You know, as long as you allow
that flexibility in the classroom.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:29.956
&gt;&gt;Good job, you guys are pros.

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:32.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kirsch is planning
to open a public school

00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:35.946
that will place sports and wellness
at the center of the curriculum.

00:07:36.126 --> 00:07:38.336
&gt;&gt;Joel: Seventy-five percent
of high school students

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:42.386
across the country are quote
unquote "chronically disengaged".

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:47.806
At the same time all the research is
showing that kids are totally engaged

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:50.366
when they're involved in
activities like sports.

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:55.656
So what we're looking to do is bring
the positive aspects of sport culture

00:07:55.706 --> 00:08:00.826
into a total learning environment
and in an entire school setting.

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:05.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kirsch's vision
is similar to programs

00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:07.266
at Harrison High School
in Mississippi.

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:11.356
Here blood pressure readings from the
school's championship cheerleading

00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:15.736
squad are entered into a database
which is accessed by math students.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:18.836
Other students learn
physics principles

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:21.186
that will enhance their
sports performance.

00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:23.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you consider a
minute ago you went from up there

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:25.816
to the floor in a 30th of a second,

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:28.986
so your acceleration
was a lot faster.

00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:32.916
&gt;&gt;C.J.: Being trustworthy but
also trusting other people,

00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:35.936
solving problems, working in teams,

00:08:36.406 --> 00:08:40.456
and taking risks are really
important skills that kids need

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:42.176
to learn somewhere to be successful.

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:47.886
What we do in physical education
program is more important now

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:50.196
than it ever was.

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:54.166
It's so great to see these
girls come in sort of quiet,

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.026
a little meek at the
beginning of the year,

00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.966
and then to see them jumping
off the wall on the zip line.

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:02.156

00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:05.256
&gt;&gt;C.J.: The transformation
is amazing.

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.426
