00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:04.029
- Oh, so then they grill like also, okay.

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:04.862
Wow.

00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:14.618
Wow, that is right off the fire.

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:20.539
(vigorous Middle Eastern percussion music)

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:23.204
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:27.102
with migrationology.com
in Istanbul, Turkey.

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:29.337
Woke up very early this morning and it is

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.962
a bright sunshiny day.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.687
The sun is reflecting over the Bosphorus.

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:37.180
Today we're gonna do some
sight-seeing and some eating.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.493
It's about 7:00 AM now, we are walking

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:41.887
towards the tram station
and we're gonna take

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:44.567
the tram to Sultanahmet.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.234
(motor rumbles)

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:52.658
- [Woman] Yeah. (clicks)

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:53.635
- Yeah.

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:56.441
- [Computer Voice] Free
pass, ticket sales menu.

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.689
Please take your card
from return tray below.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.464
- We made it to Kabatas Tramway Station

00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:05.569
and figured out how to buy our tickets.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:06.666
It was pretty easy.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.430
And we are going to load
onto the Tramway now.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.974
Or this one is already closed?

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:12.070
This one is already closed?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.533
- Oh, (word in foreign language).

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.616
Ah, you press the button.

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:20.026
Okay, we made it onto the Tramway.

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:23.776
(peppy jazz saxophone music)

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:44.094
We just got off the train at Sultanahmet,

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:45.921
that took about 20 minutes.

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.403
And this is the area,
this is a neighborhood

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:51.005
within the Fatih District of Istanbul.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.867
And it's one of the most
famous, most important areas

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:58.317
of Istanbul, and some of the
most well-known attractions

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.780
are located in this area.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.772
(bell rings)

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:04.448
And our first stop this
morning, we are going to

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:08.515
what is called Sultan
Ahmet Camil which is known

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:11.204
in English often as the Blue Mosque.

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:14.572
Wow, it is just amazing already,
I can see the Blue Mosque

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:18.267
to the right and Hagia Sophia to the left.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:22.533
(peppy Middle Eastern music)

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:25.175
The view from the outside is spectacular.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.654
And this is one of those
places that I have seen

00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:31.674
so many photos of that it
almost feels like I've been

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.949
here before, because I've
seen so many photos of it.

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.616
But at the same time, when you're here

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:38.911
it's completely different,
the magnitude of it

00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.635
and of course the inside
is going to be also

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:43.301
completely different than the photos.

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:48.251
Oh and stepping into the,
the main courtyard area.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.845
I think we came at the
perfect time though,

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:55.395
it's almost completely
quiet and just beautiful.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:59.395
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.671
We arrived a little bit
early, it's still not open

00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:06.644
to the public yet.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.609
We have about 30 minutes,
but I'm just enjoying

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.573
this courtyard, it is
absolutely spectacular.

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:15.212
I think we're gonna take a
look at the Hippodrome first

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.260
and then we will come back in
about 30 minutes to go inside.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.843
Hello, how are you?

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.734
You are the Hippodrome Dog.

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:28.941
Right outside of the Blue
Mosque is the Hippodrome

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:33.542
of Constantinople, and this
is an open square area.

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:37.351
Hippodrome means the horse
path and so, this area is

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.073
also often called the Horse Square.

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:42.633
The obelisk is made from pink granite

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:46.458
and with some Egyptian
carvings on the sides of it.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.991
And it looks almost new,
it's so like perfectly

00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.956
well-kept, and then on
the base of the obelisk

00:03:52.956 --> 00:03:55.390
you will see some different carvings.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.395
You can see Theodius the Great, as well as

00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:01.767
some of his family which
are carved into the base.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:05.934
(soft Middle Eastern percussion music)

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:10.491
One of the most iconic
sites in all of Istanbul is

00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:14.111
the Sultan Ahmet Camil,
which is also commonly known

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:16.508
as the Blue Mosque,
because of the blue tiles

00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:18.009
that are inside.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.446
It was built by Sultan Ahmet in the years

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.279
between 1609 and 1616.

00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:25.973
And there are Byzantine
and Christian influences

00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:29.748
in the architecture, but it
is an Ottoman-style mosque.

00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:33.854
And there are five main
domes, six minarets,

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:36.247
and then eight smaller domes which support

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:38.612
the entire structure.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.722
It is just a spectacular sight.

00:04:40.722 --> 00:04:43.567
It's 8:30 AM, they have just opened,

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.960
so we are entering right now.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.960
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:54.242
And you walk inside and it just opens up

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:57.044
into this huge prayer hall area.

00:04:57.044 --> 00:05:00.297
And within the, on the
ceiling within the domes

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:04.114
there are over 20,000
handmade ceramic tiles.

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:08.438
Some of them have a kind of
floral and cypress designs.

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:10.629
And then, it contrasts the red carpet,

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.051
which is on the floor.

00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:16.359
But, this is just an amazing
sight, just giant columns

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.363
and what I really like is
you can see all of the domes

00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:20.951
as well, on the inside.

00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.916
There are also dozens
of ancient chandeliers.

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:27.123
And there are over 200
stained glass windows.

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:31.123
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.785
And now we are heading
across the courtyard

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.447
to the Hagia Sophia.

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:44.447
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.355
And it started off as
a Christian Basilica,

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:54.956
and then it became a
Roman Catholic Cathedral,

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:57.512
and then it became a
mosque, and now present-day

00:05:57.512 --> 00:05:58.856
it is a museum.

00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:02.140
But, there is just layer
upon layer of history.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.552
They didn't allow me to
bring my microphone inside,

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:06.973
but they said video is okay.

00:06:06.973 --> 00:06:09.409
So, the audio might not be so good.

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.983
But, we are entering
into Hagia Sophia now.

00:06:12.983 --> 00:06:17.150
(softer, mysterious Middle Eastern music)

00:06:20.738 --> 00:06:24.955
It is absolutely gigantic,
and the main dome

00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:28.410
which is right above me
right now, it's so high.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.688
They are doing some
construction in here right now,

00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:33.372
so there is scaffolding on one side.

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:36.303
But that doesn't take
away from the magnitude

00:06:36.303 --> 00:06:37.829
of this place.

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:40.966
And you can just feel the
ancient history in here.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:44.716
(peppy Middle Eastern music)

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.102
There is even a noticeable aroma in here

00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:54.812
that smells kind of like
stone and kind of like must.

00:06:54.812 --> 00:06:57.395
It just smells ancient in here.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:05.169
Along with the dome and
the entire Hagia Sophia,

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.853
one of the things that
I've noticed is the floor,

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:11.629
which includes just
giant pieces of marble.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:14.396
Just imagine how many
1,000s and 1,000s of people

00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:16.469
have passed through this same door

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.415
and walked across this same stone.

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:20.648
And you can see it starting to slump.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:24.224
We are now heading up
to the upper gallery,

00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:27.961
oh, and entering this, it feels
like we're underground here.

00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.961
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:07:33.524 --> 00:07:35.189
It just keeps on going and going,

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.053
wrapping around and up.

00:07:37.053 --> 00:07:41.053
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.330
I'm gonna go look out this
window and I think you can get

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.496
a nice view of the Blue Mosque from here.

00:07:57.496 --> 00:07:58.329
Oh, yeah.

00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:03.833
(foreign words are spoken)

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.284
Hagia Sophia is a place that
I have dreamed about visiting

00:08:07.284 --> 00:08:09.520
ever since high school,
when I took a course

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.468
on Western Civilization.

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:14.924
So it is, I'm extremely
glad to have had the chance

00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:17.770
to visit, it was amazing.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.775
When you come to Istanbul,
you do not wanna miss seeing,

00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:23.789
both the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia.

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:27.727
We are now walking over
to the Topkapi Palace.

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:31.727
(vigorous Middle Eastern music)

00:08:33.415 --> 00:08:35.446
And I think I forgot to
mention this earlier,

00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:38.577
but I bought a Museum Pass Istanbul,

00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:42.239
and it costs 85 Lira, and it is valid

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.364
for many of the museums and
it's valid for five days.

00:08:45.364 --> 00:08:48.043
So even, we entered into Hagia Sophia

00:08:48.043 --> 00:08:49.950
and now we're gonna enter into the Palace.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.669
Each of those entrances
on their own are 40 Liras.

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:55.107
So with the card, that's
just an extra little bit

00:08:55.107 --> 00:08:57.665
and it also allows access
to many more museums.

00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:59.739
So if you're planning to
visit many of the museums

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:02.827
in Istanbul, it's a great
way to save some money

00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:06.764
and also it allows you to
bypass the lines for tickets.

00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:08.714
The entrance of the Palace
really looks like a castle

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:12.700
with two towers and the
doorway right in the middle.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.533
(softer Middle Eastern music)

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:21.309
You have to walk through a
series of gates and courtyards.

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:23.544
The landscape, the trees, and the gardens,

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:27.711
and the courtyards are also
really nice at this Palace.

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:32.527
The entire Palace area is
huge, you can definitely spend

00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:34.602
a couple of hours just
walking around the courtyards

00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:38.769
and the gardens, and then
going into the different rooms.

00:09:39.972 --> 00:09:43.065
And now I am out here,
this is the third courtyard

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:46.923
I think, and there's a nice
view overlooking the Bosphorus.

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:50.256
(jazzy saxophone music)

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:05.429
This is the Golden Pavilion
where the Sultan is reported

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:08.842
to have broken his fast
during the Ramadan period.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:12.175
(jazzy saxophone music)

00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:19.275
For our final stop at the Palace,
I'm in the Imperial Harem,

00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:21.347
which is an area of the
Palace that was reserved

00:10:21.347 --> 00:10:23.461
exclusively for women.

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.022
And this is supposed to
be one of the highlights

00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:27.606
of visiting the Palace.

00:10:27.606 --> 00:10:30.853
What's already amazing just
entering is the tile work

00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:33.280
and the preservation of the tiles.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.447
(soft, mysterious Middle Eastern music)

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:45.758
I just spent some time looking
around the Imperial Hall,

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.179
that's one of the most impressive places

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.846
in the whole Palace.

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.560
(water trickles, voices murmur)

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.208
That was the perfect way to
end this tour of the Palace.

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:58.795
That was definitely the
most impressive part

00:10:58.795 --> 00:11:00.663
of the whole Palace,
it's so well-preserved

00:11:00.663 --> 00:11:02.491
and it's a lot bigger than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:04.806
You just keep walking through the hallways

00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:07.035
and the rooms and passageways.

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:10.367
And the tile work is
especially just, yeah.

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:12.274
You just have to admire it.

00:11:12.274 --> 00:11:15.523
All of this sightseeing
has really made me hungry,

00:11:15.523 --> 00:11:18.124
so next, Ying and I are
on our way to lunch.

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:21.791
(peppy, modern chime music)

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:27.992
(voices murmur)

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:29.903
For lunch today we walked
over to a restaurant

00:11:29.903 --> 00:11:33.277
that is famous for serving
Cag Kebap, which is

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:36.566
on a horizontal spit and
I think I may have gotten

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:38.516
the best seat in the entire restaurant,

00:11:38.516 --> 00:11:40.221
out here in the alley.

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:44.604
But right, literally right
behind me is the spit of meat.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.085
He is carving the meat,
so I'm getting like

00:11:47.085 --> 00:11:51.717
the meat aromas from behind
me and it smells unbelievable.

00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:54.157
They're using real fire to cook the meat

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:55.376
and it's just sizzling.

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:57.932
You can see the fat and
the juices actually like

00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:00.575
bubbling on the skewer of meat.

00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:03.742
It is a pretty packed
environment here for lunch

00:12:03.742 --> 00:12:05.981
and I ordered up the special.

00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.194
You can smell the aroma,
the fumes of the lamb,

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:12.013
roasting over that fire, or
up to the side of that fire,

00:12:12.013 --> 00:12:15.244
because it's a horizontal spit.

00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:18.047
He just masterfully slices off the meat,

00:12:18.047 --> 00:12:20.804
and making sure that
the meat is both juicy,

00:12:20.804 --> 00:12:23.122
but slightly crispy on the edges.

00:12:23.122 --> 00:12:25.756
And then you can see how
the meat is both going to be

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:29.850
like oily and juicy, but kind
of crispy at the same time.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.130
And also serve it with
bread and a roasted chili

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.838
as well as onions and we got us a couple

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.059
of side dishes as well.

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.577
But I just first have to
immediately taste that meat

00:12:38.577 --> 00:12:40.566
with nothing on it.

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:44.504
Get some of that meat
off, just look at this,

00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:46.921
look at this thing of beauty.

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:49.762
Oh,

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:54.106
oh yeah, that is stunning.

00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:59.825
It's so nicely salty, but
that really brings out

00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:03.153
like the oily flavor of the real lamb.

00:13:03.153 --> 00:13:07.584
And then, it's not like a
fall apart tender texture,

00:13:07.584 --> 00:13:10.267
but it's very tender to
chew, but it does have

00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:12.544
a little bit of a texture to it.

00:13:12.544 --> 00:13:13.965
Wow, that's incredible.

00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:15.997
Now onto the bread, and
what I see most people do

00:13:15.997 --> 00:13:18.718
is you grab, this is a very thin bread.

00:13:18.718 --> 00:13:21.353
I'm gonna leave it to the
half, and what I'll do

00:13:21.353 --> 00:13:26.241
with the rest of that skewer
is I will put all of the rest.

00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:28.342
I think you can kind of
just wrap it up like this

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.842
and pull off all of that meat,

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:36.909
and slide it all out,
put this on the side.

00:13:36.909 --> 00:13:40.867
I'm gonna actually add
in that whole chili,

00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:43.698
and then also I've gotta
add in some onions.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.342
The plate of onions, and
I think that is sumac

00:13:46.342 --> 00:13:47.759
sprinkled on top.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.933
Onions,

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.303
perfect.

00:13:58.034 --> 00:14:02.040
And then I'm gonna sprinkle
on some of this dry chili,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.235
and then wrap this up.

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:08.402
(voices murmur in a foreign language)

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:21.784
That meat is so crazily
flavorful that it just

00:14:21.784 --> 00:14:23.977
provides flavor for the entire bread.

00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:26.375
But I love it with the
addition of those onions

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.321
and especially that roasted chili.

00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:31.571
Now, I'll stick this onto my next bite.

00:14:37.587 --> 00:14:40.837
Mm, we've also got some type of a soup.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:48.393
I think that's like a lentil soup.

00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:52.112
It's like a, I think
it's like a lentil puree.

00:14:52.112 --> 00:14:53.696
We've also got a mixed
salad, there are tomatoes

00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:57.529
in here and cucumbers
and parsley and chilies.

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:03.906
Mm, oh yeah, I need to
squeeze on the lemon.

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:09.808
(voices murmur in a foreign language)

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:20.123
Mm, the tomatoes in
Turkey have been so good.

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.233
For my next roll, and you can order more

00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:25.062
skewers of meat as well.

00:15:25.062 --> 00:15:27.729
I'm gonna double up on the meat,

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:32.334
and next skewer.

00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:38.482
What I love so much about this meat is

00:15:38.482 --> 00:15:42.585
it is the absolute perfect
ratio of fat and meat.

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:45.311
So, it's soft, but it's not too soft.

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.437
And then, it is just packed with flavor.

00:15:48.437 --> 00:15:52.950
And that saltiness really brings
out the flavor of the lamb.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.200
It's just yeah, it's unbelievably good.

00:15:57.868 --> 00:16:00.389
I like to go heavy on the onions as well.

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:03.389
I may as well go for all the onions.

00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:07.248
This is gonna be a thick one.

00:16:07.248 --> 00:16:10.998
Add some of this, and
I think this is mostly,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.585
I think this might be a combination

00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:16.753
of both tomatoes and red chilies.

00:16:16.753 --> 00:16:19.193
But it's very fragrant,
a little bit spicy,

00:16:19.193 --> 00:16:20.939
and fantastic, and then I gotta sprinkle

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.483
some dry chili on here as well.

00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:25.489
And then, another half a chili here.

00:16:25.489 --> 00:16:27.739
This one is pretty big, but

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.196
this is gonna be fantastic.

00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:36.478
(voices murmur in a foreign language)

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.335
I could not resist the opportunity

00:16:44.335 --> 00:16:45.592
to order some more meat.

00:16:45.592 --> 00:16:48.680
I had to have two more
skewers, it's just so good.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.606
And I'm not gonna eat any
bread, just pure steak.

00:16:51.606 --> 00:16:55.773
Oh, I'll take that thick
piece from the middle there.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:03.353
That meat is spectacular, oh it's so good.

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:13.400
Yeah, I think I'm in love with
the grilled meats of Turkey.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.242
That was fabulous.

00:17:17.242 --> 00:17:19.479
And this is their very
famous dessert here.

00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:21.184
I'm not sure the name of
it, but they only serve

00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:24.023
one dessert, and you can
see walnuts in the middle

00:17:24.023 --> 00:17:26.541
and it looks like almost
little noodles on the outside.

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:30.708
And then it looks like a
sweet, kind of syrupy dressing.

00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:40.135
Mm, I think those are the
vermicelli, which are fried

00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:43.843
so they're crispy and then soaked in like

00:17:43.843 --> 00:17:46.093
a very sweet, sugary syrup.

00:17:47.218 --> 00:17:50.787
And then those walnuts are in the middle.

00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:53.147
It is pretty sweet for
me, I do prefer the salty,

00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:55.564
but that is very good though.

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:58.572
- Ah, yeah.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:04.942
The tea is a fantastic
way to end that meal.

00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:09.644
- I come from all east,

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:15.212
and now the (foreign word) is going east.

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:17.795
- Okay, okay, this was so good.

00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:22.059
It's so good.

00:18:23.188 --> 00:18:26.032
I am from America, but I live in Thailand.

00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:27.773
- Ah, Thailand, I also came across.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.749
- My wife is from Thailand.

00:18:28.749 --> 00:18:29.582
Oh, okay.

00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:32.770
- I know, the best Cag
Kebap around Istanbul

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.437
you are now sitting.

00:18:35.828 --> 00:18:38.172
- We ate it already.

00:18:38.172 --> 00:18:42.005
(words in a foreign language)

00:18:46.435 --> 00:18:49.018
Oh, (laughing)

00:18:53.126 --> 00:18:53.959
very nice.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.147
Oh, so then they grill
like also, okay, wow.

00:19:06.658 --> 00:19:09.325
Wow, that is right off the fire.

00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:14.208
Oh, that is stunning.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.204
That is amazing.

00:19:19.204 --> 00:19:20.037
- Thank you.

00:19:20.037 --> 00:19:22.818
- That is right off the spit.

00:19:22.818 --> 00:19:26.651
(words in a foreign language)

00:19:29.108 --> 00:19:32.775
Wow, that literally
just melted in my mouth.

00:19:39.022 --> 00:19:40.606
You have to go, "Mm."

00:19:40.606 --> 00:19:42.856
(laughter)

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.835
Oh, that was one of the
most amazing meals ever.

00:19:47.835 --> 00:19:51.737
The food was awesome
and the people eating,

00:19:51.737 --> 00:19:53.114
they were all so amazing.

00:19:53.114 --> 00:19:56.402
We met one man who sat next to us eating.

00:19:56.402 --> 00:19:59.164
And so the tables are
lined up so you inevitably

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:02.217
need to sit next to someone,
because it's always busy.

00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:05.006
And so, the man that sat
next to us, he was really

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.846
friendly, he started chatting,
he said that he traveled

00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:10.447
all the way from the
Asian side, somewhere far

00:20:10.447 --> 00:20:13.008
on the Asian side of
Istanbul to come to eat

00:20:13.008 --> 00:20:14.106
at this restaurant.

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:16.586
Because this is the best,
maybe one of the only

00:20:16.586 --> 00:20:19.391
and definitely the best
place in all of Istanbul

00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:21.385
that serves this type of kebab.

00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:23.741
Also, a special thanks to
all of you who recommended

00:20:23.741 --> 00:20:28.091
that restaurant, that
was just a mind-blowing

00:20:28.091 --> 00:20:30.123
meat experience.

00:20:30.123 --> 00:20:34.580
(peppy electronic chime music)

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.405
The next place we are going
today is the Basilica Cistern.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:42.551
(lively, jazzy saxophone music)

00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:45.674
The Basilica Cistern is
one of the many underground

00:20:45.674 --> 00:20:47.338
cisterns in Istanbul.

00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:49.125
And this one that we're
gonna visit it's located

00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:52.625
right across the street from Hagia Sophia.

00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:57.570
It's really dark and kind of feels damp

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.237
and musty down here.

00:21:01.103 --> 00:21:03.173
This was an ancient
cistern that dates back

00:21:03.173 --> 00:21:05.932
to the Byzantine period,
and it was commissioned

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:09.626
by Emperor Justinian the
First in the sixth century.

00:21:09.626 --> 00:21:11.861
Although there are many
underground cisterns

00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.258
in Istanbul, this is one of the largest

00:21:14.258 --> 00:21:17.344
and it is a water storage facility.

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:21.119
It measures 70 meters by 140 meters.

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:23.839
I have read that some
people find it spooky,

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:27.130
scary in here, and some people
find it kind of romantic.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.674
What are you thinking?

00:21:28.674 --> 00:21:30.381
Is it scary or romantic?

00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:31.315
- Both.

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:32.290
- [Mark] Both at the same time?

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.412
- [Ying] Mm, hm.

00:21:33.412 --> 00:21:36.381
- It definitely is a little bit spooky.

00:21:36.381 --> 00:21:40.548
(soft Middle Eastern percussion music)

00:21:45.277 --> 00:21:48.285
Definitely one of the main
attractions at the cistern

00:21:48.285 --> 00:21:51.008
are the statues of Medusa,
and there are two of them

00:21:51.008 --> 00:21:52.757
at the base of the columns.

00:21:52.757 --> 00:21:57.556
And it's not quite sure
known how the Roman Medusa

00:21:57.556 --> 00:22:00.319
statues got here to the
cistern, but it's thought

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:04.137
that they were brought
over from the Roman Empire.

00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:05.600
I have to wait until I get under one

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.350
of the lamps to blog.

00:22:08.363 --> 00:22:09.909
With all the fish down here, you could

00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:12.303
definitely survive for a while, too.

00:22:12.303 --> 00:22:16.323
(child's voice cries out
in a foreign language)

00:22:16.323 --> 00:22:19.207
We just exited back onto ground level

00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:23.152
from that dark dungeon,
that was pretty cool.

00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:26.239
So basically, this entire
ground and this park

00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:30.406
which is located right here,
the cistern is below that.

00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:33.674
It's the middle of the afternoon,

00:22:33.674 --> 00:22:36.397
I think that we've
decided to take the tram

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:40.564
back to our hotel and rest for
a little while before dinner.

00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:45.284
(rattling, rumbling on tracks)

00:22:45.284 --> 00:22:48.205
(voices speak in a foreign language)

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:52.372
(peppy electronic chime
music with clapping)

00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:07.811
We rested in the hotel for a little while

00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:10.856
and now back out walking,
and we're heading over

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:14.557
to an area call Besiktas for dinner.

00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:16.912
And the reason I know
Besiktas is because they have

00:23:16.912 --> 00:23:19.637
a football team and so
I recognized the name

00:23:19.637 --> 00:23:20.813
of the neighborhood.

00:23:20.813 --> 00:23:24.146
(jazzy saxophone music)

00:23:34.483 --> 00:23:35.863
We arrive to the restaurant,

00:23:35.863 --> 00:23:38.913
this place is called Balkan Lokantasi.

00:23:38.913 --> 00:23:40.945
And this is a very popular restaurant

00:23:40.945 --> 00:23:43.991
in a very busy area of town.

00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:46.756
And it is cafeteria-style,

00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:48.218
so actually we've had to line up,

00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:49.885
because there are so many people here.

00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:52.806
And we are getting in line
and then we're gonna order

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:54.473
whatever looks good.

00:23:59.427 --> 00:24:02.517
Okay, so you grab a tray
down here on the bottom.

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:04.420
Oh my goodness, there are so many choices.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.839
(woman's voice in a foreign language)

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.589
Chicken, in the back?

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:13.548
(voices murmur in a foreign language)

00:24:20.468 --> 00:24:23.551
(rattling, clinking)

00:24:26.643 --> 00:24:29.526
This is the type of meal
that is my favorite to eat

00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:31.351
in Thailand, it's called (foreign word),

00:24:31.351 --> 00:24:32.816
which means rice and curry.

00:24:32.816 --> 00:24:35.130
And they have all of the
different dishes prepared

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.832
and you just get rice and you choose

00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:37.971
the different dish that you want.

00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:39.557
That's in Thailand, but this is

00:24:39.557 --> 00:24:41.342
the Turkish version of that.

00:24:41.342 --> 00:24:43.371
You grab a tray and they just,

00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:46.735
they must have at least two
dozen, maybe three dozen

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.842
dishes available, you
just point and choose

00:24:48.842 --> 00:24:50.021
for the dishes that you want.

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.050
Or if you know the names, you choose them,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.593
and then you put them on your tray,

00:24:53.593 --> 00:24:56.031
you just walk through the
line, your tray gets pushed

00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:58.992
down the line and then you
pay for whatever you eat.

00:24:58.992 --> 00:25:00.937
And I made a little bit of a mistake,

00:25:00.937 --> 00:25:05.116
because it was so busy and so
kind of like rushed to order

00:25:05.116 --> 00:25:06.537
that I didn't really
know what I was ordering.

00:25:06.537 --> 00:25:09.294
So I just pointed to bunch of dishes,

00:25:09.294 --> 00:25:12.305
and so I may have gotten a
little bit too much food.

00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:14.742
But I think that's
okay, it looks fantastic

00:25:14.742 --> 00:25:16.856
and I'm getting ready to dig in.

00:25:16.856 --> 00:25:18.684
This is an awesome restaurant,

00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:22.584
and I'm gonna eat Thai style,
with my spoon and fork.

00:25:22.584 --> 00:25:26.001
This one is chick peas I
believe, garbanzo beans.

00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:27.825
And I saw most people
eating it with this rice,

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:30.034
which is rice which
looks like there's some,

00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:32.353
a few small vegetables within the rice.

00:25:32.353 --> 00:25:34.947
And most people actually
got the rice with this

00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:37.830
on top of it, but I didn't
know how to order that,

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.089
so I just got it on the side.

00:25:39.089 --> 00:25:41.404
I will put some of this onto the rice,

00:25:41.404 --> 00:25:43.237
chili flakes on there.

00:25:48.217 --> 00:25:49.050
Mm,

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.833
that's like a slightly spicy,

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.309
tomatoey chick pea stew.

00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:00.546
That's just like good,
classic beans and rice.

00:26:00.546 --> 00:26:03.878
I think this one is yogurt with eggplant,

00:26:03.878 --> 00:26:06.031
I think that's yogurt,
and oh, are there roasted

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.698
chilies in here too?

00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:14.808
Mm, that is a very, very
creamy I think, yogurt

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:16.915
and very rich, and then there are pieces

00:26:16.915 --> 00:26:18.499
of roasted eggplant.

00:26:18.499 --> 00:26:22.764
I think there are, there
might be potatoes in here

00:26:22.764 --> 00:26:24.514
and maybe some tomatoes as well.

00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:26.297
And I think this one is another salad,

00:26:26.297 --> 00:26:31.166
maybe with yogurt and some
kind of green vegetable.

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:34.008
That tastes like spinach,
just flooded in yogurt.

00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:35.646
That is nice, that's very cooling.

00:26:35.646 --> 00:26:39.713
Okay next dish, and this
one looks fantastic.

00:26:39.713 --> 00:26:42.638
It looks like a piece of
cheese on top with some kind

00:26:42.638 --> 00:26:44.791
of green vegetable and
then on the bottom of this

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.919
like cap of vegetable cheese are pieces

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:49.549
of meat and potatoes.

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:52.799
Wow, this is like a complete meal dish.

00:26:54.223 --> 00:26:57.806
At least one that goes
with all the dishes.

00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:06.085
Mm, okay this one is awesome.

00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:09.638
It's like a creamy,
oily sauce with nuggets

00:27:09.638 --> 00:27:13.600
of tender, I think it's beef
and then the green vegetable is

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.826
very soft and tender, and
then just a cheese cap.

00:27:17.826 --> 00:27:21.159
But the cheese is not too rich or salty.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:23.666
Mm, I like this.

00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:29.038
And I think this should
be eaten with rice.

00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:33.205
It's either, maybe it's
beef, I'm really not sure.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.121
Oh, that is awesome,

00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:44.435
that meat is fall-apart tender.

00:27:44.435 --> 00:27:47.521
And that's like a little bit of a tangy,

00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:49.710
like tomatoey sauce, it
kind of tastes similar

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.409
to the chick peas, but
the meat version of it.

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:55.396
And then this is another eggplant we got,

00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:57.063
with tomatoes in it.

00:27:58.845 --> 00:28:03.012
Mm, just creamy, roasted
eggplant with tart tomatoes.

00:28:11.073 --> 00:28:14.771
I am pretty stuffed
after eating that meal.

00:28:14.771 --> 00:28:16.190
That was a lot of yogurt.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.611
I don't know if I've
ever eaten so much yogurt

00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:19.280
in one meal in my life.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.185
But that was some really
good food that tastes really

00:28:21.185 --> 00:28:24.881
like homemade, home cooking, actually.

00:28:24.881 --> 00:28:28.095
And this restaurant has
just continually the line

00:28:28.095 --> 00:28:31.019
has never stopped the entire
time I was eating in here.

00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:32.807
And actually, it's gotten longer.

00:28:32.807 --> 00:28:35.125
People just keep flowing
through this restaurant

00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:38.215
and this is a quick place to chow down.

00:28:38.215 --> 00:28:39.718
I would have loved to
come to this restaurant

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.831
when I was in university,
when I could eat more

00:28:41.831 --> 00:28:43.375
than I can now.

00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:44.962
But that was a wonderful meal,

00:28:44.962 --> 00:28:48.045
thank you to all of you who
recommended this restaurant.

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:50.559
I'm gonna end the video
for today right now.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.265
I think we just gotta
walk back to the hotel

00:28:52.265 --> 00:28:55.510
and I need to walk off this, this meal.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.890
Thank you all for watching this video.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.149
Please remember to give it a thumbs up

00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:59.567
if you enjoyed it.

00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:01.233
Leave a comment below.

00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.816
It has been an amazing
full day in Istanbul

00:29:06.272 --> 00:29:08.792
and it's been sort of a tour of some

00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:12.245
of the main attractions,
some delicious food,

00:29:12.245 --> 00:29:13.908
and I will see you on the next video.

00:29:13.908 --> 00:29:15.211
Thank you again for watching.

00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:17.376
(beep)

00:29:17.376 --> 00:29:18.780
(words in a foreign language)

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.525
And can you see anything?

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:21.907
(laughter)

00:29:21.907 --> 00:29:23.893
Ying is looking right
into the piece of wood,

00:29:23.893 --> 00:29:25.804
but I'm getting a nice view

00:29:25.804 --> 00:29:27.221
of the Bosphorus.

00:29:28.608 --> 00:29:30.356
Do I look like a ghost?

00:29:30.356 --> 00:29:31.495
(woman speaks words in foreign language)

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:32.328
Okay.

00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:35.995
(rhythmic percussion music)
