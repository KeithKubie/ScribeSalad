1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,930
Talking about escape stories about people
being trapped and them getting out,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,853
getting free.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,360
And in our last segment week met a guy
for whom will the escape itself became a

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:14,100
trap. But now we're going to take our
escape Motif to a much bigger scale.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,870
Yet we're calling this, by the way,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,650
we are the limit because in this one
we're going to the outer limits of the

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:24,130
human imagination began for us when
we spoke with this writer. Yes,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,580
I hear you. Boom. Here and Dole Nick is
his name and he told us a story about,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,590
so this is Isaac Newton's
story for the most part.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,100
And it's a story that involves the
Earth, the heavens, God, humanity.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,250
And you might as well
throw on the apple. Um,

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,150
the one thing everybody knows about Newton
is that an apple fell from a tree and

13
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,360
bonked him on the head, which
isn't true. I was told, right,

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,350
that isn't an apocryphal,
it's probably not true. But,

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:53,140
but it's a story that Newton himself
told. Oh really? Cause Newton,

16
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:56,680
according to Ed all his life had this
notion that he was different from other

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,980
people. Uh, not only different
from but, but better. Uh,

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,770
he had a pipeline to God.
God was whispering secrets,

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,710
the secrets of creation into his ear. Uh,

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,330
no one else had been blessed in this way.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,110
Other people's role in life was
simply to, uh, to bog him down.

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,790
Not what I would call the modest
guy. No, but identity rate,

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,110
what our story begins around
1665, Newton is at Cambridge.

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,750
She's a student in Cambridge,
is hit by the plague.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,140
They send everybody home because although
nobody understands how the disease

26
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:30,120
works, they know that if people are
crowded together, they tend to, uh,

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,010
to all get it. So, so everybody
go your separate ways.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,040
This was a kind of an enforced
summer vacation, right?

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,100
And He's like 19 or 20 at
this point. 2122. Okay.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,980
Newton goes home to his
mother's farm. Mom's like, cool,

31
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:45,980
now you can help me on the farm. But
he says, no, because he has a plan.

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,360
He'd brought some books home,

33
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,310
a bunch of of textbooks and he locks
himself in his room and sets himself not

34
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,830
only to having mastered all the
science that had ever been done,

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,660
but two plunging on ahead
of everyone else on his own,

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,670
motivated by this religious faith that
everything in the universe was set up by

37
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,610
a god who wanted someone
to crack the code.

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,330
Newton believes he's the one in the
same as he doing in his room. I mean,

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,020
was he just sitting there and like
with a thousand giant textbooks,

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,870
all that's known is that he did this.

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,120
He just went into his room and
came out with what we're about.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,890
So he came out with, with the how
gravity works, how light works,

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,540
how rainbows work, how the tides
work. And then having done all summer,

44
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,440
he did all this. What did you do on
your summer vacation jet? I know Mike,

45
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,950
my summer I, um, I learned how
to fold sheets like Marines do,

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,230
which I thought was pretty good too.

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,770
So after having one flash
of insight after another,

48
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,490
Newton now sets his mind to one
of the great problems of all time,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,180
which for our purposes we will
call the problem of the moon.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,250
And just to set this up,

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,510
what everybody before [inaudible]
Galileo thought is there were a bunch of

52
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,480
ordinary things here on earth like rocks
and they behave in the ordinary way

53
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,230
that we know, you know, pick
up a rock, let go it faults,

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,110
and there are a bunch of much more
different mysterious, elegant,

55
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,470
perfect things in the sky like
the moon, which doesn't fall,

56
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,780
it just flutes there.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,290
So one could conclude that the moon
has its own separate set of laws.

58
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,500
There are one set of laws that work here
on earth and another set that work in

59
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,310
the heavens.

60
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,400
And there's no reason it should be the
same set of laws any more than New York's

61
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,760
laws should be the same as as Paris's
laws. Can it make sense? Actually?

62
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,310
Heavenly things float earthly things fall.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,350
But then here's where the problem begins.

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,280
Newton and a bunch of people at that time
had gotten a hold of this new fangled

65
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,840
thing called telescope.

66
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,820
And one of the things they saw was
that the moon wasn't this mysterious,

67
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,780
a heavenly body that they seem,
it was a big rock, irregular,

68
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,610
lumpy potato wish rock.

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,830
Oh. People were like, Huh,

70
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,410
but Newton being of course
Newton. But now wait a second.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,400
If the job of a is to fall, and
if the moon is just another rock,

72
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,960
why doesn't it fall down? Exactly. So

73
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,830
what's it doing sitting up
there night after night?

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,693
Whoa.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,980
And it's at this point that Newton
sitting in his room or wherever he was,

76
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:16,280
we can imagine, makes a crazy mental leap.

77
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:20,180
He thought back to a little thought
experiment that Galileo had come up with,

78
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,410
which initially might not make much
sense the connection, but it pays off.

79
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
And here's the setup.

80
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,130
You've got someone standing in a big
field with a gun that he's about to shoot

81
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,940
it,

82
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,650
and next to that person with his gun is
a person holding in his hand a bullet.

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,800
So you've got a person holding a gun and
a person holding just the bullet side

84
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:43,190
by side and the bullet in the hand and
the bullet in the gun are exactly the

85
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:48,140
same height above the ground and
now somebody says, ready, aim, fire.

86
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,110
And at the instant he says
fire the man with the gun,

87
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,590
shoots that bullet horizontally.
And at that same instant,

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,820
the man next to him holding the bullet
in his hand opens his hand and the bullet

89
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,480
trucks. So there's one bullet
zipping along, mn falling.

90
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,700
And then there's another
one that just falls, right?

91
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,930
We shoot the bullet out of the horizontal
gun and we dropped the bullet from

92
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,650
right decks to the guy
at the same time. Yes,

93
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,640
both bullets will hit the ground
eventually, but when they do,

94
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:18,350
they'll be far apart. And Galileo's riddle
was, which of those bullets hits the

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
ground first? Well,

96
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,250
I mean everybody would know that the
one that would hit the gun first and the

97
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:27,460
one that you just dropped because the
other one has to go all that. This is,

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,070
this is, this is a hard drill. And the
answer is why is it such a hard riddle?

99
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,630
Because I would think that the bullet
you drop is just gonna hit first.

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,620
The gun's got to go all the
way. No, those two bullets

101
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,800
both hit the ground at the exact
same instant. Really that's,

102
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,090
that's an experimental fact.

103
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,300
The bullet from the gun and the bullet
from things lands at the same time. Yes.

104
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,160
This bullet that shot horizontally,

105
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,920
it doesn't go like Wiley
Coyote running off a cliff.

106
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,560
It doesn't go straight through it.
Straight, straight, and then fall.

107
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,040
It's curving as it goes.

108
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,790
And the thing that causes it to curve
as it goes of course, is gravity.

109
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,230
It's the same gravity that is pulling
the bullet that you drop. Same gravity,

110
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,520
same pole, same speed.
So counterintuitively,

111
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:15,260
when you drop a bullet and it falls
for this long, when you fire the gun,

112
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,700
it'll also fall for that long,
even though ends up a mile away.

113
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,860
See that was Galloway was riddle and
that's as far as Galileo took it. Yeah.

114
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,840
Newton looked at that and
he said something smart.
First thing he said is, okay,

115
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,674
this field,

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,180
let's not pretend that this is some
perfectly flat field that goes on forever.

117
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,700
No, we're on the earth
and the earth is round.

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,460
And what roundness means is that the
ground curves away below horizontal.

119
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,510
So really what's happening is it has the
bullet is shooting across the field and

120
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,350
falling to the earth.

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,090
The Earth at the same time is very
gradually curving away from it.

122
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,820
Now of course, most guns, you know,

123
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,760
they don't shoot the bullet very
far and at that short distance,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
the field is still pretty much flat.
But here's what Newton thought.

125
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,920
What if you could find just the right
gun that could shoot that bullet,

126
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,130
not just across the field but
across like thousands of miles.

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,380
And what if as it falls,

128
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,410
that bullet curves down towards the earth
in just the same way as the earth is

129
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,840
curving away from it. In this
scenario, the bullet that we've shot,

130
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,610
we'll keep falling and
falling and falling,

131
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,700
but the earth keeps falling and falling
and falling away from the bullet.

132
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,150
So the bullet falls forever.
The earth curves forever.

133
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
The picture never changes.

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,790
So the bullet then does what the pulpit,

135
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,093
he's in orbit

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,180
[inaudible]

137
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,790
hundreds of years before
Sputnik and other satellites.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,430
Newton has invented the satellite.

139
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,620
And on top of that he said when we see
rocks like the moon that are not falling,

140
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,720
the reason we think they're not falling
is because we misunderstand really just

141
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:08,680
as the gun launched a bullet on
earth and it goes in never falls.

142
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,100
God who was presumably a terrifically
strong picture launched the moon around

143
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,790
the earth at just such a rate that that
would continue in its circle around us

144
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,880
forever. This is a perpetual dance.

145
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,040
The partners are bound together but they
never come close and they never break

146
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,240
up either. It's this endless round,

147
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,980
round round

148
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,140
from which there is no the scheme.

149
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
What this does,

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,950
what Newton did is take the
moon out of the domain of, of,

151
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,940
of poets and, and, and,
uh, musicians, the,

152
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:53,941
the golden or in this kind of thing and
last Sobek to the same that we use here

153
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:00,360
on earth. In other words, what he
showed is that in a very real way,

154
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,200
there's no separation between
the US and the heavens.

155
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,540
The same set of laws
does govern everything.

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,330
It's one universe and
I've explained it all.

157
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,380
[inaudible]

158
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,420
once you figured out
the laws of gravitation,

159
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,490
then you can send
spacecraft to Mars, Jupiter,

160
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,900
Saturn, anywhere out there.

161
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,570
If you're a radio lab
listener from way back,

162
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,690
you might recognize that voice
that's an [inaudible]. Hi.

163
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,440
One of the first stories we did actually
I interviewed her about working on the

164
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,260
famous uh, golden record.
You remember this? Sure.

165
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,860
So the idea at the time was to put
this record on the voyager capsule,

166
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:45,790
send it in the space,

167
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,420
and on the record would be all of these
sounds that represented, you know,

168
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,020
us kiss a mother's first word.

169
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,970
It's your newborn baby. Come on. Now.

170
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,663
In any case,

171
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,820
Ann was the one who was in charge of
choosing all the sounds to put onto that

172
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:09,380
record. She and Carl Sagan work together
on that project. And here's the thing,

173
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,220
we stopped our story as
the rockets took off,

174
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,580
but obviously that was just the beginning
of the story and the voyager capsules

175
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:17,414
right now

176
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,960
or about to make the kind of escape
that Newton could have only dreamed of.

177
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,430
Okay. It's the record thing. And, uh,
our producer loom levy has been, sorry,

178
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,050
I just turned my headphones up way too
loud. I've been following this story. Ah,

179
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,690
AH, oh yeah, yeah. Just turn it down.
Yeah. Okay. So it can pick it up.

180
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:35,860
Where we, uh, left. Okay.

181
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:40,180
So like in the point of the mission
wasn't really to deliver this record,

182
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,260
it was to go out and look at all the
planets in the outer solar system.

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
So starting in 1977, these two
little spaceships, two spacecraft,

184
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,990
voyager one and two went racing
away from Earth snapping pictures.

185
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,440
And so every time before [inaudible]
would reach another planet, you know,

186
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:01,670
all of the voyager people would get
together, go into the imaging room

187
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,040
and see the pictures come
from the outer solar system.

188
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,210
Do you remember seeing them? I remember
as a child saying life magazine,

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,720
you know, I was seven when
[inaudible] was launched. So this is

190
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,100
[inaudible] professor at Boston
University. As a grown up,

191
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:21,640
she became part of the voyager team. All
the pictures that, you know, as a kid,

192
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,450
you look at the books and to see what,
how Knapton look how Jupiter look.

193
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,880
No, just a complete revelations.

194
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,220
Sat to the image of Saturn technique,
color like pink and look, reddish,

195
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:38,900
turquoise, color yellow. And
those rings just spectacular.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,770
They could see active volcanoes on
one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally,

197
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,510
that vision of Neptune,

198
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,080
this like blue jewel,

199
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,260
really blue, it's all came from voyager.

200
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,640
We had no idea how they
look like before wager.

201
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,620
Neptune was the last big cool planet
and it was the last thing they were

202
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,760
supposed to photograph.

203
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,540
After that the cameras were going
to be shut off till save energy,

204
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,720
but Kelsey and convinced them to turn
voyager back to earth and take a final

205
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:14,140
picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh,

206
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:18,100
one of the ships slowly rotated
so it was facing back to earth

207
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,023
and

208
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,710
it snapped a picture. One
last picture. Describe it.

209
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,120
So it's mostly empty.

210
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,960
Um, it's, it's pretty dark.

211
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,740
You can see sort of streaks
of light coming from the sun

212
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,980
and then you honestly wouldn't notice
it if it wasn't pointed out to you.

213
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:47,720
But down in one corner, kind
of a suspended in a Sunbeam,

214
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,790
there is a very small dot.

215
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,420
Blew a pale blue dot that
with us in Carl sagans words,

216
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,020
everyone you ever knew, everyone
you ever loved, every superstar,

217
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,730
every corrupt politician, just
everyone in all of history,

218
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,410
everything is some total op Rod.
Think of the rivers of blind

219
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,110
so that one indistinguishable group
could have momentary domination over a

220
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,140
fraction of that pixel.

221
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,090
It was one of those really rare
it images every single day.

222
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:31,091
I hear from people who take that Pale
blue.so deeply to heart and was it,

223
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:36,540
it was a complete reframing after
that because I was with tone-deaf,

224
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,670
but here's the thing.

225
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,320
The ships kept going, going, going, going,

226
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,730
drifting through the darkness,

227
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,100
going, going, going,

228
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,270
even though they weren't taking pictures
anymore that they were using like their

229
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:57,470
other senses, little instruments that
detect like how many particles are around,

230
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:58,490
what the temperature is.

231
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,360
So they were hurdling through this
empty space really fast, measuring,

232
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,920
sending that data back and scientists
like that off where they're listening and

233
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,920
waiting for what was not clear,

234
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,430
but they knew at some point these
capsules would get to the edge,

235
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,200
the edge of what? The solar system,
the solar system has an edge.

236
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,410
I thought it was just a big spiral.
Has an edge. It's, it's like a bubble.

237
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,590
C The Sun has a wind.

238
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,200
If we start has a wing, but
the sun has its own wind,

239
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,710
it blows out through the
solar system. It's very fast.

240
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,820
It can be between 400 to 800
kilometers per second anyway.

241
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,250
It blows out from the sun
past all the planets and uh,

242
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,650
it keeps everything else out. Oh, so
it's like blowing up a balloon. Yeah,

243
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,330
exactly. The wind gives it a shape, right?

244
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,650
So these little things are cruising
out towards this edge, wherever it is.

245
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,140
Scientists don't quite know
where it is or what it is.

246
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,120
The guys in the control room are like
pinging the ships. Like, Hey, what's,

247
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,250
what's up? What do you see in the
ships are like nothing. How about now?

248
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,890
Not much, no. Nothing. And how long
before they actually see something?

249
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,030
14 years. Oh Man.

250
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,750
It's like driving through Kansas
but like a million times worse. But

251
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,850
there comes a day I end of 2004 where
they stopped listening for a little while

252
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,840
because the antenna,

253
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,210
NASA only has so many antennas and
they have to use them to listen to

254
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,210
everything. So for a little while
the voyager teams like, okay,

255
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:27,350
you guys over there can use the
antennas. We're going to lunch. Yeah.

256
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,460
I mean it's not like anything's
happened. Nothing's happening anyway.

257
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,850
It's been 14 goddamn years.
Yeah guys, it's cool.

258
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,640
And they come back a few hours
later, start listening again and

259
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,270
it's happened. Very southern.
Everything is totally changed. Really.

260
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,290
All of a sudden, boom.

261
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,180
The speed of the wind dropped from
around three 80 kilometers per second

262
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,990
to 100 instantly. Like
just all in one sentence.

263
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,150
And then everything out
there started to get messy.

264
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,370
Top on [inaudible] much more top on land.

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,190
And before particles are also, um,

266
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,410
behaving a very different way.

267
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,250
And the fields are very, um, we are

268
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,470
the fields, the magnetic field.
So just like the sun has a wind,

269
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,240
the sun has a magnetic field as well.

270
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,900
The field starts at the sun and then
curves out in this kind of graceful arc

271
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:33,901
through the solar system in the how the
subtle tates create what people call

272
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,660
[inaudible] cart.

273
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,720
You know how like a skirt will
flair a few spin around real fast.

274
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,540
[inaudible] that's apparently kind
of what this field looks like.

275
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,890
But way out there, it seemed like
the skirt had started to fray,

276
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,770
maybe tear a little threads,

277
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,770
had broken off and seem to be
floating around on their own.

278
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,090
Not connected to anything. So
what does this all mean? I mean,

279
00:16:56,091 --> 00:17:00,680
if the fields are breaking down and the
wind is dying down and you said the wind

280
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,170
is what actually creates the
space of the solar system,

281
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,940
does this mean we're out to know?

282
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,670
I kind of thought that was what was
happening, but no, it's not out.

283
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,770
And it's not quite in,

284
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,730
it's in the edge of the
bubble. It's in the air. Yeah.

285
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,120
But it's not like, I'm not like a
little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick,

286
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,290
thick edge. So the edge isn't just a
little line that you cross. It's a place.

287
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,180
Yeah.

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,180
And while we listened the two voyager
ships moved through this edge for several

289
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,683
years.

290
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,970
Then something very
interesting happen, um,

291
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,750
is that the wind on virtual one

292
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,210
stopped like completely stopped. Yeah.

293
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,090
So now we're out. No, no.

294
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,230
I mean this is what people thought,

295
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,370
but there are other measurements like
temperature and number of particles.

296
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,340
The magnetic field doesn't tell
us that we are out of the bubble.

297
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,410
Nature surprised us again.

298
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,460
So now we think there's a place
at the edge of our solar system.

299
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,050
Why didn't they edge the edge of the edge?

300
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,340
That's utterly still no
wind at all. A pause.

301
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,370
People are Connie stagnation layer and
there is a big discussion why this layer

302
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,680
exist and how thick it is
and by how thick it is,

303
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:25,880
she means when will it end?
Because once we get past this.

304
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:29,090
So has anything ever crossed
the boundary before? No.

305
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,180
This would be the first man
made object to live any star.

306
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,690
And a voyager has like right
there smelling, touching
that boundary. You know,

307
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,870
you only do those things first.
Once like your first kiss,

308
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,150
your first tasted alcohol,
your first time driving a car,

309
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,400
the first time you see the ocean

310
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:52,880
[inaudible]

311
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,740
these things open up a whole new world.

312
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,930
First time out of the solar system.

313
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,460
Aw.

314
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,630
So when is it going to freaking happen?

315
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,800
It might have happened while we were
talking. Yeah. We're thinking from now.

316
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:08,160
Any moment now. Next couple of
months or three years from now,

317
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:10,560
four years from now. It's close.

318
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,600
Everyday opened my Google alert for
voyager and I look and see did it happen

319
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:19,270
today? [inaudible] if it happens before
the show goes out, I'm really pissed.

320
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:23,180
Yeah. Every day. That's the first thing
you do in the morning. Oh, alright.

321
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,440
Like the third thing.
