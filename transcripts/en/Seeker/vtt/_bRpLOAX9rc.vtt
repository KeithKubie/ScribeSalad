00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.509
Eggs were unhealthy and then healthy.

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.900
Alcohol is healthy but also dangerous!

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.330
Butter was bad, now it's GREAT!

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.550
WHAT THE HELL SCIENCE!!

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.699
Guys, science isn't perfect.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.699
It's not!

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.699
I'm not.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.699
We're not.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.210
And sometimes it's really confusing.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.509
Some studies show fat is good for you, and
more studies show fat is bad you.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.009
Last week, the British Medical Journal released
a study claiming the effects of alcohol were

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.650
vastly overstated; and that globally, more
than three million deaths are attributed to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.820
alcohol consumption.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.380
Yet, in the same damn week, Oregon State University
says drinking wine could help you burn fat!!!

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.750
WHAT THE HELL.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.961
Okay, science isn't law, we in science accept
more than one idea at the same time, and we

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.740
question constantly.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.810
That's hard to do!

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.560
It's called cognitive dissonance, or the idea
that two opposed ideas can both be held and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.890
understood in the same head and.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.040
IT'S HARD.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.329
There's a reason we end a lot of our stories
with the words, "More research is needed,"

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.530
because a single study is almost NEVER enough
to ascertain actual science.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.420
What the media covers on the other handâ€¦
that is completely different.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.329
One notable example of this is butter and
cholesterol.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.270
As a kid, I remember being taught that cholesterol
is bad.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.649
It's all bad.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.119
In the 60s, the American Heart Association
warned cholesterol could be bad for the heart.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.350
Then, a 1977 study by the Senate Select Committee
on Nutrition and Human Needs resulted in the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.289
creation of the "Dietary Goals for the United
States," and cholesterol was branded as a

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.289
baddie.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.779
From there, the government, various associations,
and media spread the word: cholesterol was

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:44.240
bad, vitamins were good!

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.719
The fourth estate loves sensation and conflict,
so people started to avoid butter, eggs, steaks,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.049
bacon and other foods high in cholesterol.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.670
The thing is, the science wasn't settled,
it was just popular There's more nuance to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.219
this story, and the scientific community protested
the decision.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.950
The American Egg Board made a campaign so
people would keep eating eggs, and over the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.640
next 50 years, the science slowly pushed people
back from the edge.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.370
Researchers told people again and again over
the years that fat doesn't cause health problems

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.390
on its own.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
High Density Lipoproteins were discovered
in the late 1920s, and Low Density Lipoproteins

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.470
in the late 70s, but cholesterol itself is
created in your liver and helps cells form

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.850
protective membranes.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
PLUS, it's a building block for vitamin D!

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.450
As dietary science progressed, it's been shown
that a low-carbohydrate diet is better than

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.810
a low-fat diet, but the public's mindset had
been set.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.420
Nevermind that an epidemic of heart disease
which, in part, prompted this scramble for

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.920
answers, was hitting the country, or that
the lead researcher only studied populations

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.160
in the U.S., Japan, and Europe who were selected
because they would confirm the results the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160
researcher wanted.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.930
The thing is, if you lived through this period,
you'd assume science kept flip-flopping!

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.030
But that's not the case, instead, the peer-reviewed
science was consistent and the media and public

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.380
were simply sending mixed messages to each
other.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
Now, new science has finally resulted in the
cholesterol guidelines being removed from

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.730
the 2015 government guidelines.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.910
It took a while, because science takes a while!

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.940
Longitudinal nutrition studies can take decades
to complete, and have to be giant populations

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.290
who are heavily scrutinized!

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.470
This is opposed to cross-sectional studies,
which are a snapshot of a sample, still helpful,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.470
but very different.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.290
It takes time to do good science, but we gotta
do it.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.500
With this in mind, I would like to say, we
at DNews report what is happening in science

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.510
as best as we can, but let's be honest, we
might make a video next year which says the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.551
exact opposite thing of a video this year!

00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:51.560
Hopefully, we spot that and point out the
change, because science isn't set, more research

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.959
is always needed.
