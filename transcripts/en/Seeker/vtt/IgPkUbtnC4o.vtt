00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.590
For anyone who isn’t a chemist, you’ve
probably always ignored that weird chunk of

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.200
the periodic table that floats below the main
elements that we have to memorize in school.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.240
This chunk, right here.*point to bottom of
screen* And that’s probably because we don’t

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.610
know a lot about these elements.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.610
These are the lanthanoids and actinoids, and
new research is only just starting to shed

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.140
light on how bizarre these heavy elements
really are, and how little we know about chemistry.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.490
All the elements in the periodic table are
organized by increasing atomic number, a number

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.180
that usually corresponds to atomic mass.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.649
Beyond mass, elements are also grouped by
kind and similar properties.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
Lanthanoids and actinoids are two distinct
groups that are often taken together because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.190
they’re both part of the inner transition
series that sits within transition metals.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.949
The elements in these two groups are also
structured differently than other elements

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.280
at the atomic level.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.829
Looking specifically at actinoids, they’re
typically soft, silvery metals with that are

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069
both dense and malleable.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.300
You could cut some of them with a knife!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Thorium is like soft steel; when it’s heated
you can roll it into a sheet or pull it into

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.460
a wire.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.320
Actinoids are also lightly paramagnetic, pyrophoric
which means they spontaneously ignite with

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.970
exposure to air, and, with the exception of
actinium, have multiple crystalline phases.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.050
But, their most notable defining characteristic
is that they’re all radioactive.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.250
And it gets stranger.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.950
Only four known actinoids occur naturally
on Earth.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.030
The others are created in a lab.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.720
But no matter where they come from, actinoids
are the heaviest and least understood elements

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720
we know.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.030
Among these synthetic elements is berkelium,
and it’s defying quantum mechanics.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.790
Berkelium was discovered by scientists at,
you guessed it, Berkeley, in 1949.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.030
It’s an actinoid so we know it’s radioactive,
but that’s almost everything we know about

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.030
it.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.670
The element is so difficult and expensive
to make that there’s almost none in existence

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.910
— there’s less than a gram in the world
and there's only one isotope chemists can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.000
work with, 249Bk, and it decays quickly - just
a half-life of 320 days.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
But that’s still SOME!

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.210
And Department of Energy recently gave scientists
13 milligrams to work with.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.709
Unlike the lighter elements at the top of
the periodic table, quantum mechanics can’t

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.569
explain what’s going on with the electrons
at the heart of this element.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.810
But scientists think it might have something
to do with Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.930
The electrons in berklium seem to follow his
prediction that says as objects move faster,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.859
they get heavier
The electrons move around the element’s

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.180
charged nucleus at a significant fraction
of the speed of light, and this is what’s

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.330
making the element heavy and behave in ways
that can’t be explained by quantum theory.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.129
Which is leading researchers to wonder how
they can either make the reaction stronger

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.170
or shut it down altogether.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.980
Until now, berkelium has mainly been used
to make new elements like tennessine, so this

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.221
is one of the first dedicated experiments
scientists have done to learn about the element

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:51.221
itself.

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.980
And really, it’s teaching us that the element
is hard to understand.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.459
Berkelium is making theories about chemistry
bend and break, but it’s all in the name

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.249
of understanding the full table of our elements
and the chemistry that comes with them.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.779
Photo galleries, blogs, e-commerce -- those
are elements too!

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:19.560
But instead of for nature, they’re for your
own website!

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:34.201
Want to 
know more about crazy states of matter, we

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:38.500
dug so deep into it my brain hurt on SeekerPlus
-- check it!

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.359
One last thing, our Periodic Table was created
by Dmitri Mendeleev, he wrote the elements

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.950
on cards and practiced rearranging them until
it hit him to put them in order of relative

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.510
atomic mass, that was in 1869 -- when there
were only 63 known.
