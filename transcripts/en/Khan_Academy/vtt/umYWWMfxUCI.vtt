00:00:00.622 --> 00:00:02.891
- [Instructor] The distribution
of average wait times

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.367
in drive-through restaurant
lines in one town

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:10.016
was approximately normal
with mean of 185 seconds

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:13.327
and standard deviation of 11 seconds.

00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:16.135
Amelia only likes to use the drive-through

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.226
for restaurants where
the average wait time

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:22.303
is in the bottom 10% for that town.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:25.064
What is the maximum average wait time

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:27.101
for restaurants where Amelia likes

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.343
to use the drive-through?

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:31.753
Round to the nearest whole second.

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:34.309
Like always, if you feel
like you can tackle this,

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.789
pause this video and try to do so.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:38.985
I'm assuming you've paused it.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.247
Now let's work through this together.

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:41.816
So let's think about what's going on.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.697
They're telling us that the distribution

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:47.295
of average wait times
is approximately normal,

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:51.107
so let's get a visualization
of a normal distribution.

00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:52.507
And they tell us several things

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:54.000
about this normal distribution.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.319
They tell us that the mean is 185 seconds,

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.616
so that's 185 there,

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.216
the standard deviation is 11 seconds.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:06.383
So, for example, this is gonna
be 11 more than the mean,

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:10.562
so this would be 196 seconds,

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:12.862
this would be another 11.

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:16.131
Each of these dotted lines are
one standard deviation more.

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.881
So this would be 207.

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:22.884
This would be 11 seconds
less than the mean,

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:26.634
so this would be 174,
and so on and so forth.

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.107
And we want to find the
maximum average wait time

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:32.974
for restaurants where Amelia likes

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:34.186
to use the drive-through.

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:35.646
Well, what are those restaurants?

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:37.232
That's where the average wait time is

00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:40.504
in the bottom 10% for that town.

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.043
So how do we think about it?

00:01:42.043 --> 00:01:44.189
Well, there's going to be some value,

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.090
let me mark it off right
over here in this red color,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.474
so we're going to have
some threshold value

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:54.641
right over here where this is
anything that level or lower

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.353
is going to be in the bottom 10%.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.880
Or another way to think about it is,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.924
this is the largest wait time

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:07.417
for which you are still in the bottom 10%.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:10.287
And so this area right over here

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:12.841
is going to be 10% of the total,

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.924
or it's going to be 0.10.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.392
So the way we can tackle this is

00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:20.521
we can get up a z-table and figure out

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.438
what z-score gives us a
proportion of only 0.10

00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:29.164
being less than that z-score,

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:30.978
and then using that z-score,

00:02:30.978 --> 00:02:33.348
we can figure out this value,

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:35.137
the actual wait time.

00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:36.975
So let's get our z-table out,

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:40.330
and since we know that
this is below the mean,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.159
the mean would be the 50th percentile,

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.661
we know we're gonna
have a negative z-score.

00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:46.378
So I'm gonna take out
the part of the table

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:50.286
that has the negative z-scores on it.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:53.823
And remember, we're looking for 10%,

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:56.251
but we don't want to go beyond 10%.

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.286
We want to be sure that that value is

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:00.009
within the 10th percentile,

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.550
that any higher will be
out of the 10th percentile.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.441
So let's see, when we have
theses really negative z's,

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:08.759
so far it only gets, it
only doesn't even get

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.226
to the first percentile yet.

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:13.376
So let's scroll down a little bit

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.552
and let's remember as
we do so that this is

00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:19.241
zero in the hundreds place,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:23.408
six, seven, eight, nine, so
let's remember those columns.

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:30.665
So let's see, if we are at
a z-score of negative 1.28,

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:32.224
remember this is the hundreds

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.949
is zero, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.116
so this right over here is
a z-score of negative 1.28

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:46.105
and that's a little bit
crossing the 10th percentile.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.828
But if we get a little bit
more negative than that,

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.720
we are in the 10th percentile.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.887
So this is negative 1.29,
and this does seem to be

00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.463
the highest z-score for which we are

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:03.713
within the 10th percentile.

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:07.503
So negative 1.29 is our z-score.

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:13.731
So this is z equals negative 1.29,

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:19.279
and if we want to figure out
the actual value for that,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.246
we would start with
the mean, which is 185,

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:24.858
and then we would say,

00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:27.588
"Well, we want to go
1.29 standard deviations

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:29.152
"below the mean."

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:31.338
The negative says we're
going below the mean.

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:35.505
So we could say minus 1.29
times the standard deviation

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:40.309
and they tell us up here

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.517
the standard deviation is 11 seconds.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:46.350
So it's going to be 1.29 times 11.

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:50.460
And this is going to be equal to

00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:54.402
1.29 times 11 is equal to 14.19.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.660
And then I'll make that negative,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.378
and then add that to 185.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:04.711
Plus 185 is equal to 170.81.

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:10.331
170.81.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.245
Now they say round to
the nearest whole second.

00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:17.980
There's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.770
If you really want to ensure
that you're not gonna cross

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.352
that 10th percentile,

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:25.794
you might want to round to the
nearest second that is below

00:05:25.794 --> 00:05:27.152
this threshold.

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:31.889
So you might say that this
is approximately 170 seconds.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.635
If you were to just round
normally this would go to 171,

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.368
but just by doing that,

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:38.757
you might have crossed the threshold.

00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:40.996
But in all likelihood for this application

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:43.001
where someone is concerned about wait time

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.456
at drive-through restaurants,

00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:47.392
that difference in a
second between 170 and 171

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:50.931
is not going to be mission
critical, so to speak.

00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:55.149
But you could safely say
that 170 or 171 seconds

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.232
will meet Amelia's needs.
