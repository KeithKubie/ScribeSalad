00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:06.950
NARRATOR: Portraits
have been used

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.130
as a symbol of power or
wealth as a historical record.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.800
But they can also
do more than that.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.910
This portrait shows
a weathered man

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.080
staring into the camera,
surrounded by what I can only

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.695
describe as junk.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.140
It's a captivating
and deliberate shot

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.920
taken by a concerned
photographer

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.430
who believes art can
help change the world.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.510
AARON DRAPER: Hi, my
name is Aaron Draper,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000
and I'm a professional
photographer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.915
And I'm a professor
of photography

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.810
at Chico State University.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.620
NARRATOR: Aaron took this
photo in the summer of 2014

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.170
as part of his master's
thesis, a photography

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.765
project he calls "Underexposed".

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:51.390
AARON DRAPER: What I know about
this man is that he's homeless.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.510
He's a former veteran.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.180
He's been on the streets for
about four or five years.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.860
The objects surrounding
this man are

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.390
some of the things that he's
collected from dumpsters,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.907
things that he's traded for
and got from friends of his,

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:03.490
and things that
people have given him.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.948
And he's selling
them on the corner

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:07.602
to people who were passing by.

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.060
NARRATOR: Aaron
chose to photograph

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.740
the homeless community because
he felt a special connection

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.042
to them, a connection he
wanted to share with others.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:17.500
AARON DRAPER: I guess it started
with a love of literature,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.500
and John Steinbeck really got
me involved with this project.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.940
I really enjoy his writing,
"The Grapes of Wrath",

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.860
"Of Mice and Men".

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.410
And he always sort of took
a stance for the poor.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.030
I grew up relatively poor.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420
Because of that, I've always
wondered about homelessness,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.330
and who they are,
and how they survive.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.680
I see a people that
are resourceful,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280
and that have
found a way to live

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.525
in the world where nobody
else would want to live,

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.450
and in a way that nobody
else would want to live.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.340
I admire their
stories that I believe

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800
that they wear on their faces.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.550
The homeless walk
around with the lines

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.590
on their faces of everything
they've ever done.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.790
And I believe that sometimes
their hard lives really

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.750
show in their faces, which, to
me, create beautiful portraits

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.390
of texture and shape and color.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.830
I also always felt that
photographers have a duty

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.340
to use their art
to change policy,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.300
to change people's ideas, and
to make people feel and think

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.294
differently.

00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:13.960
NARRATOR: Aaron is
doing more than that.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.210
Not only does he pay
them for their time.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.790
He also tries to track them
down later to give them

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.347
a copy of their photo.

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:22.430
AARON DRAPER: I've been
able to find most of them,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.888
and head back and find them
after I've printed their image.

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:27.020
And some of them I'm
still looking for.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.730
I would hope to think
they get a glimpse of how

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.490
beautiful and amazing they
can look when lit correctly,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.400
when somebody takes
the time to produce

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.650
a beautiful portrait of them.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.390
NARRATOR: Check out
this story on why

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.010
America used these famous
photos as propaganda.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.410
NARRATOR 2: They understood
the power of photography,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.410
that the struggle
in these images

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.190
might create a new awareness.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.074
Or as one FSA leader said,
introduce Americans to America.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:59.365
