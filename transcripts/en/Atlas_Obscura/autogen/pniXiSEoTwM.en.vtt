00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.954
- When you find opal,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.043
it's an adrenaline rush
and it can be addictive.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.390
I'm Desrey Jones.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm born and bred in Coober Pedy,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.190
the opal-mining capital of the world.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.140
I am one of the very few females involved

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.000
in the mining industry here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.870
My mom and my dad both have
been in the mining industry

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.770
ever since I was young,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.687
so I've been around it
basically my whole life.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.890
Opal was formed millions of years ago.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.650
125 million years ago,
this was all an inland sea.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.700
Soluble silica gets
into cracks, solidifies,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.423
and it creates opals.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.890
Coober Pedy is really remote.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.540
We're in the middle of Australia,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.660
so the closest town is Port Augusta,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
which is about 500 kilometers south.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.480
The opal was discovered here in 1915

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.840
by a young boy, Willie Hutchison.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.400
From there we had settlers coming in,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.763
and mainly men coming here,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.493
trying to, you know,
strike it rich with opal.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.770
Aboriginal people were
transient through here.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.890
When the white man came here,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.600
they saw them burrowing into
the side of sandstone hills

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.920
and that's where we got the name,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.587
"white man in a hole."

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.220
So I was one of the last
female babies to be born

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.220
in Coober Pedy in 1980.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.880
With the majority of opal miners
and workers here being men,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.450
it can be a little bit tough

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.370
being a female in this industry.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.680
There's not a lot of ladies out here,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.847
so the ones that are here,
we all know each other.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.700
It's not just exclusively for men,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.710
women can do it,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.480
as long as you don't mind
working in some tough conditions.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.690
You are your own boss
at the end of the day

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.720
and you can go out when you
like, come back when you want.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
It's a little bit of hard work,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.060
but I think that might be
a little bit of a reason

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.430
why so many people would be leaving.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.040
So we've got half of our
population that we used to have.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.360
I think that might be
because of the gender,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.583
there's a lack of
females here, definitely.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.920
We live in underground homes,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.000
which we call dugouts.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.510
So we dig into the side of sandstone hills

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.490
with the same machines
we use to dig for opals.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.370
About 70 percent of our
population lives underground

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.360
'cause of the temperatures.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.520
So it can reach from the
40s to the 50 degree mark.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.917
Underground it stays between 21

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.433
and 24 degrees all year round.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.010
Everyone's involved in the
mining industry somehow,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.160
whether they're mining
the opal, buying the opal,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.770
or selling the opal.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.243
We're all kind of involved
in it in some way.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.010
You do tend to get a little
bit lonely here in Coober Pedy.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.770
You see the same faces every day.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.440
There's not a lot of
chance to meet new people

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.840
which is something I do miss,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.850
but at the end of the day,
Coober Pedy is where I grew up.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.760
It's where my family is, it is my home.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.649
So I'll always love it for that.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.170
We sell opal in the rough per ounce.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.390
Depending on the quality
if, it's really, you know,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.480
great quality, you can get,
you know, 300 an ounce.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.860
But then you will sell it for that.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.500
And then you might get, after
it's been cut and polished,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.390
you know, a couple thousand per karat.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.980
You know, beauty is in the eye
of the beholder, I suppose.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.503
If you like something,
you're gonna pay for it.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.120
So when you see it in
the wall, you sell it.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.530
You might be able to retire
on the money, like my dad,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.203
but he's 72 and he's
out there mining still.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.150
Mining is like gambling.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.090
You could go out tomorrow
and find a million dollars.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.083
You could be out there for
two years, and find nothing.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.280
So I hope to strike it rich
and find that, you know,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.270
those million-dollar finds, but yeah,

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.520
I hope to find it while I
am young and not too old.
