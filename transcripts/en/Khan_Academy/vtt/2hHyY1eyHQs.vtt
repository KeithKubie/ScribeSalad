00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:01.720
- [Instructor] We have other videos

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.023
on individual techniques
for factoring quadratics,

00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:06.379
but what I would like to do in this video

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.960
is get some practice figuring out

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.793
which technique to use, so I'm gonna write

00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:13.602
a bunch of quadratics, and I encourage you

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.280
to pause the video, try to see if you can

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.066
factor that quadratic yourself before

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.136
I work through it with you.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:22.886
So the first quadratic
is 6x squared plus 3x.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.818
So pause and see if you can factor this.

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:29.200
So this one might jump out at you

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.626
that both of these terms
here have a common factor.

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:34.934
Both of them are divisible by three,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.026
six is divisible by three and so is three,

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:39.260
and both of them are divisible by x,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.702
so you can factor out a 3x.

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:43.914
So if you factor out a 3x, 6x squared

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:47.594
divided by 3x, you're gonna
have a 2x left over there

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:51.524
and then 3x divided by 3x,
you're going to have a one.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:52.982
And that's about as much as we can

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:54.589
actually factor, and you can verify

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.314
that these two expressions are the same

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.857
if you distribute the 3x,
3x times 2x is 6x squared,

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:05.371
3x times one is 3x, and
that's all we would do.

00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.373
We would be done.

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:09.036
That's all you can
really do to factor that.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:11.311
And as we'll see, in this example,

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.797
trying to factor out a common factor

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:16.527
was all we had to do, but as we'll see

00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:19.885
in future examples, that's
usually a good first step.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.026
Do all of, check whether the terms

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:23.956
have a common factor, and if they do

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:27.093
it never hurts to factor that out.

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:29.429
So let's do another example.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.596
Let's say I have the quadratic
4x squared minus 4x minus 48.

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:41.356
Pause the video and try to
factor that as much as you can.

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:42.969
Alright, so the first thing
you might have noticed

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.554
is that there is a common
factor amongst the terms.

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:47.667
All of them are divisible by four.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.250
Four is clearly divisible by four

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.485
and 48 is also divisible by four.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.064
So let's factor a four out.

00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:54.188
This would be the same thing as four

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:57.438
times x squared minus x minus 12.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.959
I just divided each of these
by four and I factored it out.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.596
You can distribute the four and verify

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.854
that these two expressions are the same.

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.497
Now are we done?

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:10.398
Well no, we can factor what we have

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:14.212
inside the parentheses, we
can factor this further.

00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:16.728
Now how would we do that?

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:18.550
So over here the key realization

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.793
is alright, I have a one as a coefficient

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:22.778
on my second degree term.

00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:23.998
I've written it in standard form

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:25.284
where I have the second degree and then

00:02:25.284 --> 00:02:26.516
if there's a first degree term,

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:27.706
and then I have my constant term

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:29.719
or my zero degree term, and if I have

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.055
a one coefficient right over here

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:34.496
then I say, okay, are there two numbers

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:37.376
whose sum equals the coefficient

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:39.503
on the first degree term, on the x term,

00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:43.206
so are there two numbers
that add up to negative one?

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.082
You didn't see a one here
before but it's implicit there.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.067
Negative x is the same
thing as negative 1x.

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.008
So are there two numbers, a plus b,

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.568
that is equal to negative one and whose

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:56.235
product is equal to negative 12?

00:02:57.904 --> 00:03:00.221
This is a technique that
we do in other videos,

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.582
and here the key is to realize that hey,

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:03.605
maybe we can use it here.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:06.772
So a times be is equal to negative 12.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.641
And there's a couple of
key realizations here.

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:11.932
It's like, okay, if I have two numbers

00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:13.951
and their product is
going to be a negative

00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.334
that means one of them, that means

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:16.429
they're gonna have different signs.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.341
One's going to be positive and
one's going to be negative.

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.494
If they had the same sign
then this would be positive.

00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:22.663
So let's think about the factors of 12,

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:24.421
and especially think about them

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.817
in terms of different sign combinations.

00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:29.817
So you could think about one and 12,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:32.478
and whether you're
thinking about negative one

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:37.008
and 12, negative one plus
12 would be positive 11.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.418
If you went the other way around,

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.715
if you went negative 12 and
one it would be negative 11,

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:43.590
but either way that doesn't work.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.815
Two and six, negative two and six

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:48.183
would be four, negative six and two

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:50.564
would be negative four,
so that doesn't work.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.814
Three and four.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.266
Let's see, negative three and four

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:57.071
would be positive one, but three

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.592
and negative four works out.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:03:59.880
You add these two together, you take

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.943
their product, you clearly get negative 12

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:05.250
and then you add them
together, you get negative one.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.324
So we can write inside the parentheses,

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:09.589
so let me write, so this is gonna be

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.756
four times, so we can factor
that as two binomials.

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.579
The first is going to be x plus,

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.772
the first is going to be x plus three

00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:23.872
and then the next is going to be,

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:25.467
we could say x plus negative four

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:28.854
or we could say x minus
four, and we're done.

00:04:28.854 --> 00:04:30.854
And if any of this seems
intimidating to you

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.645
I encourage you to watch the videos

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:34.986
on introduction to factoring polynomials.

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:37.748
The key here is to recognize the method.

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:39.735
So once again, at first try to

00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:41.209
factor out any common factors.

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:43.335
We did that in both examples.

00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:44.478
And then we saw here, hey if we have

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:46.101
a leading one coefficient here

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:47.366
on the second degree term and we have

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:49.607
it written in standard form, well let's

00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.015
think of two numbers that add up

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:53.067
to this coefficient and whose product

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:55.586
is equal to the constant
term, and in this case

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.023
it was three and negative four,

00:04:57.023 --> 00:04:58.357
we were able to factor it this way.

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:00.909
We prove that in other videos.

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.205
Let's do another example.

00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:04.749
We can't get enough
practice, and like always,

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.451
pause the video and see if you
can work through it yourself.

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.534
Three x squared, plus 30, plus 75.

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.562
Alright, I'm assuming you had a go at it.

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:16.765
So you might immediately see that

00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:18.662
all of the terms are divisible by three,

00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:20.311
so let's factor three
out, so it's gonna be

00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:23.315
three times x squared plus, oh whoops,

00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:25.170
this should be an x here, my apologies.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.436
Pause the video again and
see if you can do it (laughs)

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.317
now that I wrote the
actual right thing there.

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:33.250
So as you imagine it's nice to factor out

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.515
a three first, so it's
three times x squared,

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:39.432
plus 10x, plus 25, and so you might

00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:42.168
immediately say alright, let's use

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.332
the technique we had here.

00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:45.240
We have a leading one coefficient,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.986
it's written in standard form.

00:05:46.986 --> 00:05:50.270
Can I think of two numbers
that add up to ten,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.468
so a plus b is equal to
10, and whose product,

00:05:53.468 --> 00:05:55.635
a times b, is equal to 25?

00:05:56.504 --> 00:05:58.259
And this would work.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.244
And if you look at the factors of 25

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:02.972
you'd say, alright, well this thing here

00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:04.484
is positive, this is positive,

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:05.948
so I'm dealing with two positive numbers

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.625
and to get 25 it's either a one and 25

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:11.588
or five and five, and
five and five match this.

00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:14.284
Five plus five is equal to 10.

00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:17.323
Five times five is equal to 25.

00:06:17.323 --> 00:06:18.767
And so just using the exact technique

00:06:18.767 --> 00:06:20.779
we just did, you'd say
okay this is three times

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.154
and the stuff in parentheses would be

00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:24.904
x plus five times x plus five,

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:31.254
or you could say three
times x plus five squared.

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:32.630
So some of you might
have immediately said,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.972
well I don't have to do
that exact technique.

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:36.588
I could have immediately recognized this

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:39.410
as a perfect square
because I have a square

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.784
constant right over here, and that's

00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:43.343
a good sign that hey,
maybe I should explore

00:06:43.343 --> 00:06:46.662
whether this is going to be
a perfect square polynomial.

00:06:46.662 --> 00:06:49.318
So this is a perfect square, and if I were

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:51.597
to take the square root of
it, and this coefficient

00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:54.423
is twice that square root, well that's

00:06:54.423 --> 00:06:56.174
a good sign that I'm probably dealing,

00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:58.979
or that I am dealing
with a perfect square.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.502
But either way, whether you recognize it

00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:03.700
as a perfect square or
whether you use the technique

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.327
that we used in the second problem,

00:07:05.327 --> 00:07:09.494
either one of those would get
you to the appropriate answer.
