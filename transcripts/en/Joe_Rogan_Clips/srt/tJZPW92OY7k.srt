1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,740
Yeah. Uh, [inaudible] Belfort's now go
into one fc and uh, looked good again,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,090
looking sexy corn all filled out.
Did you see Eddie Alvarez is I, yeah,

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:13,250
he got fucked up. Yeah. That
dude he fought Timofey um,

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,970
now stoking Nastia Liukin I think is
his last name. But the guy's a beast.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,790
That one FC show was legit.
Yeah. Have you watched it?

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,580
I've watched just highlights.
I uh, I don't have time.

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,370
I don't tell him to watch all
the UFC fights this time. Um,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,070
so it's hard to kind of,
to watch the other cards as well,

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,640
but once in a while watching Beltour
I'll watch one FC. Damn. Look at that. I,

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,420
oh my God. His eyes fucked up. Oh my God.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,510
That's terrible. That's
a terrible injury. Yeah.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,250
That looks like it's split his eye
lid. It did. Oh my God. Jesus Christ.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,660
It's split his fucking eyelid,
dude. Oh my God. People,

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,440
people don't realize like
that side of it, like, I mean,

15
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,760
that's fucking touch your face. I mean,
you had a little bit of an MMA fight.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,600
You know what it's like, not
really. You did, it was a fight.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,480
Is a fight against another comedian
comedian up. Very impressive. But Hey,

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,390
it was, he had taekwondo black
belt from when he was 14 years old.

19
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,910
Take that back to taekwondo black belt.
No,

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,340
I seen people forget how to do shit,
man, if you'll all bullshit aside.

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,180
But they also gave out a lot of taekwondo
black belts that are 100% portraits.

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,040
It's part of the business.
Even if they're not,

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,240
if you're not giving your belts out,

24
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,770
how are you not going to
get people to come back.
