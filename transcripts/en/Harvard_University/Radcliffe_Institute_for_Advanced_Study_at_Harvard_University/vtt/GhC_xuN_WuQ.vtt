00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.968
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.940
- Okay, welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.166
My name is John Huth and
I'm professor in the physics

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.290
department here at Harvard.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.230
But I'm also a member of
the venture's faculty.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.720
And it is a distinct delight
to be able to work and help

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.250
the programming at Radcliffe.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.030
And I get to bring science
lectures and a science

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.549
symposium every
year to Radcliffe.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.830
And it's wonderful to talk to
and put together the program

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.760
because I'm able to target areas
that I'm interested in and get

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.910
experts and talk to the experts
at just the right level so I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.630
can learn something new .

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.670
And today is a perfect
example of that.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.960
So it's a pleasure to
introduce Kerry Emanuel.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.120
He's going to talk about
hurricanes and the titles

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
predicting and adapting
to hurricane risk.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
I've been fascinated
with the issues of what's

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.040
happening to our planet in
particular, as the science

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.439
topics may reflect, the role
of the ocean and climate

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.730
and what it may be doing to us.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.500
So to just confess to a
certain scientific geekiness,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.870
about once a week, I check
out the National Oceanic

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.600
and Atmospheric
Administration's website

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
for the chart of the sea
surface temperature anomaly

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.230
and sometimes even paste it
up to Facebook once a week.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.780
Some of my Facebook
friends know.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.430
So that gives you
an idea of where

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000
I am on the nerdy
spectrum, but that's me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.740
So I'm hoping to hear a
little bit more of this.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.720
So Dr. Emanuel is the Cecil
and Ida Green Professor

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.160
of Atmospheric Sciences
at MIT, but is also

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.310
the co-director of the Edward
Lorenz institute at MIT.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.350
And I could give you a
lot of his background

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.250
but then you'd have to listen
to all the honorific titles

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.540
associated with him.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.539
But I will note,
among other things,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.690
that he has written a
biography of Edward Lorenz.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.570
And Lorenz, for those
of you who may not know,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.950
is credited as being the
founder of chaos theory

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.220
and also there is this
famous quote from him,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.910
does a butterfly's wings
flapping in the Brazilian rain

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.560
forest create a
tornado in Texas,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.910
which has sparked-- I
use this in my lectures

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.560
and in fact I'm lecturing
on weather today.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.330
So without any further
ado, Kerry Emanuel.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.830
- Well thank you
very much, John.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.070
It's a great pleasure to
be with you here today

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.350
to talk about one of
my favorite subjects.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.110
I go around the country
talking about climate a lot,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.300
but I really like
talking about hurricanes.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.870
So what I want to
do today is to put

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.790
a little bit of a
twist on this topic

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.730
by not talking about
the storms themselves

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.190
that much, as much
as I'd like to,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.700
but talk about how we go about
assessing risk from them.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
So I want to answer
questions like,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
what's the probability that
my campus, MIT, will someday

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.000
be under water in a flood?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.970
And is that probability
evolving over time

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.590
because of climate change?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.710
How do we go about
answering those questions?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.320
And so that's what I sort of
like to do with you today.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380
So I'm going to
start off talking

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.360
a little bit about
hurricanes themselves

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.700
and the various risks that are
associated with these storms.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.830
Then the real issue for me is
how do you quantify the risk.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.860
How do you actually
put a number on it?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.070
I mean, how many years
typically go by before we

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.010
get hit here in New
England, for example?

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.990
And then to talk finally
about how we expect climate

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.210
change to begin to
affect these storms.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.960
Just so you know what
we're talking about,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.480
this is a classic
satellite image

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.250
of a hurricane that's been
doctored by the people at NASA

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.810
to give it a kind of three
dimensional perspective.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.250
So when you look
down from space,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.959
you see a swirling mass of
clouds a few miles across.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.010
And the heaviest wind,
the strongest rain

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.130
is in our annulus
that closes off

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.999
in a clear area we
know as the eye.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.540
When you look down
from space, you're

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.670
looking at the top of
the storm about 12,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.710
13 miles above
the ocean surface.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.380
And you may not know this,
but the temperatures up there

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.890
are well below minus
100 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.570
It's a remarkable
thing, if you look

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.310
through the whole
atmosphere, some

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.290
of the coldest air
you can find is

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.030
in the tropical
upper atmosphere,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.670
colder even than Antarctica.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.550
And one of the things-- one
of the reasons that hurricanes

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.640
are so deadly and intense
has to do with the fact

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.920
that the atmosphere is
so cold near their top.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.820
It actually makes them into
very efficient heat engines.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.690
Now if we zoom in,
this is a photograph

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.250
taken from the Space Station
of the eye of hurricane Igor.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.380
And once again, you
see this annulus.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.940
We call it the eye wall for
reasons that I'll show you.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.480
But you can see if you
go down into the eye

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.030
here that it is almost
like a circular wall.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.120
We fly airplanes into these
storms fairly routinely

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.940
and have since the mid-1940s.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.300
But once again, the strongest
winds, heaviest rains

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.160
are under this annulus.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.260
In the Northern
hemisphere, the airflow

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.210
is counter-clockwise
near the surface,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.120
but as you get to
the top of the storm

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.340
and the air begins to move out,
it actually reverses rotation

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.020
and goes the other way.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.470
And the rotation at all levels
is reversed [? in sine ?]

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.200
in the Southern hemisphere.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.960
This is just a little
climatology of these storms,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.540
showing tracks of
tropical cyclones.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.790
Tropical cyclone, by the
way, is the generic word

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.400
for this kind of event.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.950
And hurricane is a
strictly regional name

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.040
that has very
interesting etymology

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.630
if anybody wants to talk
about it afterwards,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.570
I can tell you
something about that.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.450
But here is the sort of a
global pattern of these storms.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.450
And most of us are familiar
with the Atlantic storms

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.720
here, that typically
form off Africa

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.310
all the way westward
over the Caribbean

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.480
and the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.260
And they curve up.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.600
The colors are an indication
of their wind speeds.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.654
But only about 12% of the
world's tropical cyclones

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:36.570
occur in the Atlantic.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.570
The rest occur in the
Pacific and Indian oceans.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.180
And they don't get
quite as much coverage

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.890
in the news as the
Atlantic storms.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.970
But the most active region
is in the Western Pacific.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.340
They just had a horrible
typhoon, category typhoon,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.570
go into the Northern Philippines
last week, for example.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.360
And there are no tropical
cyclones within a few degrees

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.220
latitude of the
equator, because you

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.950
need to be able to take
the Earth's rotation axis

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.840
and project it onto
what you locally call up

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.610
and get an answer
that's not zero.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.180
Well right on the
equator, it's zero.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.270
So you can't have
any hurricanes there.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.670
So if you fantasize,
as I sometimes

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.520
do when I'm sitting in my
office about some day sailing

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.726
around the world
in a nice sailboat,

00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:21.350
and you're afraid of
tropical cyclones,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.300
you just stick to the
equator and you'll be fine.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.660
You may have other problems,
but not that problem.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.100
OK, so when we
think about risks,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.409
we like to think about three
major kinds of risks that

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:35.700
are associated with hurricanes.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.850
What everybody
thinks of is wind.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.900
The wind blows, the wind
[INAUDIBLE] very hard,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.770
and structures
aren't necessarily

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.020
designed to cope with
winds in this country

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.900
much over 100 miles an
hour, and they fail.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.450
And that is a big
source of damage.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.950
But it is surprisingly not, by
any means, the most lethal form

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.270
of damage, particularly
in the developing world.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.870
Actually the second
deadliest aspect

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.590
of hurricanes, which
I'm constantly--

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.410
and my colleagues are constantly
trying to drum into the public

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.370
is this boring thing
called rain, right?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.350
The Weather Channel
doesn't usually

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.950
send their weather forecasters
out to stand in a rainstorm,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.420
because it's boring and they
want the drama of the wind.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.220
But this is what kills.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.230
All right?

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.370
And we have unfortunately
lots and lots

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.860
of bad examples of that,
even recently in US history.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.780
But if you go back to
1998, Hurricane Mitch,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.240
which went into Central America,
killed about 12,000 people.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.150
12,000, OK?

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.090
It was all from freshwater
flooding caused by rain.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.200
One death occurred because
of wind in that event.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.150
But historically the most
lethal is the storm surge.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.540
This is what got people in New
Orleans in Katrina and New York

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.200
in Sandy, but tragically in
other parts of the world,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.090
like the Philippines a few
years ago, when Haiyan went in.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.360
The storm surge is
what people find

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.370
most difficult to envision.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.440
And so to try to get you to
understand what it looks like,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.000
I'm going to play you
a short film clip.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.240
And what you're going
to see is a storm surge

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.830
associated with
Haiyan, photographed

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.220
by an amateur who happened
to have a video camera.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.550
And hydrodynamically, it is
the same thing as a tsunami.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.040
It's just that it hasn't
been caused by shaking earth

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.050
but by blowing wind.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.900
But when it happens,
it's the same thing,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.994
except it occurs in the
middle of a typhoon.

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:36.264

00:09:36.264 --> 00:09:37.250
So this is a storm.

00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:47.190
Now I think you can imagine that
that's impossible to survive,

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.550
if you're caught in it.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.117
That's what kills
the most people.

00:09:51.117 --> 00:09:51.700
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.780
And yet we're
forever trying to get

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.350
people to take that seriously.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.200
And I think it's partially
because they can't envision it

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.880
that they don't take
warnings of this phenomenon

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.470
all that seriously.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.320
So if you can imagine a tsunami
in the middle of a typhoon,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.580
that's what a storm surge is.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.810
So we want to try to quantify,
to actually put numbers

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.260
on the risk of storm surges in
different parts of the world.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.760
Now if you just look at
the damage from hurricanes.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.250
Globally, on average, it's
about 10,000 people a year.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.740
Of course these are concentrated
in a handful of events

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.480
every few years.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.580
And $700 billion in 2015
US dollars annually, OK?

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.230
So that's a lot of money.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.940
And globally, this
is the partitioning

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.200
of insured losses for a
particular year, 2006,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.970
by natural phenomena
of the floods,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:52.360
79 percent windstorms, of which
most of that is hurricanes

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.410
and other phenomena.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.890
Now this can be
a bit misleading,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.210
on the other hand, because
private insurance in most

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.060
countries doesn't
cover earthquakes

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.630
and often doesn't cover floods.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.070
But it usually does
cover hurricanes.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.460
And so for that reason,
the big insurance companies

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.670
and the reinsurance industry
is pretty much paranoid

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.500
about hurricanes.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.760
And they're always after
me and my colleagues

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.180
to tell them more about them.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.860
We have a big problem
with hurricanes

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.830
in the United States, a really
big problem historically.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.710
And that's indicated
in this graph, which

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:32.880
shows the damage
in 2004 US dollars,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.660
corrected for inflation,
but not otherwise corrected,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.750
by decade, from the first
decade of the 20th century

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.930
to the first decade
of the 21st century.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.970
And you can see this really,
really big increase in damage.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.880
This is sort of going
up geometrically.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.150
And there's no particular
mystery, on the other hand,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.410
about why that's happening.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.400
And it's not because hurricanes
are changing, or at least

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.510
not changing enough
to cause that.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.960
It's just because
coastal populations

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.450
are going up much faster than
the population as a whole.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.140
OK?

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.880
This is the population of
Florida from 1790 to 2004.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.090
And you can see
this huge increase

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.620
that really began to
accelerate in the 1950s,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.640
thanks to the invention
of the air conditioner,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.200
which made Florida
habitable by mere mortals.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.540
But that's the big problem.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:35.680
And policies that are in place
in the United States actively

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.300
subsidize people to move to
and build in dangerous places.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.350
And that's going to cause a
string of Sandys and Katrinas

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.687
as far as the eye can
see, having nothing

00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:47.770
to do with climate change.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.442
Climate change just
makes it worse.

00:12:49.442 --> 00:12:53.050
In the United States we have a
huge hurricane policy problem.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.310
Now my colleague, Roger Pielke,
at the University of Colorado,

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.530
tried to correct the
damages to account

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.390
for changing population and
infrastructure, in addition

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.380
to changing wealth, and gets
this sort of normalized graph

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.950
of hurricane damages.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.740
You can see the spectacular
damages in the 1920s.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.270
That was largely from one event,
the Miami hurricane of 1926,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.700
which put that city under water.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.870
But the first decade
of the 21st century

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.380
is also very bad in this rank.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:32.710
Now here is the US damage
over that whole period of time

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.680
by the category of
storm at landfall.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.600
The Saffer-Simpon
Category is a measure

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.780
of how strong the
winds are, basically.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.390
You probably are
familiar with this.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.130
But you can see
most of the damage

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.740
is done by Category 3
and 4 and to some extent

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.050
Category 5 storms.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.230
But those storms are in a
pretty small minority of events.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.010
So this is just the number of
events whose landfall Category

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.125
is given on this axis.

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:03.280
So most of the storms
making landfall in the US

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.060
are Category 1 and Category 2.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.320
They're relatively weak and
they don't do very much damage.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.830
We're pretty hardened
to those storms by now.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.110
It's the much rarer
Category 3, 4, and 5 storms.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.060
So here's the nature
of the problem.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.530
More than half of the normalized
damage over the last 150 years

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.610
is done by eight storms.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.320
Eight.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.150
OK?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.380
That's not a lot of
numbers to do statistics

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.130
with if you're a statistician.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.290
And more than 90%
are caused by storms

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.680
of Category 3 and
higher, which only

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.200
constitute 13% of the events.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.170
So the conclusion that
we get and that we

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.910
try to drum into the
insurance companies,

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.400
is all you want to do is do
it from an actuarial basis,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.110
look at historical
statistics, determine

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.720
everything, like your
property insurance premium,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.640
based on that.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.250
It's a fool's game.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.380
The history isn't long enough.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.660
And I haven't even started
to tell you how imperfect

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.980
that history is in terms
of the quality of the data.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.640
So, is there something we
can do to put some more

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.770
teeth onto this whole
problem of hurricane risk?

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.320
Can we do a better
job than just looking

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.790
at historical statistics?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.620
Well, yes, I think we can.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.050
And there are two
main approaches.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.250
One is to ask, what can we learn
from the geological record?

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.660
Do hurricanes leave a
signature in that record?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.080
And what can we learn from that?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.330
Now this is not work
that I do, but it's work

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.930
that I strongly support.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.860
And this field is called
paleotempestology.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.040
And in fact, my only
contribution to that field

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.990
was to invent that word.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.120
But there are
various techniques.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.190
And probably the
most published one

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.430
is this, that-- I just showed
you a film of a storm surge.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.160
And if you imagine
a coastline, which

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.830
you find many examples that
are like this in the US East

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.630
and Gulf Coasts, where
you have the ocean here

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.870
and a beach or bunch of sand
dunes, and then behind that

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:12.910
you often have either a marsh
or a lake or a lagoon or both.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.220
And normally, during
quiescent periods,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.030
you have things growing in
the lagoon and in the marsh

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.770
and they die and
they settle down.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.640
They create this very
nice rich, organic mud.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.300
But when there is a
hurricane, the storm surge

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.790
washes some of the sand into
these marshes and lagoons.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.820
And then you resume burying
it with organic material.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.060
So if you get a rubber
dinghy and load it up

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.160
with graduate students
and go out in the lagoon

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.520
and take a core, you
can see the sand layers.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.290
And you can radiocarbon
date the mud around them

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.420
and that will tell you
when those sand layers were

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.590
put down.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.420
So this has been
done and is still

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.150
being done around the country.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.650
And we're really beginning to
learn some interesting things.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.770
I want to show
you one site which

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.250
is at the head of Apalachee
Bay in Florida here,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.589
where the star is, where
there is a kind of a sinkhole,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.380
and sand being washed
into the sinkhole

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.617
by hurricanes over
a period of time.

00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:18.450
And so we get a record
that looks like this.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.740
So this is going back in time.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.619
So this is 2000 BC.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.329
This is 0.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.440
And then this is the
present, 2000 Ad.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.700
And each of these
spikes, which represent

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.730
how coarse the material
is in the core, it's

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:39.130
kind of a measure of how much
sand you have, is denoted by--

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.040
is here.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.870
And some of the more
recent ones correspond

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.780
to known historical events.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.920
There's Elena that went ashore
there in the 80s, Dennis

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.240
more recently.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.220
And then back in
the 18th century,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.740
there was a famous
storm that wrecked

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.140
an entire Spanish fleet
commanded by Solano,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.590
so it's called Solano's storm.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.770
And that shows up
in this record.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.990
But you can see that
there are periods,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.650
for example the
first 1,000 years

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.720
BC, where there was a
lot more activity, also

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.540
during the sort of medieval
warm period in here

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.410
there was a lot more activity.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.245
And so we think,
just based on that,

00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:24.160
that we're underestimating
long term hurricane

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.130
risk in that
particular place today

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.520
because we happen to be in
a relatively quiet period.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.310
OK?

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.870
So that's one way of doing it.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.600
But that only gives you a
few points along the coast.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.900
That doesn't really tell you
what's happening globally.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.950
And so we turn to
another technique,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.360
which is to try to bring
physics to bear on the problem.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.250
After all, we do
understand quite a bit more

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.610
than we used to about how
hurricanes work to the extent

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.740
that we can simulate
them with models.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.070
But there is a technical
problem with this.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.710
So if we try to use a
climate model, for example,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.050
a global model to
simulate them, it

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.540
turns out they're
just too coarse.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.200
These equations are solved
on a computational lattice

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.880
whose computational points
are typically 100 miles apart.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.330
And that's just
way too much, too

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.770
coarse to resolve the critical
eye wall region of a hurricane.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.050
In fact, we know from
lots of experiments

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.210
we need to be down
in the one mile

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.130
range of our computational
grid to be able to simulate

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.150
hurricanes accurately.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.970
So if you go ahead
and try to do it,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.340
you get kind of bad answers.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.500
So what you see on this
chart is wind speed.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.220
Now this is in
meters per second.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.700
If you like knots, if you're
a sailor, if you double this

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.920
you'll just about get knots.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.870
And this is the frequency of
storms with this wind speed.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.150
The black is what we
observe in nature.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.630
This black line is the
division between Category 2

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.300
and lower in Category
3 and higher.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.800
And the red is what's
modeled by global models.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.820
So what this tells us is
that the destructive storms,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.910
remember the ones to the right
of this curve, these storms

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.370
here, we don't even model those.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.620
So the very storms
we're interested in,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.630
we can't simulate
with a global model.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.750
Now, maybe 20 years
from now, given

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.640
the advance in the
speed of computers,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.810
we'll be able to do that.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.670
But right now we can't do it.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.450
We only can simulate weak
sort of sloppy storms.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.660
And that's with the state
of the art climate model.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.980
So global models don't simulate
the destructive storms.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.610
So what we've done
at MIT is an approach

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.250
that sometimes
called downscaling,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.700
where you embed
within the hurricane

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.320
model, the global model, a very
specialized hurricane model.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.470
So this is one that was
developed over the years,

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.280
first as a laboratory tool, then
it was adopted by the National

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.970
Hurricane Center
to help forecast

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.770
and still does help them
forecast real storms.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.620
And I don't want to go bore you
with a lot of technical detail

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.930
about this.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.710
But it has very high
resolution and it critically

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.940
interacts with the ocean.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.490
You know hurricanes stir up
cold water from the depths

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.620
and that helps limit
their intensity.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.480
And you have to simulate
that if you want

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.430
to do hurricanes accurately.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.690
So what we do is to
embed these little baby

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.680
hurricane models--
there's a lot more to it

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.740
than I have time to explain--
within the time evolving fields

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.700
produced by a global model
or global climate analysis

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.380
data set.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.570
And we can generate
hundreds of thousands

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.730
of synthetic events that way.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.274
And of course it's all
very well and good to say

00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:48.940
you can do that.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.606
But how do you know
you've got it right?

00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:53.650
Well there you do have
to use history to ask,

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.510
do you get the right
distribution of storms?

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.080
So this is an example of a
mere 1000 tracks produced

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.800
by this method where we
embed the hurricane model not

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.160
in a climate model
but in a climate data

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.210
set, an actual data set
of the current climate.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.700
And it's similar to the
tracks I showed you before.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.830
The colors are an
indication of intensity.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.470
Now of course those of you who
have seen hurricane charts--

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.250
I expect you have John,
given your proclivities

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.120
for looking at maps like these,
but-- this looks pretty good.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.940
But of course you want to
do much more rigorous tests

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.840
on this than you can do by once
over lightly with the eyeball.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.200
But this is kind of
a low level check.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.390
And we've done lots
and lots of statistics.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.370
And the technique works
surprisingly well.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:48.910
This shows you the origin
points of these simulated storms

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.720
versus real storms.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.805
And you can see similarities
and differences.

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:54.430
The greatest differences
are that there

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.040
are a lot of storms
in the observations

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.900
up in this region
here, including

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.030
right off of Long Island.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.000
And we know that can't be true,
because tropical cyclones never

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.860
develop off of Long Island.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.399
That shows you that
there are perils

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:08.440
in doing this comparison.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.780
The observations
aren't always right.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.470
The analysts put in to the
mix nor'easters, which are not

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.357
the same thing as hurricanes.

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:18.190
And so you have to be
very careful about how

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.060
you do these comparisons.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.830
Now once you have
this technique,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.320
you can generate--
you can filter storms,

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.780
so that, for example, here
are 200 hurricane tracks that

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.430
happen to pass close enough to
where we're all sitting today

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.840
to affect the region.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.990
And then we can-- if we're
interested in hurricanes

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.890
in Boston, we can produce
event sets like this,

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.790
and start to really put
some numbers on the risk.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.880
Now, what we like to do is
to compare those statistics

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.460
with historical
statistics in places

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.110
where there are
enough historical data

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.820
to make that viable.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.710
And that gives us some
confidence that this works.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.820
So here is an example of a
storm that affects Boston.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.890
It's just one out of many
thousands of simulated storms.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.620
The color again
shows you a measure

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.540
of how strong the winds are.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.720
These are dates in September.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.420
So this particular
event, characteristic

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.340
of all strong hurricanes
in New England,

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.820
is moving very, very
quickly to the north.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.540
It covers territory
from off the Carolinas

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.090
to New Hampshire in one day.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.350
So it's really moving fast.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.700
Here is something
called a wind swath.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.960
This is just the contours of
the strongest wind experience

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.350
at any point during this one
event that I just showed you.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.380
So, for example,
in Boston Harbor

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.330
there are winds of 85 knots
or so with this event,

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:58.300
which is a respectable
hurricane for New England.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.380
The event itself
follows along this.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.010
The center of the storm
goes up this black line.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.260
And as usual for New
England hurricanes,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.290
the strong winds are all
to the right of the track,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.690
whereas a lot of the rain
is to the left of the track.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.340
Speaking of rain, this
model does produce rain.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.880
Remember rain is the
second biggest killer.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.800
We're worried about that.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.470
This storm is moving
very fast so it

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.840
didn't produce very much rain.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.450
But here you see contours of
storm accumulated rainfall

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.190
in millimeters.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.380
So you can see the effects of
topography and other things

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.550
that are known to
affect rainfall there.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.500
Well, the beauty
of this is that we

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.550
can go way beyond history
in estimating things

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.060
like the rare events.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.740
So here is an estimate of
something called the return

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.960
periods for storms affecting
the whole New England coastline.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.410
And so this is the
return period in years.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.850
And that's
technically-- it's just

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:02.510
the inverse annual
probability of storms.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.460
So the way to interpret 100
is that a return period of 100

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.620
is a probability of
1% in a given year

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.500
that you will have a
storm of that intensity.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.880
So we see that there's
a 1% probability

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.220
that you'll have a storm in any
given year affecting the New

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.010
England coastline
with winds of around

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.940
105 nautical miles per hour.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.790
The green dots are
inferences made strictly

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.090
on historical data.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.620
And the blue dots come
from these synthetic events

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.020
I just described.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.300
The red is just a
curve fit to that.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.590
So you can get much
further out because you

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.870
have many, many more events.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.400
So you can look at much
rarer events of the kind that

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.190
usually cause the most damage.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.420
Now I mentioned to you that
the most lethal aspect,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.470
on the other hand, of
hurricanes is the storm surge.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.570
So we haven't said anything
about how to model those,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.160
but in fact, that
is a very advanced--

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.370
that particular bit of
computational fluid dynamics

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.974
is very advanced.

00:27:09.974 --> 00:27:11.390
My profession has
gotten very good

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.820
at simulating storm
surges given that you

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.420
know what the hurricane's
doing, obviously.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.130
So if you have a known
hurricane, you can do that.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.880
And here is an
example of a series

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.020
of simulations for
the city of New York

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.210
that we did some years ago.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.970
And this circular area
here shows an example

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.630
of the computational
mesh that was used

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.630
to do the surge simulations.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.490
And the dots, blue and
red dots [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.780
is a different model, a
much more sophisticated one,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.590
which has an adaptive, or
sorry, an unstructured mesh.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.380
And the beauty about
storm surge modeling

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.040
is the equations are very
simple, for those of you who

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.850
do any kind of modeling.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.860
On the other hand, the
boundary conditions

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.260
are hopelessly complicated.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.140
So it's an interesting
computational challenge.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.300
But I think it's
been largely met.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.380
So we can use these thousands
of artificial hurricanes,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.500
if you will, to drive storm
surges using models like this

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.670
and get an estimate of
the risk of storm surges.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:25.420
And we did a study for
Manhattan back in 2010.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.870
It's before Sandy, actually.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.640
And this was our estimate
of the peak surge

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.590
at the Battery, which is at
the southern tip of New York

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.440
and happens to
have a tide gauge.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.880
So these things
are measured there.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.300
And this again is return period
so this is one in 100 years,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.960
one in 500 years, one in 5,000
years, one in 50,000 years.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.380
And this is the level
of the surge in meters.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.420
OK?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.350
So Sandy's surge was
about 2.8 meters.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.530
And so we would have
estimated that that

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:05.690
was like a 600 or 700 year event
that we saw for the Battery.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.104
It doesn't mean
you wouldn't have

00:29:07.104 --> 00:29:09.770
to wait that long to see a surge
that magnitude somewhere around

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.450
there, but right at the
Battery-- and other people

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.710
using completely
different methods

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.240
have come up with
similar estimates.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.710
So Sandy was a rare, rare event.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.600
And we did this before Sandy.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.460
All right.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.870
So we can do rain, we can do
wind, we can do storm surge.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.570
And we're starting to
try to put together

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.090
what the actual
risk is in places

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.910
all around the
world, including most

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.360
recently in my own backyard.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.510
I finally got MIT
to realize that they

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:46.262
have a substantial flooding
risk from these kinds of events,

00:29:46.262 --> 00:29:47.720
including the fact
that the control

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.500
room for our nuclear reactor
is underground and not very far

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.460
from the Charles River.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.720
So I'm trying to get them
to pay attention to that.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.050
But slowly it's happening.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.730
Now I want to talk
about climate change.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.140
And I don't have a long time
to introduce the subject.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.940
A lot of you have
heard a lot about it.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.760
And I'm not really here to
talk about that, per se.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.860
But I did want to mention that
this is an old subject, not

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.120
a new one.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.030
And arguably, the
first scientists

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:17.030
who worried about the fact that
we were changing the climate

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.930
was this man, Svante Arrhenius,
a gifted Swedish chemist,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.470
who won a Nobel
Prize in chemistry,

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.520
who lived at the end of the 19th
and the early 20th centuries.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.070
And he wrote a paper
in 1906 in which

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.460
he, using measurements
of moonlight,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.880
and pencil and paper-- this was
good old fashioned 19th century

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.820
science-- came to the
conclusion that if we succeeded

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.159
in doubling the carbon dioxide
content of the atmosphere,

00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:47.450
we would raise the earth's
surface temperature by about

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.189
4 degrees C. And if
we quadrupled it,

00:30:50.189 --> 00:30:51.230
it would go up 8 degrees.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.510
They were slightly
higher estimates

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.690
than ones he had done about
eight years before that,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.890
nine years before that.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:03.140
But given that, with all of our
computers and the whole IPCC

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.080
process, we're two
degrees to 4.5 degrees

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.230
is the current
range-- he did this

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.900
without computers, with
pencil and papers pretty good.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.670
So was he right?

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.980
I think the data are pretty
persuasive about this.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.570
This green curve is the Earth's
mean surface temperature

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.220
from thermometers going back
to the late 19th century.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.160
And the blue curve is a
measure of the carbon dioxide

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.460
content of the atmosphere.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.110
And you can see that there's
a lot of chaotic variability.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.620
John mentioned to
you Ed Lorenz, who

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.820
was very interested in this.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.860
There are also things
I haven't shown

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.040
you on this diagram, volcanic
eruptions and so forth.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.240
But by and large, the
surface temperature

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.500
has followed carbon
dioxide, as we

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.100
know it did in the geological
past, so we have a problem.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.640
And a lot of work
has gone into trying

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.700
to quantify all kinds of
risks associated with this,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.910
but I'm here today to talk
about hurricane risks.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.540
Now before I show you what
this particular model has

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.700
to say about that, let me
say that all the way back

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.730
in the late 1980s,
we understood,

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.250
just from the basic
theory of hurricanes

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.970
as heat engines, just engines
for taking in this case

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.710
the heat energy from the
ocean and converting it

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.320
into the kinetic
energy of winds,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.520
would have to go up if
you warm the climate

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.840
by almost any means
you can think of,

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.680
the sun, CO2, so forth.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.410
There's a speed
limit for hurricanes.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.940
And it's dictated by the
thermodynamics of that engine.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.491
And that speed limit goes
up as you put carbon dioxide

00:32:38.491 --> 00:32:39.240
in the atmosphere.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.520
So we understood
that theoretically.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.080
But there's an awful lot of
other things that can change,

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.344
the tracks of
storms and so forth.

00:32:47.344 --> 00:32:48.760
And so we'd like
to try to, again,

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.300
try to put some numbers on this.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.920
So what we do is we
apply this technique

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.925
I just described to you, rather
than to climatological data

00:32:56.925 --> 00:33:00.420
sets, to global climate models.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.670
And we are using at
the moment seven models

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.750
chosen because of
the availability

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.860
of the actual output we
need to run our technique.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.190
And I'm going to look
at-- primarily compare

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:18.610
historical period storms to
end of this century storms

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.450
under a kind of business as
usual emissions scenario.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:26.590
If you look globally, this is
a measure of global hurricane

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.650
or tropical cyclone power.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.410
This is actually a hindcase
going back to 1980.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.570
And then this is
a prediction going

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.380
to the end of this century.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.330
And you can see that there
is in-- this shading is

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:43.237
a scatter among the seven
models that we applied this to.

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:45.070
So you can see there's
considerable scatter.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.570
But in general there seems to
be an upward trend, as theory

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.820
told us there should be.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.590
So here is a very
rare event that

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.840
occurs in one of
these models that

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.780
affects Boston at the end
of this century, 2,086,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.770
in August and September.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.070
And so you can see that now--
and again this even then

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.770
would be an
extraordinarily rare event,

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.936
but it's actually possible
at the end of the century

00:34:09.936 --> 00:34:13.679
to get a Cat 5 hurricane in
Boston, according to this.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.050
Unlikely, but possible.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.510
And there's the wind swath
associated with that event.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:24.030
And the wind speed and direction
on the 4th to 5th of September

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.219
at Logan Airport.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.679
So wind is ramping up.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.340
This is in knots.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.460
It's a little bit more
than a mile per hour,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.239
if you aren't used
to those units.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.110
It ramps up.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.719
It goes all the way
up to about 130 knots.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.880
Then the eye passes over.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.720
And then this is the
backside of the eye wall.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.219
And this is the
wind direction here.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.400
But it's a very,
very rare event.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.900
And that's an event
that would not

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.510
be able to happen physically
in today's climate.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:57.010
So if we want to really try to
get down to the nuts and bolts,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.840
this is showing-- in this case,
you have to adjust yourself.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:07.440
This is the return period here
of storms-- of tropical storm

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.100
hurricane Cat 1, Cat 2, Cat
3, all the way to Cat 5.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.700
This is the return
period of storms

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.970
passing within 150
kilometers of here,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.470
based on five climate models.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.590
The blue is for the climate
of the late 20th century

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.200
and the red is for the climate
of the late 21st century.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.030
So for example, a Cat 5
passing within 150 kilometers

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.240
in the current climate
is virtually impossible.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.680
You know, it's a 1 in
200,000 year event, 1

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.650
in 200,000 chance each
year of having an event,

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.340
basically impossible.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.820
But it becomes something
like a one in 900 year event

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.340
by the end of the century.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.950
The shading, again, is the
scatter among, in this case,

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.760
the five climate models that
we applied the technique to.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.550
And so an event that's a 100
[? knot ?] of Category 2 events

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.320
might be expected once per
100 years, on the average.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.480
By the end of the century
it's more like once a decade.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.040
So there's a big change.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.460
I was a bit surprised
to see that.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.180
Rain is much more clear cut.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.820
As the year gets warmer,
there's more water vapor in it,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.940
and a given storm can rain more.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.660
Doesn't mean that annual
rainfall will go up,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.840
but you have storms
that produce more rain.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.310
This is the same kind of curve.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:38.510
It's just for this total
storm rainfall in millimeters.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.720
This again is for Boston,
the current climate,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.730
future climate.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.510
So 1,000 year event, at the
end of the 20th century,

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.360
becomes every 50
years or something

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.240
like that at the
end of this century.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.150
That's something that
virtually all techniques show,

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.630
is that the risk of really
heavy rainstorms of just about

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:04.480
any kind goes up in many places
because of this phenomenon.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.960
This is the same kind of
thing, but for storm surge

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.620
in Boston Harbor.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.610
So once again, this is
the peak surge in meters.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.490
It's not as big as you
can get in New York.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.710
This is for the current
climate and this

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.010
is for the future climate.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.010
And this is all because of
changes in the character

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.190
of the hurricanes.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.570
We haven't put sea level
rise into this yet,

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.860
and that's a big deal.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.210
And I'll show you
that in a minute.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.210
But for example, a surge of
2 meters in Boston Harbor

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.950
is actually hard to
do with a hurricane.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.430
We're more at risk of
nor'easters in Boston.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:42.310
But by the end of the century,
that becomes every few hundred

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.030
years.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.920
But sea level is going up.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.260
So this is a global sea
level, relative to what it was

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.170
in 2000, going back to 1980.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.324
This is in feet in this chart.

00:37:55.324 --> 00:37:56.740
That's what's
happened, and that's

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.930
what's projected to happen.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.380
So we could have a few
feet rise in sea level,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.630
but with a lot of uncertainty.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.140
And unfortunately, it's going
up faster in certain places,

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.760
including New England, than
it's going up globally.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.650
Sea level rise is
not globally uniform.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.340
Far from it.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.530
There are actually places,
like South of Greenland,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.380
where the sea level is falling.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.630
And so somebody might want
to ask me a question later,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.480
why should sea level be
falling South of Greenland?

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.110
OK?

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.360
Kind of an interesting
story there.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.030
So if we build a
one meter sea level

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.390
rise, globally or in
Boston, into that and then

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.570
we get these huge differences
in surge, not surprisingly,

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.360
so a 10,000 year event becomes
every couple of centuries.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.940
For example, in Boston.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.970
And an event that you might
experience once in 500 years,

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:51.050
you basically have
it every year,

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.400
because one meter is already
built into the system.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.480
So it's there permanently.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.380
Now once you have
numbers like this,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.570
you can start to convert
them into other things

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.050
that you might be interested in.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.990
For example, monetary losses.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:13.070
And Michael Bloomberg and Hank
Paulson and a few other people

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.280
commissioned a rather
thorough economic analysis

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.200
of the costs of climate
change a couple of years ago.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.820
And I was part of that effort.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.380
I sort of worked on the
hurricane aspect of this very

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.360
comprehensive report.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.660
So what we see here
for the whole US

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.440
is the increase in
average annual losses

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.010
due to hurricanes.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.550
And this increases in
billions of dollars.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:45.160
So by 2030, we can have just
maybe a few billion dollars

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.160
increase over what we're
already experiencing.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.590
The green is for-- I should say
the blue is for sea level rise

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.140
alone, without any changes
in hurricane characteristics,

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.030
and the green includes
changing hurricanes.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.680
So by the end of
the century, if we

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.590
include changing
hurricane statistics,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:10.300
we're looking at an additional
average $70 billion a year

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.530
loss.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.280
And so planners are very
interested in numbers

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.150
like that.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.800
So let me try to bring
it down, finally,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.700
to the level where it
might mean something.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.840
What are you going
to do about this?

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.300
So I'm not going to get
into the whole issue,

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.280
should we try to
control climate change.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.690
If you're the mayor of a city,
like the mayor of New York,

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.320
that's not your problem.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.900
Your problem is how do you make
the city resilient or robust

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.674
to this sort of thing.

00:40:39.674 --> 00:40:41.840
So they've actually done a
lot more work in New York

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.620
than we've done here in
Boston and they've actually

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.760
started to cost out various
options for preparing New York

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.390
City for this kind of
thing in the future.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.360
So what you see here
are some proposals.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.380
If you might recognize, this
is a map of the New York Metro

00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:58.880
area.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.720
There's Staten Island,
Manhattan is here, Brooklyn,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.190
and so forth.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.820
And so one of the options is
to build some storm barriers.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.090
This is a fantastic one.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.660
It goes all the way from
the Rockaways to New Jersey.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.770
OK?

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.750
There are much smaller versions
of this all around the country,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.720
including most
spectacularly New Bedford,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.520
if you've ever been down there
to see their storm barrier.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.280
But this is a really
big version and they

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.440
have to build a
small one up here

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.030
at the head of
Long Island Sound.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.030
And they shut those
gates if a storm comes.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.630
And they've actually
costed that out.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.110
I helped them do that.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.870
Another strategy is to
forget about doing that,

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.450
build some much more
modest barriers,

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.770
but harden a lot of the
infrastructure of the city,

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.560
make it possible to keep
water out of the subways,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.200
move generators from the
basements of buildings

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.890
to the rooftop,
emergency generators,

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.210
so they don't go out just when
you need them and so forth.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.120
Now what option
you decide to do,

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.240
if you're a resident of the
city of New York, a voter there,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.520
is a perplexing
question, because it

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.220
depends upon your time
scale and also depends on

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.090
your assumption about
how the economics

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.060
of the city and the country will
evolve over the next 100 years.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.190
So you know something
about the discount rate.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.800
So I don't want to
bore you with this,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.040
but these are sort of
benefit cost ratios for four

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.290
different kinds of solutions.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.850
And this is for the
current climate,

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.012
this is for climate change.

00:42:31.012 --> 00:42:32.470
There are a lot of
numbers up here.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:36.090
But the bottom line is if you're
only worried about the next 50

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:39.360
years, harden the
buildings, and that's

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.830
about the best you can do.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.580
If you want to take an
optimistic point of view

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.690
in terms of the economy
and wait, then 50 years,

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.100
later you build
the storm barrier.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.810
And that will see you through
the next 50 or 100 years.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:59.040
Now again, voters
have to decide this.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.230
It's our job-- not my
job because I'm not

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.300
an economist, thank God.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.600
But the economist's
job is to understand

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.790
how to convey to the public
what particular benefit is going

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.310
to cost what
amount, so that they

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.070
can make intelligent decisions.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.050
All right, so I
hope I've given you

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.060
a little bit of a taste
for where we're going.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.750
This is taking the physical
problem of hurricanes--

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.981
and hurricanes are really
beautiful for physicists.

00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:27.480
OK?

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.660
As deadly as they
are, they're really

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.910
neat phenomena to understand.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.950
I'd love to talk to
you about that today.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.320
But I think it's important
also to take what we've

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.280
learned about physics and
about modeling storms,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.809
and actually start to use
it to understand risk.

00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:46.350
And it's kind of an
interesting thing

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.551
to do because there are
physical modelers over

00:43:48.551 --> 00:43:50.050
on that side of the
room and they're

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.720
risk modelers over
in the other corner

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.680
and they hardly ever
talk to each other.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.490
Because the risk
modelers are all doing it

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.140
based on historical statistics.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:02.160
They're statisticians looking
at actuarial approaches

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.600
to this, right?

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.520
And the physicists weren't
worried about risk.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.280
They just want to know
how the thing works.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.470
And some of us have
tried to bridge this

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.420
and it's actually turning into
a very fascinating endeavor.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.740
So let me summarize.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.120
Hurricane history,
even in the US,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.350
where it's arguably the best
historically, is too short.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.770
And I didn't really
talk about it,

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.982
but the hurricane
records are pretty bad.

00:44:29.982 --> 00:44:31.440
So when you put
those together it's

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.390
really tough to come up with
quantitative assessments

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.880
of hurricane risk strictly
from historical data.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.280
You can make better
estimates-- although I'm not

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.740
sure we're there yet--
potentially you can make better

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.590
estimates by looking at
the geological record

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.030
and making deductions from that.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.488
There are other
techniques I didn't

00:44:49.488 --> 00:44:52.700
talk about today which are even
more fantastic for doing this.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.680
So there's some hope that we're
going to get learn something

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.620
about hurricanes from looking
at a 7000 year history

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.060
rather than just a
100 year history.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.470
And then in many
places, hurricane risk

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.260
is expected to increase
to this century.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.330
There are places where
we expect it to fall,

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:16.230
but by and large
we see increases.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:19.500
Coastal impacts of hurricanes,
whether they change or not,

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.550
are made much worse
by sea level rise.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.600
And I should say here
that in the United States,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.820
we have a peculiar
and very worrying

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.120
problem, that would be a problem
if there was no climate change.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.990
It's the confluence of two
bad trends, one of which

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:42.620
is actually climate related,
rising sea level and big time

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.650
rising coastal populations,
accompanied by policies that

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.050
greatly underwrite
the risk people take

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.790
when they move to the coast.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:55.050
I love the sea, so it's a
terrible dilemma for me.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.540
But the fact is that
we're going to bring about

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:03.780
lots and lots more hurricane
disasters just through policy.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:09.140
We call them natural disasters,
but that's not correct.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.099
Nature got used to these
events a long time ago.

00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:13.640
There are disasters
for us because we

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.280
insist upon building stuff and
living in dangerous places.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.820
That's the bottom line.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.690
If we're simply going
to adapt to the changes,

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.770
that pathway is very
dependent upon where you are.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.890
What works for New York may
be a disaster for Boston,

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.700
and vice versa, and
also on your viewpoint.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.180
Is it you just care
about the economy today?

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.690
Or do you care about the economy
that your kids and grandkids

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.380
will experience?

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.520
So it's all a bit subjective,
and from an economical point

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.410
of view also, assumptions
about discount rates.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.840
And hurricanes are just
one of many problems

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.840
that we have to
try to understand,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.140
in terms of their risk and
how to mitigate them and adapt

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:01.950
to them.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.197
So I'll leave you
with those thoughts,

00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:05.488
and I'm happy to take questions

00:47:05.488 --> 00:47:09.310
