00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.062
Actually, as much as it might surprise
you, we've been doing algebra right here.

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:09.120
These 2 symbols, the square and the
triangle that we assigned to replace the

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:13.462
words that we had written earlier are
called variables. In algebra we make a

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:18.725
distinction between numbers and variables.
Numbers are well, numbers, like 3,000,000

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:24.810
or 100,000, and variables are generally
represented by symbols or single letters.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.043
A variable doesn't have a set value like a
number does. Instead, it's value is

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:33.043
allowed to vary depending on what we
decide that it should equal. We'll talk more

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:37.755
about how we make decisions about that
soon. Numbers will appear either as

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:42.750
constant terms on their own, just numbers
like 3,000,000 right here, or in terms

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:47.300
that combine numbers and variables like
this last one on the right. When

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:51.430
multiplied by a variable or set of
variables, a number is called a

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:56.769
coefficient. So again, going back to our
variables, I could of chosen any two

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.760
symbols I wanted to represent these two
quantities right here, the square and the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.529
triangle. I didn't have to choose the
triangle and I didn't have to choose the

00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:08.987
square. In fact picking these two
particular symbols, is actually pretty

00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:12.422
unconventional in math. To give you a
preview of what you're usually going to be

00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:16.692
seeing during this course, I'll write this
equation out with more typical notation.

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:21.782
We'll most often see the letters X and Y
as your variables in equations in algebra.

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:26.538
You can also see I've removed the dollar
signs and the commas from the original

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.401
equation down here to make this equation
look a little bit more clean and strictly

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:36.551
mathematical. You'll notice that I also
sneakily deleted the multiplication sign

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.700
we had in the top equation, and didn't
write it down here at the bottom. When we

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:44.660
have single terms that involve both
numbers and variables multiplied together,

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:49.508
we don't usually write the multiplication
sign in, like I did at the top. As long as

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.660
we write the symbols directly next to each
other, with nothing in between,

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.640
multiplication is assumed to be happening
between them. It's like there's an

00:01:56.652 --> 00:02:00.644
invisible multiplication sign written
right here. I'm going to erase that

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:04.496
though, to remind us that we're not
usually going to see any multiplication

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:08.276
signs written between numbers and
variables. Although people doing math

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:12.994
often use the variables y and x in their
equations, I really want you to remember

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:18.177
that this is not necessary. Triangles and
squares are just as useful as x's and y's.

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:23.162
No matter what symbol you choose to write
a variable with, the power that it has is

00:02:23.174 --> 00:02:27.316
still the same. It acts as a slot where we
can insert different numbers to make terms

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:31.830
and expressions take on different values.
So maybe I set this first variable equal

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.926
to 3 and the second equal to -1 or
maybe this is -1/2 and this is 23.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:41.980
In certain situations, there will be
restrictions placed on what different

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:46.200
variables can equal. But, until we have
more information about what they equal, we

00:02:46.212 --> 00:02:50.563
leave them written as variables, showing
that their values are still sort of a

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:52.102
mystery to us.
