00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.290
Some things science can’t explain.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.350
Tide goes in, tide goes out, you can’t explain
that.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.830
Hahahaha I’m kidding, you totally can.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.829
What’s up our semidiurnal viewers, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.230
Over the weekend the southern coast of Britain
was hit with big waves and some of the highest

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.890
tides in 20 years.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.820
What’s causing these huge tides?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.870
And why do we have tides at all, for that
matter?

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.900
Most people are taught that the moon controls
the tides, and that’s pretty much where

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.110
their education ends.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.399
While that’s most of what you need to know,
it may be a bit confusing when you look closely.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.879
It’s logical that water would be drawn toward
the moon because of its gravitational pull,

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.039
causing a tidal bulge in that direction.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.280
Weirdly though, a tidal bulge also forms on
the opposite side of the planet, and there’s

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.379
no secret moon over there.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.489
So what’s going on?

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.079
Well you have to remember that the moon’s
gravity isn’t just pulling on the water,

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319
it’s pulling on the whole earth too.

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.909
Water closest to the moon gets drawn towards
it hardest, the Earth gets tugged toward the

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.379
moon a little less vigorously, and water on
the far side of the earth is pulled much less,

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.860
so essentially it’s being left behind and
forming its own little lump.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.710
Our moon has a slightly elliptical orbit that
varies how far away it is by about 50,000

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.960
km each month.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.500
When it’s closest, or in perigee, tides
are much more pronounced than when it’s

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.660
farthest at apogee.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.970
Another factor affecting tides is land.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.040
If the Earth had no… earth, then the tidal
bulges would stay in line with the moon while

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.631
the planet and it’s water spinned under
them, but luckily for things with legs, we

00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:29.750
do have land.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890
The continents keep the water from freely
flowing and it complicates tidal patterns.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.020
Most places get two alternating high and low
tides a day.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.250
If the highs and lows are about the same,
it’s called semidiurnal.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.160
If they’re different, it’s a mixed semidiurnal
pattern.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.740
And if they get one high and one low tide
a day, it’s diurnal.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.770
The moon is the biggest factor at work, but
the Sun’s getting in on the action too with

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.870
solar tides being about half as big as lunar
tides.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.960
When the Sun and the moon are aligned twice
a month, we experience extreme highs and lows

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.200
called spring tides because their powers combine.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.980
When the Sun and moon are at right angles,
their gravities smooth out the bulges and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.090
the less extreme differences are called neap
tide.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.250
Over the weekend, Britain was on the wrong
side of all these factors.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.680
The moon was in perigee, in line with the
sun, and the shape of the land along with

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680
stormy weather meant a lot of water was headed
for the southern coast.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.280
Bad luck, but it was bound to happen eventually.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.810
At least there’s no vengeful anglophobic
curse at work that we can’t explain.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.290
While it’s true there are plenty of things
science hasn’t figured out yet, we’ve

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.310
got tides pretty much on lock.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.510
So the outside of the planet obviously has
a lot going on, but there’s plenty of movement

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.720
and shaking under the surface too.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.530
Trace talks about what we’ve figured out
in this video:

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.130
We’ve got a link in the description if you
wanna check out the full episode.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.100
So what are some other natural phenomena you
want us to explain?

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.770
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
