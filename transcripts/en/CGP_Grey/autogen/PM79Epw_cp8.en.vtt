00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 This is you, this is your genealogy 

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.999
 And this is your family tree explanation. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.366
 You have parents, and your parents have parents. 

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.166
 They are your grandparents, 

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.332
 Of course they also have parents - your great grandparents. 

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
 Keep going up, always add a "Zeng" word 

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.832
 Every "祖" word 

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.499
 There will be a generation between you and the "ancestors" 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.833
 grandparents? a "ancestor", 

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:22.599
 a generation between you 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.433
 Have you ever had grandparents? 

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.666
 Three Zeng Yizu, four generations 

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.732
 Back to the beginning, you have brothers and sisters, 

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.866
 And your parents also have it. they are 

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.832
 Your uncle and aunt. 

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.199
 Going up, you might call these people your "zu" and "zu". 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500
 But your grandparents’ brothers and sisters 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.333
 It is actually your uncle and uncle. 

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.066
 I used to be in the upper part of my grandparents. 

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.066
 The brothers and sisters of your great-grandparents were 

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.766
 Zeng Shuzu and his uncle. 

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.066
 Below the genealogy, the children of your brothers and sisters 

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.766
 Is your nephew and niece 

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.599
 Then you are their uncle / aunt or aunt / aunt. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.700
 Their children are your grandsons 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.300
 Then you are their uncle or uncle. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.266
 Looked up and down, now 

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.699
 I have to look to the side. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.333
 When you get married, there will be everyone's favorite. 

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.633
 in law. You are with your husband or wife. 

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.199
 Brothers and sisters are at the same level. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 You think you are just like them. Whole new family 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 The relationship to you is the same as their relationship with your spouse. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.833
 There is only a "in-law" suffix. 

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.633
 Everything looks straightforward 

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.766
 Only your spouse’s brothers and sisters are your brothers and sisters. 

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.632
 But your brothers and sisters are also your brothers and sisters? 

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.899
 This is a bit fuzzy 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.600
 Ok, the in-laws say enough, continue to talk about you should 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.366
 See the reason for this video. Cousins ​​and sisters? 

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.666
 They are the children of your sister/uncle and aunt/aunt, 

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.266
 But there are many types of cousins. 

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.599
 To understand them better, 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.566
 To simplify this genealogy, think about the next generation. 

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.566
 Here are you, your children, and your grandson. 

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.066
 Your grandchildren are cousins ​​and sisters to each other. 

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.366
 Their children, your great grandchildren, are the second cousins ​​of each other. 

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.066
 This relationship has continued 

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.799
 Cousins, sisters, and ancestors 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.733
 He tells you how many cousins ​​are on the family tree. 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.533
 Fourth cousin? Middle four generations 

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.599
 And have the same great-grandfather 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.666
 From the first law, 

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.899
 Your first cousin has the same grandparent with you. 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.300
 The second generation of the same great-grandparent 

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.632
 Just connect the number of cousins ​​and the number of "z" 

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.933
 Then everything is done, how simple 

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.533
 Off topic: turn this rule in turn 

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.866
 Brothers and sisters can call each other's 0th cousin 

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.866
 And they should do this 

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.499
 Are you your -1 cousins? What ghost? 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 End of topic 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
 Ok, nothing to say. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300
 Oh, there is still a little 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.966
 You may have noticed that these cousins ​​are on a generation basis. 

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.499
 What is omitted is the generation of their upper heads. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 For example, what relationship do these two people have? 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.633
 Starting from a younger generation 

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:44.233
 The first cousin, calculate the separate generation 

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:47.433
 This is a cousin divided twice, three times apart 

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.066
 This is the second cousin to separate twice, once apart 

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.132
 On this simplified picture 

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.266
 It’s too simple, but most genealogy 

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:56.432
 It looks more like this. 

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.933
 In fact, the rules are the same. 

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.999
 Just want to call faster, who is more difficult 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 For example, your second cousin is separated twice or your great-grandfather 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.700
 Here is a picture you can download, 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.866
 Will help you figure out 

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.532
 Who is who? 

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:16.266
 In your next family collection and of course 

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.632
 Show how much you hang 

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.266
 Then we are really finished. Unless you start 

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.766
 I want the value of such a big family. 

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.899
 How many of you have had great grandparents? 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.733
 sixty-four? 

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:31.899
 These former grandparents gave you a bunch of cousins 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.266
 This form totals to the tenth cousin 

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:37.032
 Or do you have more than 2,000? 

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.133
 This is too much, but 

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.433
 This figure has a big asterisk. 

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.466
 Let's talk about it next time, 

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:47.099
 In 'family inheritance; second volume'.
