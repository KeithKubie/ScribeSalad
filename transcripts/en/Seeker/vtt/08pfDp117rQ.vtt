00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.879
When volcanoes erupt in movies they do so
unexpectedly, and the eruption lasts as long

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.059
as the story needs it to last, but c'mon science,
what's it REALLY like?

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:21.470
I think my producer, Pam, had it right when
she said, "Volcanoes and dinosaurs are some

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.710
of the first things that get people excited
about science."

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.590
Volcanoes are incredible to witness, unless
you live in the path of one.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.680
They can be destructive, dangerous, and deadly,
but they're a glimpse into the awesome power

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.829
of the planet beneath all our feet.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.579
This week, unexpectedly, after 42 years of
silence, Calbuco volcano erupted in southern

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.579
Chile.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.192
Residents had 15 minutes of warning, and 4000
people had to be evacuated as the volcano

00:00:46.192 --> 00:01:02.679
spewed ash into 
the sky.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.180
No doubt, residents are asking how long can
this be expected to continue?!

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.210
According to research from Smithsonian Institution's
Global Volcanism Project, the median length

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.860
of a volcanic eruption is seven weeks, but
the length of volcanic eruptions throughout

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.510
scientific history is SUPER varied.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.690
For example, the crater at the top of mount
Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.650
held a lava lake from to 1894 to 1977, but
when it "erupted" the lake drained in less

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.650
than an hour.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.830
Conversely, the eruption of Stromboli volcano
off the coast of southern Italy has had low

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.620
level activity and occasional lava flows and
explosions since 450 BCE!!

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.360
Stromboli's been erupting for almost 2500
years -- most recently, with fairly large

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.790
explosions in August 2014.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.570
The length and behavior of these long-term
volcanic eruptions can teach volcanologists

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.960
and geologists a TON about the ground beneath
our feet.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.130
Mountains are created when tectonic plates
jam together, forcing rock upward, or when

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.210
magma from underneath the Earth's crust rises
through a weak spot, creating a volcano.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.289
Magma is like a bubble in water, it's lighter
than the rock around it, and slowly rises

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.730
until it hits the surface.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.140
As magma gets closer to the surface, gases
appear inside the magma -- like nitrogen bubbles

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.439
in a diver's blood.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.519
When the magma and gas reach the surface,
they EXPLODE into the comparatively thin atmosphere

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.999
above the crust -- when that happens, it's
just like a soda that's been shook up.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.129
Bubbles and explosions galore.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.550
In 1983, magma under mount Kilauea in Hawaii
forced open a rift 6.4 kilometers (4 miles)

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.550
long!

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.770
When Kilauea cracked, lava fountains shot
1,500 feet (460m) into the air, with activity

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.489
continuing for 3 years before more cracks
spread the pressure under the volcano around

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.580
-- causing a low-level continuous eruption
which is still ongoing today, 32 years later!

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.879
Now, the eruption is used to learn more about
how lava behaves, and how magma flows beneath

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.030
the crust.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.304
Scientists studying the Kilauea eruption -- and
the nearby new Pu'u 'O'o (pooh-OO-oh-oh) volcano

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:05.310
that formed over the crack -- have learned
more about the tectonic plates our planet's

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.439
continents ride on, how earthquakes happen,
and more about the toxic gases that escape

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.109
during volcanic activity.

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.209
They can also track the slight swelling of
the rock at the volcanoes surface to find

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.590
the magma pipes which feed the eruption -- sort
of like the volcanoes blood vessels.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.769
Luckily, Chile's Calbuco isn't near any major
population centers, but when it erupted in

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.719
1895 it threw 30-cm bombs (1 foot) 8 km (5
miles) from the eruption site.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.989
So, this isn't the big one for ol' Cal.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.989
Chile has many hundreds of volcanoes, and
according to Penn State, this eruption will

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.840
continue until the magma melt beneath the
volcano has stabilized, and the pressurized

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.700
gas which has built up is released; but, honestly,
no one can tell exactly how long that will

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.700
be.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.700
Volcanoes are so cool.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.519
Seriously, who doesn't love watching these
things?

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:19.209
From a safe distance 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729
of course.
