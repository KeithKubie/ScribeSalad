YINNON HAVIV: Hi everybody.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.620
Welcome.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.240
I'd like to start this session
with a small video that kind

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.950
of inspired us into pursuing
this topic.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.810
So watch closely.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:03:08.590

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.310
YINNON HAVIV: Pretty
cool, huh?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.830
So my name is Yinnon, I lead
a team that does the Google

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.800
Chart Tools and together with me
is Michael Fink, the PM for

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.380
that same team.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.510
And what we are going to talk
about today is how to turn

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.815
your data into a story.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.810
The structure of this session
will contain two parts.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.520
So in the first part, we'll take
the data, and we'll show

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.430
you how to create a dashboard
over this data that allows you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.790
to watch the data from different
perspectives.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.710
Each perspective, each slice,
will show up a little bit

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.560
different information.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.410
And the graph that you see below
here is the different

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.410
possibilities to go from
one slice into another.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.370
And you will give this dashboard
to your user.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.940
And that dashboard can be used
to travel the data and slice

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.545
and dice the data, moving
freely in this graph.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.830
In the second part of the talk,
we'll show you how to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.540
make a story out of
that same data.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.530
And that story will resemble a
path inside this graph that

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.120
we've seen earlier.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:42.810
And so without further delays,
let's move and start with the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.430
first part.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.940
So the first part is all about
how to create dashboards that

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.100
allow you to explore your
data, explore it freely.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.450
To explore data I need
to start with data.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.850
So the data that we chose today,
we wanted to start with

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.530
the topic of the popularity
of specific artists.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.890
And if you ask people how to
measure the popularity of

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.790
artists, of performers,
you would get--

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.180
if you ask five persons you
would get around seven

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.510
different answers.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.950
So if you ask Michael Fink,
who is also the product

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.360
manager for Google Insights
and Google Trends, he will

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.700
tell you one answer.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.000
And that would be use the
search popularity.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.850
Just consider how many times
people have searched for

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.880
Beyonce, in this example, or
how many times people have

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.650
searched for Madonna.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.300
And that would give you some
sort of a measurement of how

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.090
popular Madonna and
Beyonce are.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.040
And you can do that for
every single month or

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.680
every single day.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.630
We chose the month
granularity.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.490
And you can do it for every
country in the world, and for

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.990
every performer as we just
discussed, and you would get a

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.960
measurement that shows
the popularity.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.720
The number doesn't
mean anything.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.820
Just a comparison between
those numbers mean

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.890
everything you like.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.410
So you can see here that in the
United States in December,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.050
2008, Beyonce was much more
popular than Madonna.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.180
And what we did is we extracted
this data from 2004

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.720
until now for all
the countries.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.410
Actually I'm sure we did
less than that but

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.750
for most of the countries.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.360
And for several performers we
extracted this information.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.500
And that's the information
that we are

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.430
going to be using today.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.320
So to be able to see parts of
this data, we will need some

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.490
sort of a way to slice and
dice this data, or limit

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.430
ourselves to viewing only
parts of that data.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.160
So what we have here
are controls.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.220
The first control will allow
us to focus on a specific

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.440
period of time.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.890
So now I'm watching the period
of time starting at January

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.520
2009, and let's take it all the
way to the end of 2009.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.630
And I can move this control.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.180
The table that you see over
here, the data inside of that

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.840
table changes.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.680
So I can control the time.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.310
And in the same sense I have
controls that allow me to pick

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.820
those countries that
I want to watch.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.250
So currently I am watching
the information only

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.440
from the US and UK.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.520
And I can add in any country
that I like.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.090
I'm from Israel, so I'll
add in Israel.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.200
And I can do that for the
set of performers.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.930
So you can see here the
set of performers that

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.690
I picked for you.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.250
From Adele, Beyonce, Christina
Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.790
Justin Timberlake,
and Madonna.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.070
So that would be the performers
that we'll be

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.810
looking at today.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.230
And I can move those controls
and the data table changes.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.840
And I'll see now it's
Beyonce and Madonna.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.465
And I see the US, the UK, and
Israel as I requested.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.950
So it turns out that creating
such a dashboard is quite easy

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.160
using the Google Chart Tools.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.240
How many of you are using
the Google Chart Tools?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.380
Have been using it?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.740
Quite a lot.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:38.250
How many of you were here last
year in the talk that we gave?

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.150
So for most of you,
it will be new.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.799
What we showed last year
is how to create those

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.800
dashboards.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.730
So I'm going to go pretty
quickly on that.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.920
But if you want more details,
you can look at the lecture.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.260
You can watch the lecture,
it is recorded.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.840
So dashboards are quite easy.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.550
Most of our libraries, most of
the libraries that we made, we

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.140
tried to make it as
easy as we can.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.530
We tried for the programmer
to do the minimal coding

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.500
required to set up.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.410
So the dashboard is
no different.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.060
All you need to do to create a
dashboard is to create this

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.330
dashboard object that will be
controlling your different

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.760
controls and visualizations
in the dashboard.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.740
So we are setting up
this dashboard.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.587
And then we are setting each
of the controls, the time

00:09:29.587 --> 00:09:31.810
picker control, the country
picker control, and the

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.240
performer picker control.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.790
And each of our visualizations.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.000
In this case we have only a
table visualization, so that's

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.860
the table chart over here.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.890
In some sense each of those--

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.640
if you know the library, you
know what charts are--

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.360
each of those wrappers wrapped
together the chart with a

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.500
specific preset of
configuration.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.520
So the table chart is all about
picking up a chart, a

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.570
chart of a specific type, table,
and stating up ahead

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.650
what will be the options that
you will be using and how do

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.840
you want to view this
data in the table.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.850
But the magic happens here.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:25.570
Here we give those controls
and visualizations to the

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.460
dashboard and we chain
them together in

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.060
some information flow.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.600
So we take the output of the
time picker control and we

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.740
squeeze that into the country
picker control.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.710
If you remember the time is
first, then the country, and

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.610
then we have the performer.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.950
So we take the output of the
time picker control, squeeze

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.400
that into the country picker,
and the country piker into the

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.050
performer picker.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.830
From the performer picker we
take the output, and we put it

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.400
into the table chart.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.970
And the reason that you see
erase over there is that you

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.550
can take the data from one
control and push it into many

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.330
of visualizations and vice
versa in some sense.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.120
So once you're done with that,
all you need to do is draw

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.014
your dashboard with the data
that you want to push.

00:11:24.014 --> 00:11:24.910
[COUGHS].

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.160
Sorry about that.

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:30.200
OK.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.970
So I tried to make the code
snippet from the previous

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.570
slide easy to read.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.060
So I removed all the details,
but there are details and

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.810
people would want to customize
their controls.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.230
If you think about it, a time
picker control, you might want

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.210
to customize the initial range
that you will be showing.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.720
So in this case, we are showing
a range from November

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.320
2008 to March 2009.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.620
That's the initial range
that we are using.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.780
And you might want
to customize--

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.380
the minimal amount of time
spent at the control will

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.080
allow the user to
physically grab.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.340
We have a whole bunch
of configurations

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.200
for each of the controls.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.390
It's the same as we do for
the visualizations.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.810
We follow the different
requests and create

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.750
flexibility to handle those.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:36.400
So watching the data
using a data table

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.360
doesn't help us a lot.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.740
It kind of dumps the
data on top of us.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.590
And what I want to do is I want
to use visualizations to

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.840
actually show the data.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.840
If you look at the data that I'm
currently showing in the

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.250
table, it has several different
times, several

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.120
different countries, and several
different performers.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.820
So it's kind of hard to show
all of that in the same

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.780
visualization.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.060
If I'm willing to reduce one
of the dimensions, for

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.072
example, the time dimension,
I can show a bar chart.

00:13:18.072 --> 00:13:20.950
Right?

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:27.790
Once I focused on a specific
date, December 2008, I'm left

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:34.130
with four data points, the
popularity of Beyonce and

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.255
Madonna in the US and the UK.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.350
OK.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.450
And I'm able to show a bar chart
that compares the two.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.930
And of course I can add
in more information.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.350
And still, the bar chart will be
useful because I'm able to

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.330
compare the differences
states.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.320
And I'm able to see, for
example, that the gap between

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.150
Beyonce and Madonna
in the US is huge.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.306
But in India, it's
not like that.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.300
OK?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.610
So it's quite useful to use a
bar chart for this situation.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:20.870
But if I'm reducing myself to
one country, for example the

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.950
US, I don't need a bar chart.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.250
I can still use a bar chart, but
I don't need a bar chart.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.060
I can use a much cleaner
visualization such as a pie

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.580
chart or a donut chart,
in this case.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.760
It's the same.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.380
So if I'm reducing another
dimension, I can go and use a

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.480
more simple visualization.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.310
If I reduce another
dimension--

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.680
let's reduce the performer
dimension.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.280
OK so now I have four data
points that I have to present.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.920
But if I'm reducing another
dimension, how many lines

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.350
would I have left in my table?

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.750
Probably one, right?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:04.070
So showing one line is all about
showing just the number.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.450
I can still move the
dashboard around.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.870
And I can still see that gauge
changing from one value to

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.150
another, but it's going to be
one value at each time.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:23.000
So I feel a little bit that this
space in my slide is not

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.860
being used very efficiently.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:32.760
I can see a lot of time in the
same visualization, right?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.230
I can now watch the period that
I just showed, and I can

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.330
see the popularity of Beyonce
in the United States

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.050
throughout this period.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:47.700
I can even compare different
artists in the same slide.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.610
There is no reason for me
to just show Beyonce.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.740
I can compare them
all together.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.640
And I can't even compare
states together.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.650
I can just put in Croatia and
see, throughout this period

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:11.390
that I picked, I can see how the
popularity of Beyonce is

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.155
different in those different
states that I just picked.

00:16:15.155 --> 00:16:16.200
You know what?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.360
I want to try to view all the
countries all together.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.230
And to do that I'm going to
remove this filter altogether.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.880
So I'm going to show all
the countries in one

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.790
visualization.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.820
That's going to be quite
horrible, right?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.330
It's quite hard to watch.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:40.800
But if I were to reduce the time
that I'm looking at into

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.170
one month, a specific month,
that we will be watching, I

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:51.350
can view all this information
very clearly on a geographical

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.010
chart, a geochart.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.080
So that's how I can do that.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.200
Let's say I looked at this
information, and I figured

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.030
that the difference between
the different states, it

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.609
doesn't matter for my story.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.500
It doesn't give me
any insight.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.849
So let's just average
around that.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.450
Let's just look at the
world as a whole.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.400
Once I reduce this country
dimension I'm again free to

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.710
explore my data, I'm free
to take a look at more

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.690
information.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.930
And essentially I reduced
one of the dimensions.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.430
So I'm left with visualizing
the two other dimensions.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:40.250
I can do the same averaging
for the dates.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.530
And I can add more performers.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.970
And now I'm looking at
performance of those artists

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.610
throughout the duration of 2008,
because I'm averaging

00:17:54.610 --> 00:18:00.570
over the period of 2008 I
think that being a good

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.160
performer is about being
consistent and being searched

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.460
a lot throughout a big
period of time.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.420
So I'm looking at the entire
period of 2008.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.680
So what we are seeing here is
that for each of the different

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.820
domains that we have, the time,
the country, and the

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.380
performer, we have several
possibilities.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.930
We can pick one value, or we
can pick several values.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.910
We can aggregate over
those values.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.660
We chose to average around those
values, but we could've

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.540
used other aggregation methods
when it suits.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.070
And we can do that
independently

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.550
for each of the domains.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:49.540
So we are left with this cube of
possibilities, and it's an

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.500
exponential number in
the number of domain

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.130
columns that we have.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.750
And this data that we have right
here only contains one

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.260
metric, the popularity metric.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.410
We could have had several of
those metrics and we could

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.240
have used different
visualizations.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:15.470
And all this combination of
possibilities is hard because

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.690
just throwing that kind of a
dashboard onto your user, it's

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.240
impossible to navigate.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.380
It's not impossible, but it's
kind of letting him solve the

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.950
problem on his own.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.890
And what you really want to
do is you want to walk him

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.680
through the story of those
performers instead of just

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.220
throwing the information
at him.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.740
So with that I give you Michael,
who will we be

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.620
showing you how to tell a story
using that same data.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.700
MICHAEL FINK: Thank
you, Yinnon.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.530
So I think the state that you
are all currently in is what

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.230
doctors call data vertigo.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.060
OK?

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.500
You've seen slices and dices of
this data and that was only

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.840
three dimensions in one matrix,
probably the simplest

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.500
data that one could explore.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.020
And Yinnon demonstrated very
nicely I think that there's an

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.740
exponential number of
possibilities in exploring

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.560
that data cube.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.840
And for each of those individual
slices that he

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.900
showed, he only showed
one visualization.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.110
But often there are several
visualizations

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.480
that you could show.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.260
So as Yinnon said, what we would
like to have, in certain

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.670
cases, a way to walk our users,
not inflict all of the

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.330
data cube on them, but rather
walk them through a very

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.070
carefully curated path of slices
that tells a story.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.940
And that's what this part will
be about, telling the story.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.430
Now when we are trying to think
how to tell a story we

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.260
could essentially address a
challenge that people have

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.370
been addressing for several
thousands of years.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.050
And we thought it would be
nice to go back to the

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.100
classical three act play
I'm sure a lot of you

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.770
are familiar with.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.700
I think this was suggested
back in ancient Greece.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.110
And the three act play
essentially says, if you want

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.420
to tell a story, start
with Act One.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.520
That should essentially present
the characters that

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.420
are in this story, the
protagonist, the antagonist.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.510
Establish the time and
space where this

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.100
story is taking place.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.320
And Act One usually ends
with the conflict, with

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.450
establishing the conflict.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.210
What is the grand challenge that
the protagonist has to

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.700
address throughout the story?

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.100
Then Act Two, which is usually
kind of the main bulk of the

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.090
story, are the different
attempts of the main character

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.610
to try to address that conflict,
address the grand

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.260
challenges that he
must overcome.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.880
Often the big conflict
is derived into

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.430
many smaller conflicts.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.780
And then in Act Three
reach the climax.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.480
Where if it's a comedy,
a positive story.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.710
If things have not gone so well
to the protagonist until

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.590
this point, but suddenly there's
a positive twist and

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.640
we all feel that suspense and
suddenly we all could relax

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.210
that things have a happy end.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.440
If it's a tragedy, it's usually
the other way around.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.810
Things seem to improve in Act
Two and then in Act Three when

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.690
the climax comes in, something
dramatic happens, something

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.430
tragic happens and things
take a turn to the bad.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.550
Now when you see this in Google
I/O, you're probably

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.250
wondering, why am I listening
to the three act play in

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.720
Google I/O?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.740
And what we try to do as a
team is to address this

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.770
challenge of taking these
principles and trying to see

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:37.300
how could these help us with our
data based storytelling.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.790
So we created a concrete
story that we

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.380
wanted to tell you about.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.930
And the name of the story is
"Reaching for the Stars." And

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.940
this is data driven
storytelling.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.000
So the first thing I want to
do in Act One, here's the

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.820
opening Act, is establish
space.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.490
OK, where are we?

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.690
Where is this story happening?

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.890
So what we're going to do in
this story, we're going to try

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.230
to show the success of
different performers.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.470
And we wanted to think of what
would be a good benchmark to

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.470
say, this performer is
definitely successful if he's

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.370
able to pass this threshold.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.460
And this is the threshold
that we found.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.640
And we chose this threshold
very carefully.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.210
We were trying to think of a
topic that humanity has been

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.170
interested in for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.470
And we thought, what would be
a good term to plug into

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.210
Google Trends to see
interests that have

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.260
been around for while?

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.860
And we said, well humanity
has been interested

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.650
in God for a while.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.560
So we said, OK let's just type
in God in Google Trends and we

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.190
get this line and that's just
how many people, every month,

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:40.320
have essentially typed the word
God into Google Search.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.240
And we thought, that would be
a very interesting threshold

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.110
because this is definitely
a very well

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.980
established point of interest.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.550
And what I'm going to do now,
sorry, is I'm going to try to

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.110
show a few performers, and
you'll see them in the context

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.450
of this threshold.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.500
So let's take a look at
Justin Timberlake.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.170
So even in the height of his
success Justin Timberlake is

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.290
getting close but he's
not quite there.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.010
What about Christina Aguilera?

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.870
So Christina Aguilera, four
Grammys, again she has her

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.280
ups, she has her downs, but
she's never quite able to pass

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.650
that very high threshold that
we set a second ago.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:19.140
J.Lo.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.230
OK so J.Lo sold over 55 million
albums throughout her

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:27.400
history but still way below that
threshold that we set a

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.810
minute ago.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.180
So this is kind of establishing
space.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.240
I think you understand
where we were going.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.680
And now what I want to do is
establish time and zoom back

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.000
in time back to 2004 and present
our protagonist, the

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.020
main hero of our
story, Madonna.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.240
Now I'm a big, big fan of
Madonna all the way back from

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.080
the time I was probably
in the second grade.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.320
So she's been around, what?

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.100
For 20-something years.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.780
And Guinness World Records
declared Madonna as the top

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.330
selling female recording
artist of all time.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.680
But at 2004 the career was
around for about 20 years and

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.380
a lot of people were thinking,
Madonna's not someone we will

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.360
be hearing about much
in the future.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.110
But me and several other
dedicated fans we knew that

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.650
something big was coming.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:22.600
And in 2004 indeed Madonna was
working on a big new album and

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.980
look what happened next.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.170
"Confessions on a Dance Floor,"
came out and did an

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:27.930
amazing thing.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.070
It was able to pass, in one
month, to pass that amazing

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.320
threshold that we
set earlier on.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.060
So all of our local fan club
is obviously celebrating.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.130
And while Madonna reached this
a phenomenal success other

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.410
actors or other performers were
out there and trying to

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:48.320
replicate this success.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.380
And here I'm introducing the
antagonist of the story.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.220
So we have here Beyonce.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.730
Completely different generation
of performer.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:03.550
And Beyonce split from her band,
Destiny's Child, and

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:11.280
emerged as a superstar with her
disc "B-Day." And I really

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.500
remember this as a tragic day
when I saw Beyonce pass my

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.870
beloved Madonna in
Google search.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.150
And going on to receive five
nominations, five Grammy

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.530
nominations.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.410
And we're pretty much at
the end of Act One.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.870
We presented the different
characters in our story, we

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.050
presented time, we presented
space and obviously the

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.410
conflict is there.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:40.070
And Madonna in the Rock Hall
of Fame competing with the

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.850
next generation of performers
that are emerging.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.690
And now we're entering
Act Two.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.680
So what happens at the beginning
of Act Two, Madonna

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.380
tries to recuperate.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.350
Releases "Hard Candy," which
was, I have to admit, not one

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.440
of her best records.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.500
But still gaining
some momentum.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.920
And then, Sticky &amp; Sweet, which
was really an amazing

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.910
tour worldwide.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.970
That was an awesome tour.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.610
But Beyonce quickly recovers,
releases three consecutive

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.800
number one hits in the
United States.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.320
And the divorce of Madonna from
Guy Ritchie definitely

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.870
did not help in this
point in time.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.440
And even her compilation disc
that came out later did not

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.500
help Madonna and recover from
where she was later on.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.270
Beyonce goes and he wins the
MTV Video Music Award and a

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.560
few months later, she gets a
world record of six Grammys in

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.860
one evening.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:43.850
And I think that the peak was
when in the recent VMA stage,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.390
Beyonce announced that she's
pregnant and all of the world

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:51.100
is rejoicing and my beloved
Madonna is way behind.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.930
A few months later, she gives
birth, she calls her

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.140
daughter Blue Ivy.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.550
And at that point Beyonce is
at an all-time record of

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.800
popularity in Google search.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.990
Now what people don't know is
that the next month Madonna is

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.720
scheduled to appear
in the Super Bowl.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.530
How many people here have
seen Madonna in the

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.450
Super Bowl this year?

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.930
Cool, that's nice.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.850
How many people went online and
searched for Madonna after

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.740
the Super Bowl?

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.690
You did, really?

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.630
Cool.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.212
So it's me and you.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.720
So will Madonna be able
to pass Beyonce?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.160
Act Three, suspense, right?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.610
So let's see.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.890
Almost.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.980
Almost was able to pass
Beyonce's declaration of

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.770
having Blue Ivy born.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.140
But she was not quite able to
do it and she was definitely

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.040
not able to replicate her
historical achievement of

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.650
passing that very high
threshold that

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.660
we set earlier on.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.970
So this was a story told what
the exact same data that

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.320
Yinnon presented earlier on.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.730
It's the same data cube.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:09.350
But it's a very careful sequence
of slices of data

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.190
that are curated in a way that
they get you engage.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.230
You're interested in the story,
you want to know what

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.970
happens next.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:22.370
You relate to the characters and
you try to think what will

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.100
be the outcome of the story?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.260
An experience that you don't
have while you're doing data

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.180
exploration.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.880
And this is just one
story from the data

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.110
cube that Yinnon presented.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.470
There are thousands of
different stories.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:36.460
Let's take for example another
story that could have been

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.160
derived from Yinnon's data.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.590
Adele, releasing "19," a few
months later appearing on

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.240
Saturday Night Live, still not
gaining the momentum the she

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.260
was hoping for.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.010
But then she wins a Grammy for
the best new artist and

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.670
releases "21," which was
her kind of big hit.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.130
And "Someone Like You," becomes
the number one hit in

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.200
the United States and look
what happens next.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.740
OK, whoa.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.410
So there is an endless number
of stories that you could

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:11.460
choose across that same data
cube that Yinnon presented

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.760
earlier on.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.160
So what we did in the last year,
we tried to think, what

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.090
would be the best tools that we
as the Google Chart Tools

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.420
could provide you as developers
in order to tell

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.210
these types of stories?

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.670
And we came up with a few tools
that essentially were

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.440
displayed here.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.130
And I'd like to show you through
a few code snippets

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.580
that will help you understand
how we build this

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.410
presentation.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.240
So the first thing I want to
show, as you see here, a small

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.680
summary of what we saw in
the previous slide.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.830
You see Adele, Adele's amazing
achievement in green.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.490
And you see that we have this
effect of graying out both

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.000
Madonna and Beyonce.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.940
Saying, at this point of
time, these two data

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.380
series are out of scope.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.370
They have that gray shade
indicating that

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.560
they're out of scope.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.240
OK?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.240
Another thing that we did here
is we used the visual

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.030
semantics of saying, maybe
occasionally at certain time

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.160
points you want to have an
informative tool tip that says

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.390
in this date and time

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.360
something interesting happened.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.340
How do we add this?

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.310
So take the same data table
that Yinnon talked about

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.320
earlier on.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.050
And imagine that the first
column is time as it was

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:18.570
previously.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.130
And the second column could
include data on Madonna.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.570
But then we add to the data on
Madonna, we add another column

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:30.390
of data which is binary data and
just says, is the previous

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.320
series, is it in scope
or out of scope?

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.260
Should it be grayed
out or not?

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.560
And so let me kind of emphasize
the part here.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.740
So we introduce a new column
into the data table that has a

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.080
specific term that
we call a role.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.590
And we give it a role of
indicating whether it's in

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.980
scope or out of scope.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.180
And if we want the entire line
to be gray we just give it a

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.430
function that just always
returns false.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.830
And that will just
mean that it's

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.910
continuously out of scope.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.050
But you could define
certain ranges that

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:00.890
would be out of scope.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.310
So that's one visual semantic
that was applied here to

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.600
Madonna and to Beyonce.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.950
A second visual semantic that
we introduced is this notion

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.030
of tool tips or rich
tool tips.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.840
This is not launched yet but it
will be launched very soon.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.080
And there, again, you just add
another column of data into

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.820
your data table and you put HTML
snippets in that column.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.030
And we will be presenting that
as the tool tip once someone

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.120
hovers over that individual
data point.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.210
A second set of tools that
is very important for

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.230
storytelling is animations
and smooth transitions.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.710
That helps the user
maintain context.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.700
So we introduced two types
of animations.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.460
One of them I'd like to present
now, which is what we

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.450
call the view window
animation.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.450
This is super simple.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.670
Essentially it lets you draw
all of your data on a big

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.990
canvas across all of the
time that is needed.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:52.190
And then you could define
smaller view windows that show

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.560
the chart across different
time periods.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.970
So just as a concrete example,
you could see here that we

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.390
have a view window defined
from 2004 to 2012.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:08.180
And then what we could do is,
once this is rendered, if you

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.320
want to have a zoom in effect,
we could define a function

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.430
that will run, and it will
define a new window that goes

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.360
from the beginning of 2005
to the end of 2005.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.570
So we went from there
long range to the

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.220
much smaller range.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.010
And the only thing that you
have to provide is the

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.050
animation duration.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:32.150
OK, so you only provide 2000 as
a two second animation, and

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.610
we take care of all
of the rest.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.990
So that's kind of the building
blocks that you will be using.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.000
If you want to add a listener
that says, once this zoom

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.360
animation finishes I want you to
do another effect, in this

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.650
example, pan to 2006, the only
thing that you have to do is

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.990
define another function
that goes to 2006.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.960
And we'll take care of
that panning effect.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.990
And just give us the duration
that you want us to do, and we

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.960
will take care of that.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.730
So that was roles
and animations.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:07.000
And so far we heard stories of
superstars trying to reach for

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.670
the stars, but when we were
preparing for Google I/O this

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:14.130
year we were thinking about,
what would be another great

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.469
example of a story?

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.330
And I remember Yinnon and
I were brainstorming for

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.300
probably two or three hours.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.960
And we were saying, maybe the
disaster in Fukushima would be

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.630
interesting.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.980
Or maybe the Arab Spring if
we want to be a bit more

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.020
optimistic.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.159
Maybe we'll take financial
data and we'll give you a

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.760
story on financial data.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.909
But then we thought, all
of these stories are--

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.199
everything has been
done already.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.850
We want to have something
new, something fresh.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.909
And what we decided to do is to
give you the tools to tell

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.190
your own story.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.510
And that's what we're going to
do in the last part of this.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.610
How will we be doing this?

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.570
I want you all-- how many
people have laptops?

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.760
You all should have laptops,
so open your laptops.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.910
And I want you to type
in that goo.gl.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:02.770
That's x, w, 9, capital c, 3.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.250
I'll wait a second so your
laptops could come up.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.710
And we're definitely going to
crash Google Spreadsheet

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.490
servers in this experiment,
but we'll

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.620
give it a shot anyway.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:28.470
OK so once you typed in
goo.gl/xw9C3, you'll be seeing

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.280
a spreadsheet, a bit like the
spreadsheet you have here on

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.190
the bottom.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.100
And the first thing I wanted you
to do is to make your own

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.180
copy of that spreadsheet.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.380
OK because that's my personal
data and I don't want you to

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.030
look into my personal data.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.000
So make a copy of that
spreadsheet, go to

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.730
file, make a copy.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.570
Once you make a copy, you'll
notice on the bottom of the

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.270
spreadsheets there
are two sheets.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.110
One is called controls
and the other one is

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.670
called emails from.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.310
So just make sure that
you return to

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.720
the emails from sheet.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.030
OK?

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.300
So I'll give you just one
more second to do that.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.290
Perfect.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.990
So you should be seeing a
spreadsheet that looks a bit

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.090
like this with your copy.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.630
And then it has two columns.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.770
Two interesting columns, Column
B, and Column C. And in

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.010
cell B1 and in cell C1, the
following thing happens.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:22.710
I wrote they're from me to Dan
and from me, David in C1.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.270
And I just want you to replace
those two names, Dan and

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.450
David, with two people
that you know.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:27.760
OK?

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.530
So one of them could be, say, an
old time friend that you've

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.750
been in a relationship
for a while with.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:36.440
And the other one maybe could be
someone that you met in the

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.780
last few months.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.770
And what I've done is I wrote a
short app script that takes

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.960
what you wrote and cell B1 and
cell B2 and what it will do,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.070
it will go to your
Gmail account.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.740
Don't worry, this is
completely private.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.300
It's your own spreadsheet and
it will go to your own Gmail

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.590
account if you give
it permissions.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.960
But keep that in mind and
share with caution.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.260
It will go to your Gmail account
and just populate a

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.930
spreadsheet that has month by
month, how many times emails

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.850
from you have the word Dan or
David or whatever names that

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:09.370
you introduced.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:14.690
Once you've done that, you
could click on the Tools.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.810
And within Tools there's
the Script Editor.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.360
And within Script Editor you'll
have a Run button.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.760
So click the Run button
over there.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.850
It will ask you for a sequence
of permissions.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.610
Say yes, yes, yes, if
you're interested.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.770
Feel free to say no if you're
not interested.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.730
And once you finished giving
all of those permissions

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.165
you'll have to run it again.

00:37:34.165 --> 00:37:36.680
OK, so run it again

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.700
I'm optimistic and I'm thinking
that maybe at least

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.920
one of you was able to follow
that sequence of instructions.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.750
But this is a cute toy and
you'll be able to play

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.150
with it later on.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:52.460
And once you run that and wait
for, say, 10 or 15 seconds the

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.810
app script will go to your Gmail
account, fetch all of

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.920
the counts of how many times
that name was mentioned, and

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.530
will populate that
spreadsheet.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.560
So that's essentially the toy
I wanted to share with you.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.540
And the reason I wanted to share
this toy with you is

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.020
because I thought it would be a
good opportunity for you to

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.820
go later on home and say, how
could I take this data and

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.870
tell my story?

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.060
And I'd like to motivate you
by showing the story that I

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:23.530
built and my personal story
using this data.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.125
So I'll ask you now to resist
the temptation to keep on

00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:29.250
playing with this toy until
the end of the talk.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:35.560
And listen to the story that
I have to tell you.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.100
OK.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.100
So I don't know if you recognize
the main actor in

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.570
this story.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.340
Our UI designers did
an amazing job in

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.320
replicating my glasses.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.590
So what I did instead of writing
a name, like you wrote

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.500
Dan or David, I use the exact
same tool that I gave you just

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.680
a second ago and I just
wrote the word great.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.910
OK, how many times do I have
threads that I sent out that

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.020
have the word great?

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.590
And you could see that I do not
use the word great lightly

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.990
throughout history.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:07.580
Actually certain months I did
not use the word great at all.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.900
But then in the last three
months, this amazing spike.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.820
OK, listen to this.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.030
In March 2012, so just three
months ago, I used the word

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.370
great 34 times.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.570
That's like I write great
every day now.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.690
And the question that you're
probably asking yourselves is,

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.330
what happened that made me make
this dramatic shift for

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.700
me to start writing great.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.560
And this is the story that I
would like to share with you.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.440
So before we start with our
story, a few other experiments

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.900
that I did, I wrote different
words like design, YouTube,

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.070
machine learning, brain and
cognition, different topics

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.200
that interest me, visualization
and travel.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.520
And then I aggregated, over
time, like Yinnon showed

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.490
earlier on, I did that type of
averaging and then I could

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.900
have this nice donut.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.310
So you could see that, for
example, traveling I have 58

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.510
mentions of traveling.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.590
And what you could see
here in the left hand

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.420
side, is you can see--

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.230
using the exact same tool
that I showed you

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.340
a few minutes ago--

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.890
you could see different cities
or countries in the world that

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.530
were mentioned in my email
across the last years and you

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.420
could see that I've traveled
quite a lot.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.950
And essentially I think that
we started by showing or

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.540
describing the protagonist
of the story.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.170
And now let's turn to
the antagonist.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.120
And often an antagonist is just
another character in the

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.450
story, the bad guy.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.420
But there are many stories where
the antagonist is not

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.545
necessarily another person.

00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:37.190
It could be like a force of
nature, you're fighting

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.310
against a storm or
something else.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.870
It could be a psychological
force or psychological flaw

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.200
that the actor must overcome.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:51.710
And here I'll be sharing with
you some of my personal flaws.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.280
So please keep it in this room
and let's ignore the fact that

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.320
everything is taped and sent
throughout the world.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.810
But I want to give you a
perspective of the different

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:07.830
women that I've had significant
relationships with

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.490
in the last few years.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.340
And here you could see my
problem surfacing is that I'm

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.990
not able to find the
right woman.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.700
So some of these relationships
are very short.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.290
OK, and some of them
are much longer.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.700
Some of them have a lot of
communications in them like

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.580
the one here in green.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.710
Some of them are shallower.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.810
And this will be kind of a
theme that I'm trying to

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.450
develop while I'm telling
my story.

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:38.380
So we talked a bit about the
main actor, we talked a bit

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.130
about the conflict that he has
to address, and now we want to

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.950
establish time.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.790
OK, so we'll be moving back
to the end of 2006.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.650
And at that period of time, I
moved from working in Google

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:55.660
Mountain View to working
back in Israel.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.820
And this was towards the end
of my first marriage.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.230
And I remember coming back to
Israel and drinking a beer

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.960
with my good friend Johnny.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.760
And I was kind of lamenting,
Johnny, why don't my

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.430
relationships work?

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.110
What could be done?

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.500
And he told me, Michael, it's
a question of expectations.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.650
He told me the following
thing.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:19.360
He said, in your league, a girl
could be sane, she could

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.650
be pretty, she could be
interesting, she could be fun,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.670
there are a lot of positive
things that

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.410
could be around a girl.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.240
But in your league, you'll never
get more than two out of

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.440
these four.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.000
That was his expectation.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.300
And he said, if you set that
expectation, things will

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.720
gradually improve.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.980
So John is known for his
infinite wisdom.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.380
And I was thinking about my
current relationship, or my

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.555
ending relationship with my
first wife, and I said, yeah

00:42:47.555 --> 00:42:49.740
she was definitely sane, she
was definitely pretty, but

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.110
things were not interesting.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.930
And I understood that she had
two of these characteristics,

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.620
but she definitely did not
have four out of four.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.520
So I remember I was back in
university at the time.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.310
And suddenly I met May.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.240
And she was something completely
different, right?

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.740
She was pretty, but she
was super interesting.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.000
She was really, really
interesting.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.010
And you can see the surge in
emails that I've started

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.250
sending to May.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:22.690
And on the top here, these are
emails that I've been sending.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.010
What I'd like to show you now
is the number of emails that

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.240
I've been receiving.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.970
OK.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.780
So on the top is emails I've
been sending, on the bottom,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.130
emails I've been receiving.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.730
And you could see that my
relationship with Diane, where

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.650
it was kind of I would send
an email maybe get an

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.560
email back, maybe not.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.120
But with May, I would send an
email and suddenly I would get

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.130
like 10 emails back.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:43.450
And at the beginning I was super
excited about all of

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.490
this interest and all
of this attention.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.830
But what started as a lot of
attention became way, way, way

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.330
too much very, very soon
and that relationship

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.860
didn't last for long.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.610
So I found myself back
in the dating scene.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.330
And using the same tool that you
guys will play around with

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:03.810
later on, I just wrote the
word dating and I got an

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.230
aggregation of how many threads
had the word dating.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:10.590
And you could see that in that
fairly sad period of time I

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.800
had points where I would have 51
threads in a certain month

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.910
that had the world
dating in them.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.950
And then I would try to
recover from that.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.220
And then probably my all time
high, 79 threads, active

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.570
threads, with the word dating
in September, 2007.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.700
And I was like, this
is way too much.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.180
I can't deal with
this anymore.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.860
And I remember one evening I
went on a date, I was sure it

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.870
would be yet another date.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.200
And then something truly
amazing happened.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.940
I went on this date
and I met Tammy.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.200
I start talking to her,
I was like, whoa.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.460
She's sane, she's pretty, she's
interesting, she's fun.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.950
And I call Johnny, I was
like, four out of four!

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.800
Four out of four, Johnny!

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.700
It's amazing, it's happening.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.690
And I was like all
excited by this.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:00.070
But unfortunately the curse of
the two traits was probably

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.430
correct because she called me
two or three days later and

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:06.450
she said, it's not you,
it's me, na-na-na.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.800
And she took off.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:13.290
So I was heartbroken by this
and I decided to leave

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.690
Jerusalem, which is pretty much
like Wyoming in Israel.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:19.360
I moved to the big town, to Tel
Aviv, which is like New

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.540
York, San Francisco.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.660
So I moved to Tel Aviv and
surely, like a day after I

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.570
moved to Tel Aviv, I met
my second wife, Lily.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.830
And what was amazing is that we
met online, but although we

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.150
met online it turned out--

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:33.040
I asked her, where
do you live?

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.430
And it turned out she lives
like three doors away from

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.780
where I live in Tel Aviv.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.840
So that was truly amazing.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.410
So you could see here the place
where she lives, here's

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.210
where I live, this
was our first

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.390
date, here we got married.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.920
We moved into that apartment.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.990
So everything was in a radius
of maybe 100 meters for me.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.120
And I saw this as a sign.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.280
I said, this is a sign.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.530
This is a relationship that
will definitely work.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:59.710
And I had this resolution, I
will make this relationship a

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:00.970
success no matter what.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.090
That was my resolution
at the time.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:09.360
And we started, everything
looked good, but in a matter

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.860
of two months the first
crisis kicked in.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.680
And we broke up for two
or three weeks,

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.650
then we got back again.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.710
And you could see this roller
coaster effect of this

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.350
relationship.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.480
And probably the saddest point
in the story is when I said,

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:25.970
you know what?

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.490
Maybe the problem is that we're
not living together.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.420
Big mistake, guys.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.190
OK?

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.180
So I said, let's move
in together.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.760
Here, come move into
my apartment.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.910
She moved into my apartment
on September of 2008.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:43.500
What you can see here is that
July, August I've been using

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.650
the word love three or four
times a month, I've been using

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:46.780
the word fun.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.410
Now she moves in, love
barely once a month,

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:53.626
fun completely out.

00:46:53.626 --> 00:47:00.720
So definitely not a
good move there.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.220
But you remember
my resolution.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.300
This would succeed
no matter what.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.990
So a few months later we
had yet another crisis.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.380
I went down to Sinai to think
about what should I do?

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:16.300
She flew over to Greece to
think what she should do.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.050
And in the third day of thinking
I said, Michael,

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.130
remember your resolution.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.570
You have to make this work.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.230
I literally took the first
flight to Greece, found island

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.860
where she was hiding, found the
hut, knocked on the door,

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.280
and I told her, Lily, I
want you to marry me.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.770
I think we could
make this work.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:35.520
So I was somewhat over
optimistic at the time.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.530
And we decided to move.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.250
We said, oh maybe the
problem was that she

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:45.670
moved into my apartment.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:48.370
Let's move into a
joint apartment.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.790
So we moved into a
joint apartment.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.720
Some disastrous things happened,
and eventually at a

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.630
certain point we broke.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:02.430
And you could see that after
breaking up I was devastated.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.750
I failed with my resolution
to make this

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:05.960
relationship succeed.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:11.510
And my mentions of great
go and decline.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.030
I'll keep the story short
because we have to finish in a

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.610
few minutes.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:20.330
But after I was devastated, I
met Anna who was my girlfriend

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.520
until just recently.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.620
And again we had sane,
we had fun, a new

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.470
combination this time.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.710
Sane and fun.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.250
And I always remembered Johnny
in the back of my mind saying

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.450
you have to settle down for two
out of four, you have to

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:35.560
settle down for two
out of four.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.580
Just accept it and everything
will turn out OK.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.660
And then a few months
ago in September, I

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.410
suddenly get an email.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.010
I get an email from Tammy.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.240
Four out of four, you
remember that.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.890
The dream, that I thought
could happen once.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.170
And once I got to the end--

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.780
she sent me this benign email
like, how are you doing?

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.200
Or something like that.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.530
And I thought, maybe
she's interested.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.640
Maybe she--

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.660
and ever since I got that email,
I noticed that the

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.960
correspondence with Anna, my
current girlfriend kind of

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.350
went downhill.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:13.220
And I said, I have to go
and think about this.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.210
So I flew over to India.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.360
And I don't know if you
can see this but I

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.660
flew over to India.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.210
And I said, Michael, you have
to make a decision.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.200
Could you just accept that a
two out of two is what you

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.750
should settle for?

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:33.350
Or should you follow your dream
and try to find that

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.980
magical four out of four?

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:40.620
So I was thinking, and I was in
India like for a month, and

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.170
let me ask you guys, should I
follow my dream or should I

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.575
settle for two out of two?

00:49:47.575 --> 00:49:48.340
Follow your dream, right?

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.460
Of course.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.840
Good choice.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.570
So I came back, and I told
her, listen, I have

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.410
to follow my dream.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:50:00.000
I'm sorry, it's not you,
it's me, na-na-na.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.400
And I got the guts to call up
Tammy, you remember, the four

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.060
out of four, I got the
guts to call her.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.090
And to my surprise, she's
like, yeah sure.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.634
We should go out.

00:50:08.634 --> 00:50:09.870
Great!

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.900
And two months later, we
moved in together.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.680
I was like, whoa.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.145
This is great.

00:50:13.145 --> 00:50:15.010
Everything's working out.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:18.000
And that's pretty much
the end of the story.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.570
And that's why everything
seems great now.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.850
And I think that with
that we will end.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.970
But just one more second, I
want to I have a serious

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.250
summary slide so you think
that this talk

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.270
was all about fun.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.600
So we presented two models,
one was focused on data

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.830
exploration, the other one was
focused on storytelling.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.650
Data exploration, as Yinnon
explained at the beginning of

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.090
this talk, is essentially
looking at the exponential

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:54.770
number of the slices of data
and saying that all of the

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.170
legitimate moves that your
controls provide is like one

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.540
big graph that the user could
navigate through.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.970
And storytelling on the other
hand, is you making a very

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:09.020
careful decision on what slices
of data do you want to

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.110
show and in what sequence and
in what tempo do you want to

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.250
show them in order to emphasize
a certain point.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.220
So one is has exponential
components, the other one has

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.270
linear components.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.840
One provides an unbiased
point of view.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.840
Here's a dashboard.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.450
Go explore the data.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.160
The other one has a certain
agenda that you

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.860
could use to promote.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.620
One has the user required to
engage with the controls and

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.900
know what he's doing.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.310
On the other one the user has
the advantage and disadvantage

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.360
of being passive.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.260
The response to dashboards,
your users are often

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.190
overwhelmed.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.165
While story could gauge interest
and walk the user

00:51:46.165 --> 00:51:48.770
through the data that you
might be interested in.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.970
One last thought that I want to
share before concluding is

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.130
that these two models are not

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.310
necessarily mutually exclusive.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:56.890
So what you could do--

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:59.500
and one of the big advantages
that Google Chart Tools

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.060
provides both of these models
in one unified framework--

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:08.390
is that you could say, let me
start by exposing the data via

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.880
story, get the user engaged.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:16.030
Instead of just giving him a
dashboard interface, let me

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.510
show him through a story.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.780
But then at any given time or
maybe at the end of the story,

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.480
let the user get the power
to say, oh do you

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.850
remember that scene?

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.580
I wonder what happened a bit
before or a bit after?

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.120
And suddenly you could build
an interface that easily

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.590
transitions between these
two frameworks-- between

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.980
storytelling, and between
data exploration.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.230
Thank you.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.890
Technical questions for Yinnon
or other questions to me?

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:59.630
Thanks, we're here for the
next 20 minutes if you

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:00.900
want to grab us.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.150
Thank you.
