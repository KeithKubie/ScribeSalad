00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.540
- [Instructor] We're asked
which of these strategies

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.690
would eliminate a variable

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.990
in the system of equations?

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.420
Choose all answers that apply.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.010
So this first one says add the equations.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.843
So pause this video.

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:14.870
Would adding the equations
eliminate a variable

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.630
in this system?

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.770
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.630
So if we add these equations,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.190
we have, on the left hand side,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.850
we have five x plus five x,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.480
which is going to be 10 x,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.340
and then you have negative
three y plus four y

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.090
which is just a positive
one y or just plus y

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.360
is equal to negative three plus six,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.490
which is just going to be
equal to positive three.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.570
We haven't eliminated any variables,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530
so choice A, I could rule out.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.550
That did not eliminate a variable.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.660
Let me cross it out and not check it.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.600
Subtract the bottom equation from the top.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.280
Well when we subtract
the bottom from the top,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400
five x minus five x,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.970
that's going to be zero x's,
so I won't even write it down,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.890
and we've already seen
we've eliminated an x

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.000
so I'm already feeling
good about choice B,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.780
but then we can see negative
three y minus four y

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.340
is negative seven y.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810
Negative three minus six is
going to be negative nine

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.740
and so choice B does
successfully eliminate the x's.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.073
So I will select that.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.470
Choice C, multiply the
top equation by two,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.440
then add the equations.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.273
Pause the video.

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:28.980
Does that eliminate a variable?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.400
Well we're gonna multiply
the top equation by two

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.400
so it's going to become 10 x minus six y

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.420
is equal to negative six,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.140
and you could already see if
you then add the equations,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.330
10 x plus five x,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.230
you're gonna have 15 x,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.620
that's not gonna get eliminated.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.610
Negative six y plus four
y is negative two y.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.120
That's not going to be eliminated,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.550
so we can rule that out, as well.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.883
Let's do another example.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.580
One, they're asking us the same question.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.290
Which of these strategies
would eliminate a variable

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.740
in the system of equations?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.270
The first choice says multiply
the bottom equation by two,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.020
then add the equations.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.863
Pause this video, does that work?

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.510
All right, so if we multiply
the bottom equation by two,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.410
we are going to get,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.310
if we multiply it by two,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.950
we're gonna get two x minus
two minus four y, I should say.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.700
Two x, I'm just multiplying
everything by two,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.470
minus four y

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.890
is equal to 10.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.680
And then if we were to add the equations.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.670
Four x plus two x is six x,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.530
so that doesn't get eliminated.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.530
Positive four y plus negative
four y is equal to zero y,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.650
so the y's actually do get eliminated

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.370
when you add four y to negative four y.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.670
So I like choice A and
I'm gonna delete this

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.760
so I have space to work
on the other choices,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.440
so I like one.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.460
What about choice B?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.123
Pause the video, does that work?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.010
Multiply the bottom equation by four,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.490
then subtract the bottom
equation from the top equation.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.500
All right, let's multiply
the bottom equation by four.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.810
What do we get?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.770
We're going to get four x minus eight y

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.470
is equal to 20, yup.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.940
We multiplied it by four

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.720
and then subtract the bottom
equation from the top.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.040
So we would subtract four x from four x.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.030
Well that's looking good.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.320
That would eliminate the x's,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.520
so I'm feeling good about choice B.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.670
And then we could see if we
subtract negative eight y

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.720
from four y, well, subtracting
a negative's the same thing

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.900
as adding a positive,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.720
so that would actually get us to 12 y

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.330
if we're subtracting
negative eight y from four y.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.000
And then if we subtract
20 from negative two,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.100
we get to negative 22,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.740
but we see that four x minus four x

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.470
is going to eliminate our x's,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.270
so that does definitely
eliminate a variable,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.843
so I like choice B.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.490
Now what about choice C?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.540
Multiply the top equation by 1/2,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.140
then add the equations.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.470
Let's try that out, pause the video.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.300
All right, let's just multiply times 1/2,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.360
so the left hand side times 1/2,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.370
we distribute the one half
is one way to think about it.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.210
Four x times 1/2 is going to be two x

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.312
plus four y times 1/2 is two y

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.890
is equal to negative two times 1/2

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.690
is equal to negative one.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.570
Now and then they say add the equations.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.120
So two x plus x is going to be three x,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.760
so that's not going to eliminate the x's.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.160
Two y plus negative two y,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.350
well that's going to be no y's.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.710
So that actually will eliminate the y's,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800
so I like this choice, as well.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.320
So actually, all three of these strategies

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.510
would eliminate a variable
in the system of equations.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.480
This is useful to see

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.636
'cause you can see there's
multiple ways to approach

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.890
solving a system like
this through elimination.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.140
Let's do another example.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.260
Which of these strategies
would eliminate a variable

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.220
in the system of equations?

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.600
Same question again.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.433
So the first one,

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:55.330
they suggest to subtract
the bottom equation

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.390
from the top equation.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.053
Pause this video, does that work?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.880
Well if we subtract the
bottom from the top,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.180
so if you subtract a negative two x,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.127
that's the same thing as adding two x,

00:05:07.127 --> 00:05:09.490
'cause you're adding two x
to three x, that's five x.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.350
The x's don't get eliminated.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.430
Subtracting four y from negative
three y's just gonna get us

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.900
to negative seven y.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.510
The y's don't get eliminated,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.820
so I would rule this one out.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.750
Nothing's getting eliminated there.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.940
Multiply the top equation by three,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.070
multiply the bottom equation by two,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.510
then add the equations.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.880
Pause the video, does that work?

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.380
All right, so if I multiply
the top equation by three,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.180
I'm going to get nine x minus nine y

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.880
is equal to 21,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.890
and then if I multiply the bottom by two,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.480
so this is times two,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.150
I'm going to get two times
negative two is negative four x

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.060
plus eight y is equal to 14,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.090
and then they say add the equations.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.070
Well if I add nine x to negative four x,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.480
that doesn't eliminate the x's.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.240
That gets me to positive five x,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.610
and if I add negative nine
y to a positive eight y,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.040
that also doesn't eliminate the y's.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.740
That gets me to a negative y,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.630
so choice B, I can also rule out.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.830
Once again deleting all of this

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.513
so I have space to try
to figure out choice C.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.600
Multiply the top equation by two,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.830
multiply the bottom equation by three,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.090
then add the equation.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.740
So they're telling us to
do it the other way around.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.680
Pause the video, does this work?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.600
All right, so we multiply
the top equation by two

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.460
and we're gonna multiply the
bottom equation by three.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.960
So the top equation times two

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.170
is going to be six x minus six y

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.530
is equal to,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.210
is equal to 14.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.640
And then with this bottom equation,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.940
when you multiply it by three, both sides,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.570
that's the only way to
ensure that the equation

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.320
is saying the same thing
is if you do the same thing

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.153
to both sides.

00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:50.040
That's really the heart of algebra.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.790
So negative two times
three is negative six x,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.550
and I already like where this is going,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.383
'cause when I add these two,

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.360
they're going to get eliminated,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.160
plus four y times three
is gonna be plus 12 y

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.650
is going to be equal to 21.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.100
And then they say add the equations,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.080
well, you immediately see
when you add the x terms

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.150
on the left hand side,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.770
they are going to cancel out.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.773
So I like choice C.
