00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.135
(film projector humming)

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.871 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We're pro hiders,
professionals at hiding.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.340
We hide fast and we hide long.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.343
(smooth jazz music)

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.316
My brother and I have over 75
years of hiding experience.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
Collectively, we
have over 3,500 hides

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.554 align:start size:84% position:16%
and virtually no
premature discoveries.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.758
Each hide presents its
own set of challenges.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:28.161
A pro needs a strong
will, lots of patience,

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.530
and an enormous bladder.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.499
Now, that's a hide right there.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.833
The lumber slumber.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.202 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's all splinters
and wood rats.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.704
Some of the places
we've hidden out are

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.240
the Middle East,
the Academy Awards,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.674
and in a moose carcass.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.444
We haven't seen our
dad in over 20 years.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.912
That's how good he is.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
My brother is attempting
one of the most

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.482
difficult hides of his career,

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.551
the supermarket stowaway.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.054
I've shaved on a hide,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.623
ate full-course meals on a hide,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.192
I met my wife on a hide.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.194
That's a textbook hide.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
A hider is discrete
and courteous.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.367
That's not a hide.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.803
Just going to the bathroom.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:14.040
A cereal shelf makes a
great bed and breakfast.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.710
Professional hiders,
here today, gone today.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.091
