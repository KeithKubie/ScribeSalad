about 12:00 midnight and then you wake
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490
about 12:00 midnight and then you wake
up in the morning and can't figure out

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
up in the morning and can't figure out
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.979
up in the morning and can't figure out
why you thought that so all of that goes

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989
why you thought that so all of that goes
 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.250
why you thought that so all of that goes
on and then do you know what a rolling

World War one and it's when you you run

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859
World War one and it's when you you run
 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.009
World War one and it's when you you run
forward and then crouch down and your

wrong of course it's unfortunate so I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900
wrong of course it's unfortunate so I
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.390

start typing on a computer now computers

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400
start typing on a computer now computers
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.670

were very helpful for me because I was

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680
were very helpful for me because I was
 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.440
were very helpful for me because I was
always a bad typist and a bad speller I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450
always a bad typist and a bad speller I
 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.110
always a bad typist and a bad speller I
start typing up my handwritten text

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120
start typing up my handwritten text
 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.270
start typing up my handwritten text
while I'm still writing it at the back

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
while I'm still writing it at the back
 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.750
while I'm still writing it at the back
so the rolling barrage of typing goes on

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
so the rolling barrage of typing goes on
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.000
so the rolling barrage of typing goes on
while the writing creeps forward along

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
while the writing creeps forward along
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.580
while the writing creeps forward along
the ground if you will

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590
 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.520
first of all there is no normal time and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
first of all there is no normal time and

first of all there is no normal time and
that it takes me to write a novel it

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360
that it takes me to write a novel it
 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.930
that it takes me to write a novel it
very much depends on the length of the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
very much depends on the length of the
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.540
very much depends on the length of the
novel and how well or badly it's going

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
novel and how well or badly it's going
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.780
novel and how well or badly it's going
and some of them have taken quite a long

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790
and some of them have taken quite a long
 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.449
and some of them have taken quite a long
time because I have started off on the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459
time because I have started off on the
 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.610
time because I have started off on the
wrong foot I've gotten quite far down

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
wrong foot I've gotten quite far down
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.320
wrong foot I've gotten quite far down
the path and realized that I have to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
the path and realized that I have to
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.540
the path and realized that I have to
change everything go back to the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550
change everything go back to the
 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.360
change everything go back to the
beginning start again and that can

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370
beginning start again and that can
 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.940
beginning start again and that can
happen several times so that of course

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950
happen several times so that of course
 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.940
happen several times so that of course
takes up time some of them are quite

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950
takes up time some of them are quite
 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.390
takes up time some of them are quite
quick because you you've started off the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
quick because you you've started off the
 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.300
quick because you you've started off the
right way and then you can just roll

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
right way and then you can just roll
 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.770
right way and then you can just roll
with it I don't know whether you've ever

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780
with it I don't know whether you've ever
 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.560
with it I don't know whether you've ever
done any whitewater canoeing or or

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570
done any whitewater canoeing or or
 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.020
done any whitewater canoeing or or
surfing but that can be an exhilarating

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030
surfing but that can be an exhilarating
 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.810
surfing but that can be an exhilarating
experience and that's when the wave is
