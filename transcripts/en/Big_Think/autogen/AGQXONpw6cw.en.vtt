I love how complex it is on the inside

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660
I love how complex it is on the inside
 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.540
I love how complex it is on the inside
but when you look at it from a distance

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550
but when you look at it from a distance
 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.939
but when you look at it from a distance
it's so simple and pure and elegant that

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949
it's so simple and pure and elegant that
 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.189
it's so simple and pure and elegant that
you would never suspect that it's such

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199
you would never suspect that it's such
 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.869
you would never suspect that it's such
an architectural masterpiece like it

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879
an architectural masterpiece like it
 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.009
an architectural masterpiece like it
follows all of the forms of a fugue

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019
follows all of the forms of a fugue
 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.479
follows all of the forms of a fugue
today a prelude any type of the dance

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489
today a prelude any type of the dance
 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.639
today a prelude any type of the dance
but when you just listen to it it's just

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649
but when you just listen to it it's just
 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.980
but when you just listen to it it's just
a charming piece by itself and you don't

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990
a charming piece by itself and you don't
 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.310
a charming piece by itself and you don't
have to hear like oh this is an

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320
have to hear like oh this is an
 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.350
have to hear like oh this is an
allemande oh this is a Sarabande

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360
allemande oh this is a Sarabande
 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.469
allemande oh this is a Sarabande
but of course it helps to know so fugue

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479
but of course it helps to know so fugue
 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.609
but of course it helps to know so fugue
is when there's two three four five

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619
is when there's two three four five
 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.139
is when there's two three four five
voices or more if you'd like and each

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149
voices or more if you'd like and each
 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.749
voices or more if you'd like and each
voice is basically just a line and each

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759
voice is basically just a line and each
 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.160
voice is basically just a line and each
line has a subject but the subjects are

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170
line has a subject but the subjects are
 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.859
line has a subject but the subjects are
all the same in each line so say the

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869
all the same in each line so say the
 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.660
all the same in each line so say the
first voice will enter with the subject

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
first voice will enter with the subject
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.060
first voice will enter with the subject
and when the subject is finished then

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
and when the subject is finished then
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.249
and when the subject is finished then
the second voice enters and does the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259
the second voice enters and does the
 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.990
the second voice enters and does the
subject but usually in a different key

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
subject but usually in a different key
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.149
subject but usually in a different key
then the third voice enter is when the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159
then the third voice enter is when the
 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.130
then the third voice enter is when the
second voice is finished with its

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140
second voice is finished with its
 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.800
second voice is finished with its
subject then the fourth voice enter is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
subject then the fourth voice enter is
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.630
subject then the fourth voice enter is
when the third is done and so on and so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
when the third is done and so on and so
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.899
when the third is done and so on and so
forth all in the 48 total preludes and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909
forth all in the 48 total preludes and
 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.969
forth all in the 48 total preludes and
fugues in the well-tempered clavier and

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
fugues in the well-tempered clavier and
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.590
fugues in the well-tempered clavier and
since i've learned 20 that means I have

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600
since i've learned 20 that means I have
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.080
since i've learned 20 that means I have
28 more to go not bad

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
 
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 
in box music there's always a lot of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330
in box music there's always a lot of
 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.230
in box music there's always a lot of
lines going and if you have say a to

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240
lines going and if you have say a to
 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.020
lines going and if you have say a to
voice view each line is completely

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
voice view each line is completely
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670
voice view each line is completely
independent from each other which is

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
independent from each other which is
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.110
independent from each other which is
really confusing to play of course

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
really confusing to play of course
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.670
really confusing to play of course
because you have to pay attention to one

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
because you have to pay attention to one
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680
because you have to pay attention to one
like one character and then the other

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
like one character and then the other
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.760
like one character and then the other
one has to be completely different

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
one has to be completely different
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.729
one has to be completely different
character but when you move on to the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739
character but when you move on to the
 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.100
character but when you move on to the
bigger fugues with three four or five

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
bigger fugues with three four or five
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.260
bigger fugues with three four or five
voices that's a really really hard task

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
voices that's a really really hard task
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.790
voices that's a really really hard task
to do because you only have two hands

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
to do because you only have two hands
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.920
to do because you only have two hands
but you have to take care of basically

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
but you have to take care of basically
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.210
but you have to take care of basically
five different people playing five

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
five different people playing five
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.660
five different people playing five
different lines and then on top of that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
different lines and then on top of that
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640
different lines and then on top of that
these five different people are

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
these five different people are
 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.970
these five different people are
interacting with each other in ways that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
interacting with each other in ways that
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.770
interacting with each other in ways that
are sometimes a bit surprising like

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
are sometimes a bit surprising like
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.170
are sometimes a bit surprising like
sometimes they like to say argue with

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180
sometimes they like to say argue with
 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.910
sometimes they like to say argue with
each other they the voices interrupt

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920
each other they the voices interrupt
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.790
each other they the voices interrupt
each other and other times they kind of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800
each other and other times they kind of
 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.050
each other and other times they kind of
play with each other and it's a very

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
play with each other and it's a very
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.570
play with each other and it's a very
friendly piece but there's an outline in

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580
friendly piece but there's an outline in
 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.540
friendly piece but there's an outline in
which they all work so say there's a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550
which they all work so say there's a
 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.490
which they all work so say there's a
friendly part and they all work together

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
friendly part and they all work together
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.160
friendly part and they all work together
but then after that they suddenly turn

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
but then after that they suddenly turn
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.990
but then after that they suddenly turn
against each other so now they're angry

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000
against each other so now they're angry
 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.910
against each other so now they're angry
at each other so you have to create the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920
at each other so you have to create the
 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.770
at each other so you have to create the
distinction between those two characters

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780
distinction between those two characters
 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.660
distinction between those two characters
as well as the five different characters

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
as well as the five different characters
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.670
as well as the five different characters
as well as the interaction between those

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680
as well as the interaction between those
 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.620
as well as the interaction between those
five characters and the list goes on and

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
five characters and the list goes on and
 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.250
five characters and the list goes on and
on of course

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
 
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.679
 
I'd have to say my favorite is the art

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689
I'd have to say my favorite is the art
 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.940
I'd have to say my favorite is the art
of fugue because this really showcases

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
of fugue because this really showcases
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.949
of fugue because this really showcases
box magnificent few writing I mean it's

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959
box magnificent few writing I mean it's
 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.640
box magnificent few writing I mean it's
the entire sixteen fugues are based on

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
the entire sixteen fugues are based on
 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.180
the entire sixteen fugues are based on
just one simple subject in the first

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
just one simple subject in the first
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.160
just one simple subject in the first
fugue that comes in four different

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170
fugue that comes in four different
 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.250
fugue that comes in four different
voices but then it's kind of like a set

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260
voices but then it's kind of like a set
 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.619
voices but then it's kind of like a set
of variations you have 15 more fields

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629
of variations you have 15 more fields
 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.069
of variations you have 15 more fields
with each subject as a variation of a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079
with each subject as a variation of a
 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.250
with each subject as a variation of a
first subject and that works really well

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260
first subject and that works really well
 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.190
first subject and that works really well
because each one has a different subject

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200
because each one has a different subject
 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.770
because each one has a different subject
and each subject is unique in its own

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780
and each subject is unique in its own
 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.680
and each subject is unique in its own
way in the fugue itself and oftentimes

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690
way in the fugue itself and oftentimes
 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.390
way in the fugue itself and oftentimes
in each different fugue

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
in each different fugue
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.099
in each different fugue
he takes subjects from different fields

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109
he takes subjects from different fields
 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.339
he takes subjects from different fields
and puts them in so I think there's some

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349
and puts them in so I think there's some
 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.589
and puts them in so I think there's some
fuchs that's you have three different

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599
fuchs that's you have three different
 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.240
fuchs that's you have three different
subjects at the same time and others you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
subjects at the same time and others you
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.710
subjects at the same time and others you
have two different subjects at the same

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
have two different subjects at the same
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.539
have two different subjects at the same
time so now you're not dealing with just

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549
time so now you're not dealing with just
 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.460
time so now you're not dealing with just
a few you're dealing with a double fugue

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470
a few you're dealing with a double fugue
 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.340
a few you're dealing with a double fugue
or a triple fuse

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350
 
 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.940
 
so the subject is basically like a very

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950
so the subject is basically like a very
 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.060
so the subject is basically like a very
specific motifs in a piece you have say

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
specific motifs in a piece you have say
 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.620
specific motifs in a piece you have say
a line like da da da da da and that is

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630
a line like da da da da da and that is
 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.730
a line like da da da da da and that is
mirrored by da da da da da in the second

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
mirrored by da da da da da in the second
 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.620
mirrored by da da da da da in the second
voice but then the third voice comes in

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630
voice but then the third voice comes in
 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.830
voice but then the third voice comes in
doing da da da da da and then the first

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
doing da da da da da and then the first
 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.140
doing da da da da da and then the first
voice comes in doing da da da
