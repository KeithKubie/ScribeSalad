00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.520
We have three different
geometric series here.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.290
And what I want
you to think about

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.391
is, which of these converge
and which of these diverge?

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:09.890
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.650
it converges if the sum
comes up to a finite value.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.390
It diverges if the sum
goes to infinity, or even

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.100
possibly negative infinity.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.557
So pause the video
and think about that.

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:25.015
Well, the general way to think
about it-- and we've seen it

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.120
in a previous video--
is that you're

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.200
going to have a converging
geometric series.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.400
Infinite geometric series
is if the absolute value

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.401
of your common ratio is greater
than zero and less than one.

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.900
So we just have to
think about, what

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.700
is the absolute value of
the common ratios over here?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.950
And it's not as obvious,
because they didn't just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.949
write one term or one
number to an exponent.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.740
They wrote several
numbers to an exponents.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.700
So we'll have to do a little
bit of algebraic manipulation.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.879
So 5 n to the negative
1, that's the same thing.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.920
Let me do that over here.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.050
5 n to the negative 1
is the same thing as 5

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.060
to the n over 5.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.150
Or you could write it
as 5 to the n times 5

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.570
to the negative 1, which
is the same thing as 5

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440
to the n over 5.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.100
And so 5 to the n over 5, 5
to the n over 5 times 9 10

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.290
to the n.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.350
9 over 10 to the n.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.850
This is the same thing.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:38.380
This is equal to 1 over
5 times 5 times 9 over 10

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.650
to the nth power.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.860
And now the common ratio
becomes a little bit more clear.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.492
This right over here
would be our-- well,

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:47.950
it won't be our
first term anymore,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.491
because we're starting
at n equals 2.

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.780
So we won't view it that way.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.280
But if we look at our common
ratio, this right over here

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.790
is going to be our common ratio.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.030
And this is absolute value
greater than or less than 1.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.642
Well, 5 times 9 is
45, divided by 10.

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.100
That's going to
give you 4 and 1/2.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
So this is greater than 1.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.120
The absolute value
is greater than 1.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.009
So this one is going to diverge.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.852
This sum is going
to go to infinity.

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:15.560
Now let's think about
this one over here.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.185
I encourage you to
pause it if that one

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:18.310
helped you a little bit.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.780
Let's try to rewrite
this in a way

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.820
that the common ratio is
a little bit more obvious.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.810
So 3/2 to the n times 1
over 9 to the n plus 2.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.550
Well, we could think
about this as 1--

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.830
let me write it this way.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.040
3/2 to the n times 1
over 9 to the n plus 2

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.230
is the same thing as-- let me
write it this way-- 9 to the n

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.360
times 9 squared.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.270
And if we write
it that way, then

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.970
this is going to be the
same thing as-- let's write

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.890
it this way-- 1 over 9
squared, which is 81, times 3/2

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.652
to the n times 1 over 9 to the
n is the same thing as 1 over 9

00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:01.880
to the n.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.510
Notice, 1 over 9 to the n,
if I raise 1 to the n power,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.410
it's not going to change
the value of that 1.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.840
And so that's going to be the
same thing as 1/81 times--

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.340
let's see.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.280
3 divided by 9, we're going
to get 1 over 6 to the n.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.490
And so here it's a
little bit clearer

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.370
that our common ratio is 1/6.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.610
Its absolute value is
clearly less than 1.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.230
So this is going to converge.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.700
This is actually going to give
you a finite value for the sum.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.540
Finally, let's go on to
this one right over here.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.140
So let's see.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.324
1 over 3 to the n minus 1.

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:38.740
So let me rewrite
the whole thing.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.970
This is 2 to the n.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.110
And I'm going to write it
over 3 to the n times 3

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.930
to the negative 1.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.379
Same exact thing, which
is the same thing as 3

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.920
to the negative 1
in the denominator.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.500
I could write it
in the numerator.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.660
So it's going to be 3
times 2 to the n over 3

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.380
to the n, which is equal
to 3 times 2/3 to the n.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
So all this business is the same
thing as 3 times 2/3 to the n.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.060
Common ratio-- its
absolute value of 2/3--

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.520
is clearly less than 1.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.090
So once again, this infinite
geometric series will converge.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.890
It will give you a finite value.
