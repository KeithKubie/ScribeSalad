00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.089
This cat better watch out. And the only
thing more badass than guns

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.340
is kittens.
It's episode 33 of IMG!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.380
This is every way

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.540
Mario can die on one page.
And this is a Hadouken manicure.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.160
Could you grab me some peanut butter?
Oh, but watch out for the honey.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.500
Shaving cream.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.510
But the best type of spill? Cat face.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Look how happy it made this guy.
What? Ohhhh.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.500
Banana dog. Better than a heart butt.
And spot the difference.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.440
Here's Lady Gaga drinking tea. Some guys
really, really like this and thus

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.730
hotgirlsdrinkingtea.tumblr.com.
Enjoy.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.180
Remember the Big Bad Wolf?
Well, here's what he should

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.430
have done. Do you guys accept Batman &amp; Joker
money? Well, look how well I throw a hammer.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.530
Oh.
The great outdoors

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.009
with a body.
And the great outdoors with a face.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.030
But let's get trippier with GIFs.
Some are hypnotizingly

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.810
patriotic and others use rapidly reversing
colors to perpetually move

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.490
towards you.
This one too.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.520
If you've got red-cyan 3D glasses, take look at these

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.750
worms.
Just do it. Some just

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.060
did it. But now let's lay down with stuffed
animal versions of ourselves and enjoy

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.520
two montages

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.820
in one video.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.650
Photobombs are great but this one is
currently my favorite. "Hi!"

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.659
Let's hold hands, I want to keep you safe.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.729
Uh, just kidding.
Going for the dunk?

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.880
Wait, wait, wait. You got a booger there.
And you know what? Lots of guys get caught staring.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.920
John Kerry, even Obama.
Sometimes it's sneaky,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.979
sometimes it's surprising and sometimes
it's just judgmental.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.019
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming Anton
showed me that Sponge Bob

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.800
is made out of sadness.
Stephanie introduced a keyboard shaped

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.459
waffle maker and Krishna showed as a dog
that can make things float

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.660
and terrify people.
Now it's time to watch

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.860
LÃœT on our other channel, Vsauce2.
Vsauce2 is just like Vsauce,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.390
except we get to be a little bit more
specific over there.
