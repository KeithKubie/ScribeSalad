00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.040
So we're going to find lots of good ways

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
to use both modulus and ord and chr operators.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.040
So let's do one more quiz that's going to be a little trickier. What I want you

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.250
to answer is which of the expressions below

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.000
are always equivalent to X. So I have

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.940
exactly the same value of X where X can be any integer between zero and ten.
