00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.310
What if told you when you look up at the night
sky most of those points of light are actually

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.560
more than one star.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560
Don’t believe me?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.600
“I find your lack of faith disturbing.”

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.610
Hey there you scruffy looking Nerfherders,
Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.900
As we ramp up for the new Star Wars film,
oh it better be good.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.760
We were wondering...Is a Tatooine Sunset a
work of fiction?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.430
Well science says such a planet might be out
there, in a galaxy far, far away.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.130
Scientists know that double sun systems are
pretty common.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.410
Binary star systems orbit around a common
center of mass.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280
Usually one is bigger than other and called
the “primary.”

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.829
While most look like a single point of light
to us here on Earth, some you can tell are

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.970
binary just by looking through a telescope.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.860
Appropriately these are called visual binaries.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.210
Some are too far away or too close together
to really tell apart.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.489
To detect these, researchers use Spectroscopy.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.970
They look for Doppler shifts, or the way their
wavelengths of light change when they revolve

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.060
around each other.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.719
You can guess what researchers call these,
yeah, spectroscopic binaries.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.350
Some binaries align with Earth in a way where
one star eclipses the other.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.710
So naturally scientists call these Eclipsing
binaries.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.700
Binaries form kind of like twins.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.299
Some form like identical twins, where the
same body forms then splits into two.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.810
The young star spins so fast as it collapses,
the ball of burn gas elongates and cleaves

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.520
into two, like a cell dividing.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
But one study published in Astrophysical Journal
found evidence that binaries form more like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
fraternal twins.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.150
They form separately but from the same mass
of gas and dust.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.119
The study used the Very Large Array to look
at young stars just starting to form.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.590
A disc of gas and dust surrounds these baby
stars, and when the researchers looked closer

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190
they saw another smaller clump starting to
form.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.390
The disc fragmented and developed another
baby star.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.890
While this sounds kind of complicated, turns
out it’s pretty common.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.930
Some estimates suggest nearly half of the
stars we see are actually multiple star systems.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.869
While multiple star systems form pretty easily,
scientists thought it would be pretty difficult

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.590
for Earth-like planets to form around them.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.970
Previously scientists thought Tatooine was
just a work of fiction.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.720
Most celestial bodies found orbiting binary
star systems were uninhabitable big gassy

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
giants.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.520
It’s tricky for more rocky planets to form
around a star.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920
Too close and they get pulled in.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.120
Too far and they don’t form at all.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.780
Around a single star, planets form in concentric
rings, so they rarely cross each other’s

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.780
path.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.310
If they do, eh, they come together slowly
and could form a single planet without much

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.310
damage.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.260
Around a binary star system however, it’s
another story.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.379
Planets could hit each other at higher speeds,
smashing them to bits before they ever can

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.379
coalesce.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.860
But researchers from the University of Utah
think that if planets find an oval orbit,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.680
they’ll “nest’ around each other and
won’t crash into destruction.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.629
They say that it could be “ just as easy
to make an Earthlike planet around a binary

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.680
star as it is around a single star like our
sun.”

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.090
And researchers from the Ohio State University
found a terrestrial planet orbiting in a binary

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.090
star system!

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.090
(OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb).

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.220
This planet is about 3,000 light years away.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.010
It’s cold and dark, so probably not inhabited.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.849
But the cool thing about this planet, it’s
orbit is in kind of an S shape.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.100
It basically ignores one of the stars and
just orbits around one.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.560
And its discovery could provide evidence that
similar planets, maybe even one like Tatooine,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560
exist,…

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.840
Speaking of space and wars in Space.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240
Is there a Dark Side of the Moon?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.790
Is there sound in space?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:37.220
