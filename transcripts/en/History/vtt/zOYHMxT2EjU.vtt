scribe
Betty Ford in one word,

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.753
it would be candid.

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.630
She spoke her mind.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.008
I think the American public
really liked her for that.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.011
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.223
From an early age,
Betty Ford wanted

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:16.850
to be a dancer.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.893
- She studied
dance, modern dance,

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:22.355
hoping, in fact, to one day
become a professional dancer.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.191
- She moved to New
York City so that

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.778
she could dance in Martha
Graham's dance troupe.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:31.948
Betty Ford performed
at Carnegie Hall,

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.200
but her mother
eventually convinced her

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.037
to move back to Grand
Rapids and settle down.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:42.459
Betty met Gerald Ford while he
was campaigning for Congress.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.918
- They did get
married just two weeks

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.712
before he was sworn into office.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.964
So, she was involved
in politics from

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.257
the very, very beginning.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.260
Betty Ford is the
only First Lady

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.472
whose husband was not
elected Vice President

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.723
or President.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.975
- She was thrust in
the position after

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.894
Watergate toppled Richard Nixon.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.645
The next month they
discovered a lump

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.813
in her right breast.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.649
Two days after that,
that breast was removed.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.277
Betty Ford was lying
in a hospital room,

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.487
and she said she got
to thinking about

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.655
the power of the woman
in the White House.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.074
The power to do good
in this position.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.243
- This was a time when

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.622
breast cancer was
just not talked about.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.916
It was considered embarrassing.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.335
Mammography was
a new technology.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.504
- So for Mrs. Ford to
speak openly about her

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.923
breast cancer was startling,
stunning, amazing.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.091
She encouraged women
to go have mammograms,

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.261
and she pushed forward
breast cancer research

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.513
and lifted the stigma.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.764
It was a remarkable
thing that she did,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.973
remarkably brave.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:42.018
- I think this did
more to impact America

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.104
than anything any
First Lady ever did.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.357
Just because of the
number of lives she saved.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.528
Betty Ford's chief
cause in the White House

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.112
the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.948
When she got to the White House,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.867
ERA ratification was
pretty much stalled.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.537
So Betty Ford
spent a lot of time

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.539
lobbying for the ERA.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.333
She did this in public and
she did it behind the scenes.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.127
Betty Ford also
tried to get a woman

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.714
appointed to the Cabinet
and to the Supreme Court.

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:16.135
She said that she was
employing all means necessary,

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.887
including pillow talk
at the end of the day

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.682
when she thought her husband
was the most vulnerable.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.643
- Betty Ford is probably
best known for the

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.020
stigma that she took
away from alcoholism.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.065
She openly admitted
about her own alcoholism.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.985
Her father and brother
were also alcoholics.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.904
- In the 1960s, she
had a pinched nerve and

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.866
was treated for this chronic
pain with painkillers.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.201
- That was really the
beginning of her struggle

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.245
with drugs and alcohol.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.747
- She went to a rehab
that was predominantly

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.165
designed for men.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.001
And she said women's issues,

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.086
particularly regarding
alcoholism, and

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.339
women's issues in general,
were very different than men's.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.842
- She eventually will
create the Betty Ford Center

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.219
for treating addiction
issues and will

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.514
stipulate that 50% of the
beds would be for women.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.850
Her work for women
throughout her time as

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.354
First Lady would continue into
this new stage of her life.
