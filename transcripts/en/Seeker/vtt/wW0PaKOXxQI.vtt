Humans have very complex, deep, and nuanced
emotions. Bummer our face doesn't show them at all

Anthony Carboni here for DNews and you can
usually tell how someone is feeling by their

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.500
facial expression. Or at least it seems that
way- but really we take in tons of other emotional

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.220
clues when we're trying to find out how someone
feels. There's a commonly held theory that

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.410
across all cultures, humans actually only
have six different emotional facial expressions:

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.300
happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,
and disgust.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
All this is based on some research by a psychologist
named Paul Ekman based on a theory by Charles

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.000
Darwin- Darwin thought people worldwide must
manifest emotions in the same way, and Ekman

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.680
traveled around the world asking people from
all types of cultures to show him those emotions-

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.719
and the expressions matched. He called it
the Basic Emotion model, and he said that

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.219
he could even use it to recognize a liar by
the difference between an actual expression

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.739
and the microexpressions made by someone attempting
to mimic them without the actual feeling behind

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.579
them. He even consulted with the CIA about
it in the 70s to help their interrogators.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.970
The research has been pretty widely accepted
since it debuted in 1969, but certain studies

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.410
have shown otherwise. One showed people pictures
of two scowling faces and asked "Hey, do these

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.090
people feel the same way?" The answer wasn't
always yes. Another showed people an angry

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.120
face, but didn't give them "angry" as a choice.
Those people were perfectly happy to choose

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.440
"disgust" or "contempt" instead.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.460
Sounds like we might be too complex to fit
into a model. But what if the model is actually

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.200
too complex for our faces. New research by
the University of Glasgow says we've actually

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.060
got four emotions that we universally express.
Happiness and sadness are two of them. But

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.300
fear and surprise are the same, and anger
and disgust are the same.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.070
The study says that all humans begin with
the same simple expressions of biologically-rooted

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
signals. All the other details are added depending
on the culture and society we live in. Smiling

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.210
is always happy, frowning is always sad. Scrunching
our nose is the beginning of anger and disgust,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.130
and comes from a basic need to show something
displeasing or dangerous is happening. It

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.750
also stops us from inhaling harmful particles.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.740
Fear and surprise start the same, with widening
eyes- take in more visual information, assess

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.220
your situation, look for a potential escape.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.530
After those four basic reactions, everything
else actually is cultural. As we spread out

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.790
across the world, we created much more nuanced
expressions to fit our societies. Studies

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.790
show that Asian cultures use the eyes much
more to identify emotion, while Europeans

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.730
use their mouths much more.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.640
I went to Russia last year and people told
me I was smiling too much, that it looked

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.780
fake. I don't know if that's because I'm American
or because they see what a sham I am. Have

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.780
you ever visited somewhere and had your emotions
misread?
