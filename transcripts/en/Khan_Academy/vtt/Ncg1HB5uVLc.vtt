00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.760
We're on 41.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.890
Lea made two candles in the
shape of right rectangular

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.810
prisms. So I'm assuming when
they say right rectangular

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.670
prisms, they mean
a kind of three

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.570
dimensional rectangular shape.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.370
The first candle is 15
centimeters height, 8

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.300
centimeters long and
8 centimeters wide.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.990
So let's see, it's 15
centimeters high.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.090
So that's 15.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.640
8 centimeters long.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.420
So maybe that's 8.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.030
And 8 centimeters wide.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.740
So maybe it goes back 8.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.710
So it looks something
like that.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.030
That's candle number one.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.540
The second candle is 5
centimeters higher, but the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.950
same length and width.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.400
So the second candle is just
5 centimeters higher.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.900
So it looks something
like this.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.410
Where this is still 8 and 8.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.220
But the height is 5 more
than 15, so it's 20.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.030
Fair enough.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.040
How much additional
wax was needed to

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.590
make the taller candle?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.280
So if you think about it, we
just have to think about how

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.430
much incremental volume did we
create by making that section

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.990
five centimeters higher?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.620
So this candle, you can
kind of view it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.430
as going up to here.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.560
It's 15 centimeters high.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.610
And then we added
5 right here.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.980
So what's the volume of this
volume right there?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.195
So it's 8 by 8 by 5.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.900
So 5 times 8 times 8.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.670
5 times 8 is 40 times
8 is 320.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.450
So we have to add 320 cubic
centimeters more of wax to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.460
make the taller candle.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.900
Problem 42.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.450
Two angles of a triangle have
measures of 55 and 65.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.220
Which of the following could
not be a measure of an

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.160
exterior angle of
the triangle?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.740
So I think this is a good time
to introduce what an exterior

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.270
angle even is.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.390
So if I draw any polygon, and
I'll draw a triangle since

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.983
that's what this question
is about.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.060
So let's say that that's
my triangle.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.520
An exterior angle of one
of the vertices is, you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.820
essentially extend one of the
lines of the vertices out.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.140
So this is an interior
angle right here.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.640
The exterior angle is if you
extend this line out, so if I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.406
were to draw a dotted
line that extends

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:27.650
out this bottom line.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.770
This is the exterior
angle right here.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.510
As you can see, it's going to
be the supplement to this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.800
interior angle.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.040
And we could have extended
the line out there.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.170
Or we could have extended
this line this way.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.580
And we could have
used this one.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.590
But we wouldn't add these two
if we wanted to find all of

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.415
the exterior angles.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.490
The exterior angle of this
vertex right here is either

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.640
this one or this one.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.960
And they are the same because
both of these are supplements

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.910
of this angle.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.740
This angle plus either of this
angle or that one will add up

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.230
to 180 degrees.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.590
So that's what an exterior
angle is.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290
So let's go back to
the question.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.190
Two angles of a triangle have
measures of 55 and 65.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.960
So let's say this is
55 and this is 65.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.820
Which of the following could
not be a measure of an

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.430
exterior angle of
the triangle?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.920
Well we can figure out all
of the exterior angles.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.720
So first of all what's
this third interior

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.220
angle going to be?

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.600
Well they all have
to add up to 180.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.160
So let's call that x.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.790
So we know that x plus 65
plus 55 is equal to 180.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.870
65 plus 55 is 120.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.700
120 is equal to 180.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.170
So x is equal to 60 degrees.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.340
So this angle right here, I'll
do it in another color, this

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.710
is 60 degrees.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.430
So what are all the possible
exterior angles.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.370
So if I extended this line out
like I did in the example of

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.070
when I defined what an exterior
angle is, this

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.840
exterior angle would
be 120 degrees.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.480
If were to do it here, if I
would extend this out right

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.250
here, what would this
exterior angle be?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.130
Let's see, this plus
65 is 180.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.890
What's 180 minus 65.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.870
180 minus 60 is 120, so this
would have to be 115.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.970
So that exterior angle is 115.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.990
And then this one, let's
see if I extend it out.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.700
One of the two lines that
form the vertex.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.160
This is going to be
supplementary to 55.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.760
So 180 minus 55 is 125.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.010
180 minus 60 would be 120, and
then it's only 55 so 125.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.120
So the three supplementary, or
the three exterior angles of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.100
this triangle are 125.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.110
And they want to know what
could not be a measure.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.430
So 125 is a measure of
an exterior angle.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.950
So is 115.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.400
And so is 120.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.830
So our answer is D.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.200
None of the exterior angles
are equal to 130 degrees.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:09.320
Problem 43.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.050
OK, they say the sum of the
interior angles of a polygon

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.060
is the same as the sum of its
exterior angles, what type of

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.130
polygon is it?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.650
And this is an interesting
question.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.810
And it's something to experiment
with for yourself.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.340
But I want you to draw random
polygons with angle measures,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.140
because you know what the angles
all have to add up to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.230
in a polyogon.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.500
And I think you'll find, that
no matter what polygon you

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.540
draw, all of the exterior angles
are going to add up to

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.360
360 degrees.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.120
In fact, in that example we just
did, what were they they

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.780
were, for that triangle.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.510
If I remember, it's
115, 125, and 120.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.370
This was for a triangle.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.800
If you added them up, you
get 5 plus 5, 10.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.380
And then that's 6.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.670
360 degrees.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.110
For that triangle, which had
kind of strange angles.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.890
It wasn't like an equilateral

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.440
triangle or anything beautiful.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.300
And it's also the same if I
were to draw a rectangle.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.075
Well let me not draw
a solid rectangle.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.090
So if I have a rectangle
like that.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.280
What are the exterior
angles here?

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.380
Well, I can continue this
line right here.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.210
This angle right here
is going to be 90.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.640
I could go either way, I could
continue this up, but you can

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.970
only do it once though for
each of the vertices.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.280
Well that exterior
angle is 90.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.125
I could go like that, that
exterior angle is 90.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.050
I could go like that.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.830
That exterior angle is 90.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.740
So once again, 90 plus 90 plus
90 plus 90 that's 360 degrees.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.740
So it's a good thing to know
that the sum of the exterior

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.490
angles of any polygon is
actually 360 degrees.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.910
And maybe we'll prove that in
another video for a polygon

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.030
with n sides.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.910
But now that we know that, so
they say that the sum of the

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.930
interior angles of a polygon is
the same as the sum of its

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.000
exterior angles, this is the
same as saying the sum of the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.060
interior angles is
equal to 360.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.510
Because this is always going
to be 360 degrees no matter

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.910
what the polygon is.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.560
So they're essentially saying
what polygon's interior angles

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.180
add up to 360 degrees.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.390
And that of course is
a quadrilateral.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.980
My mouth got ahead of me.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.410
And if you think in a
quadrilateral you have 90, 90,

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.910
90, 90 and they add
up to 360 degrees.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.270
Next question.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.080
Let me copy and paste a couple
of them so I don't have to

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.330
keep doing this.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.940
OK.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.390
All right.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.140
What is a measure of angle x.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.760
So this is an exterior angle
to the vertex B.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.510
So how do we figure this out?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.160
Well there's kind of a fast
way and a slow way.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.690
And the slow way is to figure
out this angle.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.310
Because you know that the sum
of the angles add up to 180.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:12.430
And you say oh, x is going
to be 180 minus that.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.100
Let's just do it the slow way
and I think you'll see the

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.440
intuition of a slightly faster
way you could have done it.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.370
This plus 60 plus 25
is 85 degrees.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.270
Let's call this angle y.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:32.020
So we know that y plus 85
degrees is equal to 180.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.730
I got this 85 just by
adding 60 to 25.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.840
So this is just saying that
the interior angles of a

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.080
triangle add up to
180 degrees.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.380
And we could figure
out y right now.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.990
You could subtract 85 from both
sides and you'd get y is

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.100
equal to 95.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.480
And then we could figure out
x from y, because x is the

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.400
supplement of y.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.090
So then you could say x is
equal to 180 minus 95 and

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.850
you'd get 85.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.185
And that would be fine, it
didn't take you too long, C is

00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:06.840
the answer.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.710
But a slightly faster
way of saying it.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.460
OK, y plus 85 is equal to 180.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.930
And you also know that y
plus x is equal to 180.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.490
So clearly, x is equal to 85.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.600
If you add 85 to y, you
get 180, if you add x

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.720
to y you get 180.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.630
So x would be 85.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.930
That would be a slightly
faster way of

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.650
thinking about it.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.260
But either way is
fine if you're

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.220
not under time pressure.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.010
OK, problem 45.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.960
If the measure of an exterior
angle of a regular polygon.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.770
Regular polygon, so that
means that all of

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.950
the angles are congruent.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.980
Of a regular polygon is 120
degrees, how many sides does

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.230
the polygon have?

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.320
So this is the vertex in
question, let's say that's the

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.870
vertex of this polygon
we're thinking about.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.510
We want to measure its
exterior angles.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.240
So I'd extend one side
of the vertex.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.190
And they're saying that
that is 120 degrees.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.370
That tells me that the interior
angle at that vertex

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.250
is 60 degrees.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.910
It's the supplement to
the exterior angle.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.860
So what regular polygon
has all of its

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.970
sides equal to 60 degrees?

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.170
Well, the equilateral
triangle.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.890
Regular polygon, all
the angles and all

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.410
the sides are congruent.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.360
So an equilateral triangle
looking something like that

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.470
would do the trick.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.200
It's a regular polygon, all
the sides are the same.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.780
And its angles are
60, 60 and 60.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.020
So when they say how many sides
does the polygon have?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.510
It has three, it's a triangle.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.600
I'm out of time.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.740
I'll see you in the
next video.
