in what really has been we were
 

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.190
in what really has been we were
calculating over five years of work and

discussion on Saarinen's work and a very

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:50.980
discussion on Saarinen's work and a very
 

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.860
discussion on Saarinen's work and a very
systematic research project in fact that

systematic research project in fact that
 

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.250
systematic research project in fact that
I think you know it really is a kind of

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:56.260
I think you know it really is a kind of
 

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.690
I think you know it really is a kind of
unusual exercise in in the context of

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:00.700
unusual exercise in in the context of
 

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.020
unusual exercise in in the context of
traveling exhibitions and such that that

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.030
traveling exhibitions and such that that
 

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.120
traveling exhibitions and such that that
a research team would be brought

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.130
a research team would be brought
 

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.690
a research team would be brought
together across the Atlantic and and

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:09.700
together across the Atlantic and and
 

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.900
together across the Atlantic and and
work together to develop not just an

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:12.910
work together to develop not just an
 

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.910
work together to develop not just an
exhibition and a catalog but a really an

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920
exhibition and a catalog but a really an
 

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.500
exhibition and a catalog but a really an
interpretive framework a kind of

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:16.510
interpretive framework a kind of
 

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.050
interpretive framework a kind of
strategy way of thinking so so in fact I

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:19.060
strategy way of thinking so so in fact I
 

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.730
strategy way of thinking so so in fact I
hope that a leaf aspects of the

conversation that will have afterwards

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400
conversation that will have afterwards
 

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.609
conversation that will have afterwards
would reflect you know

00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619
would reflect you know
 

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:29.359
would reflect you know
the sort of knowledge and insights

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:29.369
the sort of knowledge and insights
 

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:34.239
the sort of knowledge and insights
accumulated over those those years so

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:34.249
accumulated over those those years so
 

00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:37.339

to refer to arches I sort of thought you

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160
to refer to arches I sort of thought you
 

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.309
to refer to arches I sort of thought you
know I realized that that it had been

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319
know I realized that that it had been
 

00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:45.259
know I realized that that it had been
about about five years it was actually

00:39:45.259 --> 00:39:45.269
about about five years it was actually
 

00:39:45.269 --> 00:39:47.779
about about five years it was actually
five years since I at least submitted

00:39:47.779 --> 00:39:47.789
five years since I at least submitted
 

00:39:47.789 --> 00:39:51.109
five years since I at least submitted
the final draft of the article that I

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119
the final draft of the article that I
 

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:54.289
the final draft of the article that I
wrote for the book that ever showed you

00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:54.299
wrote for the book that ever showed you

and so it sort of was the opportunity to

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:58.470
and so it sort of was the opportunity to
 

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:02.390
and so it sort of was the opportunity to
think to reflect really on the content

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400

and really arguments in
 

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:11.010
and really arguments in
in that piece and and and try to talk a

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:11.020
in that piece and and and try to talk a
 

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.860
in that piece and and and try to talk a
little bit about it but more about what

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:13.870
little bit about it but more about what
 

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.470
little bit about it but more about what
it doesn't say what I have since learned

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480
it doesn't say what I have since learned
 

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.900
it doesn't say what I have since learned
and or at least since felt it important

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:18.910
and or at least since felt it important
 

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.880
and or at least since felt it important

research so in that sense I first I want

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:27.370
research so in that sense I first I want

the things that we've kind of concluded
 

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.230
the things that we've kind of concluded
in a sense is that saarinen is remains

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240
in a sense is that saarinen is remains
 

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.180
in a sense is that saarinen is remains
an enigma I mean as an architect it's

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:39.190
an enigma I mean as an architect it's

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.050
be let's Ernie remain an enigma it's
more interesting that way and and in

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.060
more interesting that way and and in

it were framework to to suggest that

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:12.610
it were framework to to suggest that
 

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.870
it were framework to to suggest that
that we learned to think historically

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880
that we learned to think historically
 

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.180
that we learned to think historically
about such and such enigmas as are

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.190
about such and such enigmas as are
 

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.850
about such and such enigmas as are
presented by this work and what I mean

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:20.860
presented by this work and what I mean
 

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.020
presented by this work and what I mean
by that historically I don't mean that

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:22.030
by that historically I don't mean that
 

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.790
by that historically I don't mean that
like like you know citing it or copying

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800
like like you know citing it or copying
 

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.150
like like you know citing it or copying
it or

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160
it or
 

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.250
it or
or somehow using it its itself as a kind

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260
or somehow using it its itself as a kind
 

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.890
or somehow using it its itself as a kind
of resource for contemporary design I

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900
of resource for contemporary design I
 

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.549
of resource for contemporary design I
actually mean to think again about what

00:41:34.549 --> 00:41:34.559
actually mean to think again about what
 

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:36.950
actually mean to think again about what
it means to historic I work and a body

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960
it means to historic I work and a body
 

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.370
it means to historic I work and a body
of a body of work and it's architect and

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380
of a body of work and it's architect and
 

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.799
of a body of work and it's architect and
and so what I want to suggest first is

00:41:42.799 --> 00:41:42.809
and so what I want to suggest first is
 

00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:46.940
and so what I want to suggest first is
that in the case of saarinen it might

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:46.950
that in the case of saarinen it might
 

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.020
that in the case of saarinen it might
involve at least it has in my own

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:50.030
involve at least it has in my own
 

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:54.380
involve at least it has in my own
interest and work around his work a kind

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:54.390
interest and work around his work a kind
 

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.730
interest and work around his work a kind
of consideration of architecture

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740
of consideration of architecture

we can call a technical medium and i'll

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079
we can call a technical medium and i'll
 

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.809
we can call a technical medium and i'll
try to explain what i what i mean by

00:42:05.809 --> 00:42:05.819
try to explain what i what i mean by
 

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:10.160
try to explain what i what i mean by
that in the essay for the catalog I it

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.170
that in the essay for the catalog I it
 

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.390
that in the essay for the catalog I it
was sort of interesting to think about

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400
was sort of interesting to think about
 

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.579
was sort of interesting to think about
the materiality of that medium and it's

00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:13.589
the materiality of that medium and it's
 

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:15.430
the materiality of that medium and it's
literally sort of technical production

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440
literally sort of technical production
 

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.559
literally sort of technical production
and I'll show you a couple of slides

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:18.569
and I'll show you a couple of slides
 

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:22.940
and I'll show you a couple of slides
from that and the butt and then you know

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:22.950
from that and the butt and then you know
 

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.460
from that and the butt and then you know
maybe what can be a door I think I could

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:25.470
maybe what can be a door I think I could
 

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.150

00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359
say well the each building well I think
 

00:50:30.359 --> 00:50:33.050
say well the each building well I think
it's maybe better put that that each

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060
it's maybe better put that that each
 

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.780
it's maybe better put that that each
building in in the ensemble there was

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:35.790
building in in the ensemble there was
 

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:37.010
building in in the ensemble there was
supposed to be a sir there's meant to be

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020
supposed to be a sir there's meant to be
 

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.130
supposed to be a sir there's meant to be
a student union but that was built later

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.140
a student union but that was built later
 

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.540
a student union but that was built later
but by dipping another architect but

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:41.550
but by dipping another architect but
 

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.809
but by dipping another architect but
this is ensemble each one of them

00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:43.819
this is ensemble each one of them
 

00:50:43.819 --> 00:50:46.250
this is ensemble each one of them
resolves the contradiction in in a

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260
resolves the contradiction in in a
 

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.290
resolves the contradiction in in a
different way and I want to suggest in

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300
different way and I want to suggest in
 

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.490
different way and I want to suggest in
its capacity as technical medium and it

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500
its capacity as technical medium and it
 

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.140
its capacity as technical medium and it
does that by manipulating two materials

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.150
does that by manipulating two materials
 

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.470
does that by manipulating two materials
in together that that we don't always

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480
in together that that we don't always
 

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.240
in together that that we don't always
think of something and sometimes we do

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:02.250
think of something and sometimes we do
 

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.520
think of something and sometimes we do
but but in a sense these buildings are

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:04.530
but but in a sense these buildings are
 

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.280
but but in a sense these buildings are
formed around these materials

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:07.290
formed around these materials
 

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.510
formed around these materials
and those are the materials of light and

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520
and those are the materials of light and
 

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.810
and those are the materials of light and
sound and and so you know this is partly

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:12.820
sound and and so you know this is partly
 

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.250
sound and and so you know this is partly
what I mean by a kind of immaterial

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:14.260
what I mean by a kind of immaterial
 

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.230
what I mean by a kind of immaterial
materiality that it's exactly the

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240
materiality that it's exactly the
 

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.109
materiality that it's exactly the
manipulation of light and the

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119
manipulation of light and the
 

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:21.930
manipulation of light and the
manipulation of sound these material

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:21.940
manipulation of sound these material
 

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.720
manipulation of sound these material
processes that that much of the

and this is a study model when again

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:48.310
and this is a study model when again
 

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.190
and this is a study model when again
many study models the office was quite

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200
many study models the office was quite
 

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.510
many study models the office was quite
famous for that into to set up set up to

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520
famous for that into to set up set up to
 

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.900
famous for that into to set up set up to
study the the workings of the Interior

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:56.910
study the the workings of the Interior
 

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.970
study the the workings of the Interior
you see the acoustic panels and then

00:51:59.970 --> 00:51:59.980
you see the acoustic panels and then
 

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.599
you see the acoustic panels and then
inside another model the sort of focus

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:03.609
inside another model the sort of focus
 

00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:06.089
inside another model the sort of focus
on on this stage both of them involve

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:06.099
on on this stage both of them involve
 

00:52:06.099 --> 00:52:07.710
on on this stage both of them involve
the problem of focus which is a formal

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720
the problem of focus which is a formal
 

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.480
the problem of focus which is a formal
problem if you're using this kind of

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:09.490
problem if you're using this kind of
 

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:13.560
problem if you're using this kind of
geometry and and you'll see that that

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:13.570
geometry and and you'll see that that
 

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:14.880
geometry and and you'll see that that
also has to do the light here's the

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:14.890
also has to do the light here's the
 

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.890
also has to do the light here's the
photo the light is focused on the stage

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:16.900
photo the light is focused on the stage
 

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.130
photo the light is focused on the stage
as is this and the sound obviously is is

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:20.140
as is this and the sound obviously is is
 

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.920
as is this and the sound obviously is is
reflected back out

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:21.930
reflected back out
 

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.049
reflected back out
and so you know in that sense this is

00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059
and so you know in that sense this is
 

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:27.500
and so you know in that sense this is
this this interior is a kind of machine

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:27.510
this this interior is a kind of machine
 

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:30.470
this this interior is a kind of machine
for focusing for for paying attention

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480
for focusing for for paying attention
 

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.150
for focusing for for paying attention
what's happen like as is this interior

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160
what's happen like as is this interior
 

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.530
what's happen like as is this interior
but this is in a sense I'm much more

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540
but this is in a sense I'm much more
 

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.900
but this is in a sense I'm much more
sophisticated and subtle one a machine

what will try to somehow make it work
and I think that's that's at issue at

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:32.090
and I think that's that's at issue at
 

01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:33.910
and I think that's that's at issue at
many of these preservation cases I know

01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920
many of these preservation cases I know
 

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.950
many of these preservation cases I know
that there's a competition now for maybe

01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960
that there's a competition now for maybe
 

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.859
that there's a competition now for maybe
mark you are doing the same for yard

01:52:37.859 --> 01:52:37.869
mark you are doing the same for yard
 

01:52:37.869 --> 01:52:39.700
mark you are doing the same for yard
competition and it would be a huge

01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:39.710
competition and it would be a huge
 

01:52:39.710 --> 01:52:42.790
competition and it would be a huge
challenge to make it make make make the

01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800
challenge to make it make make make the
 

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:46.120
challenge to make it make make make the
park work for the city you know notice

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:46.130
park work for the city you know notice
 

01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.070
park work for the city you know notice
or icon for the city but actually as

01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080
or icon for the city but actually as
 

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.180
or icon for the city but actually as
something that is used and you know by

01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:52.190
something that is used and you know by
 

01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:54.040
something that is used and you know by
the cities and so it's it's it's a

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:54.050
the cities and so it's it's it's a
 

01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:57.700
the cities and so it's it's it's a
tricky tricky questions we saw kind of

01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:57.710
tricky tricky questions we saw kind of
 

01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:59.649
tricky tricky questions we saw kind of
images but you know so the truth you

01:52:59.649 --> 01:52:59.659
images but you know so the truth you
 

01:52:59.659 --> 01:53:01.330
images but you know so the truth you
know like they London embassy also that

01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:01.340
know like they London embassy also that
 

01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.910
know like they London embassy also that
stopped working for the for the client

01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920
stopped working for the for the client
 

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.530
stopped working for the for the client
then there was a huge discussion about

01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:05.540
then there was a huge discussion about
 

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:08.620
then there was a huge discussion about
whether that should be preserved so it's

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:08.630
whether that should be preserved so it's
 

01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.540
whether that should be preserved so it's
it's it's not an easy question just

01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:13.550
it's it's not an easy question just
 

01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:15.310
it's it's not an easy question just
going to briefly build on that I mean

01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320
going to briefly build on that I mean
 

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.270
going to briefly build on that I mean
there's only one had the physical

01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:16.280
there's only one had the physical
 

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.370
there's only one had the physical
preservation of the actual artifacts

01:53:18.370 --> 01:53:18.380
preservation of the actual artifacts
 

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.919
preservation of the actual artifacts
that we've been referring to on the

01:53:20.919 --> 01:53:20.929
that we've been referring to on the
 

01:53:20.929 --> 01:53:23.620
that we've been referring to on the
other hand in terms of relevance I mean

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:23.630
other hand in terms of relevance I mean
 

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.270
other hand in terms of relevance I mean
I do think that there's there's the

01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280
I do think that there's there's the
 

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.550
I do think that there's there's the
notion of saron ins legacy relative to a

01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560
notion of saron ins legacy relative to a
 

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.169
notion of saron ins legacy relative to a
whole series of issues that continue to

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:29.179
whole series of issues that continue to
 

01:53:29.179 --> 01:53:32.410
whole series of issues that continue to
kind of either plagued us today or that

01:53:32.410 --> 01:53:32.420
kind of either plagued us today or that
 

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.609
kind of either plagued us today or that
we have kind of the opportunity to

01:53:33.609 --> 01:53:33.619
we have kind of the opportunity to
 

01:53:33.619 --> 01:53:35.500
we have kind of the opportunity to
explore depending upon how one one looks

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:35.510
explore depending upon how one one looks
 

01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.970
explore depending upon how one one looks

and so I think it would be as a student

01:53:39.370 --> 01:53:39.380
and so I think it would be as a student
 

01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.440
and so I think it would be as a student
kind of useful to consider his

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:41.450
kind of useful to consider his
 

01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:42.850
kind of useful to consider his
relationship to the kind of technology

01:53:42.850 --> 01:53:42.860
relationship to the kind of technology
 

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:47.190

kind of experimentalism and and kind of

01:53:47.190 --> 01:53:47.200
kind of experimentalism and and kind of
 

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.240
kind of experimentalism and and kind of
techniques of materialization and

techniques of materialization and
 

01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:51.490
techniques of materialization and
fabrication which are kind of obviously

01:53:51.490 --> 01:53:51.500
fabrication which are kind of obviously
 

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:52.900

a kind of ongoing sort of obsession

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:52.910
a kind of ongoing sort of obsession
 

01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:55.450
a kind of ongoing sort of obsession
there's the kind of relationship to kind

01:53:55.450 --> 01:53:55.460
there's the kind of relationship to kind
 

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:56.890
there's the kind of relationship to kind
of notions of kind of program and the

01:53:56.890 --> 01:53:56.900
of notions of kind of program and the
 

01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.270
of notions of kind of program and the
kind of client and there's this curious

01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280
kind of client and there's this curious
 

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.070
kind of client and there's this curious
way in which sarin is able to kind of

01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080
way in which sarin is able to kind of
 

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.060
way in which sarin is able to kind of
operate within sort of very sort of

01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:03.070
operate within sort of very sort of
 

01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:05.260

circumstances and to kind of produce
architectures which on the one end can

01:54:09.250 --> 01:54:09.260
architectures which on the one end can
 

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:12.070
architectures which on the one end can
be seen as expressions of these you know

01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080
be seen as expressions of these you know
 

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:13.930
be seen as expressions of these you know
these sort of institutions and

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:13.940
these sort of institutions and
 

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.180
these sort of institutions and
organizations but at the other hand have

01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:16.190
organizations but at the other hand have
 

01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:18.310
organizations but at the other hand have
this kind of idiosyncratic and adding

01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320
this kind of idiosyncratic and adding
 

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.260
this kind of idiosyncratic and adding
enigmatic quality that we're all kind of

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:20.270
enigmatic quality that we're all kind of
 

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.730
enigmatic quality that we're all kind of
referring to and that's part of the kind

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:21.740
referring to and that's part of the kind
 

01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:24.130
referring to and that's part of the kind
of fascination so I think there's on the

01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:24.140
of fascination so I think there's on the
 

01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.840
of fascination so I think there's on the
one hand the physical artifacts of the

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:25.850
one hand the physical artifacts of the
 

01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:27.010
one hand the physical artifacts of the
architecture on the other hand there is

01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:27.020
architecture on the other hand there is
 

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.110
architecture on the other hand there is
being kind of look going to be on that

01:54:29.110 --> 01:54:29.120
being kind of look going to be on that

it at the ways in which they begin to
 

01:54:31.610 --> 01:54:34.180
it at the ways in which they begin to
kind of reveal certain approaches to

kind of reveal certain approaches to
 

01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:36.400
kind of reveal certain approaches to
trajectories that are still sort of

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:36.410
trajectories that are still sort of
 

01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:55.959
trajectories that are still sort of
present today
