00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500
All right.
Good morning all.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:17.166
Today we embark on another new
chapter in what we do.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:23.000
And the topic is going to be --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.304
We will talk about this thing
called an Operational Amplifier.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:51.608
Before I get into the lecture,
I want to point out a couple of

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:54.652
things.
One is that you are going to

00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:59.000
hear about two big words in
today's lecture.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.665
Two big and incredibly
important words.

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:08.163
And I want to mention those
words to you right now so that

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:12.504
when I come to them in lecture
you can say OK,

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:17.810
I better pay really close
attention, these are important

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.353
words.
All right.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:24.562
One of them is abstraction.
The second one is feedback.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:29.000
Two incredibly important
concepts.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.043
Abstraction,
you have been seeing a couple

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:36.126
times during this course,
once in the beginning where we

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.838
abstracted out Maxwell's
equations by focusing on a

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:44.366
smaller playground and simply
using KVL, KCL in place of those

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.445
equations.
A big abstraction.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:51.048
It turns out that almost all of
EECS is based upon abstractions

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.943
at various levels.
In the first lecture,

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:58.174
I also showed you the layer
upon layer of abstraction that

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:03.000
we built to be able to build
interesting systems.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.188
The second big thing is
feedback.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:11.867
And I am going to relate this
to anti-lock breaks in cars.

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:16.151
And so, you can wait and see
how we do that.

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.738
It's an incredibly important
concept.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:24.221
Before we dive into the
amplifier abstraction,

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:30.000
let me first talk about
something that you know.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.737
Start with something that you
know and then lead up into the

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:37.788
operational amplifier and its
circuits.

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:41.000
You know about the MOSFET
amplifier.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.821
The MOSFET amplifier that you
know about looked like this.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:59.000
It was based on a MOSFET.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.201
There was a VS supply.
There was a vI input,

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:14.826
a vO output and,
as I said, a VS supply.

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:22.471
So, this was a MOSFET circuit
that you've seen before.

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:30.980
One way of viewing this is that
this circuit has three major

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.263
ports.
This here is the input port

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:38.953
with voltage vI.
This here, between the drain

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:42.559
terminal and the ground,
is the output port.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:47.170
I take the output between the
drain terminal and ground.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.021
And, finally,
we have a third port,

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.878
which is this one.
It is called the power port.

00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:58.155
I apply VS between this
terminal here and the ground

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:02.201
terminal.
And that gives us the power

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.891
port.
This device here was a three

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:08.070
port device.
Input port or control port,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.961
output port and a power port.
And so we looked at the circuit

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.141
and did a whole bunch of
analyses of it.

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:20.461
Then what I can do at this
point, now that you've seen

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:24.375
this, it's often times
interesting to think about

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:30.000
abstracting this out into some
kind of a building block.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.588
Much like in software,
you write a procedure and you

00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:37.529
abstract out the internal
details of the procedure in the

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.118
procedure declaration and in the
call that you make.

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:44.355
In the same way,
we can take this little device

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:49.000
here and abstract that out into
the following abstraction.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We could abstract that out as a
device that looks like this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.790
I have my input port,
I have my output port and I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.873
have my power port.
So, I can apply VS here.

00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:25.521
Notice that I've taken these
six terminals here,

00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:30.473
one, two, three,
four, five and six,

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:37.011
and put a box around it.
And just exposed the terminals

00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:39.558
to you.
And I need to tell you a little

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:43.312
bit more about the internal
properties, but suffice it to

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:46.865
say that you can begin working
with this little block.

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:51.089
An even simpler version of this
for many applications might just

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.837
look like this,
vI and vO where there is a

00:05:53.837 --> 00:05:57.592
ground that is shared among them
that is implicit in this

00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:01.299
picture.
And vI and vO can simply be the

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:05.526
node voltages at these nodes.
This is a progressively more

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:08.566
abstract representation of this
amplifier.

00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:11.162
What we can do is,
provided we know,

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.870
we can abstract out the
relevant properties of this

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.098
block and expose them outside.
And the relevant properties

00:06:19.098 --> 00:06:22.657
might well be that,
let's say here the properties

00:06:22.657 --> 00:06:27.181
may be that I in is always zero.
I can also express to you the

00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:33.406
gain of this amplifier.
I may also be able to tell you

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:37.722
the Thevenin equivalent for the
output.

00:06:37.722 --> 00:06:44.763
There are some properties that
I can give you that will let you

00:06:44.763 --> 00:06:48.624
use this building block
abstractly.

00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:55.097
Today, what we will do is
introduce a powerful abstraction

00:06:55.097 --> 00:07:01.116
of a type of amplifier.
This is called the operational

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:09.287
amplifier or "op amp" for short.
What I am going to do is give

00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:15.748
you a slightly more involved
building block than the one I

00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:21.530
have shown you there.
But suffice it to say that the

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.218
idea is going to be the same.
This building block looks like

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:31.732
this.
This building block has an

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:37.509
input port.
This building block also has a

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:43.124
port in which to connect power
or the power port.

00:07:43.124 --> 00:07:47.686
And the way I am going to
connect power,

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:52.716
I am going to connect a plus VS
supply here.

00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:56.694
That is going to be my ground
node.

00:07:56.694 --> 00:08:03.128
And I am going to connect a
minus VS supply to this node

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:08.458
here.
So, these voltages are both VS.

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:14.818
I want to apply a plus VS here
and a negative VS out here.

00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:21.066
And I am going to take the
output between the ground node

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:27.314
and the output node of the
operational amplifier and call

00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:32.000
that a vO.
This is the output port.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.754
So, input port and output port
and a power port.

00:08:35.754 --> 00:08:39.909
Think of this as a pattern
where I have an input port

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.465
across which I connect the
input.

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:46.619
I have a power port across
which I connect a plus VS,

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:49.975
minus VS supply,
and then I take the output

00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:54.369
terminal and take a ground
terminal, which is defined by

00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:58.683
external components of my
circuitry, and use this as my

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:02.946
reference node.
Remember ground is just a

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:06.216
reference node.
I am going to use this as a

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:09.097
reference node.
These two are equal in

00:09:09.097 --> 00:09:11.978
magnitude.
And take this as my output.

00:09:11.978 --> 00:09:16.104
And when I do something like
this, I can build an even

00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:20.776
simpler, so this is an abstract
differential input amplifier.

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:23.968
In other words,
this amplifier is going to

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.849
amplify whatever I apply at the
input.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.897
A slightly more abstract
representation of this looks

00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:34.863
like this.
vOUT and plus/minus vIN.

00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:38.978
This is a slightly more
abstract representation where,

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.937
remember, we are going to draw
this again and again,

00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:46.354
maybe at least 38 or 39 times
in this course.

00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:49.149
And, remember,
each time you draw it,

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:52.642
remember that there is an
implicit power port,

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:58.000
a plus/minus supply that is
connected which we don't show.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.424
And I remember when I first
learned about it a long time ago

00:10:02.424 --> 00:10:05.200
there was a confusion in me
initially.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.950
How does this work?
Where is the power coming from?

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.075
Just remember that power comes
from a plus/minus supply,

00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:16.600
and we just don't show that in
this abstraction.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.200
Now, the details,
a lot of details are in Chapter

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.100
16 of your course notes.
That's the reading for that.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.674
The other thing is that there
are some other key properties of

00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:35.043
this amplifier.
And let me discuss those very

00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:37.971
quickly.
First of all,

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:44.105
I can draw a circuit model for
the amplifier.

00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:52.750
Make some room for myself here.
And this is a circuit model for

00:10:52.750 --> 00:11:00.000
what we call the ideal
operational amplifier.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.720
And the circuit model is going
to look like this.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.139
This is an abstract device.
And, in terms of analyzing how

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:12.248
this behaves in a circuit,
I am going to show you this

00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:15.193
abstract circuit that looks as
follows.

00:11:15.193 --> 00:11:19.147
Some input v is applied at
these two terminals here.

00:11:19.147 --> 00:11:23.565
And this terminal is called my
v plus terminal and this is

00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:27.829
called my v minus terminal,
so this corresponds to these

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:32.010
two terminals.
I am telling you that the

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.916
current going in is going to be
zero, so i plus is going to be

00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:39.812
zero and i minus is going to be
zero.

00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:44.638
i plus is the current in here
and i minus is the current into

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:48.498
the v minus terminal,
and both these currents are

00:11:48.498 --> 00:11:51.394
going to be zero in this device
here.

00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:54.369
The output is going to look
like this.

00:11:54.369 --> 00:12:00.000
Let me just call it vOUT to be
consistent with this here.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.528
And taken with ground as my
reference.

00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:07.247
The output is simply Av.
In other words,

00:12:07.247 --> 00:12:12.873
what I am doing is I am going
to model this as a device that

00:12:12.873 --> 00:12:16.306
has a dependent source at its
output.

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:22.028
And the dependent source here
is a voltage controlled voltage

00:12:22.028 --> 00:12:25.079
source.
It is a dependent source,

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:30.229
it is a voltage controlled
voltage source such that the

00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:37.000
output voltage is A times the
voltage v across its input.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.067
This is actually very simple.
Think of these three terminals

00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:46.447
I have shown you here.
I applied input across these.

00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:51.257
And the output is going to be A
times whatever I applied.

00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:54.607
And A is going to tend towards
infinity.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:59.159
A is going to be huge.
And specific values for A might

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:05.000
be a hundred thousand or a
million or things of that sort.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.411
Huge A in this abstract
amplifier.

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:15.962
In addition to that,
the other properties are that

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:21.978
it is going to have infinite
input resistance.

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:30.000
That means looking in this
looks like an open circuit.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.543
The fact that this is open here
implies the infinite input

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:40.892
resistance across this port.
What about the output here?

00:13:40.892 --> 00:13:44.199
Remember, this is a voltage
source.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:49.645
And we have a zero output
resistance, which means that no

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:55.286
matter how the load affects
this, as I apply a load this is

00:13:55.286 --> 00:14:01.122
going to behave like an ideal
voltage source and keep holding

00:14:01.122 --> 00:14:06.179
the voltage constant based on
whatever the function I

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:10.814
establish here.
And A is virtually infinite.

00:14:10.814 --> 00:14:14.571
Let me pause there for a few
seconds and just dwell on this

00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:17.616
so you just understand what the
basic device is.

00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:20.856
Following this basic
definition, I am just going to

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:23.577
build a whole bunch of fun
little circuits.

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:26.363
The analysis will be pretty
straightforward,

00:14:26.363 --> 00:14:30.056
but this is a big conceptual
leap here where there is some

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:33.555
circuitry inside.
Containing resistors,

00:14:33.555 --> 00:14:36.518
MOSFETs, a whole bunch of stuff
in there.

00:14:36.518 --> 00:14:39.333
I am not telling you what is
inside it.

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:42.666
Much like I could build an
abstract amplifier,

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:46.740
I could put an abstract box
around the amplifier you saw

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.444
earlier, I want to put a box
around some circuitry.

00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:53.555
I am not telling you what the
circuitry is.

00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:57.555
And, if you are curious,
you should look at page 581 of

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:02.718
your course notes.
There is an example solved.

00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:07.046
The example is for a
differential amplifier.

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:11.174
This is the small signal
analysis chapter.

00:15:11.174 --> 00:15:17.114
That differential amplifier
that's solved in that example is

00:15:17.114 --> 00:15:23.053
usually the first stage in an
operational amplifier circuit.

00:15:23.053 --> 00:15:30.000
That differential amplifier is
the first stage at the input.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.457
And that differential
amplifier, as the name implies,

00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:39.428
amplifies not a single voltage
but amplifies a differential

00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:42.514
voltage.
Note that this guy amplifies

00:15:42.514 --> 00:15:46.799
the voltage difference between
these two terminals.

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:50.485
That's v here.
And v is simply the same as v

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:54.342
plus minus v minus.
It's the node voltage here

00:15:54.342 --> 00:16:00.000
minus the node voltage here.
That is what's amplified.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.482
It amplifies a difference.
Therefore, it is called a

00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:06.759
difference amplifier or a
differential amplifier.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:10.310
And so that input stage is what
is inside the op amp.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.997
It's got a bunch of other
circuitry like level shifters

00:16:13.997 --> 00:16:16.729
and so on.
And at the output it has got a

00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:18.777
buffer.
At at the output it has

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:23.147
something that is reminiscent of
the source follower circuit that

00:16:23.147 --> 00:16:26.561
you learned about in
recitations, solved an example

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:31.000
in the course notes and in your
homework as well.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.374
And you solved a variant of the
source follower on your quiz as

00:16:35.374 --> 00:16:38.832
well in problem two.
So, a circuit that looks like

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:42.430
that appears at the output.
Remember, for the source

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.664
follower, the resistance looking
in from the output was very,

00:16:46.664 --> 00:16:49.204
very small.
You have seen some of the

00:16:49.204 --> 00:16:53.226
pieces that go inside the
amplifier, but we will deal with

00:16:53.226 --> 00:16:57.318
this as a building block and
simply represent it using this

00:16:57.318 --> 00:17:02.021
abstract little circuit.
To dwell on this a little

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:06.954
longer, this little device here
is the workhorse of the analog

00:17:06.954 --> 00:17:10.026
industry.
Much like your primitive gate

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:14.070
abstraction, your inverter and
NAND gate and so on,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.598
much as your primitive inverter
or NAND gate was from the

00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:21.428
foundations of the digital
industry.

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:25.633
Remember we learned how to
build this little abstract

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:30.000
device called a NAND gate or an
inverter?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.571
We noticed that those form the
foundations of very complicated

00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:38.018
microprocessors.
Those were the building blocks

00:17:38.018 --> 00:17:41.015
of the digital industry.
In the same way,

00:17:41.015 --> 00:17:45.286
this little beast here is the
building block of the analog

00:17:45.286 --> 00:17:47.984
industry.
Just to give you an analogy

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.206
from software,
think of this abstract little

00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:55.927
device as a library routine from
a library of functions when you

00:17:55.927 --> 00:18:01.546
program in C++ or whatever.
Can someone give me an example

00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:06.724
of an incredibly popular routine
that we use all the time that

00:18:06.724 --> 00:18:11.137
may be called the workhorse of
the software industry?

00:18:11.137 --> 00:18:13.005
Pardon?
An abstraction,

00:18:13.005 --> 00:18:17.419
an abstract procedure.
One example might be something

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:21.153
like a printf.
Printf is an abstract name for

00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:25.228
a procedure that goes and does
something for you.

00:18:25.228 --> 00:18:31.000
It is amazing how we take the
lowly printf for granted.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.116
I stick my printf into my
program, it includes the

00:18:34.116 --> 00:18:37.296
standard IO library and it goes
and prints a value.

00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:40.285
You won't believe how
complicated the printf is.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:43.782
As you go into learning more
advanced software subjects,

00:18:43.782 --> 00:18:46.199
implementing the printf is a
nightmare.

00:18:46.199 --> 00:18:48.997
It is horrendously complicated.
Just imagine.

00:18:48.997 --> 00:18:52.750
You give it a string and it has
to go and print that on your

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.675
terminal or on your Windows
system or whatever.

00:18:55.675 --> 00:19:00.000
Think of the complicated steps
it has to go through.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.844
But, as far as you're
concerned, it's simple.

00:19:02.844 --> 00:19:05.431
Just print out something and
you're done.

00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:08.211
The same way.
Think of this as the printf of

00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:10.797
the analog business.
It is really simple,

00:19:10.797 --> 00:19:13.965
and the analysis is going to be
incredibly simple,

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:17.068
it will be mind-bogglingly
simple, but inside it,

00:19:17.068 --> 00:19:19.396
heavens forbid if you look
inside it.

00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:22.306
Tell you what,
go into to S-T-D-I-O dot in one

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:25.668
of the library routines and just
pore through printf.

00:19:25.668 --> 00:19:30.000
The world's worst horrendous
macros are in there.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.466
I mean it is just nasty.
The same way inside the op amp,

00:19:33.466 --> 00:19:35.924
it is nasty.
You don't want to go there.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.886
Much like in your C programming
in your classes,

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:42.605
you were able to use printf
without fully knowing how it was

00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:45.189
implemented.
Probably some MIT god or some

00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:48.907
key graduate implemented it,
but once it was implemented you

00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:52.373
just used it based on simple
abstract rules as to how it

00:19:52.373 --> 00:19:54.642
behaved.
You didn't have to know what

00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:57.478
was inside it to use it.
The same way with the

00:19:57.478 --> 00:20:02.098
operational amplifier.
So, just think of printf when

00:20:02.098 --> 00:20:06.439
you see this and just imagine
how simple it is going to be to

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:09.116
use it.
You may think that I spend way

00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:12.155
too much time,
ten minutes dwelling on this

00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:15.483
abstract concept,
but I like to dwell on things

00:20:15.483 --> 00:20:18.160
that I think are incredibly
important.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.343
The concept of abstraction is
very important.

00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:25.395
And it's not just in software.
The concept of abstraction

00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:30.098
pervades all of EECS.
And if I were to give you a

00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:34.838
project to say go and ask every
professor what is the one word

00:20:34.838 --> 00:20:38.024
that you think best describes
all of EECS?

00:20:38.024 --> 00:20:41.754
Just pick one word.
Go ask every single professor

00:20:41.754 --> 00:20:44.163
you know.
What is a single word?

00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:48.670
If you were to characterize all
of EECS with just one word,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.789
what might that word be?
In my mind, it is the A word,

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:54.887
abstraction.
It is all over.

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:58.695
If you do a grep on all the
words used by all your

00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:03.202
professors in your four years
here, I promise you the first

00:21:03.202 --> 00:21:08.108
one will be know.
And the second one will be

00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:10.135
abstraction.
Check it out.

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:13.216
See if what I am saying is true
or not.

00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:17.756
It is all over the place.
In 6.001, how many times do you

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:21.324
think the word abstraction was
used in 6.001?

00:21:21.324 --> 00:21:25.135
It's all over the map.
It's the A word all over.

00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:30.243
Imagine your shock when you see
it being used in 002 because the

00:21:30.243 --> 00:21:35.235
same concept applies.
We build more complicated

00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:40.241
systems by abstracting out the
details of lesser objects,

00:21:40.241 --> 00:21:45.427
and then using those to build
the more complicated systems.

00:21:45.427 --> 00:21:50.344
Abstraction is a very powerful
mechanism of dealing with

00:21:50.344 --> 00:21:54.009
complexity.
Next step is how do I go about

00:21:54.009 --> 00:21:58.301
using the op amp?
Let me show you how it looks on

00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:03.825
a scope.
What I am going to do is apply

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:09.563
input to the op amp,
I am going to look at the

00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:17.469
output, place the resistor RL to
ground and look at the output.

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:25.375
And here I am going to apply a
plus VS and out here a minus VS.

00:22:25.375 --> 00:22:32.771
Again, remember that a plus VS
simply looks like this and a

00:22:32.771 --> 00:22:40.735
minus VS simply looks like this.
It's just an inverted VS

00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:45.979
applied here so I get a minus VS
at this input.

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:50.994
First of all,
what I would like to do is as I

00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:57.036
change vIN, I am going to plot
for you how vOUT looks.

00:22:57.036 --> 00:23:03.131
vIN and this is vO.
I am going to plot vIN in terms

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:08.888
of microvolts and vO in volts.
vIN is going to have a very

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:14.646
very small, the scale is going
to be in microvolts because

00:23:14.646 --> 00:23:17.979
remember the gain of this is
huge.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:21.717
It's on the order of ten to the
sixth.

00:23:21.717 --> 00:23:25.757
It's huge.
Small changes in vIN are going

00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:32.906
to cause massive changes in vO.
I have a very fine scale on the

00:23:32.906 --> 00:23:36.187
X axis.
What is going to happen if I

00:23:36.187 --> 00:23:39.843
somehow magically make vIN
exactly zero?

00:23:39.843 --> 00:23:45.562
If I short these two terminals,
if this was a completely ideal

00:23:45.562 --> 00:23:50.718
op amp, which it never is,
if it's a completely ideal op

00:23:50.718 --> 00:23:53.906
amp, then my output should be
zero.

00:23:53.906 --> 00:24:00.000
As I increase my vIN the output
should be A times vIN.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.720
For some small value of vIN,
small v, let's say one

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.697
microvolt, the output should be
one volt.

00:24:06.697 --> 00:24:10.790
A is a constant so this would
look like a straight line.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.734
And let's say my supply
voltages are 12 volts minus 12

00:24:14.734 --> 00:24:19.051
volts, if this were an ideal
amplifier and I didn't have to

00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:23.069
worry about the supply,
this would just go on extending

00:24:23.069 --> 00:24:25.525
forever.
But I have a plus 12 volt

00:24:25.525 --> 00:24:27.981
supply and a minus 12 volt
supply.

00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:32.000
My output cannot go past those
limits.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.960
And so, therefore,
my output kind of flattens out

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.920
at these two points.
And it is called hitting the

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.807
rails.
Output goes up and you hear a

00:24:42.807 --> 00:24:45.529
thunk sound and you hit the
rails.

00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:49.077
When you play with op amps in
your next lab,

00:24:49.077 --> 00:24:53.202
if you listen really,
really carefully you may hear

00:24:53.202 --> 00:24:55.347
it.
So, this saturates out.

00:24:55.347 --> 00:24:59.059
Not surprisingly,
this region where the output

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:05.000
saturates at the supply is
called the saturation region.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.512
Remember, don't confuse it
with-- It's not the same as your

00:25:09.512 --> 00:25:13.403
saturation in the MOSFET.
It is a totally different

00:25:13.403 --> 00:25:16.282
thing.
It is just happenstance that we

00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:20.250
call this saturation.
And if you would like to think

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.063
about it, you can think of it as
the thunk region.

00:25:24.063 --> 00:25:27.876
That's probably more
appropriate to distinguish it

00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:32.000
from the saturation region in
the MOSFET.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.418
And, not surprisingly,
this one is called the active

00:25:36.418 --> 00:25:39.537
region.
And it is in this region that

00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:43.610
we use the op amp.
Here it has hit the rails and

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.288
is kind of dangling out there.
It's not much use to us.

00:25:48.288 --> 00:25:53.660
It's in this active region that
we use it because this is where

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.389
the gain is seen.
Now, it turns out that this is

00:25:58.389 --> 00:26:01.893
a very high gain device.
It is very skittish.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:05.159
This gain is kind of a really
funny thing.

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:08.026
It's dependent on a bunch of
factors.

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:10.814
This could be temperature
dependent.

00:26:10.814 --> 00:26:15.353
This gain here and this curve
is just completely skittish.

00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:20.292
It could depend on temperature.
It could depend on time of day.

00:26:20.292 --> 00:26:24.672
It could depend on what
medication this amplifier is on.

00:26:24.672 --> 00:26:27.380
It could depend on its mood
swings.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.000
Who knows what?
This is kind of unstable.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.414
And A in particular is highly
unstable.

00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:36.828
It is going to be big,
that's for sure,

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:40.703
but it could be ten to the six,
on a rainy day it might be two

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:43.943
times ten to the six.
If it feeling sleepy it may be

00:26:43.943 --> 00:26:46.039
point five times ten to the
sixth.

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:48.136
It is big but I cannot rely on
it.

00:26:48.136 --> 00:26:51.694
Let me show you an example.
I want to show you this curve

00:26:51.694 --> 00:26:54.680
for this MOSFET,
apply an input and plotting the

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.967
output.
What I will do is take a look

00:26:56.967 --> 00:27:00.830
at this curve.
Then what I am going to do is

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.429
use a heat gun to heat the op
amp and you are going to see

00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:07.775
this vary all over the map.
If you still remember last

00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:11.247
week, some of you may remember
that from some place in a

00:27:11.247 --> 00:27:15.035
similar situation where the gm
for the MOSFETs you were given

00:27:15.035 --> 00:27:18.381
was also dependent on
temperature and stuff like that.

00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:22.232
It is a very common occurrence.
And that is certainly the case

00:27:22.232 --> 00:27:24.000
for the MOSFET.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.284
Let's apply input.
Let's do this.

00:27:34.284 --> 00:27:38.493
This is vIN versus vOUT for the
amplifier.

00:27:38.493 --> 00:27:44.344
Notice that this is plus 12
volts, this is minus 12 volts.

00:27:44.344 --> 00:27:47.834
It is about two volts per
division.

00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:52.145
This axis here is in
microvolts, I believe.

00:27:52.145 --> 00:27:57.586
For a very small change,
for a few tens of microvolts,

00:27:57.586 --> 00:28:03.563
I have an incredibly high gain.
Notice that this has an

00:28:03.563 --> 00:28:07.300
incredibly high gain here.
The gain is the slope of this

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.106
line, almost a vertical line.
What I am going to do next,

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.368
is to have some fun,
is I am going to heat the op

00:28:14.368 --> 00:28:16.611
amp.
To show you that A is kind of

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:20.553
really skittish and also the
fact that it doesn't quite hit

00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:24.766
zero, it does all kinds of weird
things, I am going to heat the

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:27.213
op amp.
And then let's take a look at

00:28:27.213 --> 00:28:30.000
how that curve fluctuates.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.371
What you saw there was that the
op amp began to behave really

00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:07.796
weirdly as I heated it.
Instead of doing this it

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:11.876
sometimes did this really
weirdly, like getting an offset

00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:15.811
from the center and so on.
And it does a bunch of other

00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.653
weird things,
but we won't go into those

00:29:18.653 --> 00:29:21.130
details.
It's not relevant for this

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.826
course.
But the point is that the gain

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:29.000
and the offset at the input are
dependent on temperature.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.723
And we look for ways to make it
less dependent on temperature.

00:29:33.723 --> 00:29:37.053
As the next step,
what I would like to do is

00:29:37.053 --> 00:29:40.382
build a circuit.
This is model equivalent of

00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:44.641
your Hello World program.
We are going to use the printf

00:29:44.641 --> 00:29:47.661
and build a small program on the
printf.

00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:51.920
You don't have to worry about
how printf is implemented,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.488
just that we can build very
highly interesting circuits with

00:29:56.488 --> 00:30:00.747
this horrendously complicated
function based on a simple

00:30:00.747 --> 00:30:08.545
abstraction of the device.
The circuit that we will build

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:14.000
is called a noninverting
amplifier.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.658
From now on,
I am not going to show you the

00:30:22.658 --> 00:30:25.189
plus/minus VS.
I am not going to show the

00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:28.481
power port, but it is in there.
It's hidden under the

00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:31.527
abstraction layer.
This is my op amp.

00:30:31.527 --> 00:30:35.345
And I am going to build the
following circuit.

00:30:35.345 --> 00:30:38.739
This is my v plus and this is
my v minus.

00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:43.745
What I am going to do is for
the v plus I shall apply a vIN.

00:30:43.745 --> 00:30:47.563
Let me talk a little bit about
ground as well.

00:30:47.563 --> 00:30:52.739
Ground is commonly taken as the
point at which I connect my VS

00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:58.000
and minus VS supply.
It is kind of at the midpoint.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.248
And if VS and minus VS are very
carefully tuned then the output

00:31:03.248 --> 00:31:08.582
is also going to be at that same
ground reference when the input

00:31:08.582 --> 00:31:11.629
is zero.
So, the ground is defined as

00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:16.201
the point at which I connect my
plus/minus VS supplies.

00:31:16.201 --> 00:31:20.518
I apply my vIN out here.
Then what I am going to do,

00:31:20.518 --> 00:31:24.835
here is my output vO.
I am going to have a resistive

00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:30.000
divider to ground here and label
these R1 and R2.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.142
And what I am going to do here
is feed this back to the input,

00:31:36.142 --> 00:31:40.673
to the v minus input.
I am going to sample the

00:31:40.673 --> 00:31:44.298
voltage here and feed that into
here.

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:49.836
So, this is my abstract model
and this is my Hello World

00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:53.260
program.
What we are going to do is

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.000
simply analyze how this little
program behaves.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.858
So, my equivalent circuit
model.

00:32:00.858 --> 00:32:03.976
The way to analyze these is
after one or two of these

00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:07.454
examples, you will be able to
directly analyze this just by

00:32:07.454 --> 00:32:09.133
looking at it,
by inspection.

00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:11.531
But, much as we did for the
other pieces,

00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:14.829
let me grunge through drawing
the equivalent circuit and

00:32:14.829 --> 00:32:18.187
grinding through the analysis,
and then show you the much

00:32:18.187 --> 00:32:20.466
simpler way of doing it.
And even here,

00:32:20.466 --> 00:32:23.464
even with this grinding
analysis, it is going to be

00:32:23.464 --> 00:32:26.762
pretty simple in any case.
So, I will replace the op amp

00:32:26.762 --> 00:32:30.000
with its equivalent circuit
model.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Its equivalent circuit was v
plus, v minus.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.429
So, that was the equivalent
circuit model of the operational

00:32:49.429 --> 00:32:53.754
amplifier, just this piece.
I draw that for you.

00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:59.000
Then what I am going to do is I
connect my v in here.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.347
And, remember,
I have an R1,

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:09.291
R2 resistive divider here.
And this one gets connected to

00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:14.996
this terminal there.
I also know that i plus is

00:33:14.996 --> 00:33:18.963
zero.
I also know that i minus is

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:22.435
zero.
All I've done is simply

00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:30.000
replaced the amplifier with its
equivalent circuit.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.368
Let's go ahead and analyze that
circuit now.

00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:38.330
Let's go ahead and analyze that
circuit.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.799
And it's going to be pretty
simple, actually.

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:48.387
What I am going to show you is
the hard way of doing it.

00:33:48.387 --> 00:33:54.482
I will show you a much easier
way, but the hard way itself is

00:33:54.482 --> 00:33:59.460
pathetically easy.
What I want to do is find vO in

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:04.194
terms of vIN.
And there will be a bunch of

00:34:04.194 --> 00:34:08.270
other factors thrown in,
including things like R1 and

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.190
R2, A and stuff like that.
Let's go and analyze it.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:16.657
vO, let's look at that circuit.
By the way, let me take 30

00:34:16.657 --> 00:34:20.263
seconds and make a little speech
at this point.

00:34:20.263 --> 00:34:24.653
When you see circuits like
this, and I saw this happen in

00:34:24.653 --> 00:34:27.239
quiz two as well,
for some reason,

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:31.472
when you see a new kind of
circuit, don't completely go

00:34:31.472 --> 00:34:36.777
berserk or freeze or whatever.
There is just no reason to.

00:34:36.777 --> 00:34:39.871
You know the node method.
The node method is the

00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:43.426
workhorse of our business.
When in doubt apply the node

00:34:43.426 --> 00:34:45.203
method.
It will simply work.

00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:47.047
Don't freeze.
Don't think oh,

00:34:47.047 --> 00:34:50.338
man, I need to apply a pattern
that I know already.

00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.379
I must have seen this
somewhere.

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:56.000
When in doubt boom,
apply the node method.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.100
This circuit here,
all I have here is one unknown

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.688
node voltage.
I know the voltage of v plus,

00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:06.422
I need to compute the voltage
vO.

00:35:06.422 --> 00:35:10.437
There are two unknowns,
vO is an unknown and the

00:35:10.437 --> 00:35:14.025
voltage here at v minus is
another unknown.

00:35:14.025 --> 00:35:18.979
This is a very simple circuit
involving a dependent voltage

00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:23.849
controlled voltage source,
and you need to find out vO and

00:35:23.849 --> 00:35:27.608
v minus using the node method.
Just apply it.

00:35:27.608 --> 00:35:31.174
It's simple.
Don't freeze.

00:35:31.174 --> 00:35:36.688
Just look at it and say I can
do it and apply the node method.

00:35:36.688 --> 00:35:40.122
It will simply work.
So, let's do that.

00:35:40.122 --> 00:35:45.183
What I can do here is vO is A
times v plus minus v minus.

00:35:45.183 --> 00:35:50.335
This is actually really simple.
And then, if I take v plus

00:35:50.335 --> 00:35:55.486
here, I know v plus is simply
vIN so I will just make that

00:35:55.486 --> 00:36:01.000
substitution right away.
So, v plus is simply vIN.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:10.000
What is v minus?
v minus here is vO --

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.956
What is v plus?
I'm sorry, v minus.

00:36:27.956 --> 00:36:33.000
v minus is simply the voltage
that is between R1 and R2.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.485
Notice that no current flows in
to the v minus node.

00:36:37.485 --> 00:36:42.674
There is no current flowing in.
Voltage at v minus is simply

00:36:42.674 --> 00:36:46.368
the voltage given by the
resistive divider,

00:36:46.368 --> 00:36:50.061
which is vO times R2 divided by
R1 plus R2.

00:36:50.061 --> 00:36:52.876
Stare at that for another
second.

00:36:52.876 --> 00:36:58.241
The voltage at this node here
is simply given by the resistive

00:36:58.241 --> 00:37:02.405
divider.
Because no current is flowing

00:37:02.405 --> 00:37:06.469
in this direction.
And no current flows in because

00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:10.864
I am telling you there is no
current there based on my

00:37:10.864 --> 00:37:14.099
abstraction.
I am telling you i minus is

00:37:14.099 --> 00:37:16.670
zero.
That voltage is simply the

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.407
voltage at this resistive
divider.

00:37:19.407 --> 00:37:23.803
And so I can simplify it
further and write this as vO.

00:37:23.803 --> 00:37:28.696
So I get, there is a one here.
And I move this thing over to

00:37:28.696 --> 00:37:35.000
this side so I get one plus A
times R2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.812
And that is equal to AvIN.
And simplifying it some more,

00:37:42.812 --> 00:37:51.619
I get vO is AvIN divided by one
plus AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:37:51.619 --> 00:38:00.000
Notice how simple this is,
and this is the hard method.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.013
All I have done is analyze the
circuit using the basic circuit

00:38:05.013 --> 00:38:09.616
analysis principle that you
learned the first week of the

00:38:09.616 --> 00:38:12.657
course, and I have the output
for you.

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:17.095
I just noted very carefully
what the relationships were

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:20.958
between the various elements in
the abstraction.

00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:25.232
Notice here that I am told that
A is extremely large.

00:38:25.232 --> 00:38:30.000
A is on the order of ten to the
six and so on.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.864
And suppose it is the case
that, let me write that down

00:38:36.864 --> 00:38:40.805
again.
vO is AvIN, one plus AR2,

00:38:40.805 --> 00:38:44.872
R2.
Suppose R1 and R2 are more or

00:38:44.872 --> 00:38:52.372
less comparable and A is ten to
the six, it's a huge number,

00:38:52.372 --> 00:39:00.000
so this whole number is much,
much greater than one.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.956
If it is much huger than one,
what I can do is I can then

00:39:06.956 --> 00:39:13.416
write this as follows.
I can say that this is more or

00:39:13.416 --> 00:39:20.248
less equal to AvIN divided by
AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:39:20.248 --> 00:39:26.211
I am ignoring the one here.
As soon as I do that,

00:39:26.211 --> 00:39:34.037
notice I can cancel out A and I
get vO to be approximately equal

00:39:34.037 --> 00:39:40.000
to vIN times R1 plus R2 divided
by R2.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.210
Notice now that when the gain
is very large the output is a

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:49.433
function of the input multiplied
by some number.

00:39:49.433 --> 00:39:54.644
The beauty of this thing here
is that when A is very large,

00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:59.675
or this expression is very
large, A cancels out and there

00:39:59.675 --> 00:40:06.120
is no A in this relationship.
This means that even though the

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.053
basic amplifier was very
skittish, the output here

00:40:11.053 --> 00:40:16.993
relates to the input based on
components that I have control

00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:20.516
over.
These are soldiers in my army.

00:40:20.516 --> 00:40:25.147
I control them.
So, to give you a sense of some

00:40:25.147 --> 00:40:29.375
numbers here,
suppose A was ten to the six.

00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:35.770
And I choose R1 to be 9R.
And R to be some R.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:44.666
Then vO is ten to the sixth vIN
divided by one plus ten to the

00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:52.979
six R divided by 9R plus R.
So, that is ten to the six vIN

00:40:52.979 --> 00:41:01.000
divided by one plus ten to the
six divided by ten.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.229
All right.
If I ignore the one here,

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:11.029
the ten to the six and ten to
the six cancel out,

00:41:11.029 --> 00:41:17.312
this ends up giving me 10vIN.
So, I get a really nice

00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:23.958
amplifier whose output is simply
ten times the input and

00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:30.000
determined solely by some
resistor values.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.565
Let me show you another quick
demo this time and show you the

00:41:34.565 --> 00:41:37.913
amplifier again,
but with resistors connected

00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:41.032
like that.
And then I show you that I want

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:45.521
to heat the amplifier to the
wazoo, the op amp to the wazoo,

00:41:45.521 --> 00:41:48.793
but vO is going to be
absolutely rock solid.

00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:51.000
Let's try that out.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.796
This time around,
this is the transfer function,

00:42:03.796 --> 00:42:07.270
the vO versus vIN.
And notice that this time

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.147
around I have similar scales on
the X and Y axes,

00:42:11.147 --> 00:42:15.509
and this has a slope of 10.
This is the point where the

00:42:15.509 --> 00:42:20.114
amplifier saturates at plus 12
volts, and this is minus 12

00:42:20.114 --> 00:42:23.022
volts, and this point here is a
zero.

00:42:23.022 --> 00:42:25.445
So, this is vIN,
vOUT, plus 12,

00:42:25.445 --> 00:42:31.317
minus 12 and this slope is 10.
What I am going to do now is

00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:36.117
heat the op amp to the wazoo and
this ain't going to change

00:42:36.117 --> 00:42:40.172
because it's my external
resistors that control it

00:42:40.172 --> 00:42:45.220
independent of the value of A,
provided A continues to be very

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.868
large.
I am just articulating the

00:42:47.868 --> 00:42:51.758
vOUT, vIN curve.
And let me start heating the op

00:42:51.758 --> 00:42:53.000
amp.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.422
Notice that it's pretty stable.
It doesn't change because it is

00:43:06.422 --> 00:43:09.483
independent of the amplifier
values.

00:43:09.483 --> 00:43:14.294
What I have done now is by
connecting these resistors in

00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:18.842
this way, I have a nice
amplifier with a gain of ten.

00:43:18.842 --> 00:43:22.516
The question you may ask
yourselves is why?

00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:27.938
There is this little sucker in
there that wants to shoot things

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:32.734
up by ten to the sixth.
Wants to knock things off the

00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:36.202
one rail or the negative rail.
Why is it that it's behaving

00:43:36.202 --> 00:43:39.610
like a docile lamb here and
giving us a nice little factor

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.822
of ten gain no matter what I do
to it?

00:43:41.822 --> 00:43:44.752
Why is it doing that?
What is the intuition behind

00:43:44.752 --> 00:43:46.606
it?
I will draw something on the

00:43:46.606 --> 00:43:50.014
board, but for the next ten
seconds I want you think about

00:43:50.014 --> 00:43:51.808
it.
See if you can come up with

00:43:51.808 --> 00:43:54.140
some insight as to why is it
doing that.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.249
Why is it exactly ten?
Why isn't the ten to the sixth

00:43:57.249 --> 00:44:01.751
kind of killing me somehow?
Why am I getting exactly ten no

00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:04.406
matter what happens?
See if you can come up with

00:44:04.406 --> 00:44:07.344
some intuition and then I will
show you how it works.

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:10.000
I will redraw the circuit in
the meantime.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Let me see if I can give you
some intuition.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.485
This is my circuit,
and let's say this is R and

00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:36.824
this is R.
As an example,

00:44:36.824 --> 00:44:42.090
let's assume that the input is
5 volts, vIN is 5 volts.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.672
If R and R are equal,
what should the output be?

00:44:46.672 --> 00:44:50.767
It's R and R,
so it's R1 plus R2 divided by

00:44:50.767 --> 00:44:53.789
R2, right?
It's 2R divided by R,

00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:59.054
so it has a gain of two.
My amplifier has a gain of two

00:44:59.054 --> 00:45:03.929
because R1 plus R2 divided by
R2, which is my gain,

00:45:03.929 --> 00:45:09.000
is R plus R divided by R equals
two.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.778
So, this will be 10 volts.
If that is 10 volts this is

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:16.303
going to be 5 volts,
correct?

00:45:16.303 --> 00:45:18.918
This R and R,
voltage divider,

00:45:18.918 --> 00:45:22.073
this is five,
so I get 5 volts here.

00:45:22.073 --> 00:45:24.868
This is v plus.
This is v minus.

00:45:24.868 --> 00:45:27.303
I get R and R,
5 volts here,

00:45:27.303 --> 00:45:32.662
that's how the circuit looks.
Now let's understand what is

00:45:32.662 --> 00:45:34.741
going on.
And listen very carefully.

00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:37.888
This is going to be a key
insight that I hope you will

00:45:37.888 --> 00:45:40.323
carry with you for the rest of
your lives.

00:45:40.323 --> 00:45:41.867
This is really,
really key.

00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:45.252
What you are going to see is,
I think, the third big ah-ha

00:45:45.252 --> 00:45:47.806
moment in 6.002.
Like small signal analysis,

00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:51.250
like the frequency domain stuff
we saw, I think this is the

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.695
third big one in the next 30 or
40 seconds, things that are

00:45:54.695 --> 00:45:57.664
completely either not
necessarily intuitive but are

00:45:57.664 --> 00:46:02.000
just spectacular in terms of
what they can do for you.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.733
Let's see.
Let's suppose that because I am

00:46:04.733 --> 00:46:08.666
heating it, let's suppose that A
suddenly tends to increase.

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:11.666
It wants to increase because I
have heated it.

00:46:11.666 --> 00:46:15.466
A is saying I want to get out
this mold here and starts to

00:46:15.466 --> 00:46:19.199
break through its shackles here.
Let's say, as a Gedanken

00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:22.800
experiment, that it tries to
shoot up this to 12 volts.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.333
It tries to push it up higher.
This is just a Gedanken

00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:30.273
experiment.
The up arrow says that the

00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:34.557
increase in A is trying to push
up vO momentarily.

00:46:34.557 --> 00:46:38.841
Let's see what happens.
It is trying to push up vO

00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:43.737
momentarily, so let's say this
goes to 12 hypothetically.

00:46:43.737 --> 00:46:47.934
If that goes to 12,
what should this volt node go

00:46:47.934 --> 00:46:49.333
to?
Six, exactly.

00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:52.918
This goes to 6 volts.
If that goes to six,

00:46:52.918 --> 00:46:56.240
what does v minus go to?
6 volts again.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:02.480
So, v minus goes to 6 volts.
Now at the input I have 5 volts

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.639
at v plus and 6 volts at v
minus, so where should the

00:47:06.639 --> 00:47:09.440
output go?
The output should go down

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.760
because the voltage of the
negative terminal is higher.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.679
And so the output is A times v
plus minus v minus.

00:47:17.679 --> 00:47:22.320
And because this has gone down,
this has gone up here it is

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.199
going to try to pull the output
down.

00:47:25.199 --> 00:47:29.760
That is going to pull the
output down let's say to 9 volts

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.004
or something.
Cachunk, there is a big battle

00:47:34.004 --> 00:47:35.875
going on here.
A has gone up,

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:39.751
it has boosted it up to 12,
but the moment that goes to 12,

00:47:39.751 --> 00:47:41.756
this goes to 6,
this goes to 6,

00:47:41.756 --> 00:47:45.966
and the op amp output has to go
down to 9 volts now because this

00:47:45.966 --> 00:47:48.572
input is higher here.
If this goes to 9,

00:47:48.572 --> 00:47:51.045
this goes to 4.5.
If that goes to 4.5,

00:47:51.045 --> 00:47:53.317
this goes to 4.5.
What happens now?

00:47:53.317 --> 00:47:55.522
If this goes to 4.5,
what happens?

00:47:55.522 --> 00:48:00.000
It wants to go back up.
Can't it make up its mind?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.698
This guy wants to go back up
now because v plus is higher

00:48:04.698 --> 00:48:07.634
than v minus.
What am I seeing here?

00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:11.829
This whole circuit here behaves
like my little son,

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:14.263
my 9-year-old.
If say do this,

00:48:14.263 --> 00:48:17.031
he wants to do the exact
opposite.

00:48:17.031 --> 00:48:21.981
So, there is a trick in how you
make them do things for you.

00:48:21.981 --> 00:48:25.589
Look at this.
Because of this arrangement of

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:29.448
the circuit when A tries to push
the output up,

00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:34.566
the rest of the circuit tries
to pull it back down to where it

00:48:34.566 --> 00:48:39.414
used to be.
If the circuit tries not to

00:48:39.414 --> 00:48:43.886
follow the true path,
the rest of the circuit tries

00:48:43.886 --> 00:48:48.178
to whack it into shape so it
follows a true path.

00:48:48.178 --> 00:48:52.829
And what's happening is
because, in this arrangement,

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:57.658
I have fed back a portion of
the output to the negative

00:48:57.658 --> 00:49:01.202
input.
I have fed back some of the

00:49:01.202 --> 00:49:06.015
output to the negative input.
And by providing this feedback

00:49:06.015 --> 00:49:09.931
of a portion of the output to
the negative input,

00:49:09.931 --> 00:49:14.418
I have arranged it in a way
that I have something called

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:18.334
negative feedback.
What negative feedback does is

00:49:18.334 --> 00:49:23.310
that if this wanted to go wild
and crazy, the circuit provides

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:27.226
it with some negative feedback
like you just saw.

00:49:27.226 --> 00:49:32.128
Feedback, a big word.
If you take a poll of all the

00:49:32.128 --> 00:49:35.211
EECS faculty,
I suspect that feedback would

00:49:35.211 --> 00:49:39.688
rank at least as the ninth or
tenth most important word in the

00:49:39.688 --> 00:49:41.963
EECS.
If abstract is number one,

00:49:41.963 --> 00:49:46.146
I think this would rank like a
nine or a ten or something.

00:49:46.146 --> 00:49:48.715
So, that's the reason why it
worked.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:53.045
In the last couple of minutes,
let me give you some insight,

00:49:53.045 --> 00:49:57.082
based on something that you
know, on how feedback works.

00:49:57.082 --> 00:50:02.000
This is a road here.
Let's look at anti lock breaks.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.774
This is my tire.
And let's say I have a set of

00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:09.632
disk brakes here.
As the car is moving forward,

00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:13.322
if I apply the brakes the tire
stops rolling,

00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:18.438
but if I apply the breaks too
hard it can lock up the tire and

00:50:18.438 --> 00:50:22.800
the whole car can skid.
The way anti lock breaks work

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.574
is as follows.
There is a controller that sits

00:50:26.574 --> 00:50:30.622
here.
And there is a little person

00:50:30.622 --> 00:50:34.836
looking at the wheel and seeing
is it turning.

00:50:34.836 --> 00:50:39.894
So, this is a feedback.
And it is saying is it turning?

00:50:39.894 --> 00:50:42.329
Yes.
Or, is it not turning?

00:50:42.329 --> 00:50:45.232
No.
All this person watching the

00:50:45.232 --> 00:50:50.664
tire is doing is saying is it
turning or is it not turning.

00:50:50.664 --> 00:50:54.317
That is it.
That is a negative feedback.

00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:59.000
And so, if it is no and if it
is yes.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.059
If it is yes then what this
does is it applies the brakes

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:06.466
even more strongly.
It is turning so I can apply

00:51:06.466 --> 00:51:08.786
more brakes.
But if it says oops,

00:51:08.786 --> 00:51:11.976
it stopped turning,
what it does is it simply

00:51:11.976 --> 00:51:15.166
releases, the controller
releases the brakes.

00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:18.863
And when the controller
releases the brakes this one

00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:23.068
tends to loosen up a little bit
and the tire starts turning

00:51:23.068 --> 00:51:25.750
again.
So, this way you are constantly

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:30.172
keeping the tire in its region
of critical friction so that it

00:51:30.172 --> 00:51:34.741
is constantly moving.
And static friction applies to

00:51:34.741 --> 00:51:37.761
how hard you can brake and it
doesn't start skidding.

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:41.012
In fact, if you take your car
out, and I don't say you do

00:51:41.012 --> 00:51:42.987
this.
Let's say go onto the Charles

00:51:42.987 --> 00:51:46.470
River in the dead of winter and
you drive on the lake and you

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.141
slam your anti lock brakes on,
on an icy patch,

00:51:49.141 --> 00:51:52.683
you will notice that there is a
constant sound that looks like

00:51:52.683 --> 00:51:55.877
something is vibrating in there.
That is exactly what is

00:51:55.877 --> 00:51:57.909
happening.
Oops, the tire is locked.

00:51:57.909 --> 00:52:01.222
Release the brakes.
The wheel is turning.

00:52:01.222 --> 00:52:03.608
Jam the brakes on.
That is exactly what is

00:52:03.608 --> 00:52:05.703
happening.
The same way as out there,

00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:08.264
you notice that oops,
the output is going up,

00:52:08.264 --> 00:52:10.301
pull it down,
oops, it's going down,

00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:12.687
pull it up.
So, there is constant negative

00:52:12.687 --> 00:52:15.132
feedback that is keeping the
output stable.

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:18.333
A very important concept.
And I will ask your recitation

00:52:18.333 --> 00:52:22.399
instructors to cover the very
simple method that is on page 9.
