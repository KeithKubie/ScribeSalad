00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.080
In today's world, the first look at a superhero
costume can be the most important part of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.840
building positive buzz - or having fans write
the project off completely.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.300
The first look isn't always the final verdict,
whether it's a costume that brings the comic

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.800
book version to life, or changes it completely.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.810
But sometimes, the fans' doubts are proven
to be a good sign - either that, or they never

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.730
know just how awful the reality of the costume
really was for the actor.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.690
Here are the 10 Most Controversial Superhero
Movie Costumes of All Time.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.850
Psylocke
Since her debut in Marvel Comics, the mutant

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.740
Psylocke's willingness to show some skin has
turned just as many heads as her psychic blade.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.320
So when X-Men: Apocalypse put Olivia Munn
in basically the exact same outfit, some eyebrows

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
were raised.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.750
Munn made sure the character's costume wasn't
just meant to get fans drooling, and with

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.791
the addition of some flesh-colored latex covering
the edgier areas, audiences can make decide

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.760
for themselves.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.230
Captain America
Steve Rogers got a clever costume during his

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.189
World War II days, recreating the color scheme
and red and white stripes without actually

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.320
looking too silly.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.400
But that changed with The Avengers, with Cap's
colorful mascot outfit justified by claiming

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.950
that the public might need a hero who was
old-fashioned, and a bit cheesy.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.470
Fans were fine with it, since the movie itself
was a hit.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.340
But the costumers clearly heard the criticism,
since every single Cap costume since has been

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.280
an update of the original style - basically
asking all of us to forget the Avengers look

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.749
ever happened.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.409
Green Lantern
Almost every practical comic book costume

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.939
gets a little tweaking thanks to digital artists,
whether it's CG capes, added effects, or tech.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.249
But with Green Lantern, director Martin Campbell
made a bold choice: to go with nothing practical,

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.600
and make the entire suit a digital creation.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.280
The idea that the Green Lantern ring makes
the suit from pure energy IS faithful to the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.959
comics, but the end result turned off almost
everyone - especially the mask.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.540
And when your star actually HAS the body of
a comic book superhero, why waste it?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.509
As an added bonus, Ryan Reynolds has claimed
that the mocap suit was so hot, it must have

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.459
been "made of actual woven misery."&nbsp;

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.549
Catwoman
From the first look at Halle Berry's Catwoman

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.499
costume, every moviegoer knew the movie was
going to be a disaster.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.259
Aside from looking ridiculous in general,
the amount of skin being shown had critics

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
enraged, pointing out that the version of
Catwoman in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (Warner

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.320
Bros.) was actually MORE seductive, showing
no skin at all.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.700
But it might just be a problem with the character
as a whole.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.920
That incredible version worn by Michelle Pfeiffer?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.000
The actress had to be vaccuum-sealed into
it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.800
Not only did she hate it by the time filming
wrapped, but over 60 versions of the suit

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.820
had to be made at $1,000 a piece.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.690
Quicksilver
No movie superhero proved you can't judge

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.070
a book by its cover like Quicksilver in X-Men:
Days of Future Past (Fox).

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.420
Where the Marvel version of the character
(Avengers: Age of Ultron) stuck to the slick

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.360
style of the comics, Bryan Singer went...
a different direction.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.180
The metallic jacket might have fit the 1970s
setting, but from the moment the silver wig

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.420
and goggles hit the Internet, fans went crazy,
claiming it to be the dumbest design of the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.730
entire franchise.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.340
Even actor Evan Peters wasn't sure it would
work, but the character wound up a fan-favorite

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.570
- goggles and all.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.340
Batman
When director Joel Schumacher took over the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.350
Batman series, he decided that the Dark Knight
needed some flare.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.870
George Clooney's version takes most of the
heat, but it was actually Val Kilmer who first

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.570
showed off the infamous "Bat nipples."

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.150
The idea was to model the Batsuit after statues
of Greek gods, nipples, cod pieces, muscles

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.150
and all.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.630
But by the time the sequel hit theaters, the
nipples and gratuitous butt shots had turned

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.150
DC's biggest hero into a walking punchline.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.320
Wonder Woman
Having already teamed up with Batman and Superman,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.820
and with a solo movie on the way, it's hard
to believe Wonder Woman was going to appear

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.560
on TV played by Adrienne Palicki, instead.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.061
Enough people thought the pilot episode was
worthwhile to actually get it filmed, but

00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:44.050
once fans caught sight of the new costume,
jaws dropped.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.470
A reminder: this costume was designed in 2011.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.510
Fans would have debated even a perfect Wonder
Woman costume, but the spandex pants and glittering

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.780
gold left no doubt: the pilot would wind up
not going to series, and basically embarrassing

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.250
everyone associated with it.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.890
Batman
Christopher Nolan's take on Batman might be

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.010
seen as brilliant now, but following on the
heels of the Bat-nipple-suit, a Batsuit that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.120
was actually practical and realistic seemed
like a risky move behind the scenes.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.870
One by one, every feature of the suit, from
the grappling gun to the wings, had to be

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.789
justified - to the director, and in the movie.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.850
For Christian Bale, the commitment to realism
meant he still couldn't turn his head while

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.550
in the suit, and the materials left with with
intense headaches.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
Who knows?

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.020
Maybe that rage is what made Batman Begins
such a hit.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.770
Harley Quinn
The Joker's girlfriend has usually courted

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.170
controversy with every one of her outfits,
showing more and more skin in cartoons, comics,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.790
and video games every year.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.870
With Dc's Suicide Squad, the filmmakers designed
a new look keeping her modern blue and red

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.740
color scheme intact - and sticking with the
short-shorts and stilettos, too.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.160
Actress Margot Robbie mainly complained about
being soaking wet in just a t-shirt and shorts,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.940
unlike her co-stars, but claimed the sexy
style was part of what made Harley tick.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.540
Whether the audience will buy it... remains
to be seen.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.810
Deadpool
We couldn't discuss some of the most hotly-criticized

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.960
superhero costumes without addressing the
mother of all mutant mistakes: Deadpool, from

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.000
X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.210
Even now, it's hard to know what the filmmakers
were thinking, giving Wade Wilson optic blasts,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:19.380
retractable swords, and the ability to teleport
without even giving him a suit - or a mouth.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.050
Ryan Reynolds got to set things right - and
then some - but there was a time when this

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.710
take on Deadpool seemed like it had killed
the character on film for good.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.560
Those are the superhero costumes we remember
being the most explosive, controversial, or

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.600
just plain misguided.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.380
But which ones have we missed?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.639
