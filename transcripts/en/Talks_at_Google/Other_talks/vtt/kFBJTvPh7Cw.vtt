FEMALE SPEAKER: American
Himalayan Foundation could not

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.020
make it today, but Therese will
be talking about both

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.990
organizations and their
great work.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.050
So today is International
Women's Day, which started

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.560
back in the early
1900s to promote

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.100
civil rights for women.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.620
We've come a really long way
in most respects, but human

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.250
rights for women and girls
in some corners of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.410
the world have not.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm excited to introduce you
to the work of Community

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
Partners International and
American Himalayan Foundation.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.580
They're doing amazing things on
the ground to prevent girls

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.000
from falling victim in Nepal,
Burma, and Thailand.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.050
Therese Caouette is executive
director at CPI and has worked

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.300
with refugees, migrants, and
displaced persons in Southeast

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.570
Asia for more than 30 years,
together with community-based

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.370
organizations, international
bodies, foundations and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.040
academic institutions.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.230
Please welcome Therese.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.950
THERESE CAOUETTE:
Hello, thanks.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.010
As Aya said, I've been working
largely in Southeast Asia.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.440
And I worked primarily in the
beginning with refugees and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.693
displaced populations in the
late '70s and early '80s at

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:17.500
the end of the Vietnam War.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.910
And during that time although I
was working with refugees I

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.720
found that more and more young
girls and young adults were

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.130
finding themselves in very
vulnerable situations outside

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.380
of the refugee camps.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.600
But when I started to do
specifically work on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.870
trafficking, I found that most
of the people at that time in

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.870
the early '90s or late '80s
were being trafficked to I

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.330
think what we--

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.730
the image at least I had at the
time, or I think people

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.980
still have of trafficking is
people being abducted or

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.250
tricked in their village,
brought across borders and put

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.510
into brothels.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.229
Very typical brothels where you
have girls locked in and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.820
they have numbers on their chest
1 through 25, and you go

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.750
in and you pick which
number you want.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.490
Now we saw that.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.550
That was very typical in the
'80s and early '90s.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.350
But I've seen that it's changed
dramatically in the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.870
last 10, 20 years, and I'd like
to talk about that today

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.270
because I feel that a lot of
us have a very different--

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.710
including myself-- still have
these other images of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.910
trafficking that are not what
we see on the ground today.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.940
So I'd like to kind of walk
through that and I'd like to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.030
make this presentation more
presentation of a discourse or

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.150
discussion about trafficking,
and not me telling you what

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.890
trafficking is.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.070
Because I think it's so nuanced
and so complex that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.700
we're all really struggling to
try to understand it and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.190
respond to it.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.330
So I'd like to kind of present
to you the challenges that I

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.970
find in my work, and ask you to
kind of think that through

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.000
with me as you think about these
issues and what you're

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.790
aware of in other contexts.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.110
So I'd like to ask you to maybe
just turn to the person

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.490
next to you, or--

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.250
because I know we have several
people who are not here with

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.500
us physically--

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.020
to just think for a minute or
two how you would define

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.110
trafficking.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.740
How do you use it, and if you
just turn to two or three

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.390
people next to you and just try
to figure out what does it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.830
mean to you.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.850
What words do you use?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.920
How do you use trafficking?

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.700
Just take one minute.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.720
I'll just do it real briefly.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.090
OK, let me bring you back.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.550
I want to say that I think if
we took a poll, we'd come up

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.560
with a whole bunch of different
images, and I think

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.870
this is what I see in my
work all the time.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.340
And I think it's not only
a problem that I face.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.370
I see that the international
community is faced wtih these

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.900
same dilemmas.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.730
If you look at the United
Nations today, we have a wide

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.130
range of conventions and
treaties and declarations on

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.560
trafficking, all of which have
very narrow definitions, and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.675
have reflected that
period of time in

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:13.940
which they were written.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.760
And yet what we find is they
really don't apply today to

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.170
the kind of dynamics
that we're finding.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.580
And there's been an effort by
the UN to try to identify some

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.890
special repertoires, some
working groups, to try to

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.820
explore a broader or more
relevant definition for

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.260
trafficking that we can use to
help deal with the issues that

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.350
we're faced with.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.400
And yet this is in-process,
and we don't really have a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.020
very clear good working
definition.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.300
And as a result, when you bring
countries together or we

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.950
bring non-government
organizations or donors or

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.000
communities together,
we're often not

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.780
talking the same language.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.200
And I think this is one of the
biggest problems that we face

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.500
with trafficking is that we have
all different images, and

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
when we sit down together
we don't have a way

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.420
to talk about it.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.000
At the same time--

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.210
over 20 years I think I've been
working on this issue--

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.180
I cannot find any communities
or girls who have been

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.090
trafficked who identify
themselves as

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.830
a trafficked person.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.090
And if you talk to villagers,
"Have you been trafficked?

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.510
Has anybody here been
trafficked?" they would say

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.270
immediately, "No, not in our
village." But if you ask them

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.380
about vulnerabilities and
migration it's a completely

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.090
different discussion that
we have that follows.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.470
So I just want to preface our
discussion today that this, I

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.680
would argue, is probably the
most important point when you

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.030
start to talk about
this issue.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.340
To just explore with one another
what you're actually

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.360
talking about and what images
or what dynamics

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.780
you're really exploring.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.920
What we see today is that
migration is happening in the

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.380
greatest numbers than we've
ever seen in our time.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.650
There's over 250 million people
who are living outside

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.080
of their countries.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.910
That doesn't mean that they're
all undocumented.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.550
It certainly doesn't mean that
they're all trafficked, but

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.810
they're all moving, and in ways
that we've never actually

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.070
had to deal with in our world.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.950
And although both men and women
are traveling and are

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.930
moving, women are by far
more vulnerable.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.750
And this is largely because most
of women's work is in the

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.380
informal economy.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.700
In markets, in agriculture,
domestic work,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.520
babysitting, day-care.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.550
We see it in our country, you
see it around the world, that

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.380
many of the jobs that women
hold are not in the formal

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.790
labor sector.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.260
Also much of women's
work is irregular.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.240
Their part-time work, they do
piece work, number of pieces,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.520
in this example, the number
of fish they serve.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.630
It's seasonal.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.215
They aren't often in the
regular economy.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.150
They're often less educated.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.270
Their gender roles are more
defined, and what we find in

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.860
developing countries is they
marry much earlier.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.950
They're are also in conflict
situations among refugees.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.680
80% of all refugees, the
millions of refugees in the

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.110
world, are largely women
and children.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.550
So women really do make up the
majority of people who are at

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.460
risk in the migration context.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.010
Today I'm going to focus on the
work in Burma, and that's

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.170
where I spent--

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.380
this keeps moving, sorry--

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.600
the work in Burma.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.490
And that's where I've worked
for the past 20 years.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.340
Although I've worked in
Southeast Asia as a whole,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.549
Burma by far has had the most
complex and difficult

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.610
migration dynamics
in the region.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.710
The reasons for that is that
it's surrounded by the largest

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.520
developing countries
in the area.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.220
Thailand, India, China, so
there's a lot of opportunity

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.040
outside their borders.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.550
It's an extremely
poor country.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.410
There's been a lot of ethnic
conflict and warfare for the

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.660
past 50 years.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.000
And there are enormous ethnic
minority populations around

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.130
the country.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.480
There are 36 major ethnic
minority populations and 136

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.020
if you count all the minor
ethnic minorities.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.230
The vulnerabilities of ethnic
minority communities--

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.920
not speaking the major
languages, not able to access

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.290
health services or education
in the countries where they

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.460
live, is a big risk factor for
the people who are being

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.710
trafficked today.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.420
Let me just jump back to say
although Eileen from the

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.400
American Himalayan Foundation
was unable to join us today,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.340
one of the ways that we started
to collaborate in our

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.010
work was that we both were on
a panel and we realized that

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.110
the discussions and the
presentations we were

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.460
providing were almost
identical.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.445
Even though she focuses her work
in Nepal, we could have

00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:59.950
used the same case examples,
we could have used the same

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.690
presentations, almost
verbatim.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.430
And one of things that I'd like
to leave you with is the

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.080
understanding that these
dynamics are really not

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.610
country-specific.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.450
It's amazing to me when I go
around to speak, or meet

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.270
others, who are working on these
issues the similarities

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.110
in Eastern Europe, the
similarities of Iraqi refugees

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:25.020
who are fleeing to Syria and
Jordan as illegal immigrants.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.060
You see these dynamics playing
out all around the world.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.200
And so even though they couldn't
be here today to

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.510
present another case example,
I think what I'll be able to

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.180
present today will highlight
very closely to what the

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.680
reality is they do
on the ground.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.170
So what I'd like to talk a
little bit about is these

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.240
current dynamics of trafficking
that I find

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.220
happening in the 21st century,
in the past 10 years.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.720
They are so different
from how I started.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.360
In Southeast Asia, these are
just the beginnings of the

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.160
infrastructure of the roads that
have been developed in

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.100
the last 10 years.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.470
Prior to that, certainly 15
years ago, but for many

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.360
countries as early as 10
years ago, all of these

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.240
borders were locked.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.740
You couldn't travel
across borders.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.600
And that has fueled not only
migration, but trade, consumer

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.900
goods, drug trafficking, a lot
of issues that have emerged in

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.880
the region have scaled up
considerably as a result of

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.760
all the infrastructure.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.870
But it's not only roads.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:35.750
It's also cellphones, it's
a lot of infrastructure

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.890
electricity.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.150
With that comes access
to the internet.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.420
All of the resources that have
come in the past 10 years have

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.420
really changed these communities
dramatically.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.990
AUDIENCE: What are
the black lines?

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.650
THERESE CAOUETTE: Say again.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.460
AUDIENCE: What are
the black lines--

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.470
THERESE CAOUETTE: The roads.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:57.150
The new roads that have been
built in the last 10 years are

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.130
linked across borders.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.470
And so now as you see
that young people--

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:10.930
their dreams and aspirations
are changing very quickly.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.380
They see the cell phones, they
see the internet, they see the

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.220
axis of opportunities.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.810
Even though their absolute
poverty has improved, the

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.580
disparity between what they
have in their villages and

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.390
what they see in the
cities is dramatic.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.210
And they want to be
a part of it.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.610
They want to travel just like
our kids do, or our friends.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.180
They want the economic
opportunities and security

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.800
that they see others
have around them.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.090
And they want to travel.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.910
They want to explore a world
that's bigger than themselves.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.090
They want to move beyond the
gender tradition roles that

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.030
they've been told are the norm,
are their expectations.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.830
And they want to do more
in their life.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.990
But they're entering a global
market that is looking for

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.520
cheap labor.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.910
They're entering the global
market that's trying to find

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.340
the cheapest race to
the bottom for

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.640
the cheapest workers.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.170
And they're entering in an
environment where they're

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.650
promoting tourism.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.480
Governments are also encouraging
exportation of

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.000
labor because by exporting
labor, they're able to deal

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.980
with the unemployment or

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.010
underemployment in their country.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.600
And they're also able to obtain
foreign exchange.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.700
The amount of remittances
worldwide from people in

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.620
developing countries sending
money home is now in 2011

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.130
reached $351 billion.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.520
That is more than three times
all of the foreign development

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.960
assistance that has gone to
developing countries during

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.930
that same period of time.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.360
And it's also almost about the
same amount of money as direct

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.580
investment in those countries.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.990
It is an enormous amount of
money and governments are

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:07.090
promoting their nationals
to go abroad to work.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.120
But when they recruit, people in
these villages have no idea

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.750
if this is a formal arrangement
organized by the

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.280
government, or if this is a
black market agent under the

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.520
table who's going to bring
across the border and give

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.310
them a real job.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.710
They have no way to understand
who's who.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:28.170
So in this context, they see
opportunity, they want to go

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.320
for it, and they have
no idea to how to

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.150
decipher which is which.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.950
So I'd like to tell
you a story.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.730
This is a village
that I worked in

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.650
for many, many years.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.330
And I have a daughter who's
now 22, but at the time--

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.440
this was about 15 years ago--

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.460
we would go frequently to this
village, and she got to know

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.070
all of these children
in this village.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.740
And she would often play this
rubber band jump rope game

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.740
with these girls and they were
very good at it, and she would

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.800
always look forward to it.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.650
So this is a last picture
we had of them

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.450
in the fourth grade.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.450
When we came back the next year
she ran off to find the

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.630
friends and they were all gone,
because they had all

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.230
gone to get a job in the city.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:14.820
Either in Bangkok, in Kunming,
in China, or over to India.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.690
She was living in Bangkok at the
time and very excited, so

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.640
she'd run around to all of the
houses to find out which girls

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.280
had gone to Bangkok to get their
addresses or their phone

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.900
numbers so she could call
them when she got home.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.240
And that any of the parents had
a number or a contact for

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.020
any of their kids.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.470
And this is the hole
that they go into.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.200
And the question I always want
to raise is, are these

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.370
children trafficked?

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.770
This is the dilemma, and if
we only look at quote

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.060
"trafficking," we look
at the end game,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.790
what happened to them.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.300
But this doesn't really solve
the risk, and so somehow I

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.040
feel we really need to start to
turn it around and we need

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.680
to look at the vulnerabilities
of these kids.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.250
And what do we need to do to
make sure that if they want to

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.750
move beyond their village that
they have the skills and the

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.290
resources and the knowledge to
be able to do so safely or

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.510
with some opportunity for
recourse, or redress, if they

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.730
get in a vulnerable situation.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.250
If we just wait to define which
one of these kids are

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.840
trafficked, it's kind
of too late.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.510
What we see happening on the
borders where I work in Burma,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:40.430
is that most of these young
people are looking for jobs.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.180
When they cross the border,
there's one area that I just

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.840
went to recently and I've been
going for a number of years,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.370
and the Thai factories are
building their factories right

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.540
up along the border, just
like we did with Mexico.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.360
Right up along the border so we
can get very cheap labor,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.180
half the price of
Thai laborers.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.310
And these Burmese young people
come up to the border to work,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.140
and there are about 4,000 or
5,000 who cross the border

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.530
every morning, get in trucks,
and go to the factories where

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.290
they're sent to work
like day labor.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.480
You can really do anything you
want to these young girls

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.800
because they have no
documentation, they have no

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.710
rights, they're illegally in
the country, and they're

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.880
working under the table.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.110
And in that context, you can not
pay them, you can pay them

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.010
the whole amount, you can make
them stay, work all night, not

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.300
work the next day, or take them
further into another city

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.360
and not let them return.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.660
And they have no way
to negotiate that.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.300
And we see this dynamic
over and over again.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.740
They live in really horrific
conditions and very difficult

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.890
labor conditions with very
little protection of

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.120
sanitation or the environment
in which they work.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.510
And more and more of these young
girls and the children

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.530
of migrant workers are
becoming stateless.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.640
They have no identification.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.260
They have no citizenship.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.280
And so they can't access
health services in any

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.720
country, or education.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.410
They will be their whole
life illegal.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.350
And if I did a report today,
or if I really focus what I

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.660
think is the most urgent issue,
I would say it's this

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.680
growing number of stateless
children.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.390
Migrants having children
abroad.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.990
The children are illegal because
they're not legal in

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.550
the country that they're in.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.000
They can't go back, or they're
from ethnic minority

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.900
communities that were never
registered in the first place.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.360
And so they never had a
identity, and when they left,

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.710
they can't go back with
any identity.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.480
This population is significant
and growing.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.650
And so in the end,
they're illegal.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.220
And they can be deported,
arrested at any point in time,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.510
if the employer doesn't
want to pay them.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.810
If the floods in Thailand,
for example--

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.870
now we blame migrants because we
don't have enough jobs, so

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.750
we're going round them
up and deport them.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.790
We have a whole dynamics of
these things happening in our

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.480
own country.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.060
And so we just round them up
and deport them and that

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.630
somehow solves the problem.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.680
And this cycle just continues
like this.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.540
I believe that the real way to
change this is to try to think

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:39.020
about what we can really do to
empower the young girls and

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.890
the young children--

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.650
youth--

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.960
who are migrating.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.950
I think that the typical
responses that we see in our

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:51.590
media and that I was very
involved in the early years--

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:56.050
shelters, prevention, trying to
warn them about the dangers

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.370
of migration, rescuing those who
are in the brothels or in

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.930
these horrible factories, trying
to help them return,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.370
reintegrate back into
their community.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:11.350
But what I've learned over the
years that keeps them in the

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.230
position of a victim.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.910
It doesn't really help them
with their life goals and

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.230
their dreams and their
aspirations for something

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.860
beyond the village.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.860
What they really need is some
life skills, some education,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.260
some resources and opportunities
so that they can

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.460
actually fulfill their
aspirations to be more than

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.260
miring at 14 or 15 years old
and following in their same

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.430
traditional patterns that
they've seen their mothers and

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.740
generations before them.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.380
They want something else, and
so I think that our typical

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.870
responses to trafficking
have to be challenged

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.550
and mine have been.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.800
To really emphasize a lot more
working with these communities

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.590
and with these young people
who are at risk.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.500
But working with those girls
is on the picture.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.940
About what they want to do about
what their conditions

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.780
are in the workforce, what
kind of jobs they want.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:07.390
Studies, life skills that
they hope to attain.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.110
Otherwise they just have to pray
each time and hope next

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.560
time they migrate they'll
have better luck.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.140
And so what we've tried to
focus on more and more is

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.640
schools, both formal and
informal schools.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.090
What we've found is a lot of
children don't go to school

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.730
when they're young, and so by
the time they're 12, 13, 14

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.620
years old, they can't go
to the first grade.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.170
So they've got to start
working with literacy

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.470
programs, life skill programs,
other informal courses or

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.610
classes that can take place in
the evening, that can work

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:50.560
with illiterate populations and
build them into a program

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.150
that reaches and meets
their needs.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.960
There's a big challenge of
trying to get schools to the

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.700
remote rural areas, especially
to ethnic minority

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.310
populations.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:09.250
They speak very isolated, small
languages that aren't

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.035
very common, and very hard to
find teachers who teach in

00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:13.830
those languages.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.380
They are very hard to
get them to stop

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.740
working during the daytime.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.440
They've got a lot of

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.050
responsibilities to keep the family.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.900
A lot of them are married
very young.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.740
What we find is that we need
to do a lot to actually get

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.670
them to school.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:35.040
What I see happening in some
of the remote areas is that

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.060
they're trying to prepare
boarding schools for kids to

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.860
come to stay in so that they can
stay Monday through Friday

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.060
and not have to walk so far
and actually attend the

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.470
schools that are closer to
the cities or the towns.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.650
This one that I just saw
a few weeks ago--

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.060
and they set this
up themselves.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.950
But obviously we should be doing
more to support these

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.420
kind of efforts by the community
to keep the girls

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.670
and young children in school.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.190
And in addition, I find over and
over again people asking

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.550
for preschools or
pre-kindergarten programs.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.450
At first I used to keep
thinking, well maybe don't we

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.020
need to focus on primary school

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.900
first, or literacy first.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.190
And what I've learned is
actually that the preschools

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.450
are actually really key to
getting the older siblings

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.530
into school, to getting the
parents working and employed

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.480
so they don't have to ask their
younger children to work

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.720
in their place, to getting
children literate and able to

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.150
communicate in the national
language so that when they go

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:39.020
to school they understand the
language and have more

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.910
likelihood to succeed.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.330
THERESE CAOUETTE: No, sure.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.210
I just have one more point and
then I'll actually stop.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.840
But this is probably my last,
so I can stop now.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.190
Go ahead.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.606
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
preschool encourages

00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:55.644
adults to get a job.

00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:58.320
THERESE CAOUETTE: To work.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.330
When the children go to school,
the mothers are free

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.320
to work, or they don't have
to ask the older kids.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.640
The question was, so how does
that help parents be employed?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:22.690
So we found that preschool and
also alternative schools have

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.730
been very important
in the American

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.820
Himalayan Foundation also.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.080
Most of us have really focused
the majority of our work on

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.110
schools, both formal
and informal.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.240
And that we really need to work
with the aspirations and

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.540
the goals of the communities and
those children and young

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.740
adults, so that they can
actually migrate, travel,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.360
move, take jobs with some skills
and some knowledge of

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.430
their rights.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.270
So I think this is a
very important--

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.110
while at the same time
negotiating a environment that

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.360
respects their rights.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.090
I think that's the challenge
for us as outside to those

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:03.720
communities.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.100
That we need to understand and
struggle to understand the

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.390
ongoing discourse
on trafficking.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.970
How these issues are changing,
how our policy of our

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.100
government impacts those
communities and the

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.340
opportunities that young
people are offered.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.070
Our multinational corporations,
the policies and

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:31.030
rules that they practice
when they're abroad.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.760
I think there's a number of
considerations that we have to

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.960
really be challenged by, and
I'd like to leave you with

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.480
these before I give the
microphone to Paula.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.140
I think we have to
be very aware of

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.180
how we "other" others.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.480
And I do it all the time, but
we see them somehow as

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.060
different from us, and they're
not any different than what my

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.750
daughter wants.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.520
She wants to travel, she wants
to see more than I did, she

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.000
wants to have a world that's
bigger than Bainbridge Island

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.270
up in Washington.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.030
She wants something bigger than
that, and so do these

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.770
kids, and we have to
really be careful.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.030
And parents want their children
to stretch beyond

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.000
what they know is possible.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.350
Because sometimes I get really
frustrated when I see in the

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.310
media and I hear people talking
that somehow parents

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.090
sold their kids, or
they minimize it.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.210
And it's really not a very
fair or empathetic

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.650
understanding of the context
with which they're trying to

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.470
raise their children.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.250
I think we also have to work to
increase our own tolerance

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.950
and understanding of cultures
and the different practices.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.770
It's very difficult for me.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.010
Like I said, I was just able
to travel in Burma the last

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.250
month, and a lot of girls
are marrying at 14

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.130
and 15 years old.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.240
It's very hard to
work with this.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.000
It's hard to see these young
kids, and yet you can't have a

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.140
simplistic answer to this
and expect change.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.450
But you really need to
communicate this into the

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.970
issues and work with
families and

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.350
communities on these issues.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.270
There needs to be basic labor
rights, even for people who

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.450
don't have legal status.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.620
We have to do it in our own
country, and we have to do it

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.040
around the world.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.710
You can't really be
an illegal person.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.970
You have some basic rights
no matter where you are.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.600
And I think it's important to
recognize and work towards

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.700
formalizing women's work--

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.100
domestic workers, babysitters,
in the markets.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.890
We have a lot of
informal work--

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.480
farm workers--

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.540
that is not recognized as formal
labor, even again in

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.940
our own country.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.680
And I think we should focus on
this labor exploitation and

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.560
not on controlling movements
of people.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.530
Focusing this problem on keeping
people in one place

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.190
and not allowing them to move is
what results in this cycle

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:56.410
of deportation and illegal
hidden dynamics that people

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.500
can't get out of.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.040
And we have to recognize that
we have large unmet labor

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.840
needs, and that we are going
around the world trying to

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.340
find cheaper markets.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.750
And that we need to look at how
these practices take place

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:19.200
and how to protect and promote
a fair labor exchange.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.150
I was just in Burma the last
month, and I suppose some of

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.490
you may know that the country's
slowly opening up.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.030
And you could not believe how
many multinational companies

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:34.245
are descending in weeks on this
place and trying to set

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:34.960
up their factories.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.920
Because this is 60 million
people with no work, very

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.300
cheap labor.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.000
And if we don't have some
mechanisms with which we can

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.640
monitor and protect and promote
their rights, then

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.590
this cycle only continues
at a even more rapid

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.840
pace than we see today.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.790
And I think we need to hear and
work with communities on

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.800
the ground to meet
their needs.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.670
As I mentioned earlier, none
of these communities see

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.820
themselves or any of the young
people in their communities as

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.040
being trafficked.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.520
That discourse is not theirs.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.590
So if we want to really deal
with these issues, we're going

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.250
to have to really talk in a
language and listen to the

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.730
concerns and the realities that
they perceive in their

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.220
communities in order to
change these dynamics.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.050
So I'd like to leave this with
you, with some of the things

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.990
that I struggle with
in the field.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.390
And I would like my colleague
Paula Bock, who works very

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.240
closely with me, to talk to you
a little bit about what

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.300
she does on this end to
complement that work.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.147
Thanks.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:42.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.820
PAULA BOCK: Hi, my name's
Paula Bock and I work on

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.760
community communications
and development.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.070
So that's telling the stories
of the people in Burma and

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.845
along its borders and helping
to get support.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.710
I want to tell you a little bit
about how I got involved

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.050
and then how if you're

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.090
interested you can get involved.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.090
So not too long ago I
was a journalist.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.130
I had a long career
as a journalist.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.130
But I also had a secret life.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.015
And that was volunteering with
my husband, who's a doctor, at

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.990
a refugee clinic run
by a really amazing

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.090
woman refugee doctor.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.330
And while we were there--
this is back in 1996--

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.990
we crossed the border from
Thailand in a pickup truck at

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.280
night over the hills to
a little village in

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.920
rebel-controlled Burma, where
they hadn't seen of

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.080
pediatrician in years.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.860
And I fell in love with the
children, playing with them.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.990
And these are two of the
girls, [? Shua ?]

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:50.650
and [? Omoo ?], and all the kids
were really delightful.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.810
These two were good friends in
particular, and in fact they

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.810
were in preschool.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.473
So you heard about the
importance of preschools, and

00:30:56.473 --> 00:30:58.430
they used to sing
the ABC song.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.250
Anyway, after my year off--

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.210
I had taken a sabbatical
for my job--

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.470
we came back to Seattle where we
live, and then I found out

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.540
that the village had fallen
to the military.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.610
It was just my heart, you know
that something had happened.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.960
So I convinced the newspaper to
send me back on a special

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.890
assignment, and I was trying
to find the girls.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.130
I didn't tell the
newspaper that.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.340
I said I was going to write
about the civil war in Burma.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.370
And I couldn't get to them
because there was this war.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.190
But over the years I kept trying
to get contact and I

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.930
would hear things.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:42.140
And as they grew up,
what happened.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.760
Their village was occupied
by enemy soldiers, right?

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.960
They were very poor.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.170
One of them was an orphan, so
all of these factors made them

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.300
so vulnerable.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.330
And like so many other
girls, so vulnerable.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.600
Would they leave the village
to try to find work?

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.080
Would soldiers try to take
advantage of them?

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.900
What happened?

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.870
So what happened was actually
a really good thing.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.930
After several years they were
both able to get out of the

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:12.310
village and get into
boarding school.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.990
So now they're 20--

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.690
around 19, 20-- one wants to
be a teacher and the other

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:18.810
wants to be a doctor.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.060
So it's like oh yeah, that's a
great story, but there are 43

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.820
million people like them who
are displaced still.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.050
I mean those are two of 43
million who had a good story,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:36.530
and so that is why I thought
I've got to do more.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:41.140
Anyway, so I got more involved
and I was here in America,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.950
what can you do here?

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.920
I got involved with a little
group and we did raffles and

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.020
all kinds of things like.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.000
That I took ESL courses,
ESL tutoring, and I

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.470
went over and I tutored.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.780
I taught aerobics to refugee
medics over there.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.320
And in America went and told
people about Burma.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.040
I wrote about it.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.920
Those happened to be
my skill sets.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.140
You have other skill sets.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.360
So here are 12 ways to get
involved if you're interested.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.640
Share your expertise.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.860
I know a lot of people have
expertise here in technology.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.780
One of our colleagues is doing
really interesting project,

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.930
trying to get it off the ground
with using phones,

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:27.830
interactive voice recognition,
to provide health care

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.110
information to people
on the move.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.170
So that could be trafficked or
migrant people, many of them

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:39.350
are illiterate, so it's great to
get that information about

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.970
malaria and reproductive
health over the phone.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.160
But there's solar-powered
phones, there's a lot

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.410
going on with that.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.650
Something simple for you is
setting up and training using

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.180
Google Apps and other
Google tools.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.480
At our organization--

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.550
and this is both in the
States here and

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.550
with our local partners.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.110
I mean, we touch the
Google tools

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.780
and use them so clumsily.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.150
So just to have somebody kind
of hold our hand and say, OK

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.070
here are your needs, you should
really be using this

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.940
and this is how you do it.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.949
SCO optimization,
graphic design--

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:23.572
if there's a website wizard or
goddess who could help, you

00:34:23.572 --> 00:34:26.370
know we use Drupal, that
would be great.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.850
And not just with our
organization, but any

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.280
organization that does this kind
of thing, share with your

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.120
friends, learn about
trafficking

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.080
or women and girls.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.710
Whatever your passion is--

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.500
Burma, Nepal--

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.860
and share that with
your friends.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.469
Host conversations, post, blog,
talk about it, engage

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.310
your network.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.659
We have wonderful supporters
and donors

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:54.600
who do a baking book.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.650
They've done crafts things.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.160
It doesn't really matter what it
is, the idea is to engage.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.050
One of our supporters is a
Broadway producer, and she had

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.960
a Broadway bash.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.820
So it just depends on your
expertise and your contacts.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.290
Donations are always welcome,
and I know there's an employee

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.110
matching gift, so
that's helpful.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.680
Online friend-to-friend
fund raising, we're

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.840
starting to do that.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.450
And if you spend a lot of time
online with your communities

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.720
online, that might
be something to

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.940
get involved with.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.140
And then there's also travel,
to broaden your horizons and

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.030
look for volunteer
opportunities.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.240
So thank you very much,
and those are--

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: And now
questions and answers.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.470
PAULA BOCK: Yep.

00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:50.100
THERESE CAOUETTE: People also
listening in want to ask

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.876
questions, feel free.

00:35:51.876 --> 00:35:53.126
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.980
THERESE CAOUETTE: OK, just let
me repeat it for the people

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.620
are listening in.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.590
She was asking why is it that
people don't identify with the

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.780
word trafficking?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.450
Is it the experience
of trafficking

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.990
itself or just the word?

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.240
Is that pretty much--

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.400
so I would say that it's
a little bit of both.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.800
They don't have that word, of
course, in their vocabulary,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.830
so that doesn't make sense.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.460
And if you if you translate it,
it doesn't really work.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.620
But they also don't
have the concept.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.900
I mean if anybody have been
fortune of to travel in some

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.740
of these really remote areas,
the trust and the kindness,

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:56.620
the generosity is so amazing
that they just don't believe

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.770
people would take advantage
of anybody to that extent.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.240
I think they really
fundamentally

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.340
don't believe that.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.510
They wouldn't have it
in their world view.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.860
But even when they
face migration--

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.190
then I think that there's
another issue.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.910
When it does happen there's so
much shame, especially for the

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.960
girls, that when they
come back they would

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.530
never talk about it.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.020
So it perpetuates that cycle.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.320
When you talk about
vulnerabilities it's a little

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.930
bit less personal.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.310
It happens to everybody
in different contexts.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.540
So people feel a little bit more
comfortable to talk about

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.390
the vulnerabilities of other
people, maybe not of

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.950
themselves.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.040
But even in that context
I just don't feel that

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.020
trafficking, and certainly
the trafficking--

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.080
because we ourselves don't even
know what we're talking

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.600
when we use that word.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.780
They themselves also are
very confused by it.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.650
But migration is much
more concrete.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.250
People are moving, there are
risks, things happen.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.000
It's much more concrete--

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.090
obvious-- to them what
we're talking about.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.780
So it's a combination of the
two, I guess is what I'm

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.330
trying to say.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.426
Yes please.

00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:01.410
AUDIENCE: I really loved hearing
about [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.950
THERESE CAOUETTE: Yes.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.220
She's asking about--

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.750
education is great, but
then there's a void.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.320
There's a lack of jobs that
people face when they actually

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.700
do finish school, or
become literate.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.610
And I think that's very
much a reality.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:39.710
I think the whole effort to do
livelihoods and try to work

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:44.430
with women and find other
alternative to employment is

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.690
very critical.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.060
And I think that there are
opportunities, people are

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.230
working on it.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.610
The infrastructure
of the new roads.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.320
These are the positive
things of that.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.620
It's bringing more jobs.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.390
It's bringing a way to
sell their produce.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.460
It's bringing markets.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.970
You see people in remote areas
on this last trip sewing

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.530
handbags, things that they
can sell in the market.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.420
That wasn't there before.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.820
So the development of the
infrastructure isn't only bad,

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.170
it just brings new dynamics.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.900
And some of the positive parts
of it does bring new markets.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.720
So yes, that's an ongoing
challenge and there are

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.450
ongoing struggles to
try to find ways

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.700
that they can be employed.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.090
Yes, please.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.730
THERESE CAOUETTE: Tell
me the name again.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.040
Sorry.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.243
THERESE CAOUETTE: OK

00:39:41.243 --> 00:39:43.167
AUDIENCE: You made this
statement already [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:09.730
THERESE CAOUETTE: OK, the
question was, what can men do?

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.840
And if men had a different
attitude, wouldn't some of

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.330
this change?

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.220
And I would say it's yes.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.170
There's two ways.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.580
One of the ways-- in the
beginning we focused way too

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.380
much on women and girls.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.540
And I think what we're learning
too is that this is a

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.990
dynamic and something that
affects the whole community.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.080
So I say it's both ways.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.690
I think we too as organizations
have to see this

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.610
as a community issue.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.340
And I think for men, it's
important for them to speak to

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.160
women's rights.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.940
What's always the hardest
for me is the

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.680
girls that I work with--

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.020
especially the girls--

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.570
their self esteem is so low
that they actually believe

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.110
that it's their fault that
this has happened.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:53.560
So I think promoting and
speaking to women about girls

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.320
and about women in
a positive--

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.950
I think that happens in
our day-to-day life.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:01.080
One of the most disturbing
things for me is when Western

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:06.290
travelers go to Asia and they
are really awful tourists,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.500
quite frankly.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.110
It's just disrespectful.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.940
And then even for myself as a
woman, I don't stand up to it

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.380
as much as they should.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.590
Sometimes you should really
say something.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.060
And I think for men to say it
to other men or at least not

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.860
to participate.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.600
To be not other and to put
yourself in that context.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.160
I think we all have a
lot of challenges in

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.000
how we "other" people.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.800
And I would say that both in our
context and also when we

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.290
look abroad that's
a challenge.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.430
THERESE CAOUETTE: Yes.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.850
Yes.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.020
That's where I think we need
to grow as an organization.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.140
What we've been trying to do in
the last few years, but we

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.380
were very slow to approach
it that way.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.480
And if I could turn back the
time and the clock, I would

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.360
have done that much earlier.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.840
Because I think it's
fundamental to

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.120
changing these dynamics.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.030
THERESE CAOUETTE: Oh
I'm sorry, yeah.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:13.850
He said, wouldn't it be better
if got boys in the schools

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:20.100
involved in girls issues and
rights of the female child.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.050
And to be more respectful of one
another, and I agreed and

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.350
I thought we should actually
been doing that much sooner

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:26.930
than we have.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.610
Just in the last few years we
start to see these programs as

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.770
being coed for both boys and
girls, instead of pulling the

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.020
girls aside and working
on these issues

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.775
just with female children.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.540
THERESE CAOUETTE: To Burma.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.540
Yeah.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.080
Yeah one of the things that we
do, maybe might be why you

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.720
asked this question, I'm not
sure, but we do we do a lot of

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.460
very, very small grants
to community leaders--

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.170
and to repeat the
question, sorry.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:15.280
What can you do to promote
strong women

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.690
role models for girls?

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:19.890
Is that pretty accurate?

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.070
THERESE CAOUETTE: And what's
possible to do that in those

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.910
communities.

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.550
And one of the things that we've
been doing a lot of is

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.220
trying to do very, very small
grants to women in those

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.320
communities to take
a leadership role.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.950
To organize girls to get
involved, to do livelihood

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.990
projects, to take
a more prominent

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.790
role in their community.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:48.050
And that a lot of that
is just small grants.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.530
We've been actually reading a
very interesting book I would

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.390
encourage you to read called
Positive Deviance.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.580
To look at women in those
communities who are taking

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:00.360
small risks in their community
to do something different, to

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.140
make a difference, and
to build on that.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.790
Not to bring it in from the
outside, or a program in from

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:07.830
the outside, but see what
they're doing already in those

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:08.660
communities.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.880
This is a book we've been
reading in our program team

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.150
that has been very
inspirational.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.990
We just shared parts of it with
a number of our partners

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.700
in the field and translated
into several languages.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.670
It's a very thought-provoking
approach to development that

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.521
I'd encourage you to
take a look at.

00:44:26.521 --> 00:44:27.771
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:31.391 --> 00:44:32.990
THERESE CAOUETTE: Yeah, they're
saving circles that

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.390
we've done.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.170
Actually a lot of them with
people who are HIV positive

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.030
and have been ostracized
in their community.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.820
But ways to get them organized
and to work with each other.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.940
Not only but also with
some women's groups.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.350
But finding they're very small
and it's actually very

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:52.860
difficult to do, because no big
philanthropy or donor or

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.722
even international organization
wants to give out

00:44:55.722 --> 00:44:58.400
a $8,000 grant.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.960
And it's very hard
to monitor that.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.700
So to set up networks in the
communities or in the country

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.370
where that's possible.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.270
So you give a big grant and then
that network can give out

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.490
smaller grants.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.610
But you have to set up something
that's different

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.310
than the model we currently have
for development to make

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.260
those kind of small
differences work.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:19.560
Yep.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.750
THERESE CAOUETTE: So the
question is, how do we recover

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.610
or how do we know if people
been able to be tracked or

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.690
returned home after they've
been sent abroad.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.000
Or after they've gone to look
for work or possibly been

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.470
trafficked.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.230
And I would say it's incredibly
difficult.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.890
The most that we can do
is work on both sides.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:54.420
We work both on the China side
of the border and the Burma

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.730
side, the Thai side and
the Burma side.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.330
And through those networks,
we can try to track.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.660
But it's very, very difficult,
and we have families and

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.560
parents who have been waiting
for their kids for years.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.880
And I just actually last week
met someone a woman who was

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.130
waiting for her husband to
return yet, She hasn't heard

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.010
from him in three years.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.670
So she has no idea if he's gone
off on a fishing boat and

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.270
not been allowed to come back to
land, or he's been put in a

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.980
factory or he died.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.300
She may never know.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:34.000
This happens a lot, and it's
very difficult to track,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.250
unfortunately.

00:46:40.692 --> 00:46:41.942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.115
THERESE CAOUETTE: She's asking
reintegrating back home and do

00:46:52.115 --> 00:46:54.980
you see them being trafficked
again or moving again.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.380
I think is a vicious cycle.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.110
I think once they've gone
abroad, they come back.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.590
It's very difficult
to return home.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.040
There's still no jobs there.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.520
And that's why I showed
that picture of them

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.800
praying at the shrine.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.180
They think OK, I'll have a
good prayer and next time

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.560
hopefully I won't have such bad
luck, or I'll have better

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.430
luck and I'll try again.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.860
And this cycle just
goes on and on.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.950
About the thing we were talking
about at lunch just

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.860
before I came is it's also it
is very difficult for people

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.880
to get remittances to send
their money back home.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.040
And this is one of things you're
talking about with the

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.240
new cell phone banking.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.880
That's very exciting, because
possibly if they could remit

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.750
their money back home--
send it home safely.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.510
Instead, now they're carrying
it all on their body.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.860
So everybody knows they
have all the money.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.950
They're ripped off all the time,
constantly, so they end

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.720
up back home with nothing and
then it starts all over again.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.600
And sometimes I really believe
if we could get a safe way for

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.620
that money to get home, they
could actually start a small

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.710
business or they'd have some
capital to do something.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.260
But because we don't have that
set up very easily-- the

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.570
banking system's so weak,
there's no banks in these

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:04.620
rural areas, there's not a
remittance system, and so the

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.750
cycle just keeps going
on and on again.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.870
It's very hard to break it.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:11.090
Yeah.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.230
THERESE CAOUETTE: This is asking
if there's any other

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:29.810
development projects that are
also helping all of us deal

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:35.930
with this issue, like roads
or cell phones, banking.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.310
All of it has its
pros and cons.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.850
But I would say, one of things I
often tell people is even in

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.380
these villages, almost every
village I showed you, all of

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.890
those kids--

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.210
well, they all have access
to a cell phone.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.040
Somebody's got a cell phone.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.450
They don't have electricity, but
they use the solar-powered

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.450
something and they've got
access to a cell phone.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:02.420
And a lot of those communities
have Gmail accounts.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.490
Those kids give me their
Gmail accounts.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.420
Now they have no internet,
but they know

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.070
that Gmail's out there.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.790
And either somebody set them up
an account or somebody will

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.650
come through with a smartphone
and let them rent the access

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:19.870
to the smartphone for a couple
minutes or hours.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:26.680
Even up in the northern Burma
with China, kids are giving me

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.460
their Gmail accounts.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.060
So I think it's exciting and
there's opportunities.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.650
Even with our partners,
I can GTalk with them.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.360
Development's changed completely
since 30 years ago

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.120
when I went out to a remote area
and you'd send a telex

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.380
every month on how
things are going.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.140
It's exciting and there's
a lot of opportunity.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.010
At the same time, there's
also a lot of risk.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:51.720
A lot of opportunities that
these young people don't know

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.220
how to evaluate or understand
or be savvy with.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.430
They don't have the worldview
to be able to move with this

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.790
technology safely.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:02.610
So it's a mix.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:06.440
I think it's the same things
that are positive also have

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.180
their challenges.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.290
This is why Paula was mentioning
one of these things

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.040
with voice recognition.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.870
That they're thinking of trying
to do some health care

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.880
services with voice
recognition.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.303
That's so interesting.

00:50:29.303 --> 00:50:29.676
Yeah.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.770
THERESE CAOUETTE: The question
is, are we working with

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:49.850
partners to utilize Google
Apps more effectively.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.480
And the answer is, we're trying
to learn how to utilize

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:53.860
Google Apps.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.040
I think our partners
really want it.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.960
They're asking us
all the time.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.950
We come from the development
world.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.180
So a lot of this is trying to
find new partners, even in our

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.520
own organization or in the
countries also that can help

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.110
us learn and move with the
opportunities that exist.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.280
PAULA BOCK: That was a great
question about partners.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.550
And I just want to clarify, as
our name is Community Partners

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.900
International, we have
indigenous partners--

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.800
over 100 indigenous partners.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.320
They're local people, and they
work with the communities to

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.050
improve health care, to
improve education.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.100
So we call them our partners.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.190
Are some of them
on Google Apps?

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.360
I know at least one
of them is.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:57.150
And then our partners
who help us and

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.940
provide pro bono services.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.080
For example, our website was
set up by wonderful partner

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.590
who works with Tiffany Asia.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:10.210
So we need a partner to help us
do our Google Apps because

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.280
we're doing it so clumsily.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.170
Yes, we would love that--

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:18.450
PAULA BOCK: Oh you do?

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.750
PAULA BOCK: Yeah.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.380
PAULA BOCK: OK.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.530
PAULA BOCK: Oh wow.

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.720
Well that would be wonderful.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.150
Thank you.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.930
Yes.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.350
Yes.

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:37.217
Thanks.

00:52:37.217 --> 00:52:39.663
THERESE CAOUETTE: I think partly
because we don't know

00:52:39.663 --> 00:52:41.660
it so well, it's very difficult
for us to help the

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.800
people in the field think
about how to use it.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:49.390
And sometimes now with all the
people coming into Burma, for

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.420
example-- but you could
talk about other

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.740
countries as well--

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.050
it's very hard to see our
partners who've worked there

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.530
in very, very difficult

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:59.100
circumstances for so many years.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.470
They are being overwhelmed by
all these international

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:03.920
organizations who come in and
they've got the website, they

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.050
have all the resources, they
know how to use these tools.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.990
And our partners lose their
voice because they don't know

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.560
how to enter and
engage in that.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.050
And I think we really need some
people who have different

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:18.520
skill sets than we have
to work with them.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.480
Yeah.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.730
PAULA BOCK: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.020
THERESE CAOUETTE: So the
question was, do you see a

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.270
generation gap between the
younger generation and their

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:46.310
aspirations in with the parents
and the traditions.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.980
And I would say certainly yes.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.020
But I would say that most of
the parents still encourage

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:51.450
their children.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.760
They're very proud of their
children when they go abroad

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.820
and go to work.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.910
They're very honored, but they
don't consider all the changes

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.880
that are going to happen.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.050
So when they come back changed
and not respecting the

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.560
traditions, then the
conflicts arise.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.940
But they're caught, and at the
same time, if they bring home

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.120
some money and they have a new
aluminum roof and some new

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.180
things in the house,
they're very proud.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.150
So it's a conflict, I think.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.270
And maybe not all so different
than our own families.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.790
But they are very proud when
their children go abroad.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.910
That they're working in another
country, that they're

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.140
learning another language, that
they've traveled beyond.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.330
But at the same time, when
they come home there's

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:35.580
terrible clashes, actually.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.180
OK, it's time.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.160
So anyway, thank
you very much.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.130
It was great questions.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.920
It was really wonderful to
be able to come here.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.170
Thanks.
