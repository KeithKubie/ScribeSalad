00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.750
&gt;&gt; Margaret Barker:
Good morning.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.740
I have to tell you,
I'm just amazed

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.550
that my little organization in
Albuquerque, New Mexico is here

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.850
in Washington, D.C. with
these wonderful people.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.680
Let me tell you a little
bit about Reading Works

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.330
and what our program is.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
We are one of the thousands

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.710
of community-based
Adult Literacy programs

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.180
across America and Canada.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.660
We have two employees,
and we have 59 volunteers,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.920
and we serve 200 people a year.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.820
Our program, like a lot

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.310
of community-based literacy
programs for adults was --

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.710
we were focused on a
goal-oriented curriculum.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.210
Which meant if a client
comes in and says,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.650
"I need to get a driver's
license", we ask our tutors

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550
to figure out how
that could happen.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.970
And we discovered that
it wasn't working.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.370
Our population, 60 -- no,
let me get this right,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.720
86% of our students
raging from age 19 to 82,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.220
read below the age --
the fifth grade level.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.380
And the majority of those
read at third grade level.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.640
We also teach English the
second language to immigrants.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.600
Of those students,
almost all of them came

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.970
in not speaking English at
all, or speaking English

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.880
at a very limited level.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.360
So, we discovered this goal
oriented tutoring isn't going

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.330
to work for these people.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.940
So, what did we do about it?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.020
We spent about a year
and a half looking

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.920
at what worked, what
didn't work.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.060
Doing research, trying to
find books already written

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510
that we could use, and
we didn't find any.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.030
So, we created our
own curriculum,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.650
and it's called 12
Weeks to Reading.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.660
It's based on phonemic
and alphabetic awareness.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.840
It can be used for English
the Second Language learners,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.950
it can be used for
reading students.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.830
It's designed to be able to
be taught by someone who reads

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.030
at a seventh or eighth
grade level.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.800
The advantage of that is
any program can use it.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.580
Right now, we are communicating
with the Drug Court

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.580
in our community where
probationers can not only come

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.830
as students, but can come as
tutors and come as teachers.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.830
And they can use this
curriculum for peer tutoring

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.460
to teach people phonemic
and alphabetic awareness.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.690
It works in three
months, and it works .

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.390
Of our current -- first cohort
that we practiced it on,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.140
100% of the people
increased their skill levels

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.530
within that three months.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.310
It is beyond our dreams of what
it would do for our students.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.940
Right now, I'm tutoring
a man who's 62 years old,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
came in reading in the
program at second grade level.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.870
We're about a quarter of the
way through the curriculum,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.170
and for the first time
in his life he's reading.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.930
It -- I can't tell you what this
means to people, it is, well,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.490
literacy work, and
we all know this,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.760
is about the dignity
of the individual.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.200
Whatever people are doing
in Vietnam, in Afghanistan,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.560
in Alaska, it's all designed
to give people dignity,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.720
and to give them
control over their lives.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.480
So, in Reading Works
when we have for example,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.550
a 64 year old Navajo
gentleman who went to school

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.990
for six months in his life.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.950
At four months of our
program, he's writing poetry

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.260
that we're publishing
in a newspaper.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.980
These kind of results means
so much to individuals,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.890
and then it passes
down to their children.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.710
And I can't tell you how
honored we are to be here today.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.370
Thank you so much.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.750
We brought the curriculum with
us, Cindy Ketchum is here,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.430
she's our program coordinator,
one of our two employees.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.460
And if anyone wants to look at
it, we'll gladly show it to you,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.720
and show it how works,
because it is,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.610
I have to say, absolutely
brilliant.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.940
So, thank you again, and we
are so honored to be here.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.820
