00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:02.311
- [Instructor] We're told that triangle

00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:04.501
A-prime, B-prime, C-prime,

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.598
so that's this red triangle over here,

00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:09.479
is the image of triangle ABC,

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.383
so that's this blue triangle here,

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:13.837
under rotation about the origin,

00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:16.200
so we're rotating about the origin here.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.766
Determine the angle of rotation.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.130
So like always, pause this video,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.242
see if you can figure it out.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.098
So I'm just gonna think about

00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:26.536
how did each of these
points have to be rotated

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:29.175
to go from A to A-prime, or B to B-prime,

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:31.044
or from C to C-prime?

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:33.410
So let's just start with A.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.822
So this is where A starts.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:36.525
Remember we're rotating about the origin.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.045
That's why I'm drawing this
line from the origin to A.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:40.530
And where does it get rotated to?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.452
Well, it gets rotated to right over here.

00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:47.676
So the rotation is going in
the counterclockwise direction,

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:49.295
so it's going to have a positive angle.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.761
So we can rule out these
two right over here.

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:56.100
And the key question is, is
this 30 degrees or 60 degrees?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.261
And there's a bunch of ways
that you could think about it.

00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.316
One, 60 degrees would
be 2/3 of a right angle,

00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:03.828
while 30 degrees would
be 1/3 of a right angle.

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:06.337
A right angle would look
something like this.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:09.039
So this looks much more
like 2/3 of a right angle,

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.924
so I'll go with 60 degrees.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.483
Another way to think
about is that 60 degrees

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:16.380
is 1/3 of 180 degrees,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.401
which this also looks
like right over here.

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.942
And if you do that with any of the points,

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:22.627
you would see a similar thing.

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:25.332
So just looking at A to
A-prime makes me feel good

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:28.338
that this was a 60-degree rotation.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.421
Let's do another example.

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.590
So we are told quadrilateral

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.506
A-prime, B-prime, C-prime,
D-prime, in red here,

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.394
is the image of quadrilateral
ABCD, in blue here,

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.438
under rotation about point Q.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.457
Determine the angle of rotation.

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:48.530
So once again, pause this video,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.341
and see if you can figure it out.

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:51.848
Well, I'm gonna tackle this the same way.

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:53.356
I don't have a coordinate plane here,

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:54.215
but it's the same notion.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.110
I can take some initial point
and then look at its image

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.446
and think about, well, how
much did I have to rotate it?

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:01.896
I could do B to B-prime,

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:03.534
although this might be
a little bit too close.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:06.360
So I'm going from B to,
let me do a new color here,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.322
just 'cause this color is
too close to, I'll use black,

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:14.104
so we're going from B to
B-prime right over here.

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:16.587
We are going clockwise,

00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:18.426
so it's going to be a negative rotation.

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:20.618
So we can rule that and that out.

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:23.222
And it looks like a right angle.

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:25.201
This looks like a right angle,

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:27.978
so I feel good about
picking negative 90 degrees.

00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:30.122
We could try another
point and feel good that

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:32.728
that also meets that negative 90 degrees.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:34.421
Let's say D to D-prime.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.187
So this is where D is initially.

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:38.894
This is where D is,

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:41.782
and this is where D-prime is.

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:44.726
And once again, we are moving clockwise,

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:46.893
so it's a negative rotation.

00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:48.956
And this looks like a right angle,

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:51.764
definitely more like a right
angle than a 60-degree angle.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.232
And so this would be negative 90 degrees,

00:02:54.232 --> 00:02:56.468
definitely feel good about that.
